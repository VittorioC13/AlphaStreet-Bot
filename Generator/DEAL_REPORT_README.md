This module allows you to create professional PDF reports for specific M&A deals using the same formatting and structure as the daily briefs generated by TMT BOT.

## Features

- **Professional Formatting**: Uses the same PDF formatting as daily briefs

- **Flexible Input**: Can handle any deal type across different sectors
- **Mock Analysis**: Works without OpenAI API key using pre-built analysis templates

## Files

- `custom_deal_report.py` - Original ExxonMobil & Pioneer specific report generator
- `general_deal_reporter.py` - General purpose deal report generator
- `create_deal_report.py` - Interactive script for easy report creation

## Usage

### Option 1: Interactive Script (Recommended)

```bash
cd Generator
python create_deal_report.py

This will present you with options to:
1. Generate the ExxonMobil & Pioneer Natural Resources report
2. Create a custom deal report with your own deal information
3. Exit

### Option 2: Direct Script Execution

```bash
# Generate ExxonMobil & Pioneer report
python custom_deal_report.py

# Generate using general reporter
python general_deal_reporter.py
```

### Option 3: Programmatic Usage

```python
from general_deal_reporter import GeneralDealReporter

# Define deal information
deal_info = {
    "buyer": "Company A",
    "target": "Company B", 
    "deal_value": "$10 billion",
    "share_price": "$100 per share",
    "exchange_ratio": "1.5 shares for each target share",
    "enterprise_value": "$12 billion",
    "announcement_date": "October 24, 2025",
    "transaction_type": "Stock merger",
    "source_url": "https://example.com/press-release"
}

# Generate report
reporter = GeneralDealReporter()
pdf_path = reporter.generate_deal_report(deal_info, sector="TMT", region="US")
print(f"Report saved to: {pdf_path}")
```

- Risk analysis

### 2. Strategic Rationale & Market Positioning

## Output

Reports are saved as PDF files in the `api/static/assets/briefs/` directory with the naming convention:
`{region}_{sector}_Brief_{date}.pdf`

Example: `US_Energy_Brief_2025-10-24.pdf`

## Configuration

### OpenAI API Key (Optional)
If you have an OpenAI API key, set it as an environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API="your-api-key-here"
```

Without an API key, the system will use mock analysis data that still provides comprehensive deal analysis.

### Sectors Supported
- Energy
- TMT (Technology, Media, Telecom)
- Healthcare
- Industrial
- Consumer

### Regions Supported
- US
- Europe
- APAC

## Example: ExxonMobil & Pioneer Natural Resources Merger

The system includes a pre-built example for the ExxonMobil & Pioneer Natural Resources merger:

- **Deal Value**: $59.5 billion
- **Enterprise Value**: $64.5 billion
- **Transaction Type**: All-stock merger
- **Announcement Date**: October 11, 2023
- **Source**: [ExxonMobil Press Release](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/1011_exxonmobil-announces-merger-with-pioneer-natural-resources-in-an-all-stock-transaction)

This creates a comprehensive investment banking analysis covering all aspects of the merger from strategic rationale to regulatory considerations.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Unicode Encoding Errors**: The system automatically handles Unicode characters in the PDF generation
2. **Missing API Key**: The system will use mock analysis if no OpenAI API key is provided
3. **File Permissions**: Ensure the `api/static/assets/briefs/` directory is writable

### Dependencies

Required Python packages:
- fpdf2
- openai (optional)
- pathlib
- datetime
- re

All dependencies are included in the main TMT BOT requirements.txt file.
