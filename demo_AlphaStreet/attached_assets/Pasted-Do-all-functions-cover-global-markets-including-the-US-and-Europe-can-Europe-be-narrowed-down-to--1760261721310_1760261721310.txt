Do all functions cover global markets, including the US and Europe — can Europe be narrowed down to London or Paris?
Yep. Our pipeline already covers the US and Europe. You can just click the territory cards in your dashboard to get market briefs and news from different regions. For Europe specifically, we actually let you drill down — like London or Paris — so your prep can be laser-focused on the markets you care about.

For the Energy sector, will it also cover upstream industries?
Definitely. When we say “Energy,” we’re not just talking about oil and gas headlines. We include upstream stuff like lithium, rare earths, and traditional materials — basically the full value chain. It’s the kind of coverage that’s actually useful if you’re prepping for energy banking or sector-specific conversations.

If I have zero foundation and only use TMT Bot for market sense, will it be detailed enough for interviews (not vague like DeepSeek or ChatGPT)?
Honestly? Yes — that’s exactly why we built it. TMT Bot’s job is to save you from hours of Googling random news. Real story: a sophomore at Colby College had zero background in healthcare banking. She went through a couple of our Healthcare briefs and ended up having a super solid networking call with a banker. The idea is to give you real talking points, not fluffy AI summaries.

Can it help me practice technical interview questions?
This is where I’ll be Brutally Honest with you — no. TMT Bot doesn’t do technicals. We focus 100% on behavioral prep, market sense, and networking. That’s the part most other tutors/tools are afraid to do because it’s hard to productize. But that’s also the part that actually makes people stand out in interviews.

Q5: I’m currently revising my CV. I realized my past deal experiences were just “dirty work” without understanding the logic. Can AI fill the gaps?
A5: Yes — and this is one of the features people love the most. We help you connect the dots behind what you actually did. Like:
Why a PE fund might pick a 10x multiple.


Why does a term sheet have exclusivity clauses?


What growth equity investors really care about (like revenue growth, scalability, unit economics).
 Basically, we help you turn “I just did grunt work” into “I actually understand the strategy.” That hits way harder in interviews.



Q6: How many Product/Coverage groups are in TMT Bot?
A6: Right now we cover five: TMT, Energy, Healthcare, Consumer, and Industrial. That lineup mirrors how banks actually structure coverage groups — so your prep isn’t just generic finance, it’s sector-specific.

Q7: During fit interviews, I need to understand the differences between banks in the same tier. Can AI provide comparisons (e.g., Evercore vs. Lazard, or Goldman Sachs / Morgan Stanley / JPMorgan Chase & Co.)?
A7: Yes — that’s what the Banking Map feature is for. For example:
Evercore vs. Lazard: Evercore’s known for being more execution-heavy in the US, Lazard leans on its restructuring and advisory legacy in Europe.


GS vs. MS vs. JPM: Goldman Sachs is all about aggressive deal flow and culture. Morgan Stanley shines in ECM and TMT. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has the balance sheet and reach that nobody else matches.


It’s not perfect yet — we’re still building it out — but the beta already gives you a clear picture of what makes each bank different. Full launch is planned for November 2025.
