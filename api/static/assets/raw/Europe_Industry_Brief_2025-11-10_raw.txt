Competitors like Nvidia (NVDA) are better positioned due to strong cash flows, which could lead to increased market share for Nvidia if CoreWeave falters.
- **Competitor Moves**: As CoreWeave struggles with $11 billion in debt and significant liabilities, competitors may capitalize on its vulnerabilities by offering better terms to clients or acquiring its assets at discounted prices.

@@@ Customer Impact:
- **Product/Service Implications**: The unpaid status of local workers could lead to service disruptions at military bases, affecting logistics and maintenance operations. This situation may compel the U.S. government to seek alternative service providers, impacting existing contracts.
