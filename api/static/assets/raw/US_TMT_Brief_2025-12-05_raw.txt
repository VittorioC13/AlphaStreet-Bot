- **Shareholders:** The investments in telecommunications infrastructure can lead to substantial value creation for shareholders.
  - **Value Creation:** For instance, Ooredoo's planned $500 million investment in new terrestrial fiber optic cables could enhance its service offerings, potentially increasing revenue by 10% over the next five years. If Ooredoo's current market cap is estimated at $10 billion, this could translate to a $1 billion increase in shareholder value.
  - **Dilution:** If Ooredoo finances this expansion through equity, existing shareholders may face dilution. A 5% issuance of new shares could lead to a 2% drop in share price, reflecting investor concerns about dilution.

- **Employees:** The expansion of telecommunications infrastructure directly impacts employees through synergies and restructuring.
  - **Synergies:** The merger of Qatar National Broadband Network (QNBN) and Gulf Bridge International (GBI) is expected to create operational efficiencies, with estimates suggesting annual cost savings of around $50 million. This could lead to job security for employees as the merged entity seeks to grow.
  - **Restructuring:** However, such mergers often lead to workforce reductions. In the case of QNBN and GBI, approximately 500 positions may be eliminated as overlapping roles are streamlined.
  - **Retention:** To retain key talent during transitions, companies may offer retention bonuses. This strategy was effectively employed in the merger of Disney and 21st Century Fox, where critical employees were incentivized to stay.

- **Competitors:** The competitive landscape is reshaped by significant investments in infrastructure.
  - **Market Positioning:** As Ooredoo and Saudi Arabia enhance their telecommunications capabilities, competitors like Etisalat (ETISALAT) and STC (Saudi Telecom Company) may need to respond with their own infrastructure investments or strategic partnerships to maintain market share.
  - **Specific Competitor Moves:** For example, Etisalat has recently announced a $1 billion investment in 5G technology to counter the advancements made by Ooredoo and STC.

- **Customers:** The implications for customers are profound, particularly regarding service availability and quality.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** The deployment of 4,000 telecom towers in Nigeria aims to enhance connectivity in underserved areas, which could lead to a 30% increase in broadband access for rural customers. This initiative is expected to improve economic activity and security in these communities.
