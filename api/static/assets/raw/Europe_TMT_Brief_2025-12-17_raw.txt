- **Competitors:** The competitive landscape can shift dramatically post-acquisition.
  - **Market Positioning:** Following a merger, competitors may need to adapt their strategies to maintain market share. For instance, if Amazon (AMZN) were to acquire a significant player in the streaming space, competitors like Netflix (NFLX) may need to enhance their content offerings or reduce subscription prices to retain customers.
  - **Specific Competitor Moves:** In response to increased competition, companies like Orange (ORA.PA) may invest in new technologies or partnerships to strengthen their market position.

- **Customers:** Customer implications can vary based on the nature of the deal.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** A merger between two telecommunications companies could allow for bundled services, enhancing customer value. This strategy may lead to a 20% increase in bundled service subscriptions.
