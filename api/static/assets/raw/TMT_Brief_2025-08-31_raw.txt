- **Analyst Commentary:** A recent analyst note stated, "While the rights offering is a necessary step for APWC's growth, the potential for dilution poses risks that investors should consider."

#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

- **Scenario Analysis:** The market's reaction can be assessed through various scenarios:
  - **Positive Scenario:** If the offering is fully subscribed and leads to successful facility expansion, shares could rise by 10% within six months.
