#### Deal-Specific Impacts on Stakeholders

- **Shareholders:** The proposed merger aimed to create the UK's largest infrastructure investment firm but faced significant pushback from shareholders.
  - **Value Creation:** HICL's board estimated that the merger could have enhanced shareholder value through increased asset diversification and operational efficiencies. However, the lack of substantial support from HICL investors led to the deal's collapse, indicating that shareholder sentiment can significantly influence M&A outcomes.
  - **Dilution:** The merger proposed a partial cash exit option for TRIG shareholders, which would have resulted in HICL shareholders holding 56% of the combined entity. The failure to secure adequate backing from HICL investors suggests potential dilution concerns that were not adequately addressed.

- **Employees:** The impact on employees in such scenarios can be profound, particularly regarding job security and organizational culture.
  - **Synergies:** The merger was expected to generate operational synergies, enhancing efficiency across both firms. However, the abandonment of the deal raises concerns about job stability for employees at both HICL and TRIG.
  - **Retention:** With the merger off the table, both companies must now focus on retaining key talent amidst uncertainty. Companies often implement retention bonuses to mitigate turnover during such transitions.

- **Competitors:** The competitive landscape is affected by M&A activity, as firms adjust their strategies in response to market changes.
  - **Market Positioning:** Competitors in the infrastructure sector, such as Greencoat Capital and others, may seize the opportunity to strengthen their positions now that the merger has failed. This could lead to increased competition for assets and investment opportunities.
  - **Specific Competitor Moves:** Following the merger's collapse, competitors may accelerate their own M&A strategies to capture market share that would have been consolidated under HICL and TRIG.

- **Customers:** Customer implications can vary significantly based on the nature of the deal.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** The merger was anticipated to enhance service offerings through a more extensive portfolio of renewable assets. With the deal off, customers may face uncertainty regarding the future direction of both firms' service capabilities.
