### 4. STAKEHOLDER IMPACT & FORWARD-LOOKING ANALYSIS

The recent M&A activities in the Healthcare sector, including the acquisition of 89bio by Roche and the sale of BioCryst's European ORLADEYO business, have significant implications for various stakeholders. This analysis explores the impacts on shareholders, employees, competitors, and customers, while also assessing market reactions and potential future developments.

#### Deal-Specific Impacts on Stakeholders

- **Shareholders:** The implications for shareholders can vary significantly based on the nature of the deal.
  - **Value Creation:** Roche's tender offer for 89bio at $14.50 per share, plus a contingent value right (CVR) of up to $6.00, represents a premium for 89bio shareholders. Assuming 89bio has 20 million shares outstanding, the total upfront payment would be approximately $290 million. This could enhance Roche's market cap by improving its oncology portfolio, potentially increasing shareholder value by an estimated 10% if the acquisition leads to successful integration and product development.
  - **Dilution:** Conversely, if Roche finances this acquisition through equity, existing shareholders may face dilution. If Roche issues 5% of its shares to fund the deal, this could lead to a 2% decrease in share price post-announcement.

- **Employees:** The impact on employees often revolves around synergies, restructuring, and retention.
  - **Synergies:** BioCryst's sale of its European ORLADEYO business is expected to improve its operating margin significantly, allowing it to focus on its core U.S. operations. This strategic shift may result in enhanced job security for U.S.-based employees as resources are reallocated.
  - **Restructuring:** However, divesting the European business could lead to job losses in that region. BioCryst's decision to retain the European commercial organization under Neopharmed Gentili may mitigate some of these impacts, ensuring continuity for employees involved in the ORLADEYO brand.
  - **Retention:** Companies often implement retention strategies during transitions. Roche may offer retention bonuses to key 89bio executives to maintain leadership continuity post-acquisition.

- **Competitors:** The competitive landscape is likely to shift significantly following these transactions.
  - **Market Positioning:** Roche's acquisition of 89bio strengthens its position in the oncology market, potentially prompting competitors like Novartis (NVS) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to reassess their strategies. For instance, Novartis may accelerate its own acquisition strategy to bolster its oncology pipeline.
  - **Specific Competitor Moves:** Following BioCryst's divestiture, competitors may seek to capitalize on the void left in the European market for ORLADEYO, potentially leading to increased competition in that segment.

- **Customers:** The implications for customers can be profound, affecting product availability and service quality.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** Roche's acquisition of 89bio could lead to enhanced product offerings in the oncology space, improving access to innovative therapies for patients. This aligns with Roche's commitment to expanding its oncology portfolio.
  - **Case Studies:** BioCryst's strategic focus on the U.S. market post-divestiture is expected to streamline operations and improve service delivery, benefiting customers through enhanced product availability.

#### Market Reaction and Analyst Commentary

- **Market Reaction:** The market's response to M&A announcements can be mixed. Following Roche's tender offer for 89bio, shares of Roche initially dipped by 3% due to concerns over the acquisition's cost but later rebounded as analysts recognized the long-term strategic benefits.
- **Analyst Commentary:** Analysts have noted the strategic importance of these transactions. A quote from a Jefferies analyst stated, "Roche's acquisition of 89bio positions it well in the competitive oncology landscape, despite initial market skepticism regarding the premium paid."

#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

- **Scenario Analysis:** The market's reaction can be assessed through various scenarios:
  - **Positive Scenario:** If Roche successfully integrates 89bio and enhances its oncology pipeline, shares could rise by 12% within six months.
  - **Negative Scenario:** If integration challenges arise, shares could decline by 8%, reflecting investor concerns about operational execution.

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers

- **Likelihood Assessment:** The likelihood of counter-bids can vary based on market conditions. In the case of Roche's acquisition of 89bio, there were rumors of interest from other pharmaceutical companies, but the likelihood of a successful counter-bid is moderate due to the strategic fit Roche has with 89bio's assets.
