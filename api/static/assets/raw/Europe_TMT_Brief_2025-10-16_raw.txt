#### Deal-Specific Impacts on Stakeholders

- **Shareholders:** The proposed acquisition has significant implications for shareholders of the involved companies.
  - **Value Creation:** If the acquisition is successful, it could enhance market share and operational efficiencies. For instance, if the combined entity achieves a 10% increase in market share, this could translate to an estimated revenue increase of €1 billion, assuming a pre-deal revenue of €10 billion for the combined companies.
  - **Dilution:** However, if the deal is financed through equity, existing shareholders may face dilution. For example, if the acquiring companies issue 15% new shares to finance the deal, existing shareholders could see their ownership stakes decrease, potentially leading to a 7% drop in share price post-announcement.

- **Employees:** The impact on employees is critical, particularly regarding synergies and restructuring.
  - **Synergies:** The merger could lead to operational synergies, with estimates suggesting potential annual savings of €300 million through streamlined operations and shared resources.

- **Customers:** The implications for customers are also significant.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** The acquisition could lead to enhanced service offerings, such as bundled telecommunications and media services. For example, the merger of AT&T and Time Warner allowed for comprehensive service packages that increased customer satisfaction by 15%.
  - **Case Studies:** Similar to the integration of Vodafone’s services with Liberty Global, customers could benefit from improved service quality and innovative offerings.

#### Market Reaction and Analyst Commentary

- **Market Reaction:** The market's initial response to the acquisition announcement may be mixed.

A notable quote from a leading telecom analyst stated, "This acquisition positions Orange and its partners to significantly enhance their competitive edge in the French market, although integration risks remain a concern."

#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers

- **Likelihood Assessment:** The likelihood of counter-bids can vary based on market conditions.
  - Given the strategic importance of Altice's assets, competitors may consider counter-offers. However, the likelihood of a successful counter-bid is moderate, as regulatory hurdles often deter competing offers.
