  - **Positive Scenario:** If the fundraising leads to successful expansions and innovation, share prices could rise by 15% over the next year.
  - **Negative Scenario:** Conversely, if companies face integration challenges or market volatility, share prices could decline by 10%.

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers

- **Likelihood Assessment:** The likelihood of counter-bids in this fundraising environment is moderate.
