#### Deal-Specific Stakeholder Impacts

@@@ Shareholder Impact:
- **Value Creation Potential**: Recent shifts in quick commerce, with platforms like Swiggy's Instamart and Zepto expanding into higher-margin categories such as electronics and fashion, could lead to an estimated 15% increase in shareholder value over the next 12 months. This is based on the observed growth of gross sales from these categories, which have risen from under 10% to 20-25%.

- **Retention Strategies**: With improved job security and social protections under the new Labour Codes, employee retention rates are projected to rise to 85%, as companies can offer better benefits and job stability.

@@@ Competitor Impact:
- **Market Positioning**: The entry of quick commerce platforms into higher-margin categories is likely to provoke competitive responses from established e-commerce players like Amazon (AMZN) and Flipkart. These competitors may need to innovate or diversify their offerings to maintain market share.
- **Brand Competition**: As quick commerce expands, traditional retailers may enhance their online presence and product variety to counteract the competitive threat, leading to a more dynamic market landscape.
