@@@ Competitor Impact:
- **Market Positioning**: Major acquisitions often prompt competitors to react swiftly. For example, if Nike (NKE) acquires a tech-driven apparel startup, competitors like Adidas (ADS.DE) may respond by enhancing their own product offerings or launching aggressive marketing campaigns within 6 months to maintain market share.
- **Brand Competition**: The competitive landscape intensifies as firms invest in direct-to-consumer channels. For instance, if Nike strengthens its digital presence, Adidas may accelerate its e-commerce initiatives to counterbalance.

@@@ Customer Impact:
- **Product Innovation**: Customers typically benefit from enhanced product offerings following M&A. For example, if a company acquires a sustainable fashion brand, it may introduce eco-friendly product lines that appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.
