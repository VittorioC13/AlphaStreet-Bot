- **Customers:** The implications for customers are multifaceted.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** Spark's focus on core connectivity services may lead to improved offerings in mobile and broadband. The recent price increases for consumer plans indicate a strategy to enhance revenue, which could be perceived positively by shareholders but may lead to customer dissatisfaction.
  - **Case Studies:** The sale of the data center business, despite its growth, suggests a strategic pivot that may impact customers reliant on those services. However, the new investments in core areas could enhance service quality in the long run.

#### Market Reaction and Analyst Commentary

- **Market Reaction:** The market's response to Spark's restructuring has been mixed.
  - Following the announcement of layoffs and the new five-year strategy, Spark's shares closed up 3.2% to $2.56, indicating some investor optimism about the potential for future growth.
- **Analyst Commentary:** Analysts have expressed cautious optimism. For instance, Craigs Investment Partners maintained an "overweight" rating, noting that while the results were in line with expectations, the company is still navigating a challenging environment.

#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

- **Scenario Analysis:** The market's future reaction could unfold in several ways:
  - **Positive Scenario:** If Spark successfully implements its new strategy and achieves projected cost savings, shares could rise by 10% within the next year as investor confidence grows.
  - **Negative Scenario:** Should further layoffs or operational challenges arise, shares could decline by 5%, reflecting investor concerns about execution risks.

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers
