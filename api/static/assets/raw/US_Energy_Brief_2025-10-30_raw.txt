The ongoing shift towards renewable energy, particularly in regions like Nepal, presents a multifaceted impact on various stakeholders. This analysis examines the implications of increased investment in renewable energy sources, focusing on shareholders, employees, competitors, and customers.

#### Deal-Specific Impacts on Stakeholders

- **Shareholders:** The call for international investment in Nepal’s renewable energy sector could lead to significant value creation for shareholders of companies involved in these projects.
  - **Value Creation:** If a company like Engie (ENGI.PA) invests in Nepal’s hydropower potential, estimated at 83,000 MW, it could enhance its portfolio and potentially increase revenue by 15% over five years, translating to an additional €1.5 billion in annual revenue based on current figures.
  - **Dilution:** However, if Engie finances this expansion through equity, existing shareholders may face dilution. For instance, issuing new shares to raise €500 million could lead to a 3% decrease in share price, impacting shareholder sentiment.

- **Employees:** The transition to renewable energy will have profound implications for employment within the sector.
  - **Synergies:** Investments in renewable projects can create synergies through shared technologies and resources. For example, Engie’s investment in solar and hydropower could lead to operational efficiencies, potentially saving €200 million annually.
  - **Restructuring:** As companies pivot towards renewables, restructuring may occur. Engie could see a shift in workforce needs, with potential layoffs in fossil fuel divisions but new hiring in renewable sectors, leading to a net gain of 1,000 jobs.
  - **Retention:** To retain key talent during this transition, companies may offer incentives. Engie might implement retention bonuses for employees in critical roles, ensuring continuity during the shift.

- **Competitors:** The competitive landscape will be influenced by these investments.
  - **Market Positioning:** Companies like Repsol (REP.MC) may need to adapt their strategies to maintain competitiveness. Following Engie’s lead, Repsol could invest in its renewable initiatives, potentially allocating €1 billion to enhance its market position.
  - **Specific Competitor Moves:** If Engie successfully establishes a foothold in Nepal, competitors may respond by accelerating their own renewable projects, as seen when BP announced a $1 billion investment in solar energy in response to market shifts.

- **Customers:** The implications for customers are significant as well.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** Increased investment in Nepal’s renewable energy could lead to lower energy costs for consumers. For instance, if hydropower production increases, electricity prices could drop by 10%, benefiting consumers.
  - **Case Studies:** The successful implementation of Nepal’s renewable energy projects could serve as a model for other nations, demonstrating the viability of large-scale renewable investments.
