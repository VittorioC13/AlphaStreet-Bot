[TITLE]ORIC® Pharmaceuticals Presents Potential Best-in-Class Profile for Enozertinib with Robust Systemic and CNS Activity in 1L and 2L NSCLC Patients with EGFR Exon 20 Mutations at the ESMO Asia Congress 2:
[TEXT]
Highly differentiated 1L preliminary systemic activity of 67% ORR and 100% intracranial ORR (by BICR-RANO), including in patients with active brain metastases

45% ORR in 2L patients exceeds competitor benchmarks

Competitive safety profile, with no significant off-target toxicity and manageable on-target toxicity, resulting in low discontinuation rate

Enrollment and follow-up continue in 1L patients at selected dose of 80 mg once daily,

with next update expected mid-2026 ahead of initiation of potential Phase 3 trial

Company to host a conference call and webcast on Saturday, December 6, 2025, at 8:00 pm ET

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and SAN DIEGO, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ORIC), a clinical stage oncology company focused on developing treatments that address mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, announced data from a Phase 1b trial of enozertinib (ORIC-114) at the ESMO Asia Congress 2025. Data in treatment-naïve and in previously treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations were presented at an oral session, and the presentation can be found in the publication section of ORIC’s website here.

“Enozertinib was purposefully designed to be highly brain-penetrant and exquisitely selective in order to address the limitations of available therapies and potentially drive differentiated durability. These data provide clinical support for this design approach, demonstrating strong systemic and CNS activity in NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations,” said Pratik S. Multani, M.D., chief medical officer. “The profile we have seen with enozertinib compares favorably to other approved and investigational therapies and continues to support enozertinib’s best-in-class potential.”

Enozertinib Phase 1b Trial Design

Enozertinib is being evaluated in a Phase 1b trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 mutations. Notably, enrollment allows patients with active untreated brain metastases. Prior therapy in 2L patients consisted of platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the trial is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), CNS response rate by blinded independent central review (BICR) using response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria in treatment-naïve patients, disease control rate (DCR), and safety.

2L NSCLC Patients with EGFR Exon 20 Mutations

As of the August 29, 2025 cutoff date, 45 2L patients were dosed — 24 patients received 80 mg QD oral enozertinib and 21 patients received 120 mg QD. Brain metastases were present in 38% of patients at baseline, including those with active brain metastases.

Preliminary Safety Analysis

Enozertinib was well tolerated with mostly Grade 1 or 2 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and no significant off-target toxicities. Most frequent TRAEs included diarrhea, paronychia, and stomatitis. Only 3 patients discontinued treatment due to TRAEs and higher rates of dose reductions occurred in the 120 mg cohort compared to the 80 mg cohort.

Preliminary Activity Analysis

In the 20 efficacy evaluable patients in the 80 mg cohort, enozertinib demonstrated strong systemic and CNS antitumor activity.

45% confirmed ORR and 100% DCR, with comparable rates in patients with brain metastases at baseline

As of the data cutoff (at a median follow-up of over 30 weeks), 67% of responders remained on treatment

1L NSCLC Patients with EGFR Exon 20 Mutations

As of the August 29, 2025 cutoff date, 33 1L patients were dosed — an initial cohort of 15 patients received 120 mg QD oral enozertinib and a subsequent cohort of 18 patients received 80 mg QD. Brain metastases were present in 39% of patients at baseline, including those with active brain metastases.

Preliminary Safety Analysis

Enozertinib was well tolerated with mostly Grade 1 or 2 TRAEs and no significant off-target toxicities. Most frequent TRAEs included diarrhea, paronychia, and stomatitis. Only 2 patients discontinued treatment due to TRAEs.

The initial cohort of efficacy-evaluable patients was treated at 120 mg QD and 80% of these patients underwent early dose reductions due to TRAEs, such that most of these patients received an effective dose of 80 mg QD. The subsequent cohort of patients was treated at 80 mg QD, for which follow-up is still in progress.

Preliminary Activity Analysis

In the 15 efficacy-evaluable patients in the 120 mg cohort, the majority of which received an effective dose of 80 mg QD, enozertinib demonstrated strong systemic and CNS antitumor activity.

67% best ORR (60% confirmed ORR) and 93% DCR

100% confirmed intracranial ORR (by BICR-RANO) in patients with measurable CNS disease

In 4 patients with non-measurable CNS disease, 2 achieved confirmed intracranial complete responses, both with active untreated brain metastases

As of the data cutoff (at a median follow-up of 33 weeks), 80% of responders remained on treatment

Next Steps

Based on these data, 80 mg QD oral enozertinib has been selected as the dose for potential Phase 3 development. Enrollment and follow-up continues in 1L EGFR exon 20 patients with the next update expected in mid-2026, ahead of initiation of a potential Phase 3 trial.

[TITLE]Herbal Supplements Market Trends, Business Opportunities and Growth Outlook 2025-2030 Featuring Glanbia, Archer Daniels Midland, Nutramarks and Other Key Players:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Herbal Supplements Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Herbal Supplements Market, valued at USD 88.96 Million in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9.31% to reach USD 151.77 Million by 2030. Market growth is primarily driven by rising global consumer interest in natural and preventive health solutions and increasing awareness of the effectiveness of botanicals in addressing diverse wellness needs.

Higher disposable incomes in emerging economies are also expanding access to these products. However, the market faces a significant challenge due to regulatory inconsistencies and the absence of harmonized standards across countries, creating variations in product quality and complicated compliance requirements.

Key Market Drivers

The herbal supplements market is strongly driven by rising health consciousness and the increasing adoption of preventive healthcare practices. Consumers are proactively seeking natural solutions to support long-term wellness, with many opting for herbal products perceived as safe and holistic. The Council for Responsible Nutrition's 2024 Consumer Survey reported that 42 percent of supplement users cited overall health and wellness as their primary motivation.

A growing preference for plant-based and naturally derived ingredients further accelerates market expansion. The trend is evident in the performance of specific herbal ingredients; the American Botanical Council's 2023 Herb Market Report noted a 108 percent increase in beet root supplement sales in the U.S. mainstream channel. Additionally, the overall market strength is supported by significant retail activity, with U.S. herbal dietary supplement sales reaching an estimated USD 12.551 billion in 2023, underscoring sustained demand and growing consumer trust in botanical products.

Key Market Challenges

A major challenge hindering market growth is the lack of harmonized global regulatory standards for herbal supplements. Divergent regulations across countries lead to inconsistencies in product quality and complex compliance requirements related to ingredient approval, dosage limits, and labeling. Manufacturers must navigate multiple regulatory frameworks, increasing operational burdens and limiting scalability. This regulatory fragmentation also restricts international trade, slowing market expansion and discouraging innovation.

According to the European Federation of Associations of Health Product Manufacturers (EHPM), the European food supplement sector was valued at EUR 18 billion in 2023, yet fragmented regulatory implementation in the region continues to impede innovation and make long-term investment planning difficult, illustrating how inconsistent standards directly constrain market development.

Key Market Trends

Personalized Herbal Formulations are emerging as a key trend, driven by consumer preference for individualized health solutions tailored to specific needs, genetics, and lifestyle factors. This approach enhances perceived effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

In the Council for Responsible Nutrition's 2024 Consumer Survey, 69 percent of supplement users emphasized the importance of personalized regimens. Companies are responding by offering customized herbal blends developed through advanced diagnostic tools and data-driven insights. ZOOMSHEAL Health highlighted this trend in July 2025, demonstrating industry momentum toward bespoke formulation and R&D support for global brands.

[TITLE]Peer Reviewed Study Highlights Therapeutic Potential Around Application of Stromal Cell Therapies Such as INmune Bio’s CORDStrom™ Platform:
[TEXT]
Boca Raton, FL, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- INmune Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ: INMB) (“INmune” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage inflammation and immunology company, announces a recently published overview of future applications and research areas for mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapies, such as INmune’s CORDStrom™ platform. The article, titled, “Fate and Function of Exogenously Administered MSCs: Current Insights and Future Directions,” was published in the peer-reviewed journal Cytotherapy. One of the lead authors of the paper was INmune Bio’s lead scientist for CORDStrom™ R&D, Dr Nikita M. Patel, M.Sci.,Ph.D.

The article, was the result of an invitation-only working party of basic, clinical and translational scientists working on MSCs and available on Cytotherapy’s website, reviews the current knowledge-base and critical gaps in order to formulate experimental questions designed to enhance development of MSC therapies such as the CORDStrom™ platform. These topics included systemic delivery of MSCs, local and/or depot-delivery (which is the method for the Company’s CORDStrom™ platform), and in vivo persistence.

“While CORDStrom™ is initially being developed for use in RDEB, in which we expect to file a BLA and MAA in 2026, publications such as this one provide important scientific background for future development of the CORDStrom™ platform. Stromal cell therapies are an important clinical advancement that may have significant impact in multiple indications including inflammation, immunomodulation, and wound healing,” said Dr. Mark Lowdell, INmune Bio CSO. “Nikita’s role within INmuneBio supports continued advancement in the knowledge base on MSCs. We believe her contributions as one of the senior authors to this article, and the insightful questions asked by the panel, will have an important impact on the development of the use of MSCs in general in addition to the ongoing development of our CORDStrom™ platform.”
