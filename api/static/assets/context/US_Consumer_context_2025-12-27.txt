[TITLE]Pet care is set to become India’s next FMCG battleground in 2026:
[TEXT]
Drools has been the closest competitor to Mars in recent years, but the influx of new FMCG players is expected to reshape pricing dynamics. Industry experts, however, believe the impact will be measured. “Reliance will be an important player, but I don’t see it dominating any time soon,” commented Santosh Sreedhar, partner at Avalon Consulting. He noted that Reliance’s scale would come through its retail chain, not the broader distribution network built over years by Mars or Drools. Sreedhar expects Waggies and HappyFur to cater to the mid-lower price band, while significant acceleration might occur in the mid-premium segment, balancing affordability and quality for large-scale adoption.

Luxury cars have missed out on India’s passenger vehicle boom in 2025, with sales growth slowing to its weakest pace since the pandemic amid geopolitical uncertainties, volatile stock markets and cost pressures from a weakening rupee.Industry estimates suggest sales of luxury vehicles — priced above ₹50 lakh — will rise just 1.6% year-on-year to around 52,000 units this calendar year, even as overall passenger vehicle retail sales are expected to grow 10.5% to a record 4.6 million, beating start-of-the-year forecasts.Choppy stock markets and mounting geopolitical tensions weighed on demand among the country’s rich and aspirational buyers, while persistent currency depreciation put pressure on costs and pricing, dragging down growth in the luxury segment, said Balbir Singh Dhillon, head of Audi India . “Additionally, the market saw a natural moderation following the strong post-pandemic rebound,” he added.However, Dhillon, along with the heads of rivals Mercedes Benz and BMW India, expect the market to return to a sustainable growth trajectory in 2026, helped by the full-year impact of GST reforms, policy stability and greater macroeconomic clarity.Santosh Iyer, managing director and chief executive officer of Mercedes-Benz India, said the year ended on a positive note for the industry, with pro-consumer policies helping create momentum despite inflationary pressures due to “deteriorating forex headwinds.”Mercedes Benz, BMW and Audi together account for nearly 85% of luxury vehicle sales in the country.India cut GST rates on automobiles to 18% and 40% from 29% and up to 50% (including compensation cess) with effect from September 22, 2025, helping lower acquisition costs and spur demand. Luxury vehicles, which were earlier taxed at 43-50%, now attract 40% GST.In the mainstream market, car sales zoomed 17.2% year-on-year in October and by 18.7% in November, after falling 1.4% in the first six months of the financial year. BMW Group India president Hardeep Singh Brar in recent interaction said consumer sentiments have improved significantly since the tax cuts. “We had more than 2,000 pending orders on October 1. We have been registering strong growth across our portfolio,” he said.Mercedes’ Iyer, too, expects the demand momentum to strengthen in the new year.“We forecast the current demand pattern (post GST cut) to cascade down in early 2026 with GST reform benefits continuing, while recent policy tailwinds are expected to sustain customer sentiment and their purchase resilience, owing to higher disposable income,” he said.Mercedes Benz has lined up multiple launches across internal combustion engine and electric vehicle segments to tap into the latent demand in the market in the new year.Audi, too, is cautiously optimistic. Dhillon expects a more stable currency environment, continued infrastructure development and the growing aspirations of a new, sophisticated generation of luxury buyers to provide tailwinds in the year ahead.“With these factors coming together, we believe the luxury car market in India is well-positioned to return to a path of steady, sustainable growth,” he said.Luxury cars currently have a little over 1% market share in India — the lowest among major economies.In the medium to long term, the country offers ample growth potential given it is home to one of the highest number of billionaires worldwide, industry experts said.

Mumbai: India's red-hot IPO market in 2025 was driven less by companies raising growth capital and more by existing shareholders using lofty valuations to cash out.The 103 mainboard listings that raised ₹1,75,901 crore saw ₹1,11,495 crore, or 63.4% of total proceeds, routed to existing shareholders via the offer for sale (OFS) route. By contrast, only ₹64,406 crore, or 36.6%, translated into fresh capital for companies In stark contrast, in the 267 SME listings that raised ₹11,429 crore among them, ₹10,388 crore, or 91%, amounted to fresh issue of stock. Only ₹1,041 or 9% crore went to existing shareholders through OFS.An OFS allows existing shareholders such as promoters or private equity investors to sell their shares to the public, with proceeds going to them rather than the company, whereas a fresh issue of shares creates new equity, with proceeds flowing into the company's treasury for business expansion, debt repayment, or working capital needs.The mainboard OFS dominance was led by marquee deals where no fresh capital was raised at all. LG Electronics India's entire ₹11,607 crore IPO was an OFS by parent LG Electronics Inc., as was ICICI Prudential AMC's ₹10,603 crore listing by promoter Prudential Corporation Holdings. Lenskart Solutions' ₹7,278 crore IPO comprised 70.5% OFS (₹5,128 crore), while even Tata Capital's blockbuster ₹15,512 crore offering was 56% OFS.The large OFS share shows that India's capital markets have become more mature and that many of the companies coming to the mainboard are already well established, according to investment bankers."The companies are largely scaled, profitable businesses coming to market at a point of operational strength," said Bhavesh Shah, MD & head of Investment Banking, Equirus Capital.Many of these companies had raised capital as funding into the company, when they were younger and their businesses were evolving. These investments were made by the private equity investors or other investors, who in turn took higher risks as the companies were scaling up, Shah said.Bankers also believe as the risk characteristics of the companies change with scale, the type of capital in the captable changes and the stock changes hands from high risk-taking private investors to less risk averse capital market investors. The mainboard IPO market has emerged as the most efficient and transparent exit route for private equity and long-term promoters, especially for mature investments. On the other hand, SMEs are very small companies and are typically at a nascent stage of growth often even pre-growth. "At this stage, promoters generally want capital to be infused directly into the business so that they can scale up and play a bigger game rather than remain small," said Siddarth Bhamre, head - Institutional Research, Asit C Mehta adding expansion, business growth, and capacity building are therefore the most important reasons for SMEs to raise funds.LG Electronics' 38-times subscription and 38.35% listing gains show that investors are willing to back strong, well-known companies even when a large part of the issue is not fresh capital. The trend also points to the evolution of India's private equity ecosystem, where early investors are increasingly looking to exit after long holding periods of 10-15 years.However, this exit-focused approach has drawn sharp criticism. "When over 63% of mainboard IPO proceeds are going to selling shareholders rather than productive assets, it fundamentally changes the investment proposition," said Dev Chandrasekhar, partner at valuations branding advisory Transcendum. "Retail investors need to recognize they're essentially providing exit liquidity to PE funds and promoters rather than funding the next phase of growth."Without fresh capital for growth initiatives, these companies must rely entirely on operational improvements to justify premium valuations, a tougher ask in competitive markets, Chandrasekhar noted.

[TITLE]PETROAN pushes for NNPC refineries privatisation by Q1 2026:
[TEXT]
The Petroleum Products Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria has renewed its call for the privatisation of Nigeria’s four state-owned refineries, urging the Federal Government to transparently conclude the process by the first quarter of 2026.

The association said the timely privatisation of the refineries operated by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited would eliminate the recurring fiscal burden on the government, improve operational efficiency, attract private capital and technical expertise, and align Nigeria’s refining sector with global best practices.

In a statement, the PETROAN National President, Billy Gillis-Harry, said sustained public funding of the refineries has failed to deliver optimal results over the years, making private sector-led management inevitable if the country is to achieve energy security and stability in the downstream petroleum sector.

Gillis-Harry stressed that privatisation, if properly executed, would encourage competition, ensure sustainable refinery operations, reduce Nigeria’s dependence on imported petroleum products, conserve foreign exchange, and support job creation across the value chain.

PETROAN also linked refinery reform to broader sectoral growth, noting that increased domestic refining capacity would complement ongoing investments in upstream production and strengthen the country’s overall energy outlook.

“PETROAN renewed its call for the privatisation of Nigeria’s four state-owned refineries, advocating that the process be transparently concluded by the first quarter of 2026. The association noted that timely privatisation will improve efficiency, encourage competition in the sector, eliminate recurrent fiscal burdens on government, attract private capital and technical expertise, and ensure sustainable refinery operations in line with global best practices,” the statement said.

The association expressed confidence that the 2026 Budget, which is based on a crude oil production target of 1.84 million barrels per day and an oil price benchmark of $64–65 per barrel, provides a strong framework for implementing key reforms, including refinery privatisation.

It maintained that decisive action on refineries, alongside improved security for oil and gas infrastructure, effective host community engagement under the Petroleum Industry Act, and adequately funded regulators, would significantly enhance investor confidence and sector performance.

PETROAN further argued that the successful privatisation of the refineries would free government resources for critical areas such as security and infrastructure, while allowing the private sector to drive efficiency and innovation in refining and petrochemical development.

The association concluded that refinery privatisation remains central to achieving a stable downstream sector and maximising the benefits of Nigeria’s oil and gas resources under the 2026 budget framework.

“PETROAN expressed confidence that a well-implemented Nigeria 2026 Budget, anchored on security, host community inclusion, regulatory efficiency, private sector participation, and decisive refinery sector reforms, will strengthen the oil and gas sector, enhance national energy security, boost government revenue, and support sustainable economic development,” the statement concluded.

Calls for the privatisation of the refineries intensified following the shutdown of the 60,000-barrel-per-day Port Harcourt refinery in May this year, six months after it was declared operational.

The Warri refinery was also shut down one month after the former Group Chief Executive Officer of the NNPC, Mele Kyari, declared it open in December 2024. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria said the refineries were a drain on the country’s economy, calling on the Federal Government to sell them off.

The PUNCH reports that the Federal Government has consistently expended resources on the Port Harcourt, Warri, and Kaduna refineries, which became moribund many years ago. It was gathered that $1.4bn was approved for the rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt refinery in 2021, $897m was earmarked for Warri, and $586m for the Kaduna refinery.

N100bn was reportedly spent on refinery rehabilitation in 2021, with N8.33bn monthly expenditure. A total of $396.33m was allegedly spent on turnaround maintenance between 2013 and 2017. Despite all the financial allocations, the refineries remain unproductive as of the time of this report.

The new GCEO of NNPC, Bayo Ojulari, rejected calls for the sale of the refineries, expressing confidence that the three plants would be revamped. When the President of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, said the government refineries might never work again, Ojulari said the plants would come back to life.

Ojulari recently said the company was assessing the operational and commercial viability of its three refineries to determine whether to overhaul or repurpose them for enhanced efficiency and profitability.

According to him, the ongoing technical and commercial review is part of a broader plan to reposition the refineries as sustainable, revenue-generating assets that can meet Nigeria’s fuel demand and align with international operational standards.

He stated that the review marks the beginning of a new era in Nigeria’s refining sector. According to Ojulari, NNPC Limited is currently in the “Technical and Commercial Review” phase, aimed at assessing the operational state of all three refineries and determining whether to upgrade or repurpose the facilities for optimal performance and long-term sustainability.

In November, the Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority said the NNPC imported a significant quantity of petrol. Marketers said this was largely due to the dormancy of the government refineries.

[TITLE]Wellness wave drives top South Florida retail leases of 2025:
[TEXT]
South Florida’s top retail leases reveal what still worked in a year of cooling markets with lower rents and higher vacancies.

Grocery stores and fitness centers were some of the tri-county region’s biggest tenants this year, according to analysis by The Real Deal. The biggest leases were overwhelmingly concentrated in Miami-Dade County, including the year’s single largest lease: 60,000 square feet for a Whole Foods Market at Triarch Capital Group’s Aventura Town Plaza.

Here are the 10 biggest retail leases in South Florida in 2025, according to Colliers and Cushman & Wakefield:

60K sf | Whole Foods Market | Aventura

Amazon-owned grocery giant Whole Foods took 60,000 square feet at Aventura Town Plaza in Aventura, according to Commercial Observer.

Triarch Capital Group, led by Daniel Halberstein, Mario Grosfeld, Stefan Grosfeld and Jorge Linkewer, owns the shopping center between 18205 and 18299 Biscayne Boulevard. Whole Foods signed a 20-year lease with six five-year extensions.

53K sf | BJ’s Market| Delray Beach

Massachusetts-based BJ’s Wholesale Market inked the second-biggest lease of the year in South Florida with more than 53,000 square feet for its smaller grocery concept, BJ’s Market, according to Colliers.

The retailer secured the space for its second-ever BJ’s Market at Marketplace of Delray 14535 South Military Trail in Delray Beach. The store is set to open early next year, according to the Palm Beach Post. BJ’s plans to open more stores in South Carolina and Massachusetts, Good Housekeeping reported.

47K sf | Beauty Master | West Palm Beach

In West Palm Beach, Beauty Master signed for 47,200 square feet at Cross County Plaza, at 4346–4370 Okeechobee Boulevard. The Duluth, Georgia-based beauty supply retailer has more than 13 locations in Georgia and Florida, according to its website.

Cross County Plaza is owned by an entity of Bernardo Kohn and Paul Pollack, who bought the complex for $35 million in 2014. They financed the purchase with a $32 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan that year, but a default on the loan in 2020 evolved into a legal battle between the owners and their special servicer.

47K sf | Publix | Sunrise

Grocery chain Publix landed 46,800 square feet in Sunrise, adding to its deep bench of South Florida stores.

The Lakeland-based grocer inked a deal at Sunrise Town Center, at 3408-3548 North University Drive, according to Colliers. While Publix was one of the biggest tenants of the year, it has also been a significant buyer of retail properties this year. In August, Publix bought four shopping centers in Davie, Lake Worth Beach and Royal Palm Beach for a total of $150 million.

41K sf | Akira | Miami Beach

Clothing retailer Akira inked a deal for 41,400 square feet in the former Forever 21 at 701 Lincoln Road. Owned by Eric Hsueh, Erikka Wang, Sarah Hughes and Gordon Liao, Akira previously had a space at 744 Lincoln Road. Both storefronts are owned by Michael Comras’ Comras Company.

Nike CEO Elliott Hill inherited an uphill battle when he took over at the sports giant in October 2024.

Since then, Hill has made changes — both big and small — to the company as part of its turnaround strategy. After retiring from Nike in 2020, the former president of consumer and marketplace returned to guide the company amid declining sales, sluggish growth, and increased pressure from upstart rivals.

During the quarter preceding Hill's start, Nike's revenue declined 10% year over year to $11.6 billion, following flat growth in the 2024 fiscal year. Nike shares jumped

[TITLE]Japan proposes record budget spending while curbing fresh debt:
[TEXT]
TOKYO, Dec ‌26 : Japan's government on Friday proposed record spending for next fiscal year while curbing debt issuance, underscoring Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's challenge in boosting the economy while inflation remains above the central bank's target.

Her cabinet approved a draft budget of $783 billion that addresses market jitters by capping bond issuance and reducing the proportion of the budget financed by fresh debt to the lowest in almost three decades.

Also complicating Takaichi's policy challenge, core inflation in Tokyo stayed above the Bank of Japan's 2 per cent target this month while the yen remains weak, bolstering the central bank's case to keep raising interest rates.

The record 122.3-trillion-yen budget for the year starting in April, a core part of Takaichi's "proactive" fiscal policy, will likely underpin consumption but could also accelerate inflation and further strain Japan's tattered finances.

[TITLE]Startups turn concierges as India’s affluent are ready to pay to have life play to their tune:
[TEXT]
Then there are legacy players like LesConcierges, founded in 1998, which operate almost entirely behind the scenes—and, definitely offline. The company operates as a B2B concierge engine for banks, luxury brands, real estate developers, and loyalty programs, servicing over 150 clients across more than 600 sites. Its founder, Dipali Sikand, is clear that concierge support is fundamentally incompatible with platform-style monetization. “Concierge does not monetize like e-commerce or platforms. You don’t pay for tasks. You pay for judgment, continuity, access, and accountability,” she said. Annual subscriptions in this segment typically range from ₹3-5 lakh, with the tab going up to ₹8–15 lakh or even more for ultra high networth individuals or UHNIs. Enterprise contracts structured annually are also on offer. (People with assets more than $30 million are generally classified as UHNIs; those with more than $1 million HNIs, short for high net worth individuals.)
