[TITLE]Folia Health Secures $10.5M in Funding to Transform Healthcare and Research With Patient-Reported Information:
[TEXT]
BOSTON, Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Folia Health , the patient-driven health company and pioneer of home-reported outcomes (HROs), committed to transforming lived experiences into structured data insights to advance research and personalized care, today announced the close of a $10.5 million in Series A funding round led by S3 Ventures , alongside longtime partner Crosslink Capital and specialist fund Create Health Ventures . The investment will enable the company to double down on its mission to put power in the hands of patients, whose firsthand experiences with chronic and rare conditions make them valuable — and underutilized — healthcare experts.

Folia's platform enables individuals to track symptoms, treatments, and outcomes, and share them with unprecedented control. The company’s commitment to consent and radical transparency means that any data used for external research requires explicit consent, participants can see exactly how their information is being used and what is being learned through detailed Participant Reports, and can withdraw participation at any time. Folia also recognizes participants for their contributions to research studies through its revenue-sharing program, Data Dividends.

“This funding is an affirmation of our fierce dedication to making patient-focused healthcare a reality. Instead of trying to fix the system from the outside in, we’ve built Folia to harness the power of each individual patient — to make their healthcare make sense,” said company founder and CEO Nell Meosky Luo. “People live in their bodies 24/7 — they notice patterns, track what works, spot when something's off. Your own insights reveal your most burdensome symptoms, how different treatments and other things you’re trying are working for you; and also, the massive difference it can make when your treatments are working well. The knowledge held by each of our participants fills crucial knowledge gaps in traditional health data, which focuses on what happens when you’re at the clinic.”

By providing a platform giving direct value to patients, Folia Health’s approach generates high-quality, longitudinal real-world evidence (RWE) for researchers. This has informed FDA discussions and treatment guidelines, led to partnerships with leading life science companies, and generated research-grade data across conditions that have a major impact on peoples’ lives, including lupus, sickle cell disease, eczema, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Other Folia Health initiatives include:

Brian R. Smith, Managing Director at S3 Ventures, adds: “Folia is a validated research platform redefining how we understand chronic and rare diseases. Nearly a decade of peer-reviewed research positions Folia as the gold standard for patient-driven real-world evidence, and we are thrilled to support their growth across new conditions and partnerships.”

With the inevitable shift toward using AI tools to make personal health decisions, data based on real experiences is the foundation that is necessary for AI models to accurately reflect individuals’ unique health journeys. “What gets lost in the excitement over the power of AI is the fact that these new technologies require the right data to give us insights that are meaningful and useful,” said Dan Toffling, co-founder and CTO of Folia Health. “Right now we’re dependent on incomplete and skewed datasets, typically information that’s collected a few days out of the year during brief interactions with clinicians. In other words, would you want all your health decisions to be based solely on what’s in your doctor’s notes in your EHR?”

The funding announcement follows Folia’s recent launch of Mosaic, a community insights research initiative that enables participants to ask questions and get answers based on aggregated data from others with similar conditions. The program is currently active for users with eczema and PNH, with plans to expand to lupus and sickle cell disease in 2026.

About Folia Health

Folia Health is a patient-led health company and the pioneer of home-reported outcomes (HROs), transforming lived health experiences into valuable structured data insights to advance research and personalized care. The company's platform is built on the belief that the knowledge of patients and caregivers is the missing piece to enable precise, individualized care and high-impact research. Through a useful platform, radical transparency, explicit consent protocols, and data dividend payments, Folia bridges the gap between patients, clinicians, and researchers while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and patient autonomy. Founded in 2016 by family caregivers and based in Boston, Folia works with individuals across chronic and rare conditions to generate clinical-grade real-world evidence.

[TITLE]Nearly one million Minnesotans about to shop for health care will see big rate increases:
[TEXT]
Those shopping for Medicare Advantage plans, or through the MNSURE marketplace, will see increases between 14-22%. Expiring tax credits could add to the pain.

To stream KARE 11 on your phone, you need the KARE 11 app.

ST PAUL, Minn. — If you're a Minnesota farmer, small business owner or anyone else who relies on the MNSURE marketplace because you can't get health insurance through an employer, be warned.

"Health insurance rates for 2026 are going up, and the numbers are alarming," said Grace Arnold, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Commerce.

During a news conference at the Minnesota State Capitol Wednesday, which Arnold called a "pivotal public awareness moment," the Department of Commerce announced the average rate increases that nearly 400,000 Minnesotans will encounter when shopping for healthcare in the weeks ahead.

According to the Department of Commerce, Individual Market rates are set to increase by an average of 22% for the 187,000 Minnesotans who rely on them.

Small Group Market rates are also set to increase by an average of 14% for another 202,000 Minnesotans.

"Middle-class Minnesotans are those that will be hit the hardest by these increases," Arnold said.

Arnold says middle-class Minnesotans are also at risk of losing enhanced premium tax credits, which have recently helped bring premiums down by hundreds of dollars a month for nearly 90,000 Minnesotans.

Those credits are now set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress votes to renew them. An extension has had bipartisan support, but Democrats want it to be part of a continuing budget resolution, and Republican leaders have said they want to deal with it separately.

"Time is running out," said Libby Cullum, CEO of MNSURE. "We've seen our uninsured rate in Minnesota drop over the last few years. I think in large part due to those tax credits. More people than ever before, more middle-class families can afford health insurance.

If they go away. You know, some folks are gonna have to make really, really tough decisions

[TITLE]Arvinas Presents Late Breaking, Positive Phase 1 Clinical Data for ARV-102, a PROTAC LRRK2 Degrader, at the 2025 International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders®:
[TEXT]
– ARV-102 was well tolerated in clinical trials for both healthy volunteers and patients with Parkinson’s disease –

– ARV-102 demonstrated dose-dependent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exposure in subjects in both trials –

– After 14 days of treatment in healthy volunteers, ARV-102 decreased lysosomal and neuroinflammatory microglial pathway biomarkers known to be elevated in Parkinson’s disease –

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Oct. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arvinas, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARVN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company creating a new class of drugs based on targeted protein degradation, today announced positive pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and biomarker data from two Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating ARV-102, an oral, brain-penetrant investigational PROTAC degrader of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Results were presented at the International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders® (MDS 2025) in Honolulu.

“We are particularly excited by the CSF proteomics results, which demonstrate modulation of lysosomal and microglial pathways that are known to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases,” said Noah Berkowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Arvinas. “We believe these findings support the intensified development of ARV-102 in ongoing studies of patients with Parkinson’s disease, and in future studies of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy.”

The company presented data from two trials: ARV-102-101, a first-in-human trial of ARV-102 in healthy volunteers, and ARV-102-103, a trial in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Key findings include:

Data from a Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose and Multiple Ascending Dose Trial in Healthy Volunteers (Poster 904):

Safety: ARV-102 was generally well tolerated at single doses up to 200 mg and multiple daily doses up to 80 mg, with no discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) observed in the study population.

ARV-102 was generally well tolerated at single doses up to 200 mg and multiple daily doses up to 80 mg, with no discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) observed in the study population. Pharmacokinetics: ARV-102 exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner in plasma and CSF, the latter indicating brain penetration.

ARV-102 exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner in plasma and CSF, the latter indicating brain penetration. Pharmacodynamics: Repeated daily doses ≥20 mg resulted in >90% reductions of LRRK2 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and >50% reductions in CSF.

Repeated daily doses ≥20 mg resulted in >90% reductions of LRRK2 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and >50% reductions in CSF. Pathway Biomarkers: Repeated daily doses of ARV-102 resulted in reduced plasma concentrations of phospho-Rab10T73 and urine concentrations of bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP), a sensitive biomarker for modulation of the lysosomal pathway downstream of LRRK2.

Interim Single Ascending Dose Data from a Phase 1 Trial in Patients with Parkinson’s Disease and CSF Proteomic Data from a Phase 1 Trial in Healthy Volunteers (Late Breaking Abstract #22):

Safety: The Phase 1 trial in patients with Parkinson’s disease included 15 patients treated with ARV-102 and 4 patients treated with placebo. In the trial, single doses of ARV-102 (50 mg or 200 mg) were well tolerated with only mild treatment-related AEs including headache, diarrhea, and nausea; no SAEs occurred.

The Phase 1 trial in patients with Parkinson’s disease included 15 patients treated with ARV-102 and 4 patients treated with placebo. In the trial, single doses of ARV-102 (50 mg or 200 mg) were well tolerated with only mild treatment-related AEs including headache, diarrhea, and nausea; no SAEs occurred. Pharmacokinetics: In patients with Parkinson’s disease, ARV-102 exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner in both plasma and CSF, the latter indicating brain penetration.

In patients with Parkinson’s disease, ARV-102 exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner in both plasma and CSF, the latter indicating brain penetration. Pharmacodynamics: In patients with Parkinson’s disease, treatment with ARV-102 resulted in median PBMC LRRK2 protein reductions of 86% with the 50 mg dose and 97% with the 200 mg dose.

In patients with Parkinson’s disease, treatment with ARV-102 resulted in median PBMC LRRK2 protein reductions of 86% with the 50 mg dose and 97% with the 200 mg dose. CSF Proteomics: In healthy volunteers treated with ARV-102 80 mg once daily for 14 days, unbiased proteomic analyses of CSF showed significant decreases in lysosomal pathway markers and neuroinflammatory microglial markers previously shown to be elevated in patients with Parkinson's disease harboring LRRK2 variants.

“To our knowledge, this is the first time an investigational LRRK2 therapy has, at 14 days in healthy volunteers, shown effects on distal pathway biomarkers in CSF that are elevated in patients with LRRK2 Parkinson’s disease," said John Houston, Ph.D., Chairperson, Chief Executive Officer, and President at Arvinas. "These data highlight the potential of PROTAC-mediated LRRK2 degradation, encouraging further development that could benefit patients in the future."

Arvinas plans to present initial data from a multiple dose cohort of the Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with Parkinson’s disease (ARV-102-103) in 2026. Pending data from the multiple dose cohort and investigational new drug (IND) clearance, Arvinas intends to initiate a Phase 1b trial in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy in the first half of 2026.

Abivax Announces Late-Breaking Presentation of 8-Week ABTECT Trial Results with Updated Safety Data

50 mg once-daily dose of obefazimod led to a pooled 16.4% (p<0.0001) placebo-adjusted clinical remission rate at Week 8; met primary and all key secondary endpoints in both ABTECT 1 and ABTECT 2

ABTECT trials enrolled refractory patient population with 47% of participants having prior inadequate response to advanced therapy, among whom 21% had prior inadequate response to JAK inhibitor therapy

Obefazimod treatment was well tolerated with no new safety signals identified for both the 25mg and 50mg doses

Abivax to present a second late-breaking abstract on October 6. Management to host a conference call to discuss results of both late-breaking abstracts at 9am ET / 3pm CET on October 6.

PARIS, France – October 05, 2025 – 5:00 PM CET – Abivax SA (Euronext Paris: FR0012333284 – ABVX / Nasdaq: ABVX) (“Abivax” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, today announced results from the first of two late-breaking presentations at the United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Meeting in Berlin, Germany. The presentation includes results from Abivax’s Phase 3 ABTECT 8-Week Induction Trials investigating obefazimod for the treatment of moderate-to-severely active ulcerative colitis, including previously reported findings and additional safety data at week 8.

“There is an urgent need for new therapies to treat ulcerative colitis that deliver durable efficacy, safety, and the simplicity of oral, once-daily dosing,” said Bruce Sands, MD*, Professor of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. "The ABTECT Trials enrolled individuals with advanced disease, including many who had failed multiple lines of advanced therapy and a significant percentage of patients with prior JAK inhibitor failure. The refractory nature of this population underscores the significance of the results presented today.”

A total of 1272 patients were enrolled across the ABTECT 1 & 2 trials. In the pooled full data set across ABTECT 1 & 2, no signal for serious, severe, or opportunistic infections or malignancies was observed. The most commonly reported TEAEs were headache (6%-placebo, 16%-25mg, 24.1%-50mg) with <1% of headaches leading to study discontinuation (0.3% at 25mg; 1.1% at 50mg), and nausea (1.3% in placebo, 5.0% at 25mg, 7.2% at 50mg).

Results from the ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2 trials demonstrated that obefazimod met its FDA primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 8 in the 50 mg once-daily dose regimen for both trials. Individually, ABTECT-1 showed a placebo-adjusted clinical remission rate of 19.3% (p<0.0001) and ABTECT-2 demonstrated 13.4% (p=0.0001), each at the 50 mg once-daily dose, with all key secondary efficacy endpoints being met.

[TITLE]Building a Digital Backbone: How States Can Modernize Rural Healthcare with RHTP Funding:
[TEXT]
The Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP), a $50 billion federal initiative spanning five years, presents states with a historic opportunity to stabilize and modernize healthcare in rural communities. Central to sustaining rural healthcare is the hub and spoke model, where a large central hub hospital can provide managed services, specialist access, and technology support to smaller rural spoke facilities. This model enhances care coordination, resource sharing, and specialist availability, creating a sustainable regional healthcare ecosystem.

Scaling this model requires significant infrastructure investment to build a robust, secure, and high-performance digital backbone. Investments must ensure reliable broadband connectivity, secure networks, and scalable telehealth platforms tailored to the size and capacity of each rural hospital—from small Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to large regional hubs. We encourage states to form collaborative consortiums involving multiple healthcare providers to leverage economies of scale and regional coordination, a critical requirement of the grant. Cisco’s modular, scalable solutions enable states and their designated hubs to design and deploy this infrastructure, supporting continuous patient care, advanced cybersecurity, and operational efficiency.

By investing in digital resilience through the hub and spoke model, states can extend high-quality care to rural populations, support the delivery of care that can lead to improved health outcomes, and build sustainable healthcare ecosystems that withstand disruptions and grow with community needs. The application deadline for RHTP is November 5, 2025, making timely investment critical to leverage this historic funding opportunity.

This approach aligns with RHTP priorities by modernizing infrastructure, strengthening workforce capabilities, enabling innovative care delivery, and ensuring long-term sustainability through scalable, secure, and adaptable digital health ecosystems.

The need for digital resilience in rural healthcare

Infrastructure Challenges by Hospital Size: Rural hospitals vary widely—from small CAHs with fewer than 26 beds to larger rural emergency hospitals and regional referral centers. Digital resilience solutions must be customized to hospital size and capacity to optimize investment and impact.

Rural hospitals vary widely—from small CAHs with fewer than 26 beds to larger rural emergency hospitals and regional referral centers. Digital resilience solutions must be customized to hospital size and capacity to optimize investment and impact. Connectivity and Cybersecurity: Smaller hospitals often face greater challenges securing reliable broadband and defending against cyber threats due to limited resources. This is compounded by a historical lack of investment in rural healthcare infrastructure. Additionally, healthcare remains the most targeted sector for cyberattacks, with the proliferation of connected medical devices increasing the attack surface and complexity of securing these environments.

[TITLE]Nearly one million Minnesotans about to shop for health care will see big rate increases:
[TEXT]
Those shopping for Medicare Advantage plans, or through the MNSURE marketplace, will see increases between 14-22%. Expiring tax credits could add to the pain.

To stream KARE 11 on your phone, you need the KARE 11 app.

ST PAUL, Minn. — If you're a Minnesota farmer, small business owner or anyone else who relies on the MNSURE marketplace because you can't get health insurance through an employer, be warned.

"Health insurance rates for 2026 are going up, and the numbers are alarming," said Grace Arnold, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Commerce.

During a news conference at the Minnesota State Capitol Wednesday, which Arnold called a "pivotal public awareness moment," the Department of Commerce announced the average rate increases that nearly 400,000 Minnesotans will encounter when shopping for healthcare in the weeks ahead.

According to the Department of Commerce, Individual Market rates are set to increase by an average of 22% for the 187,000 Minnesotans who rely on them.

Small Group Market rates are also set to increase by an average of 14% for another 202,000 Minnesotans.

"Middle-class Minnesotans are those that will be hit the hardest by these increases," Arnold said.

Arnold says middle-class Minnesotans are also at risk of losing enhanced premium tax credits, which have recently helped bring premiums down by hundreds of dollars a month for nearly 90,000 Minnesotans.

Those credits are now set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress votes to renew them. An extension has had bipartisan support, but Democrats want it to be part of a continuing budget resolution, and Republican leaders have said they want to deal with it separately.

"Time is running out," said Libby Cullum, CEO of MNSURE. "We've seen our uninsured rate in Minnesota drop over the last few years. I think in large part due to those tax credits. More people than ever before, more middle-class families can afford health insurance.

If they go away. You know, some folks are gonna have to make really, really tough decisions

[TITLE]Folia Health Secures $10.5M in Funding to Transform Healthcare and Research With Patient-Reported Information:
[TEXT]
BOSTON, Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Folia Health , the patient-driven health company and pioneer of home-reported outcomes (HROs), committed to transforming lived experiences into structured data insights to advance research and personalized care, today announced the close of a $10.5 million in Series A funding round led by S3 Ventures , alongside longtime partner Crosslink Capital and specialist fund Create Health Ventures . The investment will enable the company to double down on its mission to put power in the hands of patients, whose firsthand experiences with chronic and rare conditions make them valuable — and underutilized — healthcare experts.

Folia's platform enables individuals to track symptoms, treatments, and outcomes, and share them with unprecedented control. The company’s commitment to consent and radical transparency means that any data used for external research requires explicit consent, participants can see exactly how their information is being used and what is being learned through detailed Participant Reports, and can withdraw participation at any time. Folia also recognizes participants for their contributions to research studies through its revenue-sharing program, Data Dividends.

“This funding is an affirmation of our fierce dedication to making patient-focused healthcare a reality. Instead of trying to fix the system from the outside in, we’ve built Folia to harness the power of each individual patient — to make their healthcare make sense,” said company founder and CEO Nell Meosky Luo. “People live in their bodies 24/7 — they notice patterns, track what works, spot when something's off. Your own insights reveal your most burdensome symptoms, how different treatments and other things you’re trying are working for you; and also, the massive difference it can make when your treatments are working well. The knowledge held by each of our participants fills crucial knowledge gaps in traditional health data, which focuses on what happens when you’re at the clinic.”

By providing a platform giving direct value to patients, Folia Health’s approach generates high-quality, longitudinal real-world evidence (RWE) for researchers. This has informed FDA discussions and treatment guidelines, led to partnerships with leading life science companies, and generated research-grade data across conditions that have a major impact on peoples’ lives, including lupus, sickle cell disease, eczema, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Other Folia Health initiatives include:

Brian R. Smith, Managing Director at S3 Ventures, adds: “Folia is a validated research platform redefining how we understand chronic and rare diseases. Nearly a decade of peer-reviewed research positions Folia as the gold standard for patient-driven real-world evidence, and we are thrilled to support their growth across new conditions and partnerships.”

With the inevitable shift toward using AI tools to make personal health decisions, data based on real experiences is the foundation that is necessary for AI models to accurately reflect individuals’ unique health journeys. “What gets lost in the excitement over the power of AI is the fact that these new technologies require the right data to give us insights that are meaningful and useful,” said Dan Toffling, co-founder and CTO of Folia Health. “Right now we’re dependent on incomplete and skewed datasets, typically information that’s collected a few days out of the year during brief interactions with clinicians. In other words, would you want all your health decisions to be based solely on what’s in your doctor’s notes in your EHR?”

The funding announcement follows Folia’s recent launch of Mosaic, a community insights research initiative that enables participants to ask questions and get answers based on aggregated data from others with similar conditions. The program is currently active for users with eczema and PNH, with plans to expand to lupus and sickle cell disease in 2026.
