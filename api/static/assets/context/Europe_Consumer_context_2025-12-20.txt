[TITLE]US consumer inflation cools unexpectedly in November:
[TEXT]
The consumer price index rose 2.7 percent in November, easing from 3.0 percent in September, but households are still feeling the squeeze - Copyright AFP/File CHARLY TRIBALLEAU

Beiyi SEOW

US consumer inflation slowed unexpectedly in November, delayed government data showed Thursday, although levels remained higher than earlier in the year before President Donald Trump’s tariffs flowed through the economy.

The consumer price index (CPI) climbed 2.7 percent from a year ago in November, the Department of Labor said, notably below analysts’ predictions of a 3.1 percent uptick.

The latest figure was also down from the 3.0 percent rise in September, the most recent month for which fuller data was available due to a lengthy government shutdown.

Inflation has ticked up this year as Trump slapped new tariffs on goods from US trading partners, causing many firms to flag a hike in business costs.

But the impact on consumers has been more muted, as companies rushed to stock up on inventory before steeper import prices kicked in. Many opted not to fully pass on the cost increases.

US households, however, still feel the pinch from elevated costs overall.

Democrats notched victories in off-year elections last month, fueled by voters being disgruntled

[TITLE]Seattle Music Scene Gut Check:
[TEXT]
Music venue operators still booking live music and DJs are miracle workers. So many factors are working against them. The cost of everything is rising and music aficionados' wages mostly aren't keeping up. Clubbing has become an infrequent luxury for many.

When the venerable Crocodile announced plans to shutter in mid-December its two downstairs rooms—the 300-capacity Madame Lou's and the 100-capacity Here-After—it struck a sensitive nerve among Seattle's nightlifers. As someone who's attended many events at both spaces, I was surprised by this news. Most of the shows that I caught there were well-attended.

But, as Crocodile creative director/general partner Hunter Motto told the Seattle Times, "We had really professional and high-level operations in the space and it has been challenging to deal with revenue on the bar side going down over the years and expenses going up." When asked if the Crocodile had found partners to take over the venues, Motto said, "Sadly, nothing we can discuss with the press

CEO Message

Steve Barnard, CEO of Mission, stated, “Fiscal 2025 was a defining year for Mission Produce. We achieved record revenue of $1.39 billion, growing 13% on top of a strong 2024 driven by avocado volume growth of 7% through our Marketing & Distribution segment, and delivered record adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. These results reflect the power of our integrated global platform and the exceptional execution of our team. Throughout the year, our connected commercial organization demonstrated remarkable agility—pivoting to capitalize on market opportunities across North America, Europe, and Asia—each of which experienced growth for the quarter and full year. We were able to optimize our owned Peruvian production across customers and markets in a balanced fashion that drove category penetration and deepened key customer relationships. Whether navigating pricing dynamics or managing supply across regions, our team leveraged the full breadth of our capabilities to drive volume growth and optimize per-unit margins. Combined with our company-wide effort to enhance collaboration, data-driven decision making, and disciplined execution, I'm confident Mission is well positioned to continue growing share through expanding our presence in the years ahead.”

Mr. Barnard concluded, “We enter fiscal 2026 with strong financial momentum and a very healthy balance sheet. We generated more than $180 million of operating cash flow over the past two years. With our heavy capital investment cycle now complete and capital expenditures expected to step down to approximately $40 million in fiscal 2026, we are positioned to accelerate free cash flow generation which provides us with great flexibility to create value for our shareholders.”

Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2025 Consolidated Financial Review

Total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased $35.4 million or 10% to $319.0 million compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the Marketing & Distribution segment, where a decrease in average per-unit avocado sales prices of 27% was partially offset by a 13% increase in avocado volume sold. Price and volume movements resulted from greater availability of Mexican fruit due to harvest disruptions in the previous year and higher Peruvian avocado production driven by more favorable weather conditions in the current year.

Gross profit was $55.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, consistent with the prior year, while gross margin increased 180 basis points compared to the same period last year, to 17.5% of revenue. The margin increase was driven by lower revenues compared to last year, resulting from lower per-unit pricing, as the Marketing & Distribution segment margin is primarily managed on a per-unit basis.

Selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) for the fourth quarter increased $0.5 million or 2% to $27.7 million, compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher general operating costs, inclusive of performance-based stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower statutory profit-sharing expense in the Peru and Mexico operations.

Net income attributable to Mission Produce for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 was $16.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $17.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the same period last year.

Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 13% to $22.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $19.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the same period last year.

Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.5 million or 12% to $41.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $36.9 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by increased owned avocado production in the International Farming segment and higher avocado volume sold in the Marketing & Distribution segment.

Fiscal Fourth Quarter Business Segment Performance

Marketing & Distribution

Net sales in the Marketing & Distribution segment decreased $47.7 million or 15% to $271.9 million for the fourth quarter, driven by the avocado volume and pricing dynamics described above. While pricing is driven by industry production dynamics, the Company manages the business primarily to volume and per-unit margins—leveraging its global platform and sourcing network to optimize per-unit margin performance regardless of the pricing environment.

Segment operating income increased $1.6 million or 9% and segment adjusted EBITDA increased $2.7 million or 11% compared to the same period last year, which is primarily attributed to higher avocado volume sold.

International Farming

The vast majority of fruit sales from the International Farming segment are made to the Marketing & Distribution segment, with the remainder of revenue largely derived from direct sales of fruit to third parties, as well as services provided to third-parties and the Blueberries segment. Affiliated sales are concentrated in the second half of the fiscal year in alignment with the Peruvian avocado harvest season, which typically runs from April through September of each year. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the International Farming segment is generally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year in alignment with the timing of sales.

Total sales in the International Farming segment for the fourth quarter increased $29.3 million or 97% to $59.6 million, compared to $30.3 million for the same period last year. Segment operating income improved by $4.7 million to $2.1 million compared to a loss of $2.5 million in the same period last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $5.7 million or 211% to $8.4 million compared to $2.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher yield from owned avocado orchards and supported by higher volume of avocado packing and cooling services provided to third parties.

Blueberries

Sales in the Blueberries segment have traditionally been concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year in alignment with the Peruvian blueberry harvest season.

Net sales in the Blueberries segment increased $4.9 million or 16% to $36.5 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $31.6 million for the same period last year, primarily due to higher volume produced on owned farms as a result of increased total acreage.

Segment operating income was $4.9 million for the fourth quarter compared to $11.6 million in the same period last year and segment adjusted EBITDA was $4.7 million compared to $8.6 million in same period last year. The decreases were due to higher unit costs resulting from lower projected yields per hectare in the current harvest season.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

Cash and cash equivalents were $64.8 million as of October 31, 2025, compared to $58.0 million as of October 31, 2024.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $88.6 million for the year ended October 31, 2025, as compared to $93.4 million last year, driven by higher working capital requirements. Working capital growth was primarily driven by lower grower payables, higher other assets and net movements in income tax receivable and payable balances, which were partially offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances and higher accounts payable balances. The movements in accounts receivable, inventory and grower payables correlated with reductions in avocado pricing levels. Other asset growth pertains to value-added tax balances in Mexico and Guatemala, while income tax movements are attributed to timing of payment requirements in operational taxing jurisdictions. Accounts payable growth is primarily attributed to higher farming production costs within our International Farming and Blueberries segments.

Capital expenditures were $51.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2025 compared to $32.2 million last year. Capital expenditures were comprised primarily of avocado orchard development, pre-production orchard maintenance and land improvements, packhouse construction in Guatemala and pre-production land development and blueberry plant cultivation in Peru.

Outlook

For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, the Company is providing the following industry outlooks that will drive performance:

Avocado industry volumes in the fiscal 2026 first quarter are expected to increase by approximately 10% versus the prior year period, driven by a larger Mexican crop in the current harvest season.

Pricing is expected to be lower on a year-over-year basis by approximately 25% compared to the $1.75 per pound average experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by higher supply conditions.

The blueberries harvest season in Peru will peak during the first quarter. The Company expects to see volume increases from owned farms resulting from new acreage in production, which should translate to higher revenue, as average sales prices are expected to be flat to slightly higher. Profitability will continue to be impacted by higher costs resulting from lower projected yields per hectare in the current harvest season.

For full year fiscal 2026, total capital expenditure is expected to be approximately $40 million.

Board Refreshment Initiative Underway –Three New Independent Directors Appointed in Advance of Expected Retirement of Current Board Chair at close of the Annual Meeting

OXNARD, Calif., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mission Produce, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVO) (“Mission” or “the Company”) a world leader in sourcing, producing, and distributing fresh Hass avocados, today announced a leadership succession plan and an update on its Board refreshment initiative. These actions position the Company to successfully execute on its long-term strategic plan, accelerate growth, and deliver value to shareholders.

Leadership Succession

Following two consecutive years of exceptional financial performance and operational execution, and the successful completion of a significant capital expenditure cycle, Mission Produce announced that President and Chief Operating Officer John Pawlowski has been named Chief Executive Officer, to become effective at the close of the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders in April 2026. Steve Barnard, who co-founded Mission in 1983 and served as its CEO since 1988, will transition to Executive Chairman of the Board, where he will continue to support the Company's strategic direction as Board Chair while working closely with Mr. Pawlowski and the leadership team in an advisory capacity.

Steve Barnard commented, “Over the past four decades, our team has built Mission into the global leader in avocados—expanding our world-class growing operations, strengthening our distribution network across four continents, and establishing Mission as the partner of choice for retailers and foodservice customers worldwide. In the past two fiscal years, we delivered phenomenal results that demonstrate the extraordinary coordination and effectiveness of our team, completed a multi-year transformational capital investment cycle, and further enhanced the Company’s cash flow generation and balance sheet to capitalize on exciting future opportunities. Since joining Mission, John has brought tremendous leadership and operational expertise, and I am confident that his strategic vision and decades of experience in the global food industry makes him the ideal leader to guide Mission through its next chapter of growth. I am proud of what we have accomplished together, and I look forward to supporting John and the team in my new role as Executive Chairman of the Board.”

“I am honored to take on the role of CEO and grateful to Steve and the Board for their confidence,” said John Pawlowski. “Mission Produce is exceptionally well-positioned—our investments in world-class growing operations and global distribution infrastructure have created significant durable competitive advantages that are driving our strong performance. As we pivot to a period of greater free cash flow generation, I am excited to lead our talented team as we continue to drive avocado consumption globally and deliver value for our customers, grower partners, and shareholders. The future is bright for Mission Produce, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation we have created under Steve’s leadership.”

Pawlowski joined Mission Produce in April 2024 as President and Chief Operating Officer. He is a highly accomplished executive with more than 25 years in the global food and foodservice industry, specializing in business development, system optimization and executive team management. Prior to Mission, Pawlowski served as President and COO of Lipari Foods, a leading independent distributor, and served for more than 16 years at J.M. Smucker in a variety of leadership positions, culminating with a role as Vice President of International.

Strategic Board Refreshment Initiative

Concurrent with the Company’s leadership changes that are expected to become effective at the close of the Company’s 2026 Annual Meeting, the Company also expects to complete its strategic Board refreshment initiative. Over the course of 2025, Mission Produce has focused on enhancing the breadth and depth of its Board of Directors, adding three highly qualified independent directors who bring deep expertise in finance, food and beverage operations, and agribusiness. These new directors, combined with Mr. Barnard’s transition to Executive Chairman, position the Board for a natural evolution in leadership following the retirement of long-time Board Chair, Stephen Beebe, as well as Board member Bonnie Lind, who will not stand for reelection at the Company’s 2026 Annual Meeting. The Board has appointed Linda Segre, who has served on the Board since 2020, as its new Lead Independent Director.

Steve Barnard added, “I want to recognize Stephen Beebe’s contributions in building Mission into the industry leader it has become over the past four decades. He has been an instrumental and trusted advisor that has made an immeasurable impact on our success. We wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I’d also like to thank Bonnie for her contributions as our Audit Committee Chair, who alongside the rest of our Board have put us in position to win and have helped us attract an amazing group of professionals to the Mission organization.”

Sims most recently served as Executive Vice President and CFO of TruGreen, and previously held senior leadership roles at AdvancePierre Foods and Chiquita Brands International, where he led global finance and business development initiatives for over 20 years. He currently serves on the boards of The Hain Celestial Group and Winland Foods. Mr. Sims serves on the Audit Committee and will assume the role of Chair effective at the 2026 Annual Meeting.

[TITLE]Village Farms International’s CBDistillery Platform Poised to Benefit from President Trump’s Executive Order to Reschedule Marijuana:
[TEXT]
Future insurance coverage of CBD products has potential to drastically transform the Company’s CBDistillery business

Company’s advocacy efforts and legal strategy in DEA proceedings contributed to historic milestone ending prohibition

Village remains committed to activating U.S. production assets to meet increasing demand for safe, affordable product

LAKE MARY, Fla., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Village Farms International, Inc. (“Village Farms” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: VFF), today commended U.S. President Donald Trump for his Executive Order directing the Attorney General to reschedule Marijuana to a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act. If enacted, the shift would represent a consequential step in modernizing U.S. cannabis policy and support the development of a regulatory framework more aligned with international drug policies which have recently begun to enable medical cannabis markets to thrive globally.

Michael A. DeGiglio, retired U.S. Navy captain, naval aviator and Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer of Village Farms commented, “We commend President Trump for his efforts to overcome decades of policy failures and bureaucratic red tape to advance meaningful reform that will help improve the lives of millions of Americans. We look forward to a better future in the United States in which federal cannabis policy follows scientific and medical research to unlock a new wave of investment and innovation in cannabinoid-based therapeutic products.”

Mr. DeGiglio added, “Earlier this year, Village Farms’ legal strategy in the DEA hearing process sought to prevent a failure to reschedule cannabis. We had a unique opportunity to represent our industry in the ALJ proceedings, and we’re proud that our actions and advocacy efforts helped contribute to President Trump’s thoughtful, evidenced based approach to enacting federal reform. We remain committed to collaborating with policymakers to advance commonsense reform for our seniors, military warriors, veterans, and medical patients, and believe our CBDistillery e-commerce platform, operational capabilities and U.S. production assets can help support increasing demand for safe, affordable medical cannabis products.”

Village Farms has long advocated for a science-led regulatory framework for cannabis in the United States, drawing on its decades of experience in controlled environment agriculture, global leadership in large-scale cannabis cultivation, track record of collaboration with governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions, and position as one of the largest e-commerce platforms for full-spectrum hemp-derived CBD products in the United States. The Company is one of the largest cannabis growers in the world, and owns 2.2 million square feet of greenhouse assets and 950 acres of unoccupied farmland in Texas which it developed in the 1990s in one of the most favorable growing climates in North America.

[TITLE]From Farming to Fashion, the Trends Shaping the Cotton Industry for 2026:
[TEXT]
A year drawing to a close marks a time of reflection for many. And for two of the industry’s relentlessly hopeful sectors—farming and retail—it’s also a time to take stock and consider the outlook for next year.

In the farming branch, cotton prices have been stable but low, which has made it a tough time for growers. But this stability could benefit apparel makers and retailers that take advantage of the lower pricing.

“This stability in raw material pricing may be one bright point in the sea of uncertainty that has been facing the industry over the past year,” said Cotton Incorporated’s Jon Devine, senior economist, in an interview with the Lifestyle Monitor™.

By working with cotton instead of synthetic apparel, brands can both win over consumers and help their bottom lines after facing a host of challenges in 2025. Consider that nearly three-quarters of shoppers (74 percent) say their favorite fiber or fabric to wear is cotton, denim or a cotton blend, according to Cotton Incorporated’s 2025 Lifestyle MonitorTM Survey. The survey completes 500 interviews per month with U.S. consumers between the ages of 13 and 70. Further, nearly six in 10 consumers (59 percent) say they would pay more for natural fibers such as cotton.

Devine explains that crop prices declined after surging during the pandemic and are now as low as they were pre-Covid. This puts growers in a bind though, since the cost of inputs have increased with inflation. The USDA estimates that costs have risen

As the global e-commerce market continues to expand, a growing number of consumers are seeking platforms that align with their values. Ethical shopping, conscious consumerism, and support for Black-owned businesses are no longer niche interests. They are shaping how people choose where to spend their money.

Lembrih Marketplace is positioning itself at the intersection of those shifts.

Founded by Ghanaian entrepreneur Latifa Seini, Lembrih Marketplace is a mission-first e-commerce platform designed to support Black and African vendors who have historically struggled to gain visibility on mainstream marketplaces.

Seini’s inspiration came from firsthand experience. Before launching Lembrih, she ran Flaunt Ankara, an African print business that connected her with customers across borders. While demand existed, growth was constrained by high seller fees, limited discoverability, and platforms that were not designed with culturally rich brands in mind.

Those challenges are not unique. Many small-batch creators and artisans face similar barriers when attempting to scale their businesses globally.

Lembrih addresses these issues with a vendor-first pricing model. Sellers receive 30 days commission-free, followed by a choice between a $10 monthly subscription plus 10 percent commission or a 15 percent commission with no subscription. According to Seini, the goal is to lower the financial barrier to entry while allowing vendors to retain more of their earnings.

Beyond pricing, Lembrih integrates social impact into every transaction. The platform donates $1 from each purchase to charitable causes, reinforcing its commitment to community uplift and ethical commerce.

The name “Lembrih,” meaning “black” in the Gonja language of Ghana, reflects the platform’s cultural foundation and its focus on amplifying underrepresented voices in e-commerce.

Seini’s professional background also informs the platform’s development. Working in IT training and enablement, she has led leadership programs and initiatives focused on the future of AI and workforce development. That experience shapes Lembrih’s scalable infrastructure and long-term vision.

The marketplace is currently in its Kickstarter pre-launch phase, with the campaign aimed at funding final development, onboarding vendors, and expanding brand awareness ahead of its official launch.

Supporters include conscious consumers, creatives, and advocates for Black-owned business platforms who are seeking alternatives to traditional e-commerce models.

As consumer behavior continues to evolve, Lembrih Marketplace represents a growing movement toward commerce that prioritizes fairness, culture, and impact alongside profitability.

While shopping malls across the US and Europe grapple with declining footfalls, oversupply and widespread store closures, India is emerging as a rare global bright spot for retail real estate.According to ANAROCK Research & Advisory, India’s retail sector is poised to attract over USD 3.5 billion in capital inflows over the next three years, driven by strong consumption growth, an acute shortage of quality mall space, and rising interest from global brands and institutional investors.The contrast with Western markets could not be sharper. Since 2020, the US has recorded a net closure of nearly 1,200 mall stores, even as new store openings rose sharply over the past two years.Vacancies have surged, forcing nearly 40% of empty malls to be rezoned or repurposed, highlighting what many analysts describe as an existential crisis for traditional malls in mature economies.India, meanwhile, is witnessing a retail resurgence.“Latest ANAROCK data shows that in the next three years, Indian malls are set to see over USD 3.5 billion of capital inflows,” says Anuj Kejriwal, CEO – Retail Leasing and Industrial & Logistics, ANAROCK Group. “Over 88 foreign brands have entered the Indian retail market between 2021 and the first nine months of 2025, and several more are actively scouting for space in the severely constrained Grade-A mall segment.”India’s appeal lies in a powerful combination of a young consumer base, rising disposable incomes and favourable FDI policies—factors that global brands increasingly struggle to find in saturated Western markets.One of the strongest drivers of investor confidence is India’s extreme undersupply of organised, Grade-A retail space. ANAROCK data shows that India’s per capita retail stock remains among the lowest globally. Tier-1 cities offer just 4–6 sq. ft. per person, while Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities have only 2–3 sq. ft. per capita. Grade-A mall space alone stands at a mere 0.6 sq. ft. per capita.By comparison, the US averages close to 23 sq. ft. per capita, while China exceeds 6 sq. ft.“This gap, combined with India’s per-capita income nearly doubling over the last decade, has created a demand–supply mismatch virtually unheard of in global retail,” Kejriwal notes. According to ANAROCK, most Grade-A malls in India are operating at 95–100% occupancy, often with long waitlists for prime zones. Leasing cycles are now outpacing construction cycles—a phenomenon rarely seen in global retail markets.India’s retail story is also being reshaped by changing consumer behaviour. The country is on track to become a USD 6 trillion consumption economy by 2030, powered by urbanisation, income growth and a demographic dividend.Unlike many Western malls, Indian shopping centres have evolved into lifestyle destinations. Entertainment and food & beverage now account for 30–35% of footfalls, helping malls remain resilient even as e-commerce grows. According to ANAROCK, leading malls record weekday footfalls of over 20,000, rising beyond 40,000 on weekends, underlining the sector’s robust demand dynamics.Although India has more than 600 operational malls, fewer than 100 meet institutional investment benchmarks, making quality assets fiercely competitive. This scarcity has sharpened global investor appetite.“With a portfolio of 19 malls housing over 1,000 brands and generating around ₹1,600 crore in annual NOI, the Nexus Select Trust REIT listing in 2023 established retail as a transparent, scalable and professionally managed asset class in India,” says Kejriwal. ANAROCK expects at least two more retail REITs to debut in the Indian market by 2030, further deepening institutional participation.Contrary to global fears, e-commerce has not weakened Indian malls. With online penetration still around 8%, far below the 20%-plus levels in the US and China, physical retail continues to play a central role. Brands are increasingly adopting a “phygital” approach, using offline stores for experience and trust-building while scaling digitally.Many direct-to-consumer brands report offline conversion rates that are two to three times higher than online, reinforcing the relevance of physical retail in India’s digital economy.From an investment perspective, Indian Grade-A malls typically deliver 14–18% internal rates of return, nearly double the yields available in many Western markets, according to ANAROCK. Stable rental escalations, revenue-sharing models linked to consumption growth, and consistently low vacancies provide investors with both yield visibility and long-term upside.“In the US and Europe, malls are battling oversupply, declining footfalls and online cannibalisation,” Kejriwal sums up. “India, in contrast, offers limited quality supply, rising incomes, heavy footfalls and rapid brand expansion.”ANAROCK data shows that retail leasing in India surged nearly 70% year-on-year in the first half of 2025, while new mall supply expanded by over 160%, reinforcing India’s position as one of the world’s most compelling retail real estate markets.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

[TITLE]The Key to Sarah Jessica Parker’s Holiday Looks This Year? Google’s Virtual Try-On Feature (Which Our Editors Tested Out):
[TEXT]

Real-life Carrie Bradshaw steps out into the snow-dusted NYC streets looking, naturally, flawless. One minute, Sarah Jessica Parker is tempted by a roasted nuts vendor. The next, she’s sitting in a cozy, “Ralph Lauren Christmas”–coded living room, typing into her phone the following prompt: “I’m shopping for an outfit that has a classic holiday New York City vibe, perfect for a friend’s downtown party.”

This isn’t a heart-to-heart with ChatGPT but a snippet of a campaign video depicting SJP’s latest obsession: Google Shopping’s AI–powered try-on tool that helps users not only pick out and shop for a spot-on getup across various occasions but also see how billions of apparel listings will look on their own bod (or that of their gift recipient) once the clothing in question is unwrapped and put on.

In the aforementioned campaign, shot by Chloe Horseman and directed by Max Bartick, Parker ends up settling on a bow-bedecked cocktail dress that we can easily imagine taking her from the holiday dinner to that downtown soirée in no time. She whizzes away in a taxi, carried by the spirit of Christmas, of course, but also the ease that comes with having your holiday outfit equations all figured out thanks to modern-day tech.

During our phone-call interview, I ask Parker if she thinks Google‘s innovation comes close to mimicking the je ne sais quoi of visiting a designer store in person — of touching each fabric, speaking to the sales reps, and catching a glimpse of your final, breathtaking look in the dressing-room mirror.

“I’m certain AI hasn’t been able to replicate that yet,” she tells WWD. “But all the in-between guesswork that happens [during online shopping] — like, ‘Does it suit my height and hair color? Will this be a good gift for somebody who’s a little taller than me?’ — will be cut out.”

Parker herself has had no shortage of online shopping–related disappointments in the past, caused by feeling “seduced,” as she says, by how something looks on a model, only to realize upon receiving the item that said model’s dimensions were wildly different from Parker’s own 5’3″ frame: effectively annulling its allure. Google, though, makes it easy to gauge the proportions of a given dress, pair of jeans, blouse, and anything else that’s piqued your interest on the internet recently.

There’s also an element of whimsy attached to it all. Per Parker, “[the technology] allows you to live in a fantasy” — dabbling in sartorial aesthetics that, to date, you’ve only been able to admire from afar.

I decided to trial the try-on feature myself, which proved to have a nonexistent learning curve. To initiate the process, I uploaded a full-length selfie to the online software, before choosing a body size for my mini-me (key to ensuring the state-of-the-art technology caters to your unique body type) and generating four stylized versions of myself wearing ‘fits spanning from a loafers-and-leather pants combo to an unlikely Canadian tuxedo mashup.

The next step was perusing through Google Shopping’s “Holiday Party Outfit” and “New Year’s Eve” edits, replete with trending styles like bubble-skirt sweater dresses, swathed-in-satin ones, and striking, cutout-clad maxi gowns. Clicking on the ones I fancied most allowed the platform to seamlessly transfer them onto my avatar, and the result was three distinct holiday ensembles that I don’t have in my closet (yet) but which seemed to come alive on my figure: no IRL trip to a label’s flagship location required.

Indeed, the visuals I got back were nothing if not natural, testament to the sophistication of Google’s latest. According to the company, its software “understands the human body and nuances of clothing — like how different materials fold, stretch and drape on different bodies,” all while “preserv[ing] these subtleties when applied to poses in your photos.”

If you so happen to find a look that’s “the one,” you can hit “Shop” next to your AI-generated image mockup — which allows Google to find the closest matching style that can actually be shopped. And if you’re trying on an already-shoppable offering (say, a festive, cropped cardi from Old Navy, Madewell’s bestselling pair of straight-leg jeans, or a softer-than-soft Ralph Lauren blazer), simply search for the “Try it on” icon on the product’s Google listing and watch as it’s fitted to you, as if by magic.

As for my interview subject’s advice on nailing the ideal cold-weather outfit? It’s not as prescriptive as you’d think (though Carrie Bradshaw would, no doubt, suggest something maximalist and Manolo Blahnik–based).

“I never tell anybody what is right or wrong or what they should or shouldn’t be wearing. In a million years, I would never,” Parker shares. “I would simply say to feel most like yourself.”

The star reveals that she’s usually “shy” in settings with a lot of people: “Bigger parties intimidate me, so I try to do anything I can to feel closer to myself when I’m out in the world, especially in social engagements.”

Other than that? Follow that one fashion vision you can’t get out of your head. “If you have a fantasy
