[TITLE]Ethan Allen Reports Fiscal 2026 First Quarter Results:

DANBURY, CT, Oct. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. (“Ethan Allen” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ETD), a leading interior design destination, today reported its results for the fiscal 2026 first quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Farooq Kathwari, Ethan Allen’s Chairman, President and CEO commented, “Despite many macroeconomic challenges, we were pleased to deliver retail segment written order growth and a strong gross margin during the just completed first quarter.

We generated strong operating cash flow of $16.8 million and ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $193.7 million, up $7.3 million from a year ago. We continued our history of returning capital to shareholders by paying $16.4 million in cash dividends, including $6.4 million in special cash dividends.

[TITLE]Customers advised of their rights amid expected delivery delays after company behind Fastway Couriers Ireland goes into receivership:
[TEXT]
Consumers have been advised of their rights by Ireland’s consumer and competition watchdog amid expected delivery delays after the company behind Fastway Couriers Ireland went into receivership.

The Nuvion Group, which includes Fastway Couriers Ireland, Parcel Connect and Nügo, confirmed yesterday evening that it went into receivership.

It is believed that up to 300 jobs are at risk, and the staff were notified yesterday evening.

In a statement yesterday, a spokesperson for the Nuvion Group said that delays and disruption is “envisaged”, and that the receivers will work with retailers to “minimise such delays”.

Inflation, rising operating costs and price pressures across the parcel market have made the business “no longer viable”, a spokesperson added.

Due to expected delays, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has reminded businesses and consumers that when a consumer orders something for delivery, their contract is with the retailer and not the courier.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the CCPC has advised that goods are the responsibility of the retailer until the buyer takes physical possession of the delivery.

"It is the retailer's responsibility to address any delay, damage or non-delivery. Orders should be delivered within 30 days unless otherwise agreed by the consumer and retailer,” it said.

Today's News in 90 Seconds, Wednesday, October 29

“If the delivery cannot be rearranged within a suitable period, or where the delivery of the goods is no longer appropriate in the circumstances, consumers have the right to cancel their order due to non-delivery and receive a full refund, including delivery fees. The retailer must refund the consumer within 14 days.

“Exceptions apply in cases where the consumer has independently engaged a courier; the retailer is then not responsible for delivery.”

Minister for Social Protection Dara Calleary said supports are available to workers and affected contractors at The Nuvion Group.

“Following the announcement from The Nuvion Group, my thoughts are with the workers and their families who are dealing with the uncertainty arising from this difficult news,” he said.

“My department has already been in contact to offer information on the supports that are available to assist employees of The Nuvion Group and other who may be affected over the coming months.

“These include a range of income supports, and assistance to move to alternative employment, or to access appropriate education, training, and development options.

“The new Jobseeker’s Pay-Related Benefit, which we introduced in March, is available to employees who lose their job and meet the eligibility conditions.

“This scheme provides a maximum weekly payment of €450 which can help people while they seek new employment.

“The easiest and quickest way to apply for a jobseeker's payment is online at MyWelfare.ie, which provides safe, convenient online access to social welfare services.”

[TITLE]Trump 'losing' trade war with China going in to Xi meeting, Senate Democrats say in report:
[TEXT]
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during a Senate Finance Committee hearing in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on April 8, 2025 in Washington, DC.

President Donald Trump is "losing a self-inflicted trade war" with China, leaving the United States with a "weak hand" going into his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Senate Democrats said Wednesday in a new report on the effects of Trump's wide-ranging tariffs.

"Trump's trade wars have imposed significant costs" on U.S. consumers and businesses and "sold out American farmers," and the president "has strengthened China's hand while weakening America's leverage," the report says.

CNBC received the report by Democrats on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs a day before Trump is set to meet Xi in South Korea.

Trump is "putting America's long-term prosperity and security at risk," Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in a statement to CNBC.

"Trump needs to change course on his trade war with China now and stop hurting American families, farmers, and businesses," Warren said.

Warren's comments came before Trump, speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, said he was optimistic

[TITLE]Dollar Climbs as Global Trade Tensions Ease:
[TEXT]
The dollar index (DXY00) today is up by +0.18%. The dollar is climbing today on easing global trade tensions, which are supportive of economic growth prospects. The US and South Korea finalized a trade deal today that will see South Korea make $150 billion in shipbuilding investments and cap US tariffs on South Korean goods at 15%. Also, President Trump said he expects to lower tariffs on Chinese goods over the fentanyl crisis.

Gains in the dollar are limited amid expectations that the FOMC will cut interest rates by 25 bp later today and possibly end quantitative tightening. The dollar remains under pressure from the ongoing US government shutdown. The longer the shutdown is maintained, the more likely the US economy will suffer and the more likely the Fed will have to cut interest rates.

US Sep pending home sales were unchanged m/m, weaker than expectations of a +1.2% m/m increase.

The markets are discounting a 100% chance that the FOMC at the end of today’s 2-day meeting will announce a -25 bp rate cut in its federal funds target range to 3.75%-4.00%. Assuming the Fed proceeds with this week’s -25 bp rate cut, the markets are then discounting an 88% chance of another -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on December 9-10. The markets are discounting an overall 115 bp rate cut by the end of 2026 to 2.95% from the current effective federal funds rate of 4.10%.

The FOMC at this week’s meeting is not scheduled to release a Summary of Economic Projections, which contains the Fed’s dot plot. That means the markets today will hear from Fed Chair Powell at his regular post-meeting press conference but will not receive an update from other Fed officials on their views

Each ADS represents the right to receive five Ordinary Shares of the Company.

Under the ATM Program, and in accordance with the provisions of Article L.225-138 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and pursuant to the 25th resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 11, 2025, 10,714,300 new Ordinary Shares (underlying 2,142,860 new ADSs) will be issued through a capital increase without preferential subscription rights of the shareholders reserved to specific categories of persons fulfilling certain characteristics (the “ATM Issuance”), at an at-the-market price of $14.00 per ADS (i.e., a subscription price per Ordinary Share of €2.4063 based on the USD/EUR exchange rate of $1.1636 for €1, as published by the European Central Bank on October 29, 2025) and each ADS giving the right to receive 5 Ordinary Shares of the Company, representing a discount, which discount primarily reflects trading fluctuations between Nasdaq and Euronext Paris, as well as foreign exchange effects, of 4.89% to the last closing price of the Company’s shares on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (“Euronext Paris”) preceding the setting of the issue price (i.e., €2.53).

HOUSTON, Oct. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Whitestone REIT (NYSE: WSR) (“Whitestone” or the “Company”) today announced its operating and financial results for the third quarter and year-to-date of 2025.

Today management is reiterating its intention to extend that track record. Whitestone has also moved its Green Street portfolio Trade Area Power (TAP) score up by the greatest percentage versus its peer set over the past 3 years as growth within Texas and Arizona pairs with Whitestone’s capital recycling program to enhance our property values and value for our shareholders.”

[TITLE]Alamos Gold Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
All amounts are in United States dollars, unless otherwise stated.

TORONTO, Oct. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alamos Gold Inc. (TSX:AGI; NYSE:AGI) (“Alamos” or the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

“We delivered a number of new financial records in the third quarter including record free cash flow of $130 million, while continuing to fund our high-return growth projects. This was driven by a further increase in production to 141,700 ounces and significant margin expansion,” said John A. McCluskey, President and Chief Executive Officer.

“Given unplanned downtime of the Magino mill at the end of September, and lower expected underground grades from Island Gold due to a seismic event in October, we are revising our 2025 production guidance lower by approximately 6%. These challenges are short-term and are not reflective of our strong outlook, nor our long-term track record. We expect a significant improvement starting in the fourth quarter with an 18% increase in production, and a 5% decrease in costs,” Mr. McCluskey added.

Third Quarter 2025 Operational and Financial Highlights

Produced 141,700 ounces of gold, a 3% increase from the second quarter of 2025 reflecting stronger performances from both Mulatos and the Island Gold District. Third quarter production was slightly below the low end of quarterly guidance of 145,000 ounces, reflecting one week of unplanned downtime within the Magino mill due to a capacitor failure within the electrical house, which occurred during the last week of September

Subsequent to quarter end, a seismic event occurred underground at Island Gold on October 17th. Mining activities continue at budgeted rates; however, this has delayed access to higher grade stopes in one mining front. As a result, grades mined are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter than budgeted. Combined with the unplanned downtime at the end of September at the Magino mill, the Company is updating its 2025 production guidance to a range of 560,000 to 580,000 ounces, a 6% decrease from original guidance (based on the mid-point)

Fourth quarter production is expected to increase 18% (based on the mid-point) to between 157,000 and 177,000 ounces, the strongest quarter of the year, reflecting a substantial improvement across all three operations

Generated record free cash flow 1 of $130.3 million, while continuing to reinvest in high-return growth projects including the Phase 3+ Expansion, Lynn Lake, and PDA. This was a 54% increase from the second quarter of 2025, reflecting strong contributions from all three operations. At current gold prices, the Company expects strong ongoing free cash flow generation through the remainder of 2025, with significant growth starting in 2026 reflecting higher production and lower costs

At current gold prices, the Company expects strong ongoing free cash flow generation through the remainder of 2025, with significant growth starting in 2026 reflecting higher production and lower costs Sold 136,473 ounces of gold at an average realized price of $3,359 per ounce, generating record quarterly revenues of $462.3 million. The average realized gold price was below the London PM Fix price, reflecting the delivery of 12,346 ounces into the gold prepayment facility executed in July 2024 based on the prepaid price of $2,524 per ounce. The Company delivered 75% of the committed ounces under the facility during the first nine months of 2025

Cash flow from operating activities increased to a record $265.3 million (including $275.3 million before changes in working capital and taxes paid1, or $0.65 per share), a 33% increase from the second quarter of 2025 reflecting strong margin expansion through higher gold prices and lower costs

Total cash costs 1 of $973 per ounce were 9% lower than the second quarter of 2025 and in-line with quarterly guidance. All-in sustaining costs ("AISC") 1 of $1,375 per ounce decreased 7% from the second quarter of 2025, driven by the stronger operational performance at the Mulatos District. The Company is reporting total cash costs and AISC excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments for the revaluation of previously issued share-based compensation. This provides a better representation of the total costs associated with producing an ounce of gold and eliminates volatility associated with mark-to-market adjustments. Prior year periods have been updated to reflect these changes retrospectively. Mark-to-market adjustments to share-based instruments impact both total cash costs and AISC given the Company allocates these costs to mining and processing costs and share-based compensation expense in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements

Pharmaceuticals: Revenue from products in the third quarter of 2025 was $37.7 million compared with $39.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting lower sales volumes in certain international operations primarily due to the timing of customer orders and product mix, partially offset by an increase in Rayaldee sales. Revenue from sales of Rayaldee was $7.5 million compared with $5.8 million in the comparable prior-year period. Revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other was $18.8 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared with $13.2 million in the 2024 period.

Diagnostics: Revenue from services in the third quarter of 2025 was $95.2 million compared with $121.3 million in the prior-year period, with the decrease primarily due to lower clinical test volume principally as a result of the sale of certain BioReference assets in 2024, partially offset by higher clinical test reimbursement rates. Total costs and expenses, net of the gain on the sale of assets in both periods, were $13.6 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared with $62.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to the assets sold and continued cost-reduction initiatives at BioReference. Operating income was $81.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, which included $4.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense, compared with $58.5 million in the 2024 period, which included $6.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense. The third quarter of 2025 included revenue of $19.5 million and costs and expenses of $25.2 million from the oncology assets that were sold to Labcorp on September 15, 2025.

Target's merchants and designers have drawn inspiration from traveling to rodeos, ski lodges and college campuses. Some of the retailer's fall accessories have western accents, such as purses with fringe and cowgirl-inspired hats. Melissa Repko | CNBC

MINNEAPOLIS — When shoppers browse Target 's aisles this fall, they will see purses with fringe accents, dresses made of suede-inspired fabrics and hats with a cowgirl flair. As winter comes, they'll find cozy sweaters with a ski lodge spin. Target's creative team has traveled the world to find inspiration for its brands, from a rodeo in Colorado to ski lodges in the French Alps and restaurants in New York's Hudson Valley. With global trips, an artificial intelligence-powered tool and sharper critiques of its own merchandise, the big-box retailer wants to get back to its roots: designing attention-grabbing, fashion-forward clothing and home decor at an affordable price. Target's merchandise was once a competitive advantage, but even the company admits it has lost that edge. The big-box retailer's sales have declined in some categories that it's best known for, such as home goods, as competitors lure away customers. As consumers' enthusiasm for Target's offerings has faded, annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and the company expects sales to decline this year. Shares of Target have tumbled

[TITLE]Adidas’ Record-Breaking Q3: How Long Can Sales Success Go On?:
[TEXT]
This story was updated at 6.14 p.m. EST.

BERLIN – After just three years in the job, Adidas chief executive Bjorn Gulden has almost achieved the goals of his initial four-year plan — one year ahead of schedule.

When he took on the job in 2023, Adidas was suffering financially because of a canceled collaboration, the very profitable Yeezy line, with the musician formerly known as Kanye West. In 2025, Gulden said he wanted Adidas to be a “healthy company” by 2026.

On Wednesday, the German sportswear giant announced record-breaking results for the third quarter of 2025, with sales revenues growing 12 percent in currency neutral terms to 6.63 billion euros and operating profit increasing 23 percent to 736 million euros.

The sales are the highest Adidas has ever notched up in a quarter and the operating margin for the first nine months of the year is now at 10.1 percent, just slightly above the 10 percent margin Gulden was targeting. The results were in line with market expectations, as Adidas had released preliminary results last week.

The company also raised guidance for the full year. It now expects currency-neutral revenues will increase around 9 percent and operating profit will come in at

[TITLE]VF’s Q2 Was Solid, but Investors Have a Vans Concern:
[TEXT]
Does VF Corp. have a third-quarter problem?

Investors think so. VF’s second quarter bested Wall Street’s consensus estimates, but investors sent shares of VF down 12.2 percent to $14.58 at market close on Tuesday.

For the three months ended Sept. 27, VF posted net income of $189.8 million, or 48 cents a diluted share, up from net income of $52.2 million, or 13 cents, in the same year-ago period. Revenue rose 1.6 percent to $2.80 billion from $2.76 billion. Wall Street was expecting adjusted diluted earnings per share, or EPS, of 42 cents on revenue of $2.73 billion.

By brand, revenue for The North Face rose 6 percent to $1.16 billion, Vans was down 9 percent to $606.9 million, Timberland was up 7 percent to $506.4 million, and for VF’s other brands — Altra, Icebreaker, Napapijri, Packs and Smartwool — it was up 2 percent to $532.3 million.

Wall Street’s consensus for the third quarter calls for adjusted diluted EPS of 55 cents on revenue of $2.87 billion. In comparison, VF for the three months ended Dec. 28, 2024, posted adjusted diluted EPS of 62 cents on revenue of $2.8 billion.

According to BTIG analyst Janine Stichter, the problem was the “relatively unchanged underlying trend for Vans.” Management noted some encouraging signs, including a better-than-expected back-to-school performance, but questions remain over how much longer the turnaround strategy would need to take hold. Stichter noted that third-quarter profit was guided below consensus due to tariff headwinds of $60 million to $70 million in the second half.

“Even in light of recent challenges at Vans, we believe VFC’s stable of brands is solid, and we like the diversification efforts afforded by a portfolio strategy,” Stichter said. “While we view Vans more as a brand in need of reinvigoration than a complete overhaul, we expect this to be a lengthy process, especially in light of the lead times to impact product, a challenged macro, tariff headwinds, and the need to clean up distribution.”

Dana Telsey, chief investment officer at Telsey Advisory Group, described VF’s second-quarter report as “solid.” The outdoor segment saw 4 percent growth, while the active business is still under pressure as the “Vans turnaround remains a work-in-progress,” she said.

VF president and CEO Bracken P. Darrell told investors in a conference call that the company made progress on its turnaround in a difficult climate.

He said that for The North Face brand, all three regions — Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and APAC (Asia-Pacific) — grew compared with year-ago levels, as well as wholesale and direct-to-consumer. Performance apparel drove momentum in core styles, while transitional outerwear was strong and footwear continued to gain traction, growing by double digits in every region.

Timberland also saw growth across both wholesale and DTC. The CEO said demand for the 6-inch premium boot represents only about “20 percent of our global revenue,” indicating that there’s opportunity for growth, whether “through colors, materials, innovations, collaborations and more,” while VF grows the brand “across other footwear and apparel categories.”

He said the recently launched Timberland 25, a lightweight version of the boot, “has been resonating well in its early weeks in our stores.” And Darrell added that the brand’s growing business around boat shoes also saw sales growth in all regions, noting plans to “diversify the product lineup and give the brand more versatility of fire power during the warmer seasons.”

As for Vans, Darrell said: “I told you that Sun’s impact on product could be visible in the back-to-school period, and it is. Product newness across footwear is drawing in new consumers, particularly women, but also youth and kids.” Michelle “Sun” Choe joined Vans as global brand president in July 2024.

The brand made waves this fall with the Valentino Garavani x Vans collaboration, which took the latter’s Authentic silhouette and reimagined it under the direction of Valentino‘s current creative director, Alessandro Michele. Darrell said newness in the Old Skool franchise drove higher sales of women’s styles. The CEO said more newness is on the way heading into holiday and spring 2026.

The company also said in September that it was selling Dickies to Blue Star Alliance for $600 million. VF will use the proceeds to pay down debt.

[TITLE]ChatGPT teams up with PayPal to make it easier for you to buy stuff in chat:
[TEXT]
PayPal recently signed a contract with OpenAI to integrate the digital wallet into ChatGPT, reports CNBC. This will allow users to easily pay for the products they discover via the AI tool.

The agreement allows PayPal users to make payments via ChatGPT and merchants to list and sell their goods in ChatGPT. OpenAI is apparently taking a big step towards turning ChatGPT into an e-commerce platform and hoping that ChatGPT’s approximately 700 million weekly active users will use the AI as a kind of “personal shopper.”

OpenAI previously announced that it would enable payments via Walmart, Shopify, and Etsy in the US via Instant Checkout. Conversely, PayPal is trying to skillfully position itself alongside leading AI providers, including Google and Perplexity.
