Renewable energy company Low Carbon has gained a significant investment from CVC DIF, aimed at driving the next stage of the company’s growth.

The CVC DIF investment, together with additional funding from current shareholder MassMutual, as well as the refinancing of existing project finance debt and a new holdco facility, brings the company’s total committed capital to around £1.1bn ($1.45bn).

Low Carbon said that the new investment from CVC DIF will support the delivery of several gigawatts of renewable energy.

This capital injection is intended to enable Low Carbon to support its transition into a diversified independent power producer, contributing to the ongoing energy transition in the UK and Europe.

CVC DIF’s primary equity investment, which includes both common and preferred shares, will result in a majority controlling stake in Low Carbon.

According to Low Carbon, the UK government’s Clean Power 2030 plan, announced last year, which includes doubling onshore wind capacity and tripling solar photovoltaic (PV), requires £40bn of annual investment.

In parallel, the EU has set a new renewable energy target of 42.5%.

The partnership between CVC DIF, its investors, and Low Carbon is expected to position the company to play a central role in delivering clean and affordable electricity across these regions.

Low Carbon currently manages a 16GW pipeline and has 1GW of highly contracted operational and in-construction assets.

The latest capital is said to support growth in key markets such as the UK, Germany, and Poland, where the company plans to bring a 3GW portfolio of operational utility-scale solar, battery storage, onshore wind, and colocated assets online in the coming years.

Low Carbon said that MassMutual, which formed a strategic collaboration with the company in 2021, remains a significant shareholder and will continue supporting the company’s growth with further investment.

MassMutual will collaborate with CVC DIF to expedite the development of Low Carbon’s renewables pipeline.

The CVC DIF investment will be made through DIF Infrastructure VIII and is expected to close this year, contingent on customary closing conditions.

Evercore served as the adviser to Low Carbon on the transaction.

Low Carbon chief executive and founder Roy Bedlow said: “I would like to thank CVC DIF and their investors for the confidence they have placed in Low Carbon and our ability to develop, build and operate high-quality renewable assets in the UK and Europe.

“In addition, MassMutual’s continued investment in Low Carbon underlines our shared ambition of delivering long-term value across the full investment cycle of renewables that will help accelerate our goal to deploy renewable energy at scale to help tackle climate change.”

[TITLE]Geothermal networks let cities warm and cool as one:
[TEXT]
Troy in New York state is one of the first cities to use an innovative type of heat pump.Credit: TW Farlow/Getty

The half-a-dozen nineteenth-century commercial buildings huddled beside the Hudson River that make up an arts centre in Troy, New York, are destined for a distinctly twenty-first-century energy makeover. The same goes for an apartment building across the street and a department store-turned-technology hub a few blocks away.

The plan — hatched by Troy’s economic-development office to revitalize the downtown area and now driven by regional utility company National Grid — is to combine the buildings’ heating and cooling systems in a single high-efficiency, low-carbon network. The hope is that more buildings will join the scheme before the thermal network begins operating in 2027. Ultimately, it might wean all of the Central Troy Historic District off natural gas.

Heat pumps installed in the buildings will do most of the work. But these are not the same heat pumps commonly used to maintain the temperature of individual homes and businesses. Those devices warm indoor spaces by extracting heat from cold air, and cool them by pushing heat out into already hot air. In Troy, a once-prosperous industrial city

[TITLE]Private Equity Circles Big Oil’s Pipelines as Majors Hunt for Cash:
[TEXT]
The world’s biggest private equity groups are investing in infrastructure assets of the national oil companies of the Middle East as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) opened their pipeline networks to foreign capital.

Private equity giants are now seeking a slice of the infrastructure assets of the international majors in deals that would give Big Oil funds to reinvest in oil and gas production. These days, amid lower oil prices and continued reluctance of public-market investors despite the dramatic shift in the ESG narrative, private equity money could be an opportunity for the top Western majors to raise cash by selling parts of their pipeline and storage assets.

The infrastructure deals in the oil and gas sector began from the Middle East, but these could spread to the international majors, which need capital to sustain dividends and buybacks at $60 oil and have enough to invest in boosting oil and gas production.

Investors Eye Big Oil’s Infrastructure Assets

Investors have recently urged top executives from ExxonMobil, BP, TotalEnergies, and Eni to consider selling stakes in pipeline and storage assets to private equity groups in what would be a new way for Big Oil to monetize their infrastructure assets and one that doesn’t involve equity-market investors.

Ahead of ADIPEC, one of the energy industry’s top gatherings, private equity teams sat down at a closed-door meeting with Exxon, BP, TotalEnergies, and Eni and told their executives that they could offload more of their infrastructure assets, the Financial Times reports.

[TITLE]UK Windfall Tax Blamed for Further North Sea Job Losses:
[TEXT]
Around 100 offshore jobs are set to be cut by oil and gas firm Harbour Energy amid pressure from UK windfall taxes.

The company, which is the UK’s largest oil and gas producer, has announced the proposed job losses as part of a review into its operations in this country.

In a statement, managing director Scott Barr said the process is necessary to make sure its UK business “remains competitive as we continue to adapt to a challenging future”.

Harbour Energy added it has come under pressure from lower commodity prices and an “uncompetitive tax regime”.

The business also said this situation has worsened after the Labour government opted to retain the energy profits levy in last week’s Budget.

North Sea jobs at risk because of windfall taxes

If the job cuts go ahead, the move will mean that Harbour will have axed around 700 jobs since the tax was introduced in 2022.

This includes around 250 onshore job losses in Scotland earlier this year.

The windfall tax was brought in by the previous Conservative government and then extended after Labour came to power last year.

The levy, which is expected to stay in place until 2030, means that operators hand around 78 per cent of their profits to the Treasury.

Harbour said the job losses will follow a consultation period, which is likely to conclude in the first quarter of 2026.

Mr Barr said: “The offshore reorganisation is a necessary step to align our operating model with reduced activity and production levels in the UK, accelerated by the retention of the energy profits levy (EPL), while maintaining our commitment to safety and regulatory standards.

“Harbour’s UK business unit will continue to struggle to compete for capital within our global portfolio while the EPL remains.

“The future structure of our offshore workforce must adapt to reflect these realities.

“While we must deliver this essential change, we recognise the next few months will be difficult for colleagues.”

[TITLE]Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq rise as weak ADP jobs data reinforces growing Fed rate cut bets:
[TEXT]
US stocks edged up on Wednesday as a surprise decline in private-sector employment revealed cracks in the job market, but also reinforced bets on a Fed rate cut next week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.9%, or over 400 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed 0.2% after the major gauges finished Tuesday with gains across the board.

The ADP report looked to add fuel to the rate-cut fire, as nearly 90% of bets sit on a quarter-point reduction from the Federal Reserve next week. Private employers shed 32,000 jobs in November, compared with expectations for a modest gain. ADP said the decline was driven primarily by a sharp pullback from small businesses.

Meanwhile, from the Institute for Supply Management showed US services activity expanded slightly in November to a reading of 52.6%, while the index for prices paid eased to a seven-month low in a potentially positive sign for inflation. The next official update on consumer prices — the PCE print due Friday — is playing catch-up from September.

Elsewhere, bitcoin (BTC-USD) extended its bid to bounce back from a deep, weeks-long slump that pulled the token below $83,000 in recent days. The leading cryptocurrency rose to a two-week high above $93,000 on Wednesday before retracing some of its gains.

Microsoft (MSFT) helped spur an early decline in tech stocks, and its shares ended down 2.5% after The Information reported that the software giant is lowering its AI sales quotas. That appeared to reignite investor skepticism around AI demand. Leading semiconductor stocks retreated, with Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) dropping, among others.

On the earnings front, Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock climbed nearly 8% after the US chipmaker's upbeat sales outlook and deal to buy Celestial AI. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) surged 15% after the retailer's strong start to the holiday shopping season.

Salesforce (CRM) results are on Wednesday's docket after the bell.

[TITLE]Calystron Capital Announces Strategic Global Expansion Across Europe and Asia:
[TEXT]
DENVER, Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Calystron Capital today announced a new phase of international expansion, marking an important milestone in the firm’s long-term vision to build a global investment presence supported by advanced technology and cross-market expertise. This initiative centers on deepening the firm’s footprint in Europe—particularly in Spain and Germany—while simultaneously accelerating entry into key Asian markets including Singapore and Japan. Together, these regions represent growing financial hubs with increasing investor demand, regulatory openness to innovation, and strong alignment with Calystron Capital’s technology-driven investment philosophy.

Christopher Ellington, Chief Investment Advisor of Calystron Capital, emphasized that globalization is not only a strategic choice but a natural extension of the firm’s core competencies. With more than thirty years of experience across major financial centers, Ellington noted that global markets are becoming increasingly interconnected, making cross-regional diversification a requirement rather than an option. “Our clients need access to opportunities beyond their home markets,” Ellington said. “Global allocation is no longer optional. It is essential for risk management, resilience, and long-term performance. A truly modern investment architecture must operate across borders.”

Calystron Capital’s expansion is anchored by two defining advantages. The first is the firm’s technology-driven investment infrastructure, which integrates the Calystron Quant Framework™ with the Calystron AI Trading System™. Together, these systems generate data-rich strategies, multi-market liquidity intelligence, high-frequency analytics, and adaptive execution models capable of responding to rapidly shifting environments. This technological backbone allows the firm to monitor global capital flows, cross-asset behavior, and macroeconomic transitions with precision, enabling more sophisticated portfolio construction for clients across diverse regions.

The second advantage lies in Calystron Capital’s approach to combining localized expertise with global oversight. By establishing specialized teams in European and Asian markets, the firm aims to directly understand local investor behavior, evolving regulations, and emerging sector opportunities—while still applying the disciplined standards and risk framework developed in the U.S. institutional market. This blend of local insight and international perspective is designed to create a more robust, diversified investment ecosystem that can adapt to global and regional cycles alike.

As part of its global strategy, Calystron Capital also intends to guide U.S. investors toward broader international diversification—especially in fast-growing European and Asian industries—while helping international investors gain access to the depth, liquidity, and stability of U.S. capital markets. According to Ellington, this two-way flow of capital is becoming increasingly important. “We want to build a bridge between markets,” he said. “Our role is to help clients navigate that bridge with clarity, discipline, and intelligent technology. The future of capital management lies in global mobility and intelligent allocation.”

Looking ahead, the firm expects its expansion to accelerate over the coming year as new research hubs, trading nodes, and advisory teams begin operations across Europe and Asia. With technology and financial expertise serving as its dual engines, Calystron Capital aims to position itself as a central connector between intelligent capital and the world’s major financial regions, shaping a future where innovation and global access define long-term wealth creation.

[TITLE]Triodos Bank plans to finance 275 energy transition projects by 2030:
[TEXT]
Triodos Bank’s new four-pillar strategy marks the first time the bank has unified its climate and biodiversity ambitions. Credit: Manuel Esteban/Shutterstock.com.

Triodos Bank has unveiled its first integrated Climate & Nature Strategy, announcing a comprehensive approach to accelerate the energy transition, reduce financed emissions and increase investment in nature-based solutions.

The Triodos Bank energy transition strategy, ‘Dare to Act. Now.’, sets out measurable targets to drive climate and biodiversity action by 2030.

Triodos Bank’s new four-pillar strategy marks the first time the bank has unified its climate and biodiversity ambitions.

The plan includes a commitment to cut absolute financed emissions by at least 42% by 2030, up from the 32% target set in 2022.

The focus is on three key activities that together account for 90% of the bank’s emissions footprint: business loans, mortgages, and listed equities and bonds managed by Triodos Investment Management.

Another pillar of the Triodos Bank energy transition strategy is the financing of 275 energy transition projects over the next five years. The bank aims to support next-generation, decentralised and community-led solutions, building on its “strong track record” in renewable energy finance.

[TITLE]The EV Truck Reality Check and Why Edison Motors’ Hybrid Might Be What Actually Works:
[TEXT]
The infrastructure problem is fundamental. Charging a passenger EV at home overnight is one thing. Charging Class 8 trucks that need megawatt-level power to recharge massive battery banks in timeframes that don’t obliterate productivity is something else entirely. The US doesn’t have that infrastructure. Building it requires grid upgrades, utility coordination, real estate acquisition, and capital investment measured in billions. Nobody figured out how to fund that at scale, so we’re left with announced initiatives, pilot programs, and scattered charging stations that don’t add up to functional networks.

The United States took the opposite approach. Throw tax credits at manufacturers, announce ambitious electrification targets, mandate technology adoption timelines, and assume infrastructure and economics will somehow sort themselves out. It’s the regulatory equivalent of throwing EVs at the wall to see what sticks, and, surprise, most of it didn’t stick.

The UK’s relative success with commercial EVs didn’t happen by accident. They coordinated between government, utilities, fleet operators, and charging infrastructure providers before pushing mandates. They built charging networks that match operational needs. They focused deployment in applications where current technology actually works, shorter hauls, predictable routes, and operations that return to base for overnight charging. They planned the rollout based on what the technology could do rather than what they wished it could do.

But before we get to Edison, let’s talk

[TITLE]247Solar launches $25 million Series B round to scale around-the-clock industrial heat and electricity for C&I sector:
[TEXT]
GREAT FALLS, Va. , Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247Solar, the MIT-born innovator of clean, always-on industrial heat plus electricity for commercial and industrial customers, today announced the launch of a $25 million Series B capital raise.

Aimed at accelerating project deployment and advancing 247Solar’s breakthrough solution to global markets, the round has already secured $3.5 million from existing investors, with additional commitments under active due diligence.

The new funding will help the company advance its $250M active pipeline on six continents that includes a Top-20 global utility, off-grid mining operations, and other applications.

The Company has retained MaxEn Capital Advisors to advise on the offering. MaxEn Capital Advisors has a long history of providing technical and financial consulting in the energy space, with expertise in project finance, project development and capital structuring.

“With it’s unique ability to decarbonize high-temperature industrial heat while also providing clean electricity, 247Solar addresses one of the biggest challenges of all in industrial decarbonization,” says Howard Margulis, MaxEn’s Senior Managing Director. “We look forward to bringing the Company together with investors and funding sources that also realize the enormous potential of this technology.”

Solving industry’s hardest energy challenge

Industrial companies worldwide face the urgent need to decarbonize their energy use — without sacrificing reliability, cost, or performance. And 60% of industrial energy use across sectors is to produce heat, not power, typically by burning fossil fuels.

247Solar’s factory-built, modular system uniquely solves this challenge, harnessing the sun’s energy to offer highly reliable, high-temperature process heat and also around-the-clock clean electric power.

By addressing their power and heat needs simultaneously, customers can cut their energy bills by 25% or more and reduce carbon emissions by as much as 95%. In addition, 247Solar solutions typically increase reliability and improve performance.

247Solar solutions provide clean industrial heat and power around the clock. Artist conception: 247Solar

Funding use and next milestones

With origins at MIT and more than 40 patents globally, 247Solar’s next-generation platform has attracted attention across mining, data center, hydrogen, and desalination markets, as well as electric utilities.

The company’s pipeline and near-term projects span Africa, India, Europe, Australia, and South America, as well as North America — including emerging markets that tend to be forgotten — with project values from $5 million to over $500 million.

The Series B capital will fund:

Scaling of 247Solar’s energy-as-a-service model to de-risk projects for both investors and customers (build-own-operate, with long-term PPAs)

Driving cost reductions and mass production of core technologies

Bringing a new industrial thermal battery to market, to deliver both clean heat and electricity from PV, wind or the grid.

Advanced development of a new, larger 3.5 MW solution (versus the current 400 kW module), to be fully engineered by mid-2026 and ready for deployment in 2027

Expanding the company’s business development and commercial team to enter new markets

247Solar anticipates its industrial heat-plus-power technology to rapidly expand as the PV solar, battery energy storage, and wind energy markets have before.

A decisive moment for industrial energy capacity

“247Solar exists to close the industrial clean energy gap—by delivering reliability, cost-savings, and round-the-clock performance that PV solar alone can’t match,” said CEO Bruce Anderson. “With this Series B, we’re scaling what we believe will become the industry standard for decarbonizing the world’s toughest energy loads.”
