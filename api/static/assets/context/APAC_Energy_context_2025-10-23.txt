[TITLE]Diwali 2024 To Diwali 2025: Silver Outshines Gold, Crude Gives Negative Returns:
[TEXT]
From one Diwali to the next, global commodity markets painted a contrasting picture. While precious metals glittered, energy prices dulled. Silver emerged as the top performer this Diwali, soaring 60% over the year to $52 per troy ounce, outpacing gold's 55% jump to $4,261 per ounce. The surge came on the back of strong investment demand and industrial use, particularly from the solar sector.

In sharp contrast, Brent crude oil slipped 17% to $61 a barrel, as global supplies remained elevated amid slowing demand growth. Industrial metals posted steady gains, with copper rising 12% to $10,604 per tonne and aluminium up 7% to $2,778 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange.

Among agri-commodities, coffee was the surprise outperformer, jumping 63% to $3.8 per pound, supported by tightening supply from key producing regions.

Equity markets across the world delivered strong dollar-denominated returns through the year. The S&P 500 climbed 17%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 11%, and Europe’s Euro Stoxx 50 advanced 25%. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 rose 23%, Hang Seng Index added 24%, and South Korea’s KOSPI led the rally with a 42% surge.

India, however, lagged global peers, with the Nifty 50 rising just 1.5% in dollar terms. Analysts attributed the underperformance to a weaker rupee, elevated valuations, and a moderation in earnings growth. Foreign investor flows were also diverted toward the US, Taiwan, and China, which offered better relative value.

Looking ahead to the new Samvat, analysts expect earnings momentum to strengthen in the second half of the fiscal. With the potential for one or two interest rate cuts, possible tax announcements, and short covering by foreign institutional investors, the outlook for Indian equities appears more optimistic than the year gone by.

MANILA, Philippines -- MANILA, Philippines (AP) — World shares skidded Friday following a retreat on Wall Street driven by concerns over banks’ loan portfolios.

The future for S & P 500 fell 1.3% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1%. Oil prices were lower while the price of gold climbed to over $4,383 an ounce, and was last trading at $4,356.50 per ounce, as Washington and Beijing swapped harsh words over trade.

In early European trading, a sell-off of bank and financial shares weighed on regional indexes. Germany's DAX slumped 2% to 23,783.64. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 1.5% to 9,293.24 while in Paris, the CAC 40 shed nearly 0.8% to 8,126.52.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.4% to 47,582.15, tracking U.S. losses. Uncertainty over the choice of a new prime minister has also weighed on investor sentiment.

Conservative lawmaker Sanae Takaichi was elected to head the ruling Liberal Democratic Party but last week's collapse of its coalition with the Buddhist-backed Komeito cast doubt over whether she would garner enough support in the lower house of parliament to prevail in a vote expected next week.

Takaichi has led efforts to form a new alliance with the Osaka-based Japan Innovation Party, which would improve her chances of becoming Japan's first female prime minister.

In Chinese markets, shares fell as trade tensions with Washington intensified. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slumped 2.5% to 25,247.10, while the Shanghai Composite index slid nearly 2% to 3,839.76.

Traders also remained cautious ahead of Monday's release of economic data and an important meeting of the ruling Communist Party leadership next week.

South Korea’s Kospi closed nearly flat at 3,748.89, erasing earlier gains amid optimism over progress in trade talks with the U.S.

Data released on Friday showed South Korea’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate slid to 2.5% in September from 2.6% in August.

Australia's S & P/ASX 200 lost 0.8% to 8,995.30, retreating from the previous day's record high. Energy and tech stocks led the decline.

Taiwan's Taiex dropped nearly 1.3% while in India, the Sensex rose 0.4%.

On Wall Street, stocks fell Thursday as worries flared over the financial health of midsized banks.

The S & P 500 slid 0.6% to 6,629.07, in its latest up-and-down day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7% to 45,952.24, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.5% to 22,562.54.

Salt Lake City-based Zions Bancorp. tumbled 13.1% after the bank said its profit for the third quarter will take a hit because of a $50 million charge-off related to loans made to a pair of borrowers. Zions said it found “apparent misrepresentations and contractual defaults” by the borrowers and several people who guaranteed the loans, along with other irregularities.

Another bank, Western Alliance Bancorp, dropped 10.8% after saying it has sued a borrower, alleging fraud. It also said it’s standing by its financial forecasts given for 2025.

Scrutiny is rising on the quality of loans that banks and other lenders have broadly made following last month’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing of First Brands Group, a supplier of aftermarket auto parts. The question is whether the hiccups are just a collection of one-offs or a signal of something larger threatening the industry.

“The Street’s been dining on rate cut and AI optimism for months, but this week the waiter brought something no one ordered: the return of the credit bogeyman,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

“Regional banks have become the canaries in the credit coal mine, and their chirping sounds suspiciously weak,” he said.

U.S. companies broadly are under pressure to deliver stronger profits after the S & P 500 surged 35% from a low in April. To justify those gains, which critics say made their stock prices too expensive, companies will need to show they’re making much more in profit and will continue to do so.

In other dealings on Friday, benchmark crude oil lost 61 cents to $56.85 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 64 cents to $60.42 per barrel.

The U.S. dollar fell to 149.70 Japanese yen from 150.44 yen. The euro rose to $1.1703 from $1.1688.
