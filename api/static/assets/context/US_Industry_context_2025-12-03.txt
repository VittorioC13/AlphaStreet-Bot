[TITLE]Catamaran Ventures to follow patient capital route in bets on India's manufacturing push:
[TEXT]
Billionaire N R Narayan Murthy's family office Catamaran Ventures plans to make more growth stage equity bets in manufacturing, a top executive at the firm said on Wednesday.

“Our thesis is based on the view that over the next 5-10 years in India, from a wealth and job creation perspective, the country needs to develop its supply chain for precision manufacturing," Deepak Padaki, president at Catamaran Ventures told Mint.

Murthy, a co-founder of information technology services bellwether Infosys Ltd, is chairman emeritus of Catamaran.

Over the last year, several funds have been deepening their focus on manufacturing as a sector, with some launching new funds to narrow down on the industry's potential. Much of this is backed by private equity and venture capital's belief that manufacturing and supply chain companies are going to be what pushes India to become an export-led economy.

“Themes like import substitution (for EMS), rising domestic consumption (for packaging, building materials) and India’s emergence as an export hub (for chemicals, auto, engineered solutions, aerospace and defense) are providing structural long-term impetus to companies," said Koushik Bhattacharyya, managing director and head of industrials investment banking at Mumbai investment bank Avendus Capital. (EMS is short for electronic manufacturing services.)

So far, Catamaran has two precision manufacturing investments: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker. Both companies are headed for IPOs.

Catamaran has so far made two investments in the manufacturing space, both of which are headed for the public markets: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker looking to raise up to Rs1,000 crore through an offer for sale. Catamaran has also invested in point-of-care medical diagnostics company Achira Labs.

The family office's sees supply chain manufacturing companies as not a good fit with typical venture capital bets given the long gestation period for such businesses. Most generalist VC funds look for exits in a five to six year horizon.

Manufacturing, which is considered a sub-sector of deeptech given the changing nature of the activity and patents around it, take as long as 10-15 years to come of some scale. For private equity to back such startups, on the other hand, they need them to be more mature businesses.

“We're more mid-market private equity when it comes to manufacturing. We thought about how we as a family office can put money into companies that is patient capital," said Padaki.

Sectors of opportunity

Catamaran is focused on a few areas within manufacturing: aerospace, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the electric vehicle space, medical devices and semiconductor companies.

The family office sees defence as “interesting" while on the lookout for companies that have achieved some scale and can be taken global — of which it has seen very few. Even on the aerospace side, apart from Aequs, despite Catamaran's desire to do more in the coming year, the pipeline is looking thin.

There's more action in electric vehicle OEMs, however. “There's a lot of small component manufacturers in places like NCR (Delhi region) and Coimbatore that are promoter-owned who are switching to EVs because we already have a strong base in auto component manufacturing," said Padaki. “We're more interested in EV supply chain components like motors, electronic systems, that kind of thing."

Catamaran is also looking to back battery recycling companies that are looking to claw back the rare earth materials used to make EV batteries.

In the electronics and semiconductor space, there are two burgeoning ends like a dumbbell. On the one end, there are plenty of startups but they're still very early in their journey, and on the other, there's fabrication companies which require very large investments to build out factories. Catamaran is scouting for those in the middle. “We're looking for companies that are in the semiconductor or data center space that are looking for growth capital support," said the Catamaran president.

Cheques from Catamaran would range from ₹50 crore to ₹250 crore and in some exceptional cases, the family office is willing to go up to ₹400-500 crore, especially when companies from outside India are looking to build joint-ventures for strategic partnerships in the country.

Previously, Catamaran had a joint venture with e-commerce behemoth Amazon back in 2014 called Cloudtail. In 2021, Amazon acquired the family office's stake due to stricter rules for e-commerce marketplaces with foreign investments.

The firm has traditionally been selective in how it makes investments and that's not changing going into 2026. "Our run rate is typically two to three investments, for which we have to look at 10-12 companies" said Padaki. “These are long gestation in terms of companies because we have to understand the promoters for some time to build relationships. Even next year, we're looking to do maybe two or three."

Manufacturing maturity in 2026

India saw some large deals by risk capital players in manufacturing this year. VIP Industries raised $206 million in a round led by Multiples. Euler Motors secured $75 million from GIC and British International Investments, while Scimplify raised $40 million in a deal led by Accel and Omnivore Partners. Rangsons Aerospace also raised capital in a round led by ValueQuest.

Many of the manufacturing startups that cropped up between 2018-2020 are also now on the lookout for their growth rounds. “Valuations need to see a shift," said Padaki. “The reason many of these companies don't get high valuations is because people don't understand that these are ROCE businesses and not growth-at-all-costs businesses."

ROCE stands for return on capital employed and is a ratio used to assess a company's profitability and capital efficiency, essentially giving insight into how well it is doing based on the money it is spending.

Aequs and SEDEMAC are both heading for the public markets and Catamaran hopes their debut will set the precedent for IPOs by other manufacturers. “Today, you don't have that many precedents of small promoter-owned companies that have suddenly gone public," Padaki said.

Given how the various themes are playing out across manufacturing and precision manufacturing, both venture capital and private equity players have their ears perked for companies that are growing sustainably. “While some near-term factors like tariff might lead to temporary uncertainty, we see large amounts of private capital entering this sector in the next 3-5 years," said Avendus' Bhattacharyya.

[TITLE]US Core Capital Goods Orders Surged in September, Pointing to Manufacturing Rebound:
[TEXT]
Demand for key capital goods made in America soared in September, with orders and shipments soaring, an indication that the pace of economic growth picked up in the third quarter.

Orders for non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, considered a proxy for business spending, rose 0.9 percent, matching the upwardly revised 0.9 percent increase a month earlier, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.

Economists had forecast a slowdown from the previously reported 0.4 percent growth in August to a rise of 0.2 percent in September. Shipments of core capital goods also rose 0.9 percent.

The durable goods report was delayed several weeks by the 43-day shutdown of the federal government that began in October.

Orders for raw metals and fabricated metals products rose at a very strong pace, indicating that U.S. metals tariffs have not sapped demand.

Orders for electronics and appliances rose 1.5 percent for the month. Year-to-date, orders are up five percent, which may indicate that tariffs are shifting demand from abroad to domestic manufacturers.

Motor vehicles and parts orders rose 0.4 percent.

Overall durable goods orders rose 0.5 percent, more than economists had forecast.

Orders for defense aircraft rose 30.9 percent. Orders for defense capital goods rose 23 percent.

The strength of durable goods orders suggests that the manufacturing sector in the U.S. is rebounding.

The government said on Tuesday that its report on third-quarter GDP would be released on December 23, nearly a month after the scheduled date. The report was delayed by the government shutdown. The economy grew at a 3.8 percent pace in the second quarter. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker suggests the economy is growing at a four percent pace in the third quarter, although the delay of many economic reports due to the shutdown raises questions about the accuracy of the nowcast.

[TITLE]Goldman Sachs to Acquire ETF Provider Innovator Capital Management:
[TEXT]
Goldman Sachs Asset Management L.P. announced Monday an agreement to acquire Innovator Capital Management LLC, an exchange-traded fund provider with $28 billion in assets under servicing. The $2 billion acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval.

Innovator provides defined outcome ETFs, also known as buffer ETFs, which GSAM described as the fastest-growing active ETF category. According to GSAM, the acquisition would expand the manager’s ETF lineup and future product road map. Defined outcome ETFs utilize derivatives to achieve specific objectives, such as downside protection during volatile periods.

“Having grown at 66% compound annual growth rate since 2020, defined outcome ETFs are a key component of the rapidly growing active ETF market, driven by the objective to deliver innovative structured strategies in accessible formats,” GSAM stated. “Investors are increasingly using defined outcome ETFs to add a broad and customizable range of objectives to their portfolios that meet their risk control needs and performance objectives.”

As of September 30, GSAM oversaw more than $75 billion in assets across more than 215 ETF strategies. The acquisition of Innovator will add 159 defined outcome ETFs to GSAM’s lineup. Innovator’s six employees, including its executive leadership, will join Goldman Sachs following the closing of the acquisition.

“Active ETFs are dynamic, transformative and have been one of the fastest-growing segments in today’s public investment landscape,” said David Solomon, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s chairman and CEO, in a statement. “By acquiring Innovator, Goldman Sachs will expand access to modern, world-class investment products for investor portfolios.”

[TITLE]Trade Finance Market Worth USD 95.74 Billion by 2030 Fueled by Blockchain and Digitization, with APAC Leading the Growth, Reports Mordor Intelligence:
[TEXT]
Hyderabad, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hyderabad, India, December 2025: According to Mordor Intelligence, the trade finance market size is valued at USD 80.64 billion in 2025 and is projected to rise to USD 95.74 billion by 2030, growing at a 3.49% CAGR. The sector is steadily shifting toward digital and open-account solutions, while letters of credit remain essential where transaction risks are higher. Regulatory advances such as MLETR and increased blockchain use are easing documentation challenges and strengthening confidence in receivables-based instruments. At the same time, tightening geopolitics is reshaping trade routes and increasing pressure on institutions to enhance AML compliance.

Regional Market Overview

Asia-Pacific continues to strengthen its position in trade finance, supported by a solid manufacturing base and rising adoption of digital trade systems. Singapore’s push for electronic trade documents is improving lender confidence, Japan’s coordinated industry digitization is gaining traction, China’s infrastructure initiatives continue to drive financing activity, and India’s export-focused policies are increasing demand for pre-shipment credit.

North America remains influential due to the strength of the U.S. dollar and a mature fintech ecosystem. Recent regulatory clarity around digital settlement is helping streamline cross-border payments. Mexico’s increasing role in nearshoring is lifting the need for working-capital funding, while Canadian institutions are leveraging regional trade insights to offer more competitive receivables financing.

Key Market Insights

Global Trade Flows Gain Momentum Despite Disruptions

Global shipping activity continues to push forward even amid sanctions, rerouted vessels, and higher freight costs. Countries like Vietnam and Mexico are benefiting as companies diversify their sourcing to manage geopolitical risks. With buyers holding more buffer inventory, demand for supply-chain finance is rising, and banks are increasingly combining trade-credit insurance with receivables programs. As overall trade expands, more businesses become eligible for financing, helping gradually ease funding gaps across emerging Asian markets.

Digital Trade Tools Gain Traction Across Global Networks

Digital systems and blockchain-backed platforms are reshaping how trade documents move between banks and corporates. Faster verification cycles and tokenized assets are opening new ways to fund receivables and improve liquidity. But with many platforms operating in isolation, companies still face heavy integration work to connect their systems. As a result, shared standards and interoperability frameworks are becoming essential for scaling digital trade solutions across markets.

[TITLE]MF1 Capital Supplies $62M Construction Takeout for Gowanus Resi Tower:
[TEXT]
Borough Developers has sealed $62 million of takeout construction financing for a newly completed multifamily development in Gowanus, Brooklyn, Commercial Observer has learned.

MF1 Capital provided the loan for the development firm’s 11-story The Baltic Canal apartment building at 526 Baltic Street. The deal retires a previous construction loan from BridgeCity Capital for the 99-unit property in an area along the Gowanus Canal that was rezoned in 2021 to enable denser development.

Landstone Capital Group arranged the takeout construction loan with a team led by Leah Paskus and Shlomy Wertzberger. Michael Squires and Ben Rosenberg represented MF1 in the deal, which closed last week.

The Baltic Canal will feature studio to two-bedroom apartment options with a portion of the units designated as affordable under the state’s expired 421a tax abatement program. Community amenities include a fitness center, a yoga studio, a sauna, a coworking lounge, a media room and a game room.

MF1 Capital and Borough Developers did not immediately return requests for comment.

Aerospace companies set to get more capital market support as reusable rockets make headway

Global Times

By Chu Daye Published: Nov 28, 2025 10:46 PM

Six Chinese commercial aerospace companies had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus from June 18 to November 27, the Securities Daily reported on Friday, amid faster growth in China's commercial aerospace sector and launches being scheduled for several reusable carrier rockets in the coming months.

Chinese industry insiders and financial experts said more commercial aerospace companies are set to receive further support from the capital market as China's commercial aerospace industry moves from the technological exploration phase to commercialization.

The Securities Daily reported on Friday that six commercial space companies, including Chinese private space firms LandSpace, Galactic Energy, CAS Space, Space Pioneer, Yee Space and Mino Space, have had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus.

The IPO progress has come amid China's increasing policy support for the sector. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced in June a new sci-tech growth tier on the country's Nasdaq-style Science and Technology Innovation Board, also known as the STAR Market.

The regulator also called for more support for companies in cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence and commercial aerospace, such as more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market, in light of industrial development and market demand.

Beijing-based LandSpace said in a statement sent to the Global Times that it is set to launch its ZQ-3 reusable rocket at the end of November. Industry analysts said this will be a key step in the mastering of heavy duty, low cost and reusable rockets by Chinese private space firms.

Space Pioneer, another Beijing-based aerospace company, is also preparing for a launch for its Tianlong-3 reusable rocket, according to the South China Morning Post. The rocket is expected to be used to build China's massive internet satellite constellations, the report said.

A Beijing-based venture capital investor surnamed Liu told the Global Times on Friday that there has been a marked rise in market attention toward the commercial aerospace sector, given the policy support and recent progress made in the industry. "The new policies are also a boon for earlier-stage investors looking for an exit strategy," Liu said.

Tian Lihui, professor of finance at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Friday that listing can not only address the financing challenges faced by enterprises and secure funding for continuous research and development input, but also guide capital toward companies with genuine technical strengths and commercial potential. It will also promote the healthy development of the industry, Tian noted.

The CSRC's call for more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market precisely addresses the chokepoint for commercial aerospace - high R&D investment and long profitability cycles - by opening up more capital market channels for the industry, Tian said.

Further policy support came on Tuesday, when China's space agency released an action plan to back commercial space firms and encourage them to pursue international cooperation over the next two years.

The document released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said the country's commercial space enterprises should "go global" and help developing countries to build satellite-application industries.

Among the supportive measures, the CNSA will establish a national commercial space development fund and local governments will be urged to establish technology-innovation centers focused on reusable rockets and smart satellites, and to build open platforms for advanced manufacturing, final assembly and testing.

The plan aims to achieve high-quality commercial space development by 2027. The recommendations for the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) list the aerospace sector among China's strategic emerging industries.
