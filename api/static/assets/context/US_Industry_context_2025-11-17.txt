[TITLE]Niveshaay leads ₹325 crore funding in Waaree Energy Storage to scale battery business:
[TEXT]
Investment firm Niveshaay on Tuesday said it has led a Rs 325 crore funding round in Waaree Energy Storage Systems to expand the Waaree Group's battery arm.

The fund will be used to enhance cell and pack manufacturing capacity, strengthen engineering and validation capabilities, and scale containerised Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) across India and select global markets.

Multiple fund vehicles

Niveshaay said it has cumulatively invested Rs 128 crore in the round through its Category II Niveshaay Sambhav Fund, Category III Niveshaay Hedgehogs Fund, and the newly launched one of India's first dedicated Collective Investment Vehicles (CIVs,) Niveshaay WESS Fund.

Other co-investors in the round include Vivek Jain (Managing Director, Action Tesa and GrowthSphere) and Saket Agarwal (former Director, Apollo Pipes Ltd and Apollo Tricoat), among others, Niveshaay, the SEBI-registered investment advisory and boutique asset management firm said.

"Battery storage will play a key role in India's clean energy growth… they expand a domestic storage platform with scale and technology depth," said Arvind Kothari, Founder at Niveshaay.

India’s storage outlook

India's storage market is growing with policy support through viability-gap funding for grid-scale storage, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for advanced cells, and the Energy Storage Obligation (ESO), the firm said.

Cumulative installations, according to Niveshaay, are expected to reach around 200 GWh by 2030 from 0.4 GWh in 2024.

As BESS systems evolve from short-duration buffers to multi-day storage and hybrid configurations, Waaree's vertically integrated model enables it to capture value across the manufacturing, integration, and long-term service layers, it said.

Waaree's existing solar manufacturing and EPC capabilities create strong alignment for battery integration, Kothari said.

The global energy transition is shifting focus from generation capacity to reliability, flexibility, and storage. Falling lithium-ion costs and supportive policy frameworks have made storage economically viable for utilities and commercial users alike, it said.

Worldwide, storage is the defining theme of the decade; India's trajectory now mirrors that of the US and Europe, where multi-hour battery systems underpin renewable integration, grid stability, and peak demand management, the company said.

Niveshaay investments across listed and unlisted equities and is known for its early-stage, high-conviction investments in India's manufacturing and energy-transition ecosystem.

Source: Pixabay On November 12, 2025, The Fly reported that Loop Capital increased its price target on Arm Holdings Plc (NASDAQ:ARM) from $155 to $180, while reiterating a “Buy” rating.

[TITLE]Shutdown deal adds $850M for B-21, Sentinel construction projects:
[TEXT]
This story has been updated to include a statement from the Air Force.

As lawmakers negotiated an end to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, they added hundreds of millions of dollars for projects related to the B-21 bomber and Sentinel ICBM programs.

The three-bill funding package signed into law on Wednesday night gives the Air Force $3.9 billion for military construction projects, some $204 million above the service’s 2026 budget request. And it includes more than $850 million for flexible spending beyond the continuing resolution for at least 11 projects related to the B-21 and Sentinel.

The allocations for military construction show continued bipartisan support for the Air Force’s nuclear modernization efforts, which have seen massive cost overruns on the Sentinel effort and shutdown-stalled talks

[TITLE]Doroni Aerospace Launches a Reg CF Raise to Accelerate Commercial Production of H1-X Personal Aircraft:
[TEXT]
Coral Springs, USA, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FAA-Certified Aviation Startup Is Raising Capital to Deliver the First Generation of Personal eVTOL Aircraft in $1T+ Urban Air Mobility Market

Doroni Aerospace, the advanced air mobility company pioneering personal electric flight, has launched a new Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) raise to scale toward commercial production of its flagship personal eVTOL aircraft, the Doroni H1-X.

After eight years of R&D and rigorous flight testing, Doroni has developed a first-of-its-kind personal aircraft designed for everyday people. With intuitive controls and advanced safety systems, the H1-X is positioned to become a breakthrough in the $1 trillion Urban Air Mobility (UAM) sector.

With the H1-X showroom model nearly completed and set to debut early next year, this new capital raise supports Doroni’s transition from prototyping to production. FAA-certified and already approved for manned flight testing, Doroni is building for a future where short-distance air travel is safe, personal, and practical.

The H1-X is engineered for real-world use, built to fit in a two-car garage and takeoff and land directly from driveways. From there, it can reach top speeds of 120 mph, travel up to 100 miles on a single charge, and recharge in as little as 25 minutes. With enclosed ducted fans instead of exposed propellers, it offers increased safety and efficiency. And after just 25 hours of training, anyone can pilot this joystick-driven, user-friendly aircraft.

“While the industry races to build flying taxis, we are focused on something far more transformative: empowering individuals with the freedom of personal flight,” said Doron Merdinger, Founder & CEO of Doroni Aerospace. “We aren’t just creating a new vehicle; we are creating a new era of mobility where people take back control of their time and their travel.

Interest is already mounting. Doroni has received over 600 pre-orders, representing an estimated $175M+ in potential revenue, and is targeting first deliveries in 2028.

Regulatory advancements are now unlocking certification for personal eVTOL aircraft, making the dream of flying your own vehicle a reality. Doroni is a key player in this revolution, having successfully achieved one of the first-ever manned test flights in the U.S.

Doroni’s investment round is now open to the public. Learn more and invest at invest.doroni.io
