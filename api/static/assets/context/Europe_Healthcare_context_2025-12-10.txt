Viatris has signed definitive agreements for the sale of its equity stake in Biocon Biologics to Biocon for $815m.

Viatris will sell all of its convertible preferred equity in Biocon Biologics. The deal value comprises $415m in newly issued Biocon equity shares and $400m in cash.

The newly issued shares will be listed and traded on the National Stock Exchange of India. They will be subject to a lock-up period of six months, and the overall transaction value will be adjusted for applicable taxes.

The agreements also provide for an earlier end to the biosimilars non-compete restrictions that were implemented in 2022 after Viatris sold its biosimilars portfolio to Biocon Biologics.

These restrictions will conclude at closing for markets outside the US, while in the US they will remain in effect until November 2026.

The deal is anticipated to be finalised in the first quarter of 2026, pending the fulfilment of all closing conditions.

Viatris has appointed Citi as its financial advisor, with Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Khaitan & Co providing legal counsel.

Viatris CEO Scott Smith stated: “Monetising the value of our equity stake in Biocon Biologics and regaining access to the biosimilars market globally provides significant additional optionality as we continue to build a portfolio of generics, established brands and innovative brands that can contribute to our future growth.”

Viatris is a global healthcare company with operations headquartered in Pittsburgh in the US, with additional centres in Hyderabad, India and Shanghai, China.

The company supplies medicines a billion patients worldwide each year, offering a broad portfolio that covers both generics and branded therapies.

It supports healthcare needs, from acute to chronic conditions, through its global supply chain and scientific expertise.

In October 2024, Lexicon Pharmaceuticals entered into a licensing agreement with Viatris, granting the latter exclusive rights to commercialise sotagliflozin in all indications outside the US and Europe.

[TITLE]“LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease Included in China’s Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that anti-Aβ protofibril* antibody “LEQEMBI®” (brand name in China: “乐意保®”, generic name: lecanemab), has been included in the “Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List” (Chinese: 商业健康保险创新药品目录), recently introduced by the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) of China. The inclusion of LEQEMBI in this list marks a meaningful step toward expanding access to early Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) treatment in China.

The Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List is based on new policies of the Chinese government to support the development and access of innovative medicines. The list aims to help narrow the coverage gap between the basic reimbursement system under the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) and innovative medicines that address areas of significant unmet need. Based on the Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List, Commercial insurance companies will discuss and reach the agreement with pharmaceutical companies regarding coverage details, and develop insurance products focusing on the listed medicines. The Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026.

Eisai estimates that there were 17 million patients with MCI or mild dementia due to AD in China in 2024, which is expected to increase with the aging of the population.

Eisai launched LEQEMBI in China in June 2024 and has delivered the product in the private market.

Eisai serves as the lead of LEQEMBI development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. Eisai will distribute the product in China and will conduct information provision activities through specialized Medical Representatives.

*Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.1 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction.2
