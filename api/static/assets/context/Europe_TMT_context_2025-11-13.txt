[TITLE]Coinbase, stablecoin startup BVNK walk away from $2B deal: Report:
[TEXT]
Coinbase and stablecoin startup BVNK have reportedly parted ways on a $2 billion acquisition deal that would have been among the largest crypto company deals ever and would’ve significantly expanded Coinbase’s institutional stablecoin offering.

Fortune reported on Tuesday that the decision was mutual, but it isn’t clear why the parties sought to cancel the deal. Coinbase and BVNK, which builds stablecoin infrastructure, had reached the due diligence stage of the deal after signing an exclusivity agreement in October.

“After discussing a potential acquisition of BVNK, both parties mutually agreed to not move forward,” a Coinbase spokesperson told Fortune, adding that it would continue to explore other opportunities.

It would have been Coinbase’s second-largest deal after completing its $2.9 billion purchase of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit in August.

Coinbase’s attempt to buy the stablecoin company comes as Wall Street’s interest in the tokens has skyrocketed, as international payment networks including Western Union, MoneyGram and SWIFT have started integrating stablecoin solutions.

The $312 billion stablecoin market is riding on regulatory momentum after the US passed the GENIUS Act in July, and the US Treasury estimated in April that the stablecoin market could grow to $2 trillion by 2028.

BVNK slated to expand Coinbase stablecoin revenue

The BVNK acquisition could have boosted Coinbase’s share of revenue from stablecoin services, which accounted for $246 million, or 19%, of its $1.9 billion in revenue reported by the crypto exchange in the third quarter.

Calling off the acquisition, however, could now free up capital for Coinbase to pursue another move in the stablecoin space.

BVNK to reassess

Meanwhile, BVNK will head back to the drawing board after also previously being in talks with Mastercard about a potential acquisition in October.

Citi’s venture capital arm, Citi Ventures, and Mastercard rival Visa also invested in BVNK back in May.

UK-based BVNK was launched in October 2021 by CEO Jesse Hemson-Struthers, chief technology officer Donald Jackson, and chief business officer Chris Harmse. It says it now processes more than $20 billion in annualized volume.

[TITLE]VCI Global unveils crypto treasury plan, backs Tether’s payments arm OOBIT:
[TEXT]
Malaysia-based VCI Global (Nasdaq: VCIG) announced plans to acquire $100 million in OOB tokens and oversee the digital treasury of OOBIT, a Singapore-based crypto payments platform launched in 2017.

According to a Tuesday announcement, Tether will become the largest shareholder in VCI Global through its stake in OOBIT. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, CMCC Global and 468 Capital are also investors.

VCI Global acquired $50 million in OOB tokens from the OOB Foundation at a $200 million market capitalization, or $0.20 per token, by issuing company shares as payment. The company plans to purchase an additional $50 million worth of OOB tokens on the open market after its official launch.

VCI is a technology and investment company that develops platforms spanning artificial intelligence, digital finance and data infrastructure. In February 2024, it raised $25 million in a Series A round to expand its crypto payments app.

On Tuesday, the company’s shares fell by over 20% in early trading following the announcement.

OOBIT races toward stablecoin payments

OOBIT rolled out its crypto-to-fiat payments app in April 2022. The platform enables merchants to accept crypto payments and cash out their funds in fiat currency.

Since May 2024, OOBIT has integrated with The Open Network to facilitate retail payments through Tether’s stablecoins USDt (USDT) and its gold-backed token, Tether Gold (XAUt).

The crypto payments space is crowded with traditional payment infrastructure providers and fintech companies racing to enhance stablecoin payments.

In October, Visa announced it was rolling out stablecoin support across four new blockchains. A few months earlier, in April, Stripe began testing its upcoming stablecoins payment network, Tempo.

A March report by OOBIT revealed that 70% of crypto payments in the European Union were made for food and beverage, as well as other retail purchases, with an average purchase amount of $8.36.

Promises Made, Promises Kept — One Year Later

Whitehouse.gov ^ | November 5, 2025 | The Whitehouse

Posted on by SoConPubbie

One year ago today, the American people delivered a resounding mandate to President Donald J. Trump when they overwhelmingly re-elected him to an historic second term. In just ten months since his inauguration as the 47th President of the United States, he has moved with unprecedented speed and resolve to secure the border, drive down costs, restore public safety, and unleash American energy and prosperity — and momentum is building for even greater achievements ahead.

Here are just some of President Trump’s PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT:

[TITLE]Investor angst over Big Tech’s AI spending spills into bond market:
[TEXT]
A basket of bonds issued by so-called hyperscalers – companies that are building vast data centres, including Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle – has sustained a hit in recent weeks.

Investors have been selling off the debt of US tech heavyweights, showing how jitters over Silicon Valley’s boom in spending on artificial intelligence have spilled into the bond market.

A basket of bonds issued by so-called hyperscalers – companies that are building vast data centres, including Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle – has sustained a hit in recent weeks.

The spread, or premium in yield that investors demand to buy the debt over Treasuries, has climbed to 0.78 percentage points, the highest level since US president Donald Trump sent markets reeling in April with his tariff plans, and up from 0.5 points in September, according to Bank of America data.

The widening spread highlights how investors are increasingly concerned with the way tech groups are turning to debt markets to finance their investments in AI infrastructure.

“The important thing the market woke up to in the past two weeks is that it’s the public markets that are going to need to finance this AI boom,” said Brij Khurana, a fixed income portfolio manager at Wellington Management.

JPMorgan on Monday said building AI infrastructure would cost more than $5 trillion (€4.3 trillion) and “will likely require participation from every public capital market as well as private credit, alternative capital providers and even government involvement”.

The mammoth scale of investment in AI infrastructure has raised concerns

Amsterdam-based Nebius Group ( NBIS ) said its third-quarter revenue rose by more than 350%, showing strong growth in the fast-moving AI sector, as per Yahoo Finance. Nebius signed a $3 billion, five-year deal with Meta Platforms (META) to provide AI infrastructure, highlighting the global race to secure computing power for artificial intelligence.This Meta deal is Nebius’s second big partnership in 2025. In September, it signed a $17.4 billion agreement with Microsoft, which could grow to $19.4 billion by 2031, as stated by Inveez. Nebius said it would deploy the infrastructure for Meta within three months. The company added that demand was so strong the deal size was limited by available capacity.For the third quarter ended September, Nebius posted $146.1 million in revenue, up 355% from a year ago, but below analyst expectations of $155.1 million, according to FactSet. The company’s net loss grew to over $100 million, compared with $39.7 million last year. But on an adjusted basis, the loss narrowed to $39.7 million from $100.4 million.Despite losses, Nebius’s market value has quadrupled to $27.61 billion by Monday’s close, showing strong investor confidence in its AI infrastructure business. After the earnings release, Nebius’s stock moved sharply in premarket trading as investors reacted to the strong revenue growth but also higher spending levels, as per the report by Yahoo Finance.Nebius’s capital expenditure jumped to $955.5 million in the quarter from $172.1 million last year. The company spent big on Nvidia GPUs, real estate, and power supply. Nebius aims to reach an annualized revenue run rate of $7–9 billion by the end of 2026, compared with about $551 million as of September. To fund this expansion, Nebius announced an at-the-market equity program for up to 25 million Class A shares. The firm said it would allow efficient ongoing funding while being “dilution-sensitive.”Founded as a spin-off from Russian tech firm Yandex last year, Nebius has quickly expanded worldwide, building data centers across the U.S., Europe, and Israel. In Israel, the company opened one of the country’s first public GPU clusters using Nvidia’s latest chips. Nebius, along with rival CoreWeave, has gained from the shortage of high-performance GPUs as AI demand exceeds supply.With big contracts and new centers, Nebius is now seen as one of the fastest-growing companies in the global cloud and AI infrastructure market. According to Marketsmojo, Nebius Group NV led the list of top-performing stocks with an annual return of 451.96%, the highest among several leading companies, as per the report by Marketsmojo.Nebius operates in the Computers – Software & Consulting sector and is a mid-cap company known for its AI and cloud infrastructure strength. Analysts said the performance of Nebius and similar firms shows how fast the technology and capital markets sectors are growing, giving investors big potential gains.Nebius signed a $3 billion, five-year deal with Meta to provide AI infrastructure and computing power for artificial intelligence projects.Nebius’s third-quarter revenue rose by 355% to $146.1 million, showing strong growth in the AI infrastructure market.

THE BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT

Pursuant to the proposed Business Combination Agreement, each of Columbus, and WISeKey’s wholly owned subsidiary, WISeSat, will become wholly owned subsidiaries of Pubco, a newly formed British Virgin Islands holding company expected to be listed on Nasdaq. In the business combination, all shares of WISeSat will be exchanged for the right to receive shares of Pubco. As a result, upon closing, WISeKey will receive 25.0 million ordinary shares of Pubco, which, at an implied value of $10.00 per share, would have a $250 million equity valuation, before fees and expenses. At the closing of the business combination, each outstanding share of Columbus that has not been redeemed by its public shareholders in accordance with its organizational documents will convert into one share of Pubco, and every 7 Columbus rights will be eligible to convert into one share of Pubco. In connection with the business combination, WISeKey and SEALSQ are expected to make investments resulting in no less than $10.0 million in cash to WISeSat. The Business Combination Agreement contemplates that WISeKey may, at its election, distribute immediately after the closing of the business combination up to 10% of the Pubco shares that it receives to its shareholders.

At the closing of the business combination, any cash remaining in Columbus’s trust account after paying redeeming public shareholders of Columbus, along with any cash provided by WISeKey or SEALSQ, after payment of transactions fees and expenses and other liabilities of Columbus, will be contributed to Pubco to support ongoing operations and planned commercialization efforts. The Business Combination Agreement and related transactions have been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of WISeKey, WISeSat and Columbus, and are subject to approval by the shareholders of Columbus and other customary closing conditions. WISeKey, as the sole holder of WISeSat shares, has also approved the Business Combination Agreement and related transactions.

A more detailed description of the terms of the Business Combination Agreement and related transactions and a copy of the Business Combination Agreement will be included in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by Columbus and in a Current Report on Form 6-K to be filed by WISeKey with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

[TITLE]Can California’s capital city become a world-class semiconductor hub?:
[TEXT]

There are around 9,000 political lobbyists in Sacramento, the capital of the fourth-largest economy in the world – but look beyond the backroom deal-making of California’s Capitol building and you’ll find a city in pursuit of reinvention.

Sacramento is ready to shed its reputation as a “government town,” as Barry Broome, CEO of the Greater Sacramento Economic Council (GSEC), refers to it, and become a central part of the US’ semiconductor industry.

Ten years ago, when Broome moved to Sacramento, it was a very different place. The city was recovering from the Great Recession. It had a population of less than half a million people, and had been experiencing a high rate of disconnected youth. Ten years later, the population has grown by over 10%, partly fuelled by priced-out San Francisco tech workers looking for a more family friendly environment. Downtown Sacramento is only a 90-minute drive from the Bay Area.

Now, GSEC says the greater Sacramento region is the fastest-growing semiconductor market in the state. According to Newmark and Brookings, Sacramento has 26-times more concentrated semiconductor growth capital than the US average. There are both domestic and international players such as Solidigm, Intel, Samsung, Kioxia and others to thank for this, as well as efforts from local leaders to foster a business environment with clear goals. The council highlights that nine of the world’s largest semiconductor firms have a presence in the region.

The biggest foreign investment in Greater Sacramento is Bosch’s. In 2023, the German multinational purchased a $1.5bn (€1.3bn) fabrication facility, or ‘fab’, in Roseville from TSI Semiconductors, representing the biggest semiconductor investment in California in three decades. The investment was supported by $575m in CHIPS Act funding (a mix between direct funding and loans), which officials assured has not been affected by uncertainty surrounding the policy. Once the plant is up and running, it is set to permanently employ 700 workers and is projected to make up 40% of domestic silicon carbon chip production capacity.

Intel as a tech industry anchor

In the late 1990s, Broome says the city began to decline following the Base Realignment and Closure process, a government effort to close military installations following the end of the Cold War. In Sacramento, the closure of two major Air Force bases, McClellan and Mather, led to major job losses. The McClellan facility, for one, employed 13,500 people at one point.

[TITLE]Industry bodies oppose auction of 6GHz spectrum:
[TEXT]
Industry body Broadband India Forum (BIF), international bodies such as the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) Alliance and companies such as Qualcomm have called for a delicensing of spectrum, in contrast to leading telcos calling for an auction of the 6GHz spectrum.

In a submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) regarding auction of Radio Frequency Spectrum for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT), the BIF said that the Upper 6GHz band should be completely delicensed while low-power indoors (LPI) and Very Low Power Wi-Fi should be permitted.

“India’s digital future depends on broadband wireless connectivity delivered by Wi-Fi. Importantly, 6 GHz Wi-Fi technology is available now, enabling advanced and affordable communications. However, currently in India, 6 GHz Wi-Fi capabilities are impaired because access to the spectrum remains unavailable,” said BIF.

The association argued that this keeps Indian consumers and enterprises from realising the full benefits of higher data rates, ultra-low and deterministic latencies, improved mobility, better power efficiency, optimisation of energy utilisation or support for high densities of users and devices.

It also pointed out how US and other countries have delicensed the entire 6GHz band more than five years ago, resulting in huge economic value from opening the band years ago.

“Device affordability improves when manufacturers can sell globally standard 6 GHz-enabled devices, instead of having to make regionspecific variants. This brings down costs everywhere,” it said.

Similarly, Qualcomm asked that the entire Upper 6 GHz band (including 6425–6725 MHz and 7025–7125 MHz spectrum bands) be earmarked for IMT, and revisited post-World Radiocommunication Conference 2027 (WRC-27). This would help India align with global harmonisation efforts and its own 6G ambitions.

“India must resist the temptation of short-term spectrum monetisation and instead prioritise strategic long-term economic and national security gains. The Upper 6 GHz band is critical for mobile growth in India and it may be noted that several other countries like China, Brazil and European countries are considering the entire 700 MHz in this Upper 6 GHz band for 6G,” said Qualcomm.

ITU-APT Foundation of India (IAFI) is a non-profit, non-political, non- partisan organisation argued that 5G deployment relies on extensive low-, mid-, and high-band frequencies across dense small-cell networks — dramatically raising capital costs. Traditional auctions force telcos to pay high upfront fees for exclusive, long-term licenses, which limits cash flow for infrastructure expansion and innovation.

“Spectrum auctions inherently favour incumbents with deep pockets. Large operators can afford to spend billions on licenses, while startups or smaller regional carriers cannot. This dynamic entrenches existing monopolies or oligopolies and limits new entrants who might offer innovative services or business models. In India, this structure has effectively discouraged new entrants,” it said.

Earlier, telecom operators Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea were reported to have asked the government for auction allocation of the entire 6GHz band, with 1200MHz of spectrum, with no sharing with others for low-powered delicensed wifi use. It may be noted however, that the India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA) India asked the government to defer the auction until 2030 to ensure clear international consensus and market readiness.

[TITLE]Before spectrum goes under the hammer, telcos make an urgent plea:
[TEXT]
Bharti Airtel Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have called for sharply lowering the base price for the next spectrum auctions and extending the spectrum usage period to as long as 40 years. In submissions made to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the telecom operators said this is needed to ensure robust network expansion and accelerate 5G deployment.

The request, which comes ahead of the next spectrum auction likely early next year, reflects persistent concerns among operators that steep reserve prices are stifling investment, leaving valuable airwaves unsold, and ultimately undermining the government’s Digital India vision. Having cheaper airwaves is necessary to free up capital for network infrastructure, the telecom companies said.

“Excessively high reserve prices keep valuable spectrum idle and result in operators facing capacity and capital constraints," Rahul Vatts, chief regulatory officer of Bharti Airtel, stated in a submission to Trai. He said spectrum that remains unsold or underutilized due to inflated pricing is a "direct loss to the country," delaying network expansion and degrading service quality. By reducing costs, operators could redirect capital toward “network densification, faster 5G rollout, and wider rural coverage."

Spectrum represents a critical revenue stream for the government, which sets a base price and expects companies to bid higher. A premium over the reserve price translates into higher government revenue. However, aggressive bidding has eased since 2021, with most of the airwaves sold near reserve prices—a shift driven by industry consolidation, high base prices, and the financial burden of recent 5G rollouts.

Reliance Jio, India's largest telco by market share, urged Trai to recommend a reserve price set at 50% of the spectrum valuation, arguing that the current valuation of 70% is "too steep and not conducive of wider participation." Jio contended that this aggressive pricing prevents genuine price discovery and competition, leading instead to sales at or near the reserve floor.

Validity

Beyond pricing, operators have also called for extending the duration of using spectrum to 30 or 40 years from the current 20 years. They argue that a longer term provides greater policy stability, enhances business viability, and enables the sustained investments required for next-generation network technologies. The Union cabinet had previously approved increasing the tenure to 30 years in 2021 to infuse liquidity, but this was never implemented, with Jio noting that Trai's valuation had simply multiplied the 20-year price by 1.5, negating the intended financial benefit.

The industry's request runs contrary to the public stance of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal recently pushed back on the necessity of lower prices.

“I have not seen any TSP come to me saying that they are not using a respective spectrum because its pricing is high," Mittal told reporters last month, questioning how data prices remain low if spectrum acquisition costs are supposedly prohibitive. Mittal maintained that the timing of the next auction would be determined by the "appetite and the demand" among stakeholders. If the reserve prices are so high, how could data prices be so low, Mittal questioned.

Bharti Airtel also said that in future auctions, telcos should be allowed a payment moratorium of six years, followed by 14 equal annual installments. This is because any new network takes a time period of at least 4-5 years to monetize and huge upfront payments combined with short moratorium periods could cause significant financial strain on operators, according to Airtel.

Currently, operators can make full or part upfront payment for the spectrum within 10 days from issuing spectrum. They can also make an upfront payment equal to the installments of at least two years, with the balance payable in equal installments with applicable interest, within the 20-year spectrum holding period. Operators are also allowed to make payment for spectrum in 20 equal annual instalments.

Unsold spectrum

Trai is also looking into concerns raised by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), which flagged a lack of effective competition in previous auctions due to industry consolidation and the oversupply of unsold airwaves. The DoT data shows over 12,000 MHz of traditional band spectrum remains unsold. In an effort to mitigate this issue, Trai has sought comments on potentially allowing other entities—such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or large connected device network operators—to bid for spectrum alongside wireless carriers.

The telecom carriers uniformly opposed this proposal. Vodafone Idea stated that allowing non-traditional bidders would "impact the robustness of the licensing framework" and create "huge complications related to valuation," arguing it runs counter to the structure of the new Telecommunications Act 2023.

Operators also said that referring to the currently available spectrum inventory as an “over-supply" may not accurately reflect market realities. “Rather, this spectrum should be viewed as strategic reserve capacity intended to address future growth requirements and regional variations in demand," Bharti Airtel said.

A recent analysis by V.J. Christopher, wireless advisor at DoT, flagged that nearly 36% of the spectrum on auction since 2010 was cleared at the base price, and only 15.5% was sold at a premium.

Another grouse relates to the duration of using the spectrum.

Currently, spectrum is issued for a period of 20 years. The Union cabinet in 2021 recommended increasing it to 30 to ensure long-term policy stability, improve business viability, and facilitate sustained investment in advanced technologies. However, the move did not take off. Jio said this should have been implemented in 2022 itself but wasn't, due to what it called Trai’s "aggressive valuation".

While the three carriers agree on the need for cheaper spectrum, they are divided on auctioning some new bands.

Reliance Jio is advocating for a comprehensive release strategy, urging that all nationally and globally identified International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) bands be auctioned immediately to ensure policy predictability and accelerate 6G readiness. Specifically, Jio wants the entire 6 GHz band to be auctioned now, with payment obligations kicking in only when the full band becomes available in 2030.

Bharti Airtel, is opposed to the plan. The company wants the auction of new bands like 600 MHz and parts of 6 GHz to be deferred for approximately two years. Airtel cited unresolved technical conflicts and the current "early stage" of the device and network ecosystem for both bands, suggesting that a premature auction would lead to underutilization.

The operators also requested the government to relax minimum rollout obligations, designed to ensure the swift deployment of purchased spectrum. Airtel highlighted the difficulty in meeting these commitments for the 26 GHz band, citing limited device compatibility and chipset constraints, and requested an extension to avoid financial penalties. The debate underscores a critical tension between the government’s desire for revenue maximization and the industry’s need for capital efficiency to fund the massive investment required for a true, nationwide 5G transformation.

[TITLE]What’s up with… Vodafone & AST SpaceMobile, sovereign services, global growth:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Joint venture SatCo to base its European Satellite Operations Centre in Germany for sovereign direct-to-device connectivity services; Red Hat and Kyndryl are enhancing and promoting their ability to support sovereign operations in Europe; year-on-year growth in the value of the global telecom and pay-TV services sector is slowing down, almost to a crawl, according to IDC; and more!

The European wholesale direct-to-device (D2D) satellite communications joint venture dubbed SatCo, formed in March by low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite operator AST SpaceMobile and Vodafone Group, one of its investors, is to locate its main Satellite Operations Centre (SOC) in Germany. SatCo’s plan is to “give consumers and businesses access to secure space-based cellular broadband connectivity via their domestic mobile network operator” in all European markets, notedVodafone in March. The facility, which will be located near either Munich or Hannover, “will allocate and map satellite connectivity used by SatCo to serve mobile network operators (MNOs) across Europe to ensure ubiquitous mobile broadband in underserved areas and support emergency services and disaster relief agencies,” explained the telco, adding that MNOs in “21 European Union (EU) member states and other European countries have expressed interest in adopting the service, with commercial launch planned to commence from 2026.” As with most developments these days, there is a ‘sovereign’ angle: Vodafone says the constellation serving EU markets “will include a comprehensive ‘command switch’ feature to support European oversight and security. This capability supports updating all telemetry, tracking and control (TTC) encryption keys for both S-Band (used to connect smartphones from space) and Q/V-Band (used for links between satellites and earth stations). It also allows for the modification of service encryption keys for communications across the continent… [and] manages the activation, deactivation and direction of satellite beams in Europe.” Vodafone Group CEO Margherita Della Valle noted: “SatCo delivers a sovereign satellite solution to the whole of Europe. It will give European operators access to secure and resilient satellite communications, complementing existing terrestrial telecommunications networks. By establishing a satellite constellation in the EU and our principal command centre in Germany, we are ensuring the next frontier of communications infrastructure is firmly embedded in Europe.” The news came a day after UK national operator BT Group, which has no plans to launch direct-to-device (D2D) services, announced a LEO-delivered satellite broadband service partnership with SpaceX’s Starlink, one of AST SpaceMobile’s main competitors. For further details, including SatCo’s spectrum aspirations, see the full announcement.

Sticking with the European sovereign services theme… Open-source cloud software giant Red Hat has announced a “confirmed sovereign support” solution, described as a “fully EU-anchored support experience”, for the 27 member states of the European Union “to address the critical strategic imperative for digital sovereignty in Europe.” This new support offering is “purpose-built to deliver dedicated EU citizen-driven technical support from within the EU for Red Hat software subscriptions, providing a new level of verifiable local control over critical IT operations,” the IBM-owned company noted in this announcement. Chris Wright, CTO and senior VP of global engineering at Red Hat, noted: “More and more European business leaders are looking to digital sovereignty as a way to help drive economic differentiation in a global marketplace, as well as insulate operations from geopolitical dynamics and safeguard EU data, technology and operations. At the same time, these leaders want to further cloud infrastructure resiliency and AI innovation goals through strengthened supply chain transparency, jurisdictional security, compliance and autonomy.”

Meanwhile, Kyndryl, the managed IT infrastructure services giant that was spun off from IBM in November 2021 into a separate, independent public company, has struck a deal to acquire Solvinity Group, a Netherlands-based provider of secure managed cloud platforms and services, for an undisclosed sum to enhance its sovereign services portfolio in Europe. “By combining Kyndryl’s mission-critical advisory, implementation and managed services capabilities with Solvinity’s private and hybrid sovereign cloud offerings, Kyndryl is continuing to innovate how customers manage, secure and automate workloads,” noted Kyndryl. “These expanded capabilities will support customers in running highly sensitive workloads with stringent security and compliance requirements in navigating evolving regulations on data sovereignty,” it added. Petra Goude, president of Kyndryl Strategic Markets, stated: “Kyndryl’s acquisition of Solvinity will enable us to offer customers expanded services in modernising, innovating and securing sensitive and complex workloads. This transaction reflects our proactive investment in mission-critical capabilities as we empower customers to bolster security, respond to increasing regulatory requirements and transform for a competitive and rapidly evolving landscape.”

And still in Europe… Generative AI giant Anthropic, the developer of the Claude large language model (LLM) that counts the likes of Amazon, Cisco, Google and SK Telecom amongst its investors, is opening offices in Paris and Munich as its “global operations expand across Europe,” the company noted in this announcement. Anthropic plans to further expand its European footprint alongside its current offices in London, Dublin, and Zurich. The moves are the “latest example of Anthropic’s extraordinary momentum in Europe – and all around the world. In the past year, we have tripled the number of employees we have in the EMEA region and will continue to expand our headcount with the addition of these new offices. Businesses across Europe are trusting Claude with their most important work. As a result, EMEA has become our fastest-growing region, with a run-rate revenue that has grown more than 9x in the past year. The number of large EMEA business accounts – customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue – has also grown more than 10x over the past year,” the AI company boasted.

Sovereign services and infrastructure strategies are increasingly important to the tech and telecom sector. The TelecomTV team will be exploring this trend at the Digital Sovereignty Forum, a new, in-person workshop-style event being held in London on 3 December. Get all the details here.

The global market for telecom and pay-TV services is expected to be worth $1.532tn in 2025, a year-on-year increase of 1.7% from 2024’s $1.51tn, according to the research team at IDC. In 2024, the year-on-year increase in the market value was 2.2%, so the growth rate for the global market is slowing, it seems. Indeed, the IDC team expects the global connectivity services market to grow at a compound annual rate of 1.5% over the next five years, so there’s not a lot for the telco community to cheer

[TITLE]VCI Global unveils crypto treasury plan, backs Tether’s payments arm OOBIT:
[TEXT]
Malaysia-based VCI Global (Nasdaq: VCIG) announced plans to acquire $100 million in OOB tokens and oversee the digital treasury of OOBIT, a Singapore-based crypto payments platform launched in 2017.

According to a Tuesday announcement, Tether will become the largest shareholder in VCI Global through its stake in OOBIT. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, CMCC Global and 468 Capital are also investors.

VCI Global acquired $50 million in OOB tokens from the OOB Foundation at a $200 million market capitalization, or $0.20 per token, by issuing company shares as payment. The company plans to purchase an additional $50 million worth of OOB tokens on the open market after its official launch.

VCI is a technology and investment company that develops platforms spanning artificial intelligence, digital finance and data infrastructure. In February 2024, it raised $25 million in a Series A round to expand its crypto payments app.

On Tuesday, the company’s shares fell by over 20% in early trading following the announcement.

OOBIT races toward stablecoin payments

OOBIT rolled out its crypto-to-fiat payments app in April 2022. The platform enables merchants to accept crypto payments and cash out their funds in fiat currency.

Since May 2024, OOBIT has integrated with The Open Network to facilitate retail payments through Tether’s stablecoins USDt (USDT) and its gold-backed token, Tether Gold (XAUt).

The crypto payments space is crowded with traditional payment infrastructure providers and fintech companies racing to enhance stablecoin payments.

In October, Visa announced it was rolling out stablecoin support across four new blockchains. A few months earlier, in April, Stripe began testing its upcoming stablecoins payment network, Tempo.

A March report by OOBIT revealed that 70% of crypto payments in the European Union were made for food and beverage, as well as other retail purchases, with an average purchase amount of $8.36.

Amsterdam-based Nebius Group ( NBIS ) said its third-quarter revenue rose by more than 350%, showing strong growth in the fast-moving AI sector, as per Yahoo Finance. Nebius signed a $3 billion, five-year deal with Meta Platforms (META) to provide AI infrastructure, highlighting the global race to secure computing power for artificial intelligence.This Meta deal is Nebius’s second big partnership in 2025. In September, it signed a $17.4 billion agreement with Microsoft, which could grow to $19.4 billion by 2031, as stated by Inveez. Nebius said it would deploy the infrastructure for Meta within three months. The company added that demand was so strong the deal size was limited by available capacity.For the third quarter ended September, Nebius posted $146.1 million in revenue, up 355% from a year ago, but below analyst expectations of $155.1 million, according to FactSet. The company’s net loss grew to over $100 million, compared with $39.7 million last year. But on an adjusted basis, the loss narrowed to $39.7 million from $100.4 million.Despite losses, Nebius’s market value has quadrupled to $27.61 billion by Monday’s close, showing strong investor confidence in its AI infrastructure business. After the earnings release, Nebius’s stock moved sharply in premarket trading as investors reacted to the strong revenue growth but also higher spending levels, as per the report by Yahoo Finance.Nebius’s capital expenditure jumped to $955.5 million in the quarter from $172.1 million last year. The company spent big on Nvidia GPUs, real estate, and power supply. Nebius aims to reach an annualized revenue run rate of $7–9 billion by the end of 2026, compared with about $551 million as of September. To fund this expansion, Nebius announced an at-the-market equity program for up to 25 million Class A shares. The firm said it would allow efficient ongoing funding while being “dilution-sensitive.”Founded as a spin-off from Russian tech firm Yandex last year, Nebius has quickly expanded worldwide, building data centers across the U.S., Europe, and Israel. In Israel, the company opened one of the country’s first public GPU clusters using Nvidia’s latest chips. Nebius, along with rival CoreWeave, has gained from the shortage of high-performance GPUs as AI demand exceeds supply.With big contracts and new centers, Nebius is now seen as one of the fastest-growing companies in the global cloud and AI infrastructure market. According to Marketsmojo, Nebius Group NV led the list of top-performing stocks with an annual return of 451.96%, the highest among several leading companies, as per the report by Marketsmojo.Nebius operates in the Computers – Software & Consulting sector and is a mid-cap company known for its AI and cloud infrastructure strength. Analysts said the performance of Nebius and similar firms shows how fast the technology and capital markets sectors are growing, giving investors big potential gains.Nebius signed a $3 billion, five-year deal with Meta to provide AI infrastructure and computing power for artificial intelligence projects.Nebius’s third-quarter revenue rose by 355% to $146.1 million, showing strong growth in the AI infrastructure market.
