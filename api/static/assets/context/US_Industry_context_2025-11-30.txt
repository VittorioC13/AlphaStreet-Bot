[TITLE]Catamaran Ventures to follow patient capital route in bets on India's manufacturing push:
[TEXT]
Billionaire N R Narayan Murthy's family office Catamaran Ventures plans to make more growth stage equity bets in manufacturing, a top executive at the firm said on Wednesday.

“Our thesis is based on the view that over the next 5-10 years in India, from a wealth and job creation perspective, the country needs to develop its supply chain for precision manufacturing," Deepak Padaki, president at Catamaran Ventures told Mint.

Murthy, a co-founder of information technology services bellwether Infosys Ltd, is chairman emeritus of Catamaran.

Over the last year, several funds have been deepening their focus on manufacturing as a sector, with some launching new funds to narrow down on the industry's potential. Much of this is backed by private equity and venture capital's belief that manufacturing and supply chain companies are going to be what pushes India to become an export-led economy.

“Themes like import substitution (for EMS), rising domestic consumption (for packaging, building materials) and India’s emergence as an export hub (for chemicals, auto, engineered solutions, aerospace and defense) are providing structural long-term impetus to companies," said Koushik Bhattacharyya, managing director and head of industrials investment banking at Mumbai investment bank Avendus Capital. (EMS is short for electronic manufacturing services.)

So far, Catamaran has two precision manufacturing investments: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker. Both companies are headed for IPOs.

Catamaran has so far made two investments in the manufacturing space, both of which are headed for the public markets: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker looking to raise up to Rs1,000 crore through an offer for sale. Catamaran has also invested in point-of-care medical diagnostics company Achira Labs.

The family office's sees supply chain manufacturing companies as not a good fit with typical venture capital bets given the long gestation period for such businesses. Most generalist VC funds look for exits in a five to six year horizon.

Manufacturing, which is considered a sub-sector of deeptech given the changing nature of the activity and patents around it, take as long as 10-15 years to come of some scale. For private equity to back such startups, on the other hand, they need them to be more mature businesses.

“We're more mid-market private equity when it comes to manufacturing. We thought about how we as a family office can put money into companies that is patient capital," said Padaki.

Sectors of opportunity

Catamaran is focused on a few areas within manufacturing: aerospace, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the electric vehicle space, medical devices and semiconductor companies.

The family office sees defence as “interesting" while on the lookout for companies that have achieved some scale and can be taken global — of which it has seen very few. Even on the aerospace side, apart from Aequs, despite Catamaran's desire to do more in the coming year, the pipeline is looking thin.

There's more action in electric vehicle OEMs, however. “There's a lot of small component manufacturers in places like NCR (Delhi region) and Coimbatore that are promoter-owned who are switching to EVs because we already have a strong base in auto component manufacturing," said Padaki. “We're more interested in EV supply chain components like motors, electronic systems, that kind of thing."

Catamaran is also looking to back battery recycling companies that are looking to claw back the rare earth materials used to make EV batteries.

In the electronics and semiconductor space, there are two burgeoning ends like a dumbbell. On the one end, there are plenty of startups but they're still very early in their journey, and on the other, there's fabrication companies which require very large investments to build out factories. Catamaran is scouting for those in the middle. “We're looking for companies that are in the semiconductor or data center space that are looking for growth capital support," said the Catamaran president.

Cheques from Catamaran would range from ₹50 crore to ₹250 crore and in some exceptional cases, the family office is willing to go up to ₹400-500 crore, especially when companies from outside India are looking to build joint-ventures for strategic partnerships in the country.

Previously, Catamaran had a joint venture with e-commerce behemoth Amazon back in 2014 called Cloudtail. In 2021, Amazon acquired the family office's stake due to stricter rules for e-commerce marketplaces with foreign investments.

The firm has traditionally been selective in how it makes investments and that's not changing going into 2026. "Our run rate is typically two to three investments, for which we have to look at 10-12 companies" said Padaki. “These are long gestation in terms of companies because we have to understand the promoters for some time to build relationships. Even next year, we're looking to do maybe two or three."

Manufacturing maturity in 2026

India saw some large deals by risk capital players in manufacturing this year. VIP Industries raised $206 million in a round led by Multiples. Euler Motors secured $75 million from GIC and British International Investments, while Scimplify raised $40 million in a deal led by Accel and Omnivore Partners. Rangsons Aerospace also raised capital in a round led by ValueQuest.

Many of the manufacturing startups that cropped up between 2018-2020 are also now on the lookout for their growth rounds. “Valuations need to see a shift," said Padaki. “The reason many of these companies don't get high valuations is because people don't understand that these are ROCE businesses and not growth-at-all-costs businesses."

ROCE stands for return on capital employed and is a ratio used to assess a company's profitability and capital efficiency, essentially giving insight into how well it is doing based on the money it is spending.

Aequs and SEDEMAC are both heading for the public markets and Catamaran hopes their debut will set the precedent for IPOs by other manufacturers. “Today, you don't have that many precedents of small promoter-owned companies that have suddenly gone public," Padaki said.

Given how the various themes are playing out across manufacturing and precision manufacturing, both venture capital and private equity players have their ears perked for companies that are growing sustainably. “While some near-term factors like tariff might lead to temporary uncertainty, we see large amounts of private capital entering this sector in the next 3-5 years," said Avendus' Bhattacharyya.

[TITLE]NeoVolta Enters into Definitive Agreements Led by Infinite Grid Capital to Advance 2 GWh U.S. Battery Energy Storage System Manufacturing Initiative:
[TEXT]
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeoVolta Inc. (NASDAQ: NEOV) (“NeoVolta” or the “Company”), a U.S.-based energy technology company delivering scalable storage for resilient residential and commercial power infrastructure, today announced that it has entered into agreements for a $13 million private placement financing anchored by Infinite Grid Capital (“IGC”), in connection with a long-term relationship to support NeoVolta’s next phase of scalable growth and U.S.-based manufacturing expansion.

The investment is structured to provide both immediate and future capital support for NeoVolta’s planned domestic manufacturing initiative. In addition to the relationship with IGC, a substantial portion of the investment proceeds is intended to advance this initiative pursuant to a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with third parties to establish and operate a state-of-the-art battery energy storage manufacturing facility in Georgia. This initiative, if pursued to completion, would emphasize domestic production aligned with federal incentives supporting battery manufacturing and compliance with relevant standards.

The facility under consideration is designed for an initial annual capacity of approximately 2 GWh, with a focus on utility-level and commercial & industrial (C&I) battery energy storage systems (BESS) that are expected to significantly expand NeoVolta’s addressable market and revenue opportunity. Operations are expected to ramp up in 2026, subject to definitive agreements and successful execution. In addition, the capital raised through this financing substantially improves NeoVolta’s financial position, significantly enhancing liquidity and addressing working capital needs to support ongoing growth initiatives.

NeoVolta and IGC also plan to establish a shared framework to evaluate potential future commercial opportunities, including offtake arrangements that may align NeoVolta’s commercial channels with IGC’s grid-scale pipeline, subject to definitive agreements.

“We are thrilled to welcome Infinite Grid Capital as a long-term strategic investor with their $10 million investment,” said Ardes Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of NeoVolta. “IGC is well-capitalized and highly aligned with our vision as we advance our domestic manufacturing plans and scale our commercial and grid-aligned channels. The investment delivers the capital and support we need while preserving the flexibility essential to our next phase of growth. We are now well-positioned to pursue a manufacturing platform capable of capturing strong downstream demand in the rapidly expanding U.S. battery energy storage market.”

“IGC is proud to back NeoVolta’s U.S. manufacturing initiative,” said Frank Liu, General Partner and CEO of Infinite Grid Capital. “This partnership reflects our commitment to advancing domestic energy storage capabilities and enabling the next phase of scalable growth.”

As the relationship develops, NeoVolta and IGC will provide updates on key milestones and the continued evolution of NeoVolta’s manufacturing and market initiatives, including details on production schedules, operational dynamics, and potential strategic collaborations. The MOU is non-binding and subject to negotiation of definitive agreements. While there is no assurance that the parties will reach agreement on final terms or that the proposed manufacturing initiative will be consummated, NeoVolta and IGC remain committed to advancing strategic manufacturing opportunities.

[TITLE]Cardoso: 27 banks raise capital to meet recapitalisation targets:
[TEXT]
The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Olayemi Cardoso, has stated that 27 banks have accessed the market to raise additional funds since the inauguration of the latest recapitalisation exercise.

Cardoso disclosed this at the 60th Bankers’ Dinner organised by the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria on Friday.

Nigerian banks have been raising funds to meet the fresh capital thresholds set for them by the CBN, which in March 2024 directed commercial banks with international authorisation to increase their capital base to N500bn and national banks to N200bn.

The CBN also ordered commercial banks with regional authorisation to achieve a N50bn capital floor, while non-interest banks with national and regional authorisations will need to increase their capital to N20bn and N10bn, respectively, with a March 2026 deadline.

Speaking at the event, Cardoso said, “With just four months to the conclusion of the recapitalisation exercise, I am pleased to report that the process is firmly on track. Several banks have already met the new capital thresholds, while others are advancing steadily and are well positioned to comfortably meet the March 31, 2026 deadline. To date, twenty-seven banks have raised capital through public offers and rights issues, and sixteen have already met or exceeded the new requirements — a clear testament to the depth, resilience, and capacity of Nigeria’s banking sector.”

“As we strengthen the capacity of our banks, stress-testing this year confirms that Nigeria’s banking sector remains fundamentally robust. Key financial soundness indicators overwhelmingly satisfied prudential benchmarks during the year.”

He added, “Our decisive actions on regulatory forbearance mark another turning point. As recapitalisation progresses, we are redesigning the credit-risk framework to enforce stronger governance, greater transparency, and firmer accountability across the sector.”

“We are determined to break the boom-and-bust cycle that has accompanied past recapitalisation efforts. MSMEs remain central to our efforts. This year alone, microfinance lending expanded by over 14 per cent, and new digital-credit products reached more than 1.2 million small enterprises — evidence of the sector’s growing depth and capacity. We are improving access to credit, supporting microfinance institutions, and expanding financial products tailored to smaller enterprises.”

Speaking on the economy, the CBN governor noted that Nigeria is now more than ever capable of withstanding external shocks.

“This year’s actions, including the deployment of the Electronic Forex Market Surveillance System, the shift to a single, market-determined foreign exchange rate regime, and enhanced risk-based banking supervision, underscore our track record of reform delivery. They have strengthened Nigeria’s capacity to absorb external shocks, from volatile oil prices to shifts in credit-rating sentiment.

“With oil now a smaller share of GDP and fiscal revenue, a sharp oil-price decline would be cushioned by the flexible FX regime, rising non-oil exports, and growing services trade. In short, Nigeria is more resilient to external shocks today than at any point in our recent history. The Central Bank of Nigeria will continue to steer monetary policy with discipline, anchored firmly to its core mandate of price stability. Stability remains the bedrock upon which investment flourishes, resources are allocated efficiently, and purchasing power is protected,” he added.

Cardoso asserted that the growth of the country’s external reserves has been mostly organic.

“With the current account balance rising over 85 per cent to $5.28bn in Q2, up from $2.85bn in Q1, bolstering our external buffers, foreign reserves reached $46.7bn by mid-November, the highest in nearly seven years, providing over 10 months of forward import cover and significantly enhancing the economy’s resilience. What is most important here is that our FX reserves are being rebuilt organically — not by borrowing, but through improved market functioning, stronger non-oil exports, and robust capital inflows,” he said.

The Central Bank governor also called for collaboration to tackle the rising insecurity in the country.

In his opening speech at the dinner, the President of the CIBN, Pius Olanrewaju, highlighted that the Nigerian banking industry continues to demonstrate resilience and adaptability, remaining active in both global and domestic economic activities.

“These developments are clear and can be affirmed. The sector plays a vital role in supporting Nigeria’s economic recovery and expanding its capacity to finance the new direction of our economy. We will recall that on Friday in November 2023, the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Olayemi Cardoso, announced the recapitalisation programme on this very platform. Subsequently, on March 28, 2024, the CBN issued guidelines applying the new minimum capital requirements for banks.

“Since then, many institutions have already met the new capital thresholds ahead of the 2025–2026 timeline, while others are actively taking necessary steps. These efforts continue to boost investor confidence, drive innovation within the ecosystem, and position the sector to support Nigeria’s aspiration of becoming a $1tn economy by 2030. Another notable development is Nigeria’s recent removal from the FATF grey list, a significant milestone for our country. This achievement restores international confidence, facilitates cross-border trade and investment flows, and reaffirms Nigeria’s commitment to transparency, compliance, and financial integrity.”

The chairman of the Body of Bank CEOs and Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of United Bank for Africa, Oliver Alawuba, in his speech, echoed the earlier charge of the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, on the need for banks to finance the dreams of young Nigerians.

He said, “The Federal Government’s target of a $1tn GDP by 2030 remains in focus. Achieving it requires deeper reforms, enhanced productivity, and increased growth. Private-sector lending currently stands at

[TITLE]8.2% GDP growth signals expanding economic momentum:
[TEXT]
Mohammad Hanief

India’s economy has recorded an impressive GDP growth rate of 8.2% in the second quarter of the 2025-26 financial year, reaffirming the country’s position as one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. This achievement comes at a time when global markets remain unsettled by geopolitical tensions, inflationary waves, and uneven recovery in advanced economies. India’s economic performance, driven by renewed domestic confidence and structural policy support, stands out as a marker of stability and resilience in a turbulent global environment.

The union government has welcomed the newly released figures, describing them as a reflection of the country’s expanding economic capacity and the effectiveness of ongoing reforms. The Prime Minister has noted that such growth underscores the contribution of India’s workforce, entrepreneurs, and industry, while also highlighting the positive trajectory created by sustained policy initiatives. He has reiterated that the government remains committed to advancing reforms and strengthening systems that improve the ease of living for citizens, ensuring that the benefits of growth extend across all sections of society.

India’s economic expansion is characterised by a broad revival across multiple sectors. Domestic demand remains one of the strongest drivers of growth. Urban consumption continues to rise steadily, buoyed by expanding employment opportunities, improved digital access, and enhanced spending capacity. Services associated with travel, communication, retail, and hospitality have seen a substantial revival after a period of prolonged disruption, while emerging service areas such as digital finance and healthcare continue to expand. This transition reflects a shift toward more technology-driven consumption patterns, which in turn support new business models and job creation.

Rural consumption, though influenced by seasonal variations and price fluctuations, has maintained overall resilience. Agricultural stability in several regions, supported by rural infrastructure improvements, has contributed to steady spending patterns. Smaller towns and semi-urban centres have also become important growth nodes, creating new consumption clusters that broaden the base of economic activity beyond traditional metros.

India’s industrial landscape has shown renewed dynamism. Manufacturing has strengthened, supported by higher production levels, sustained demand for domestic goods, and increased confidence among businesses. Policy incentives encouraging domestic manufacturing have attracted fresh investments into sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, renewable-energy components, and automotive products. The shift in global manufacturing preferences, with companies seeking diversified and stable supply chains, has increased India’s appeal as a potential industrial hub.

The construction sector continues to be one of the strongest pillars of the current growth phase. Nationwide infrastructure expansion-covering highways, express corridors, rail modernisation, port upgrades, airport development, and urban housing-has generated wide-ranging economic activity. These initiatives not only propel demand for construction materials but also play a crucial role in employment creation. The scale of public infrastructure spending has produced a ripple effect across allied industries, generating incentives for private participation and supporting thousands of small and medium enterprises connected to supply chains.

India’s investment climate has also strengthened. A sustained rise in capital formation indicates growing confidence among investors. Public-sector expenditure on infrastructure, digital connectivity, and energy systems has laid the foundation for long-term economic momentum. A series of reforms implemented over recent years-ranging from improvements in tax compliance to digitisation of administrative services-have contributed to a more transparent and predictable business environment. These measures have helped streamline processes, reduce barriers, and increase the ease with which businesses operate.

Financial institutions have shown improved health, with stronger balance sheets and rising credit flows to priority sectors. Lending to small and medium enterprises has expanded, supported by government-backed credit mechanisms. This has enabled smaller businesses to participate more effectively in the recovery process and further strengthened the interconnected structure of the economy. Digital payments continue to grow rapidly, deepening financial inclusion and enabling quicker business transactions across rural and urban areas alike.

Even as India’s domestic sectors show strong results, the global environment remains mixed. Export sectors face external pressures due to slower international demand and fluctuations in commodity markets. Despite these headwinds, India has managed to maintain a steady export performance by expanding its presence in sectors such as engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and electronics. Agricultural exports have also shown resilience in several categories. Traditional export industries, including textiles and gems and jewellery, continue to be affected by global market softness, but the diversification of export baskets has helped reduce overall impact.

The services export sector remains one of India’s most stable global strengths. Technology services, business process management, consulting, and financial services continue to attract international demand. India’s skilled workforce, growing digital capacity, and expanding knowledge sectors have played a key role in maintaining a strong services export position, even during periods of global uncertainty.

Employment trends, while still adjusting to pre-pandemic patterns, show gradual improvement. The expansion of construction and manufacturing has supported large-scale labour absorption, particularly in urban and semi-urban regions. The services sector has opened significant opportunities across varying skill levels, supported by the growth of logistics, retail, education, digital platforms, and healthcare. The rise of gig-based and platform-based employment has diversified income opportunities for young workers, particularly in urban centres. At the same time, government initiatives aimed at skill development and digital training continue to bridge gaps between labour supply and industry demand.

Inflation remains a concern, particularly in food categories influenced by seasonal and supply-chain disruptions. Although core inflation has moderated, food prices continue to fluctuate, affecting household budgets. Policymakers maintain a cautious approach to inflation management, balancing price stability with the need to sustain growth. The Reserve Bank of India’s approach has remained focused on ensuring stability in the financial system while providing monetary conditions that support economic expansion.

The government has emphasised that the recent GDP performance reinforces the importance of continuing reforms and strengthening the ecosystem that enhances ease of living. Efforts are under way to improve digital access, expand affordable housing, enhance transportation infrastructure, and increase access to healthcare and social protection. A key focus moving forward will be ensuring that the benefits of economic growth translate into tangible improvements in quality of life and reduced disparities across regions and social categories.

Looking ahead, India’s economic prospects remain robust. The combination of strong domestic demand, renewed industrial activity, expanding services, and sustained investment forms a stable foundation for the coming quarters. The government’s approach-anchored in policy continuity, infrastructure expansion, and reform-driven governance-seeks to create conditions that support long-term growth. While global uncertainties will continue to influence external sectors, India’s structural strengths and diversified economic base position it favourably among emerging economies.

The 8.2% GDP growth rate is more than an indicator of short-term recovery; it signals a broader economic transformation under way. It reflects the growing strength of sectors that have adapted to new realities, the contribution of citizens and businesses across the country, and the policy environment that continues to push for greater transparency, efficiency, and inclusion. As India moves further into the fiscal year, the economic narrative is marked by confidence and a renewed sense of possibility, with a clear national focus on ensuring that growth translates into improved opportunities and living standards for all.

[TITLE]Lundin Mining Announces an Update Regarding the 2017 Class Action:
[TEXT]
VANCOUVER, BC, Nov. 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- (TSX: LUN) (Nasdaq Stockholm: LUMI) Lundin Mining Corporation ("Lundin Mining" or the "Company") announces that it has received a ruling from its appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The ruling upholds the 2023 Ontario Court of Appeal decision allowing a proposed securities class action to be commenced relating to the timing of disclosure of a 2017 pit wall instability and rockslide at the Candelaria Mine in Chile. The certified class action can now proceed before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. There has been no decision on the merits of the case, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the action.

Background

Lundin Mining disclosed the pit wall instability and rockslide in its normal course operational update to investors on November 29, 2017. The claim alleges that these events should have been disclosed earlier. The decision regarding leave to proceed centered on the distinction between a "material fact" and a "material change" under the Ontario Securities Act.
