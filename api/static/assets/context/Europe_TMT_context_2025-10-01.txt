[TITLE]Nissan considers sale of Yokohama F. Marinos:
[TEXT]
Nissan is considering selling the Yokohama F. Marinos professional soccer club, which plays in the top division of the Japan Professional Football League, or J. League, it was learned Monday.

Nissan has approached multiple companies with offers to sell its 75% stake in the operator of the club. It aims to narrow down possible buyers by the end of the year for an early sale, informed sources said, adding that possible buyers include a major technology company.

The move is part of the struggling automaker's restructuring efforts. A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment, saying that the company has not announced such a move.

The Yokohama F. Marinos originated from Nissan's corporate soccer club, established in 1972. In 1992, a year before the launch of J. League, the team was renamed the Nissan FC Yokohama Marinos.

The club adopted its current name following a merger with the Yokohama Flugels.

The club has led Japanese soccer since before J. League's inception. It has won the J1 division five times and the Emperor's Cup annual tournament seven times. Many of its players have played in European leagues and for the Japanese national team, including Shunsuke Nakamura.

Meanwhile, Nissan suffered a net loss of more than ¥670 billion in the year that ended in March, due to sluggish global sales. It has announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs and close seven plants worldwide.

The company has also asked the city of Yokohama to significantly reduce the naming rights fee for Nissan Stadium, home to the Yokohama F. Marinos, to ¥50 million a year.

YouTube has agreed to pay $22 million to settle a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump after the company suspended his account over the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, according to a court filing Monday.

The online video platform, a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet, is the latest Big Tech firm to settle with Trump after he lodged legal cases challenging his broad deplatforming by Big Tech after January 6.

The $22 million will go toward Trump’s latest construction project at the White House, through a nonprofit called Trust for the National Mall, which is “dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom,” per a notice of settlement filing in a California federal court.

Besides the $22 million to Trump’s ballroom venture, YouTube agreed to payments of $2.5 million to a host of other Trump allies, including the American Conservative Union.

Major platforms removed Trump after January 6 amid worries he would promote further violence with bogus claims that voter fraud caused his loss to Joe Biden in 2020.

The platform blocked Trump from uploading new content on January 12, 2021, pointing to “concerns

[TITLE]3 E Network Technology Group Limited Receives Nasdaq Notification Regarding Minimum Bid Price Deficiency:
[TEXT]
HONG KONG, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 3 E Network Technology Group Limited (Nasdaq: MASK) (the “Company” or “3E Network”), a business-to-business (“B2B”) information technology (“IT”) business solutions provider, today announced that on September 25, 2025, it received a deficiency letter (the “Notice”) from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). The Notice informed the Company that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company’s ordinary shares (“Ordinary Shares”) over the 30 consecutive business day period between August 13, 2025 and September 24, 2025, the Company is not in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share of its Ordinary Shares for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”).

The Notice has no immediate effect on the continued listing status of the Ordinary Shares on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company has been provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until March 24, 2026, to regain compliance pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). If at any time before March 24, 2026, the closing bid price of the Ordinary Shares reaches or exceeds $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Staff will provide written notification that the Company has achieved compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and the matter would be resolved. If the Company chooses to implement a reverse stock split, it must complete the split no later than ten business days prior to March 24, 2026, in order to regain compliance.

If the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement during the initial 180 calendar day period, the Company may be eligible for additional time for compliance.

To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company meets these requirements, Nasdaq will inform the Company that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar days. However, if it appears to Staff that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq will provide notice that its securities will be subject to delisting.

The Company’s business operations are not affected by the receipt of the Notification Letter. The Company intends to actively monitor the closing bid price of the Ordinary Shares and will evaluate available options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.

[TITLE]EA's boss won't have to answer to Wall Street. That doesn't mean the pressure's over.:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson will soon no longer have to answer to Wall Street, but he may not be off the hook.

The video-game company Wilson has led since 2013 announced on Monday that it will go private in a $55 billion all-cash deal backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, as well as the investment firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners.

It is the largest leveraged buyout in history, and shareholders will get a premium of around 25% on Thursday's closing share price, the parties involved said in a joint statement. Wilson, who assumed the additional title of chairman in 2021, will continue as CEO.

The deal appears to bode well for EA's shareholders, industry observers told Business Insider. They say the price is fair, especially as the company had no other serious buyers looming, largely due to the tough antitrust landscape. It took Microsoft nearly two years of battling regulators in the US, the European Union, and the UK, for example, to close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023.

For Wilson, though, the future is less clear. On the one hand, taking EA private means he will no longer be beholden to the whims of shareholders, who earlier this year punished the company for cutting its fiscal-year outlook mainly due to challenges with its flagship soccer franchise, "EA Sports FC," formerly known as "FIFA." Shares plummeted nearly 17% on January 23, marking their biggest single-day decline in nearly 17 years.

"Andrew was literally feeling pressure to grow the stock," said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, who has covered the video-game industry for more than two decades.

But Wilson, a native of Australia who joined EA in 2000, could still face heat from the video-game maker's new owners, said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

"Investor pressure is always a little diffused," he said. With just a few private owners, "there's no hiding or escaping."

Leaving on a high note

EA is exiting the stock market on a high note. The company's shares have rallied in recent months in anticipation of "Battlefield 6," the next installment of its shooter franchise due out October 10.

The game was expected to compete with "Grand Theft Auto VI," but in May, the developer of that highly anticipated title, Take-Two Interactive Software, postponed its release from what would've also been this fall to May 2026.

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

From here, the only direction EA can likely go in as a publicly traded company "is down," Joost van Dreunen, who teaches the business of video games at New York University, told Business Insider.

One reason is that "Battlefield 6" will still face competition from Activision's next "Call of Duty" this fall, and eventually from "Grand Theft Auto 6," too, which analysts expect to be a massive hit.

Another is that EA has become too dependent on dated, evergreen franchises like "The Sims" and "Madden NFL" under Wilson's tenure to drive meaningful growth, said Pachter. He added that EA has also struggled to succeed in mobile gaming, the largest segment of the video-game industry by revenue.

"EA has tried a bunch of things that they believed would be innovative since Andrew became CEO, and almost none of them worked," he said.

By going private, Wilson, 51, can perhaps focus more on driving innovation at EA by leaning into generative AI.

"This remarkable technology is not merely a buzzword for us. It's the very core of our business," he said at the company's Investor Day in September 2024.

Wilson could also work with the Saudis to expand EA's footprint in esports. The annual Esports World Cup, run by a nonprofit, is held in Riyadh.

In a memo to employees, Wilson noted that he's excited to continue as CEO and described the deal as a recognition of their collective work.

"This is a historic moment," he wrote. "With the support of our new partners, the future we are building together is brighter than ever."

[TITLE]Ford and BMW both take shots at CarPlay this week:
[TEXT]
Ford CEO Jim Farley said on a podcast that Ford is not convinced of CarPlay Ultra and is waiting for the next generation of the tech before it considers adopting it.

While talking to Joanna Stern from the Wall Street Journal on The Verge‘s Decoder Podcast, Farley mentioned a lot of various excuses as to why Ford hasn’t made any moves on CarPlay Ultra, but ultimately, Stern seems to hit the nail on the head, suggesting that when companies choose CarPlay Ultra right now, it limits them from also offering Google’s Android Auto phone projections system. Since Ford works at such a large scale, it can’t alienate Android users from its cars.

Farley also discusses the need for control over the car for its fleet management software and other car-related software. For instance, he mentions things like Apple controlling the car’s speed, which seems unlikely to me. He also seems to be missing the point that CarPlay Ultra is still a phone projection, so there will need to be some kind of Ford OS beneath it.

That said, it does seem like there needs to be more collaboration and data sharing between an automaker like Ford and Apple if they want to use CarPlay Ultra. That seems like the bigger hold up to me, if I had to guess.

On the BMW side of things, the company’s SVP of UI/UX Development, Stephan Durach, has said that most BMW drivers use the in-car navigation systems instead of CarPlay. That said, the average age of someone who buys a new BMW is 56, so I think that should let you know that it’s not exactly tech enthusiasts who are buying these expensive cars. I’ll also note that in my time with a BMW, it was frustrating to use CarPlay or Android Auto for navigation because the BMW navigation system would still pop up alerts, making it pretty easy to accidentally open BMW’s nav.

All in all, it seems like automakers are still not sold on in-car phone projection tech. Anyone waiting to see which cars get CarPlay Ultra next should probably stop looking at Ford or BMW. Apple’s

[TITLE]EU member states back calls for Chips Act changes:
[TEXT]
Momentum is gathering behind calls for a Chips Act 2.0 to strengthen Europe's competitiveness in the semiconductor sector amid growing geopolitical uncertainty over global markets and supply chains.

The Semicon Coalition, a group now composed of all 27 EU member states, has signed a declaration [PDF] setting out its goal for a stronger Chips Act to bolster Europe's position in the global semiconductor industry.

It follows earlier calls from European chipmakers to look beyond the Chips Act and do more to support other areas of the sector, not just manufacturing, while the European Semiconductor Industry Association (ESIA) also previously said it would like to see more public funding and greater input on decisions.

In response, the European Commission says it is already conducting an evaluation and review of the initiative, and opened a public consultation and call for evidence earlier this month. Those with an interest in the sector are invited to share their views on how the Chips Act is performing today and how it should be adapted.

The declaration says a revised version of the strategy must address Europe's vulnerabilities, and aim to make its chip industries stronger in response to geopolitical, technological, and environmental challenges. This is to build on existing strengths as well as emerging market opportunities highlighted in the Draghi report on European competitiveness.

Those challenges include volatility with America - the Trump administration is using every trick it can think of to force tech companies to dance to its tune - and China's attempts to push chipmakers in other countries out of business by flooding the global market with cheap subsidized products.

However, on the strategic objectives for an updated silicon initiative, the declaration says the amibiton to achieve 20 percent share of the global semiconductor market by 2030 is currently unachievable – something many critics had already pointed out – because it lacks clear strategic direction on where and why Europe should lead in the semiconductor supply chain.

Instead, a revised Chips Act 2.0 must be "grounded" in three overall objectives: enabling a competitive European semiconductor ecosystem that can deliver prosperity; developing technological leadership at critical points in the supply chain; and building a stable and reliable supply of trustworthy semiconductors for Europe's critical industrial sectors.

These objectives need to be backed up by measurable targets, periodically reviewed by the European Commission working with member states and relevant stakeholders in the semiconductor ecosystem, the declaration proposes.

A long list of policy priorities is identified, most of which can be grouped into creating a strong ecosystem within Europe, ensuring enough funding, and developing a workforce with the right skills.

The latter would involve support for greater collaboration between academic institutions in the EU, with the establishment of a European Chips Skills Program. Fostering collaboration between industries across Europe and boosting R&D efforts all the way up to first deployment of a particular technology, are also part of the mix.

Funding suggestions include aligning national and European-level finance streams, as well as encouraging private capital to back up the public money.

Also mentioned are issues that hold back construction of new industrial infrastructure: permits, grid access, power supply, and other preconditions.

"We will explore emergency permitting legislation to fast-track strategic investments in the semiconductor ecosystem," the declaration states, echoing similar measures being implemented in the US and UK to allow projects seen as vital to side-step the usual planning checks.

The declaration issues a call to action, saying the signatories are ready to work with the European Commission on a revision of the Chips Act that will drive the development of a stronger local sector.

"Together, we can out-innovate, out-compete, and out-perform," it says rather optimistically, "ensuring Europe's leadership in the critical technologies that will define our future."

Luis Fernandes, IDC Senior Research Manager for EMEA Digital Infrastructure Strategies, said that a review is quite normal for this type of initiative since it has reached its two-year anniversary.

"That being said, it is hard to classify the first iteration of the European Chips Act as a resounding success," he told The Register.

"The first Act was focused on a limited number of projects. This next iteration has the potential to enlist other member states that might want to partake in this endeavor and expand the capabilities and resilience of the initiative," he added.

The Semicon Coalition was formed earlier this year, initially composed of Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the Netherlands.

In a published statement, Minister Vincent Karremans of Economic Affairs for The Netherlands said: "Today all EU Ministers agreed on the fact that Europe's industrial strategy should adapt to the increasing geopolitical tensions in the world. This unique unity is a landmark step forward in securing future strategic autonomy and broad prosperity."

Peter Burke, Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Enterprise in the Irish government, said: "This morning I am proud to stand with my European colleagues in endorsing the Declaration of the European Semiconductor Coalition. And I join with them in calling for a revitalized European Chips Act to secure Europe's place at the forefront of the global semiconductor industry."

"This is Europe's moment to align national ambitions with a shared vision: to build a semiconductor ecosystem which secures our sovereignty, drives innovation while ensuring prosperity for generations to come."

Gaurav Gupta, VP Analyst in Gartner's Emerging Trends and Technologies team, said that Chips Act 2.0 needs to better define the end goal.

"The original plan of 20 percent market share was too optimistic and broad – I would say it was rather vague. Once there is a better understanding of what the EU wants to achieve with 2.0, it should channel resources in the right direction. Then it would be a matter of execution," he told us.

Where the original act largely just followed what the US and China were doing, the EU should play to its strengths, Gupta believes, such as in research, automotive and industrial chips, emerging energy-efficient technologies, and wafer fabrication tech (think ASML).

"The EU doesn't have the same resources that China and US have with regards to investing in and leading in advanced semiconductor process nodes. It must rather rely on collaboration for certain aspects, while ensuring better utilization of its own resources.

"Another challenge [the] EU has is that with many participating nations drafting these policies, rather than crisp decision making, it can fall into the trap of interests that serve a particular entity. [The] EU needs to overcome those issues and be quick and aggressive." ®

[TITLE]'Much of the value creation in the semiconductor industry is occurring outside the EU' says EU member states, and they want a fresh plan to claw some chips back:
[TEXT]
A new declaration from all 27 EU member states lays out an "urgent need" for a new and improved EU Chips Act. Essentially, Europe feels like it's fallen behind in chip production and design, and it would like to see a concerted effort from the European Commission to regain ground.

"To secure and strengthen our global position," the declaration reads (via The Register), "the EU must prioritize the semiconductor sector as a strategic industry, on par with aerospace and defence, and treat it as a key target for investment, R&D and innovation, and—if necessary—use the available instruments to protect it and act collectively.

"However, while global competitors are significantly ramping up public investment, much of the value creation in the semiconductor industry is occurring outside the EU," it continues. "This underscores the need for a strengthened, second-phase EU Chips Act that is both ambitious and forward-looking."

You have to agree with the signatories here, which represent each of the countries within the EU today, that Europe has slipped up with chip production. An OECD report (PDF) on the semiconductor value chain shows how the largest exporters of chips tend to be in Asia, such as China, Korea, and Taiwan, with companies in the US making the most money from these chips, as per this Semiconductor Industry Association report.

Europe does have a place at the table with big firms such as Dutch company ASML, which builds most of the world's cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing machines. There are also companies such as Infinion, Europe's largest chip manufacturer, and Arm, thought the latter was previously sold and since listed on a stock exchange outside of Europe. Though this 2020 report from the Semiconductor Industry Association suggests the EU only makes up for 9% of global manufacturing capacity—lower than some individual countries such as Taiwan (22%), South Korea (21%) and Japan (15%). It also suggests this share will decrease by 2030 to 8%.

As the declaration rightly points out, when you're depending on semiconductors for "enabling necessary societal transitions", you sort of want to be in a good place to produce the ones you require, especially as global trade and relationships can be so easily fractured.

Here's what the report suggests should be the objectives of a revised EU Chips Act:

The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors

Prosperity: enabling a competitive European semiconductor ecosystem that enhances Europe's economic and broad welfare and value creation across end-markets. Indispensability: maintain and develop Europe’s technological and innovation leadership to secure critical control points in the global semiconductor value chain. Resilience: secure a stable and reliable supply of trustworthy semiconductors for Europe’s most critical sectors, particularly in times of global disruption or geopolitical uncertainty.

Yep, that all checks out. What self-respecting country or country bloc wouldn't want these things? That's the issue here, it's not what you say, it's how you do it. And competing in the highly-competitive world of semiconductors, especially when you're already behind the times, is going to be excruciatingly tough going.

This is the revised Chips Act, so what happened to the original one?

That's still very much in play, operating to increase the EU share in the "global market value chain by revenue" to 20% by 2030. The big issue is how realistic the act is. Right now, the EU is expected to be around 11.4% by 2030, as laid out in this report on the EU's digital transition. This being so unrealistic is one of the main causes for concern at the original Chips Act, as noted in a special report by the European Court of Auditors, who suggest the target may have been "overly ambitious".

"We recommend that the Commission carries out an urgent reality check and swiftly begins preparing the next strategy," the special report published in April says.

The EU has opened a public consultation on the Chips Act, too, asking for evidence to review the effectiveness of the act.

Well, these many reports won't do very much on their own. The original, surprisingly lightweight declaration suggests a few key topics for a future revision to the Chips Act. Here's the quick version:

Collaboration between industries, supporting tech champions, and fast-tracked legislation.

Public and private investment and cross-industry collaboration, including quantum and AI fields.

Supporting skilled workers.

Supporting the green transition and clean energy.

Foster global collaboration.

There are some fine details in there on specific programs for skilled workers or funding programmes, though most represent points that I think anyone with a half-decent idea of semiconductors would also end up with if tasked with a plan of action for Europe. That's not to say it's ineffective, as it's clearly a signal of intent with powerful backers (every EU member state, don't forget), but the real question remains: how much money is the EU prepared to spend on this?

The US rolled out its own CHIPS and Science Act back in 2022 under the Biden administration, which invested roughly a couple hundred billion dollars into US chipmaking and research. That has ended up being tweaked by the current president, Donald Trump, as he used funds previously awarded to Intel under the act to buy shares in the business instead. This deal struck with Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, who also canned the company's planned European megafab, which was a big part of Europe's optimistic push into more domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Intel still operates a big fab facility in Ireland.

The Trump administration has also pushed Nvidia and AMD into deals relating to their China business, and pushed chip designers (so-called fabless companies) to buy more of their chips from US manufacturing than foreign fabs. You can see the difference between carrot and stick here, right? China also recently rolled out similar measures to block local firms from buying up foreign-made tech, including Nvidia's purpose-made and only very recently green-lit AI chips.

It is a crucial time in Ireland’s digital transformation, with investment in world class broadband by telecom operators, Elaine Carey says.

“Our mobile and broadband networks are world-class, and that is down to the significant investment that telecommunications operators and broadband providers have put into them.

“These networks are critical infrastructure for our country.”

However the rise in artificial intelligence (AI) means that all sectors within telecoms needs to make the most of its benefits, says the new director Nicola Cooke.

“Almost every sector will need to digitise and embrace the benefits and efficiencies of AI, if they are to remain competitive into the future.

“It is the Government’s stated ambition for Ireland to be at the forefront of European and global digital developments, and we want them to work more closely with TII to achieve this.”

Ms Cooke has also been appointed as director of Audiovisual Ireland, the Ibec representative group for the screen industry (animation, independent film and television production, postproduction, television broadcasting and VFX).

The sector employs approximately 16,000 full-time equivalent jobs (FTEs) and has an estimated Gross Value Added in excess of €1bn and is a key part of national cultural life and profiles Ireland as a destination for tourism, it said.

[TITLE]Moldova election results: Who won and did the diaspora play a role?:
[TEXT]
Election was tense amid pro-EU government’s fight to join the bloc and move further away from Russia.

Moldova’s ruling pro-West governing party won a majority in the country’s tense Sunday elections, beating pro-Russian parties by a wide margin amid reported attempts to violently disrupt the vote and allegations of interference by Russia.

Results from more than 99 percent of the polling stations counted by Monday noon showed the Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) clearly in the lead, despite analysis and opinion polls before the vote suggesting that pro-Russian parties would come close and possibly upset the ruling party’s parliamentary majority.

The small country is located between Ukraine and Romania. One of Europe’s poorest states, it was part of the Soviet Republic until 1991. The breakaway, semi-autonomous region of Transnistria, which lies along the border with Ukraine, has traditionally supported ties with Russia.

As a result, in recent years, Moldova has emerged as a battleground for influence between Russia and the West.

In a September 9 speech at the European Parliament, Moldovan President Maia Sandu, founder of PAS, declared that this election would be “the most consequential” in the country’s history.

For Moldovans, the elections represented a crucial turning point. The small country with Russia’s war in Ukraine on its doorstep could either continue on its current path towards European Union membership, or it could fall back into the old fold of Russian influence.

Ultimately, despite reports of pro-Russian groups threatening violence, with at least three people arrested in Moldova, and several bomb scares reported at polling booths abroad, the Moldovan diaspora played a key role in delivering a pro-EU victory.

What was the outcome of Moldova’s election?

Nearly all votes cast at polling stations had been counted by Monday. Some 1.6 million people cast their votes, making
