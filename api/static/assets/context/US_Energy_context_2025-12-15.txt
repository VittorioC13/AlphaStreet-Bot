[TITLE]BW Energy Makes Strategic Angola Entry with Chevron-Operated Block Deal:
[TEXT]
BW Energy has taken a major step into Angola’s offshore sector, striking a joint deal with Maurel & Prom (M&P) to acquire minority stakes in two producing deepwater blocks from Azule Energy, the Eni–BP joint venture that dominates much of the country’s upstream landscape.

Under the agreement, the consortium will purchase a combined 20% interest in Block 14 and 10% in the adjacent Block 14K. BW Energy’s net stake will be 10% in Block 14 and 5% in Block 14K, while M&P will hold the same. The transaction gives BW Energy an immediate producing foothold in Angola—one of Africa’s most established oil provinces—and positions the company for future operated developments in the region.

“Entry into Angola is a key step in BW Energy’s West Africa growth strategy,” CEO Carl K. Arnet said. “We see clear upsides beyond current production in Block 14 and the opportunity to develop stranded assets using existing infrastructure.”

Block 14, operated by Chevron, is a mature deepwater hub with nine producing fields and gross output of around 40,000 barrels per day. BW Energy’s share will total roughly 4,000 bpd. Block 14K, a cross-border tie-back between Angola and Congo, delivers an additional 2,000 bpd via existing facilities.

Net producing reserves for BW Energy are estimated at 9.3 million barrels, with scope for further recovery gains through additional infill drilling and development work. The licenses run until 2038, and decommissioning obligations are already provisioned.

The acquisition carries a base consideration of $97.5 million for BW Energy and the same for M&P, with each company paying a $6 million upfront deposit. Contingent payments of up to $57.5 million per party may be triggered if Brent crude exceeds set thresholds between 2026 and 2028 or if production milestones linked to the PKBB development are met.

Regulatory approval from Angola’s National Oil, Gas and Biofuels Agency (ANPG) is required, with closing expected by mid-2026.

For BW Energy—fresh off drilling progress in Namibia’s Kudu area—the deal marks another building block in a strategy focused on developing proven reserves and leveraging existing infrastructure in Africa’s mature basins.

[TITLE]Trump plans envision major U.S. investment in Russia, restoring oil flows to Europe, WSJ says:
[TEXT]
MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for peace in Ukraine includes proposals to restore Russian energy flows to Europe, major U.S. investment in Russian rare earths and energy, and tapping frozen Russian sovereign assets, the Wall Street Journal said.

The newspaper said the plans were detailed in appendices to peace proposals handed to European counterparts over recent weeks.

They include a plan for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap $200 billion of frozen Russian sovereign assets for projects in Ukraine, including a major new data center powered by the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces, the paper said.

U.S. companies would invest in Russian strategic sectors such as rare-earth extraction and oil drilling in the Arctic, while Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the world would be restored, it added.

The paper said one unidentified European official compared the proposed U.S.-Russian energy deals to an economic version of the 1945 Yalta conference.

At that meeting, the victors of World War Two, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, divided up their spheres of interest in Europe.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, formed of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies in deal for Namibia offshore oil field:
[TEXT]
TotalEnergies will join Portuguese firm Galp to operate Namibia's Mopane oil field, which could contain at least 10 billion barrels, according to estimates - Copyright GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP Andrew Harnik

TotalEnergies said Tuesday it had reached a deal to become a partner in the Mopane oil field off the coast of Namibia, where exploration remains underway.

The deal with Galp will see TotalEnergies joining the Portuguese firm as an operator as more exploration wells are drilled in view to develop the field for production.

“The transaction positions TotalEnergies as the operator of the two largest oil discoveries in Namibia and opens the way for the development of a major producing hub, generating long-term value for the country and partners,” the French firm said in a statement.

Galp said last year it estimated the Mopane field could contain at least 10 billion barrels of oil.

The deal will see TotalEnergies take a 40 percent stake in the petroleum exploration licence that includes Mopane. Galp will retain a 40 percent stake, alongside the Namibian national oil company Namcor and private firm Custos, which each hold 10 percent stakes.

In exchange, TotalEnergies will finance half of Galp’s capital expenditures for exploration and appraisal of the Mopane field, as well as initial development, with repayment to come from future cash flows from the project.

Galp will also get a 10 percent stake in the nearby Venus exploration zone, where TotalEnergies has discovered oil.

TotalEnergies said it hopes to make a final investment decision on whether to develop production at Venus next year.

TotalEnergies shares were up 0.4 percent in afternoon trading on the Paris stock exchange, where the blue-chip CAC 40 index was down 0.6 percent.

The government has notified the new Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, bringing into force a modern regulatory framework aimed at attracting investment and improving ease of doing business in the oil and gas sector.The rules, issued under the recently approved Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Act, 2025, replace the earlier system of multiple licences with a single petroleum lease covering exploration, development and production of all hydrocarbons, including shale, according to a gazette notification.The new framework provides lease tenures of up to 30 years, extendable for the full economic life of a field, with terms protected from adverse changes. Criminal penalties for violations have been removed and replaced with higher financial penalties of Rs 25 lakh, plus Rs 10 lakh per day for continuing breaches. The rules also allow lessees to share infrastructure to improve operational efficiency.Environmental provisions have mandated time-bound plans for zero gas flaring and reduced greenhouse emissions.Applications for petroleum leases must now be decided within 180 days, and disputes may be resolved through an expedited mechanism, including a neutral arbitration seat for foreign investors.The Oil Industry Safety Directorate has been designated as the competent authority for offshore safety, audits and standard-setting in exploration and production operations.Commenting on the move, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said, "In a landmark moment today, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, have been amended to offer ease of business and operations".With a broader spectrum of rights under one petroleum lease, the lessees will have the right to carry out all types of mineral oil operations under one petroleum lease, he said, adding that they may undertake decarbonisation and comprehensive energy projects at oilfields.Application for the grant of a petroleum lease will be decided within 180 days. Long-term leases of up to 30 years may be granted and may be extended up to the economic life of the field, allowing the lessee to make a planned investment decision.Lessees will make an annual declaration to the government of the installed, utilised and excess capacity of the infrastructure facilities owned by it, he said.The new rules permit lessees to jointly develop or share infrastructure facilities by mutual agreement.Seat of arbitration of lease and contractual disputes, where all lessees or contractors are companies incorporated in India, will be New Delhi. Where any member is a foreign company as defined in the Companies Act, a neutral seat of arbitration may be opted for.Rules require NOCs to promptly notify all existing and new discoveries, submit field development plans within prescribed time limits, obtain central government approval for development areas, and regularly report development and production activities. Vedanta Group chairman Anil Agarwal said, "Notifying the landmark reforms to India's oil and gas regulatory framework" is "a truly historic development"."The world has long recognised India's vast untapped hydrocarbon potential, and these new rules finally create the environment needed to unlock it," he said."India produces some of the most affordable oil and gas globally. These reforms will directly benefit consumers - especially the poorest - by enabling greater domestic production and reducing dependence on imports."He said this is the kind of bold, inclusive policy that transformed the United States from a major importer into an energy surplus nation."I never imagined I would witness such a reform in my lifetime. Our energy security is both our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity. With these changes, I am confident that India can produce at least 50 per cent of its energy domestically."

[TITLE]Atlantica Closes the Acquisition of Statkraft's Renewable Energy Platform in Canada:
[TEXT]
December 10, 2025 – Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure today announced it completed the previously announced acquisition of a Canadian renewable energy platform, marking an important milestone in the Company’s growth strategy in North America.

The platform includes 236 MW in operation and a 0.6 GW pipeline of renewable and storage projects and a small team of experienced employees who have joined Atlantica. This acquisition expands Atlantica’s presence in the Canadian market and strengthens its position in the broader North American renewables sector.

The operating portfolio includes a 51% stake in l’Érable, a 100 MW wind facility in Quebec, in operation since 2013, and a 136 MW wind asset in Alberta that began operations in early 2025. Both assets are backed by long-term PPAs with investment-grade counterparties, with an average remaining contract life of approximately 13 years. The platform also adds approximately 0.6 GW of solar, wind, and storage projects under development across several Canadian provinces, further strengthening Atlantica’s position in Canada.

In addition, Atlantica successfully closed the project financing of Winnifred with National Bank of Canada.

Santiago Seage, Atlantica’s CEO, said: “This transaction is a key step in our North American growth strategy. We are pleased to welcome the new team members to Atlantica. The integration of this experienced local team will complement our existing Canadian operations and enhance our capabilities to capture future growth opportunities across the region”. Santiago added: “This acquisition significantly expands our presence in a core market with attractive growth prospects.”

Atlantica previously announced in August 2025 that it had signed an agreement to acquire this platform. Following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the transaction has now successfully closed.

[TITLE]Electricity Metering in Nigeria: NERC Reports 187k New Meter:
[TEXT]
Nigeria’s metering performance improved between September and October 2025, with 187,765 electricity customers newly metered nationwide, according to the latest metering factsheet released by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission.

The document shows that 80,943 customers received meters in September, while another 106,822 were metered in October. It indicated that the sustained meter rollout pushed the national metering rate from 55.37 per cent in September to 56.07 per cent in October.

During the same period, the country’s active electricity customer base grew from 12,030,315 to 12,071,018, reflecting an addition of 40,703 new customers. NERC’s figures indicate that the number of metered customers rose from 6,661,564 at the end of September to 6,768,386 by October, leaving 5,302,632 customers still on estimated billing.

The improvement might be partly linked to ongoing interventions such as the Meter Acquisition Fund and other metering programmes, which began yielding visible gains in the fourth quarter of the year.

According to the NERC report, Ikeja Electric posted the highest metering rate in the country at 85.59 per cent, with 1,113,421 of its 1,300,940 active customers captured. Eko Electric followed closely at 84.75 per cent, while Abuja Electric achieved 75.82 per cent.

However, four distribution companies — Yola, Jos, Kaduna, and Kano — remained below the 35 per cent threshold. Yola Disco ranked lowest at 28.92 per cent, followed by Jos (29.74 per cent), Kaduna (33.72 per cent), and Kano (34.50 per cent).

It was noted that Aba Power made the most notable progress in the month under review, installing 18,906 new meters and raising its metering rate from 69.49 per cent in September to 78.20 per cent in October, a 3.3 percentage-point jump.

Abuja Disco added 19,118 meters, while Ikeja installed 17,046, and Ibadan followed with 15,739 during the same period. The remaining DisCos, including Benin, Enugu, Port Harcourt, and Eko, accounted for the balance of the October installations.

Despite the significant gains, NERC’s report shows that more than 5.3 million electricity customers remain unmetered across the country. With metering now crossing the 56 per cent mark after years of stagnation around 50–55 per cent, sector observers believe that sustained progress through the end of 2025 could push Nigeria closer to achieving the long-delayed goal of universal metering.

Recently, NERC accused DisCos of not doing enough in metering. NERC Vice Chairman, Dr Musiliu Oseni, at the recently held 4th NESI Stakeholders Meeting in Abuja, revealed that there are currently 600,000 to 700,000 meters available in the country.

He challenged utilities to improve publicity and rollout speed, noting that the government has made the investment, so the DisCos need to step up. NERC Commissioner for Corporate Services, Nathan Shatti, told the DisCos to stop behaving as if they were doing customers a favour.

Reviewing the data on Meter Asset Provider refunds and installations, Shatti highlighted the “poor performance” of specific utilities, noting that Abuja and Kano DisCos have achieved only 2 per cent compliance on refunds.

Addressing the backlog of paid-for but uninstalled meters, he rejected technical excuses, saying, “If your network is not ready for metering, do not collect people’s money.”

He further observed that for every transformer or meter not installed, DisCos incur losses; hence, it is in their interest to meter customers and fix transformer-related issues. Shatti also revealed that over 350,000 meters are yet to be migrated to the new STS standard, demanding immediate cleanup of obsolete data.
