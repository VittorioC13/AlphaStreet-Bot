[TITLE]Greece To Supply Ukraine With US Natural Gas For Winter:
[TEXT]
By Sotiris Nikas

Nov 16, 2025 (Bloomberg) –Ukraine said it’s reached an agreement with Greece that will help secure the supply of natural gas for the coming winter heating season.

Following a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Athens on Sunday, the two sides announced that Greece’s Depa Commercial SA would supply Ukraine’s Naftogaz with US natural gas from December through March.

From the very first days of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Greece has been helping us, working together with Europe and with other partners so that we can reach the conditions under which peace becomes possible. And we truly value your support and your commitment. Today we have an… pic.twitter.com/tN83Mjnamh — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / ????????? ?????????? (@ZelenskyyUa) November 16, 2025

“Ukraine gets direct access to diversified and reliable energy sources, while Greece now becomes a hub for supplying central and eastern Europe with American liquefied natural gas,” Mitsotakis said.

The deal comes as Ukraine races to secure energy for winter after Russian airstrikes in the past month wiped out more than half of its domestic natural gas production. Kremlin forces continue regular attacks on Ukraine’s power infrastructure, causing widespread outages to gas, heating and electricity generation.

Under the framework of the prospective agreement between DEPA and Naftogaz, LNG originating from the US is expected to be transported through “Route 1,” offered jointly by the gas transmission system operators of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, the companies said.

The agreement comes as Greece seeks to become a gas-transportation hub for the region and Europe works toward a complete ban on Russian supplies. Earlier this month, Atlantic See — a subsidiary of Depa and Aktor — signed a deal with Venture Global for the purchase of at least 0.5 million tonnes per year of US liquefied natural gas for 20 years, starting in 2030.

Deliveries of American LNG have already increased, and the southern European country wants to have a key role in importing and exporting LNG via the so-called Vertical Corridor — a project to expand transit capacity for LNG flowing into Greece and moving northward to countries including Romania and Hungary as well as Ukraine.

[TITLE]Agreement for the Transfer of American LNG from Greece to Ukraine – Signed in the presence of Mitsotakis, Zelenskyy, and Gillfoyle:
[TEXT]
Newsroom November 16 03:13

An agreement has been signed between DEPA Commercial and Naftogaz for the supply of American LNG to Ukraine from December 2025 to March 2026. The signing took place in Athens during the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in the presence of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and U.S. Ambassador Kimberly Gillfoyle.

This agreement represents a critical contribution to regional and European energy security and resilience, supporting Ukraine during a difficult winter. Greek government sources emphasize that Greece’s vital energy infrastructure ensures stable gas flows along the Vertical Corridor.

The deal outlines the transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States via “Route 1,” a network operated jointly by the transmission system operators of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine. This collaboration between DEPA Commercial and Naftogaz aims to diversify supply sources and routes, enhancing energy solidarity and strengthening regional security.

Konstantinos Xifaras, CEO of DEPA Commercial, highlighted that the agreement provides a “bridge of energy” between Greek and Ukrainian infrastructures, supporting broader European energy resilience. The supply of American LNG will be managed through ATLANTIC – SEE, a company in which DEPA holds a 40% stake, underscoring DEPA’s commitment to delivering practical and secure energy solutions throughout Southeast Europe.

Sergii Koretskyi, CEO of Naftogaz, noted that the agreement opens a reliable new import route for the upcoming winter, expanding Ukraine’s supply geography to ensure dependable heating for its citizens and strengthen energy security across the region. He expressed gratitude to DEPA Commercial and acknowledged the Ukrainian government’s role in making the deal possible.

Naftogaz is Ukraine’s leading vertically integrated energy company and a cornerstone of the country’s energy security. Its operations span exploration, production, transportation, storage, wholesale and retail supply of gas and oil, as well as electricity and heat generation. The company’s strategy focuses on diversifying supply sources and routes, actively participating in international gas markets, and investing in renewable energy such as photovoltaics, small-scale LNG, green hydrogen, and biomethane. Naftogaz aims to establish Ukraine as a reliable energy hub while supporting a sustainable energy transition.

DEPA Commercial is one of Greece’s most advanced and comprehensive energy groups, playing a key role in shaping the domestic energy market and serving as a pillar of national energy security. Its portfolio includes gas supply and trading, electricity, power generation, renewables, and alternative fuels like hydrogen, biomethane, and small-scale LNG. Its strategic focus lies on diversifying sources and routes, maintaining a flexible LNG portfolio, and having an active international presence. Through the ATLANTIC – SEE LNG TRADE joint venture, DEPA strengthens regional LNG trading and energy interconnections while investing in electricity generation and green transition, shaping Greece’s energy future.

[TITLE]Five Greek cross-border energy projects set to redraw the Eastern Mediterranean and Eastern Europe map:
[TEXT]
Newsroom November 16 08:56

Five major Greek-led cross-border initiatives are reshaping the energy landscape of the Eastern Mediterranean and Eastern Europe. Greece’s plans to become a regional gateway for energy gained new momentum after a series of agreements—signed in the presence of senior U.S. government officials and energy-sector representatives—during the Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Ministerial Meeting (P-TEC), held in Athens on November 6–7.

The project’s concern:

A new “vertical” natural gas corridor originating in Greece

A long-term agreement to import U.S. LNG and re-export it across the region

The electricity interconnection between Greece and Egypt

A proposal to supply Cyprus with natural gas from Israeli fields

Offshore drilling in the Ionian Sea to explore a potential natural gas target

Environment and Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou told the Athens–Macedonian News Agency (APE):

“The 6th session of the Transatlantic Energy Partnership (P-TEC), which concluded in Athens a few days ago, left a strong geopolitical footprint for Greece and the entire Eastern Mediterranean. This was not a meeting of words and declarations but of concrete agreements and decisions in the energy sector—with results that hold immediate and long-term value.

We capitalized on our country’s unique geographic position, its infrastructure, the clear commitment of the EU and the United States to move away from Russian gas, and Greece’s political and economic stability. As a result, Greece is becoming a gateway for American LNG to Europe and a secure starting point for the new development corridor toward Northeastern and Central Europe, while reducing Turkey’s influence on the new energy map.

Greek energy companies stood shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the world’s largest energy giants, demonstrating credibility and expertise. During P-TEC, they signed agreements of great and multi-layered significance—both for today’s energy landscape and for the decade ahead.

The work continues. We must now implement all agreements swiftly and consistently, strengthening the central artery of growth and stability for our region and for Europe as a whole.”

The Five Projects in Detail

1. The Vertical Gas Corridor

At P-TEC, the gas transmission operators (TSOs) of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine jointly submitted a request to their national energy regulators to approve two new cross-border supply routes—Route 2 and Route 3.

Route 2 will originate at the Alexandroupolis floating LNG terminal, and Route 3 will begin from the transnational TAP pipeline. Route 1, which starts from the Revithoussa LNG terminal, has already been approved.

Approval of the new routes—combined with tariff reductions and upgrades to network capacity—will enable greater volumes of gas to transit through Greece, replacing Russian gas, which under EU decisions must cease flowing to member states by the end of 2027.

These routes will also allow natural gas deliveries to Ukraine.

2. U.S. LNG Supply and Regional Re-Exports

ATLANTIC–SEE LNG TRADE (a joint venture of the AKTOR Group and DEPA Emporia) signed a 20-year agreement with U.S.-based Venture Global to import 0.5–1.5 million tonnes of LNG annually from 2030 onward. This marks Greece’s first long-term LNG supply contract with a major U.S. producer.

The company also signed 20-year Memoranda of Understanding—also beginning in 2030—with Ukraine’s Naftogaz (up to 0.7 million tonnes annually) and with Romania’s NOVA POWER & GAS and Transgaz (up to 1.4 million tonnes annually) for LNG sales.

3. Greece–Egypt Electricity Interconnection

This is a 3,000-MW electricity interconnection that includes 9.5 GW of renewable energy capacity (wind and solar) to be developed in Egypt. The project is led by Elica Interconnector of the Copelouzos Group and is currently undergoing detailed seabed mapping.

According to the company, 60 Greek industrial firms have already signed agreements to purchase power through the interconnector, with roughly one-third of the electricity intended for re-export.

4. Supplying Cyprus with Natural Gas

Energean—a company of Greek interests—has proposed supplying Cyprus with natural gas from the Israeli fields it operates. Under the proposal submitted to the governments of Cyprus and Israel, Energean would construct a new undersea pipeline linking the “Energean Power” FPSO in Israeli waters directly to Cyprus.

Israel’s Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, Eli Cohen, expressed strong support, noting that gas sales to Cyprus would enhance Israel’s regional and European standing, contribute to stability and prosperity, and generate significant state revenue.

The gas would come from Israel’s Katlan field.

5. Ionian Sea Drilling

A $100 million drilling project in “Block 2,” west of Corfu, is now a realistic prospect after ExxonMobil agreed to join the exploration consortium, acquiring stakes from Energean and Helleniq. The final decision will depend on the reassessment of seismic data; if positive, Greece could proceed with the development of production wells and the installation of the required extraction, processing, and transport infrastructure, at a total investment of around $5 billion.

A commercially viable hydrocarbons discovery would be a milestone—both for Greece and for the EU—especially if quantities can meaningfully contribute to regional energy needs.

Also under consideration is the Great Sea Interconnector, which would link Greece, Cyprus, and Israel, for which updated studies and new investors are being sought.

[TITLE]Oil Stabilizes After Selloff Amid OPEC Reassessment and U.S. Funding Deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices steadied on Wednesday after a sharp 4% slide the day before, with Brent trading near $63.08 and WTI around $58.80 at 11:01 a.m. ET, as traders reassessed the latest OPEC shift toward a more balanced 2026 market outlook. The passage of the U.S. funding deal that ended the government shutdown removed one macro problem, but crude remained focused on supply signals rather than broader risk sentiment.

The modest rebound contrasted with the equity rally highlighted by Bloomberg, where U.S. indices advanced on softer inflation readings, renewed risk appetite and relief following the shutdown resolution. The move in equities had limited pull on crude, which stayed driven by evolving supply projections and near-term balance concerns.

The recovery follows Tuesday’s selloff linked to OPEC’s updated projections, which show the cartel moving away from its earlier deficit view and toward a neutral supply-demand balance next year. Traders reacted to signals that rising non-OPEC output and incremental OPEC+ barrels could offset moderate consumption growth. Those factors, combined with a softer demand trajectory outlined in the IEA’s latest assessment, left the market focused on potential surplus risk.

Diesel margins firmed during the session, while crude futures recovered more slowly. Murban traded near 65.43 on steady Asian buying and stable demand for middle distillates. Natural gas edged toward 4.62, supported by early-season heating needs and lower storage levels.

The Bloomberg update showed equities rising as Treasury yields fell, but that shift offered little lift to crude. Traders said oil remains tied to OPEC+ supply decisions and demand expectations through early 2026, not the broader market mood.

A softer dollar and lower Treasury yields added some support to commodities, though they did not shift the outlook for crude supplies. Asia continued to take regular cargoes, and early-winter demand for diesel and jet fuel stayed firm. Traders said many positions were still small following Tuesday’s selloff as the market waits for guidance on upcoming OPEC+ output levels and demand expectations for early 2026.

[TITLE]Norway’s Oil Industry Raises 2026 Investment Forecast:
[TEXT]
Energy operators offshore Norway expect to invest $24.8 billion (249 billion Norwegian crowns) in oil and gas activities next year, Statistics Norway’s latest quarterly survey showed on Thursday.

The estimate is $1.9 billion higher compared to the previous quarter’s forecast, mainly driven by higher forecasts of investments in field development and operating fields, the Norwegian statistics office said.

The increased estimate of investment in field development is chiefly pushed up by higher costs being reported for some development projects.

Since the autumn of 2024, the total costs of the ongoing projects have increased by

[TITLE]Global LNG Glut Could Upend Prices by 2026:
[TEXT]
Global LNG supply is rising and growth will accelerate in the next two years as major projects in the top exporters, the United States and China, come on stream.

Supply growth is set to outpace the global LNG demand increase, leading to an oversupplied market from the end of 2026 onwards, analysts say.

The coming glut will likely depress spot LNG prices in Asia, where the price-sensitive buyers such as South Asian importers India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh could benefit from the price drop and boost demand.

For Europe, the expected LNG oversupply would be welcome news as the EU moved to ban Russian gas and LNG from 2027 and will be looking to buy even higher volumes of the super-chilled fuel to fill the gap left by the planned halt of Russian gas imports.

If LNG prices are lower, all the better for the EU budgets and its energy security. That’s if the EU moves to significantly scale back its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which places additional barriers to LNG flows to Europe, according to gas producers, traders, the United States, and Qatar.

Related: US Oil Drilling Picks Up: Baker Hughes

If the sustainability directive remains as-is, importers of LNG may have to divert cargoes away from the EU as of 2027 due to non-compliance with the legislation, which would reduce gas supply just as Europe will have phased out Russian gas flows.

At any rate, global LNG supply is set to jump by 10.2% from this year to 475 million metric tons next year, per data from Kpler cited by Reuters columnist Clyde Russell.

The projected growth in LNG supply would equal the total annual demand of South Korea, which is currently the world’s third-largest LNG importer behind China and Japan.

Most of the supply increase will come from the United States by 2027, after which Qatar’s mega expansion of LNG supply capacity and newly approved U.S. projects will hit the market.

The U.S. is set to export 14.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG this year, up by 25% from 2024, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) this week. Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana has ramped up exports more quickly than the EIA expected, leading the administration to raise its forecast of LNG exports in the current quarter by 3% compared with last month’s outlook. The EIA expects U.S. LNG exports to increase by an additional 10% in 2026.

The supply wave of U.S. LNG will continue through this decade as LNG developers are taking advantage of market and regulatory tailwinds to approve investments in new projects.

“There’s a period of time when it would appear we’re going to see more supply coming into the market than demand will be able to absorb,” Chevron’s CEO Mike Wirth told Bloomberg TV this week.

“That probably results in lower spot prices,” Wirth added.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) also warned of oversupply in LNG markets in its annual World Energy Outlook out this week.

Available global LNG supply is set to surge by 50% by 2030, according to the agency, which estimates that about half of the new capacity is being built in the United States, and a further 20% in Qatar.

“Natural gas demand has been revised up in this year’s WEO, but questions still linger about where all the new LNG will go,” the agency noted.

The unprecedented momentum in U.S. LNG development raises the question about the risk of prolonged oversupply, Kristy Kramer, Head of LNG Strategy and Market Development at Wood Mackenzie, says.

But the wave of new supply meets robust fundamentals worldwide, Kramer wrote in an analysis.

European demand for LNG is expected to rise further as the EU shakes off dependence on Russia, while fundamentals in Asia remain “equally strong,” Kramer added.

“Lower prices will enhance LNG's affordability and potentially trigger the next phase of demand growth,” the strategist noted.

Spot LNG prices are headed higher in the near term with the peak demand during the winter in the northern hemisphere. Any material drop in prices could become visible in the latter part of 2026, if Europe hasn’t depleted its gas reserves in the winter and doesn’t need large volumes of LNG to fill up for the following winter when Russian LNG would no longer be a supply option.

[TITLE]A seven-year-old merger plan for insurance weaklings is being dusted off the shelves:
[TEXT]
The Centre is weighing a massive restructuring of National Insurance Co., Oriental Insurance Co., and United India Insurance Co., potentially involving a merger, privatization or both.

The Union finance ministry is discussing various options for the future of the three weak general insurers, the people mentioned above said on the condition of anonymity. These include merging two of them with the listed and profitable New India Assurance; merging all three; and merging only two and preparing the third for privatization.

“The Centre is seeking a structure that aligns with the policy to limit the number of state-owned companies in non-strategic sectors to one or two, while retaining a minimum of four in strategic sectors," one of the two people said on the condition of anonymity. General insurance falls under the non-strategic category.

The discussions are at an early stage, and any decision will follow a deeper study of each insurer’s solvency profile, integration challenges, and the fiscal implications of further capital support, the people cited above added.

Queries emailed to the finance ministry and the four insurers went unanswered.

Back from the back-burner

The discussions to strengthen India's state-owned insurers mark the revival of a seven-year-old plan.

The 2018 plan to merge and subsequently list the three general insurers failed as they battled heavy losses and low solvency margins, leading to repeated capital injections by the government. Despite weak solvency ratios and dependence on regulatory forbearance, all three reported profits in at least some quarters of fiscal year 2025 (FY25), bringing the consolidation plan back on the agenda.

“This time, the conversation is more pragmatic," the second person mentioned above said. “The focus is on what is feasible, what strengthens the sector, and what limits future fiscal exposure."

Discussions to consolidate insurance companies are unfolding alongside similar efforts to reshape India's public banking sector.

Policy push

“It is the government's stated policy to have bare minimum presence of PSUs in the strategic sector, with the remaining to be privatized or merged, or subsidiarized with other central public sector enterprises, or closed," said C.R. Vijayan, former secretary general of the General Insurance Council, adding it is "very natural" that the government attempts merger or privatization in the sector.

Consolidation began with banking, and the same would be rolled out for insurance companies, Vijayan said. "How it is done would be decided by the government. But it will be done now."

Others pointed out that with the insurance sector now fully open to foreign direct investment (FDI), public sector insurers must urgently prepare for a far more competitive marketplace. The move is set to reshape the market: more global players are expected to enter or expand, bringing capital, technology, and product innovation that will pressure public sector insurers to modernise, improve efficiency, and strengthen customer service.

“Competition elevates the quality of customer focus and the need to bring

[TITLE]RE sector financing doubles as outstanding loans surge 2x in Sep:
[TEXT]
Indian banks are bullish on India’s renewable energy (RE) sector with loans outstanding to the sector as of September, more than doubling year-on-year (y-o-y).

Data from RBI shows that the outstanding credit to the renewable energy sector stood at ₹14,842 crore as of September 2025 as against ₹6,778 crore in the same period last year.

The growth significantly outpaces the rate of growth in other priority sectors like agriculture, MSMEs and Housing and is also up compared to the 39 per cent y-o-y growth from the September 2023 to September 2024 period

Speaking to businessline, industry experts said the increase in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution with GST reductions and favourable policy landscape pushing projects that were previously on hold to the implementation stage.

Healthy growth

Sachin Sachdeva, Vice President, Sector Head - Financial Sector Ratings , ICRA Ltd, said the overall growth of renewable energy sector remains healthy with significant capacity additions taking place y-o-y. “Consequently, a large part of the funding goes towards the under-construction projects as the already developed project would primarily have refinancing requirements,” he added.

Sachdeva noted that large infrastructure non-banking finance companies (NBFC-IFCs), who have a big play in the RE space, have also seen their assets under management (AUM) grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 30 per cent over the last two years.

Ramneek Sehgal, Chairman & Managing Director of infrastructure firm Ceigall India Ltd, noted that the surge in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution rather than just pipeline build-up, especially in the solar energy sector.

“With the sharp reduction in solar module prices and the ramp-up of domestic manufacturing capacity, many projects that were previously on hold have now moved into the implementation stage,” he said. Sehgal added that the solar sector has opened up after a period of supply-side constraints and policy adjustments with 42 Giga Watt of solar capacity additions expected in FY26.

Overall installed RE capacity in India as of October 2025 stood at around 2 lakh Mega Watt (MW) (excluding Large Hydro Power) with 27,927 MW added in the April-Oct 2025 period.

Vivek Jain, Director, India Ratings and Research said, “When we look at the loans outstanding it is a combination of both under-construction and commissioned projects and hence we see a significant jump in loans outstanding,” he added. Jain mentions that this trend will persist if under-construction projects continue at the same pace but if their pace declines, the loan growth would appear slower than capacity growth.

Costs moderating

Experts added that the rise in financing is more reflective of expanding execution activity rather than cost inflation.

“Input and equipment costs have largely stabilised over the past year. In fact, the reduction in GST and improved domestic supply chains have helped offset earlier cost pressures. Across the industry, scale efficiencies and better value engineering are enabling developers to optimize overall project costs,” Sehgal said.

Sachdeva from ICRA says project costs have generally trended downward and the growth in funding to the sector seems to be primarily driven by capacity additions taking place at a faster pace.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies agrees renewable power deal with Google for Ohio data centres:
[TEXT]
Oil major TotalEnergies has agreed a 15-year power purchase deal to supply Alphabet's Google with 1.5 terawatt hours of renewable electricity from its Montpelier solar farm in Ohio, the French company said on Wednesday.

The solar facility, which is nearing completion, is connected to the PJM grid, the largest in the United States, and will help power Google’s data centre operations in the state, it said.

"This agreement illustrates TotalEnergies’s ability to meet the growing energy demands of major tech companies by leveraging its integrated portfolio of renewable and flexible assets," said Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables and Power at TotalEnergies.

The company's growing investment in electricity is helping the company secure a steadier revenue stream and avoid the boom-and-bust cycles typical of oil and gas, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said earlier this month at the ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi.

The Paris-listed firm is deploying a 10 gigawatt portfolio in the United States, with onshore solar, wind and battery storage projects.

[TITLE]Turbo Energy to pilot tokenized financing for renewable energy projects on Stellar:
[TEXT]
Turbo Energy (Nasdaq: TURB) is launching a pilot project to tokenize financing for hybrid renewable energy systems, starting with an on-site solar and battery installation at a supermarket in Spain. The initiative aims to demonstrate how blockchain-based debt instruments can fund distributed energy projects.

The project is being developed in collaboration with digital asset infrastructure firm Taurus and the Stellar Development Foundation. According to an announcement, the pilot will test how tokenized financing can support liquidity and improve capital access to renewable energy funding.

Energy-as-a-Service is a model that allows customers to pay for energy use or performance without owning any equipment. It allows businesses to access clean energy through subscription-style contracts while providers handle installation, maintenance and operation.

The pilot will tokenize debt financing for on-site Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) using Turbo Energy’s SUNBOX solar storage systems. The model aims to create a scalable framework for financing commercial and industrial solar projects worldwide.

Taurus will issue and manage Turbo Energy’s renewable-energy tokens using the Stellar blockchain, which will enable fractional, onchain financing, allowing more investors to participate in funding clean-energy projects.

According to data from Grand View Research cited by Turbo Energy, the global EaaS sector was valued at $74.43 billion in 2024 and is expected to more than double to $145.18 billion by 2030.

Clean energy in blockchain

In Bitcoin’s early years, critics often claimed that its heavy energy use made it harmful to the environment. While it is true that Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains consume significant amounts of electricity to secure their networks, innovation within the crypto ecosystem is also driving eco-friendly solutions.

In January, Italian renewable energy company Enel Group teamed up with crypto wallet company Conio to let investors buy tokenized shares of solar panels on the Algorand blockchain. The offering allowed Italian investors to purchase fractional ownership in Enel’s solar farms and apply the generated energy to offset power consumption in their homes.

In October, Thopen, a Brazilian solar power company, announced it was considering a pivot into Bitcoin mining to “absorb local generated energy” from the country’s renewable sector.

In August, the UK-based publicly traded company Union Jack Oil, announced plans to use natural gas from undeveloped wells to generate electricity for Bitcoin mining.
