(NASDAQ: QNRX) (the “Company” or “Quoin”), a late clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on rare and orphan diseases, today announced that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with new healthcare focused institutional investors with the potential to raise up to $104.5 million in gross proceeds, including initial upfront funding of $16.5 million and up to an additional $88.0 million upon the potential cash exercise of accompanying warrants at the election of the investors. The private placement was priced at a premium to the Company’s prior day’s closing stock price.

The financing includes participation from new healthcare-focused investors, including AIGH Capital Management, Soleus Capital, Nantahala Capital, Diadema Partners, Stonepine Capital Management, ADAR1 Capital Management, and Velan Capital, among others.

The accompanying warrants will consist of four tranches:

Series H warrants to purchase up to 1,993,940 ADSs at an exercise price of $9.075 per ADS for an aggregate exercise price of up to $18.1 million. The Series H warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the Company’s public announcement that the Company has received Type C meeting minutes from the FDA indicating openness to baseline-controlled pivotal studies for QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance.

Series I warrants to purchase up to 1,993,940 ADSs at an exercise price of $10.3125 per ADS for an aggregate exercise price of up to $20.6 million. The Series I warrants are immediately exercisable and expire as follows: 50% of the Series I warrants will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the Company’s public announcement that the primary endpoint has been met in the monotherapy pivotal trial of QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance; and the remaining 50% of Series I warrants will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the Company’s public announcement that the primary endpoint has been met in the adjuvant pivotal trial of QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance.

Series J warrants to purchase up to 1,993,940 ADSs at an exercise price of $12.375 per ADS for an aggregate exercise price of up to $24.7 million. The Series J warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the public announcement of the receipt of either accelerated or traditional approval by the FDA of QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance.
