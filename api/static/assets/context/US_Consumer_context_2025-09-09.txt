[TITLE]With return of three pandas to China, U.S. could soon have none:
[TEXT]
HONG KONG — Some of the last giant pandas in the United States are heading back to China.

The National Zoo announced last month that its three pandas — Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their 3-year-old male cub, Xiao Qi Ji — will return to China by Nov. 15, earlier than expected.

Panda fans have been flocking to say goodbye to the black-and-white bears, who have long been one of the zoo’s main attractions.

“It’s probably going to be a long time, possibly one of the last times I see a panda in captivity,” Ryan Nickol, who has traveled from Pennsylvania to see the pandas multiple times in recent weeks, told NBC News. “So it’s pretty frustrating and also a little sad.”

Their departure leaves Zoo Atlanta as the only one in the U.S. with a giant panda program. But the loan agreement for the zoo’s four pandas expires next year, raising the prospect that there could be no pandas in the U.S. for the first time since 1972.

The U.S. is not the only country facing the loss of the beloved bears, which China has long gifted to other countries in what is dubbed “panda diplomacy.” The only pair of pandas in Britain is set to return to China from the Edinburgh Zoo by the end of the year, while Australia and China are negotiating the extension of a loan agreement for two pandas at the Adelaide Zoo that expires next year.

Depending on what happens, all three countries could be panda-less by 2024.

The panda exodus comes as the U.S. and its allies are at odds with China over a number of issues including trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and China’s stance on wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. Both the U.S. and China have expressed interest in improving ties, and President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet in San Francisco this month, their first interaction in a year.

Animal keepers and curators at the National Zoo have been preparing the pandas for their 20-hour journey by crate-training them.

“The pandas absolutely love their crates,” said animal keeper Mariel Lally, who is traveling with them on a chartered FedEx flight. “Some pandas, like Mei Xiang, actually don’t want to leave their crate.”

“We have to bribe them with food to get them out of it,” she added.

The pandas are expected to spend much of the flight sleeping and eating. The zoo plans to bring
