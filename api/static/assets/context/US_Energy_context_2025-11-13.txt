[TITLE]Turbo Energy to pilot tokenized financing for renewable energy projects on Stellar:
[TEXT]
Turbo Energy (Nasdaq: TURB) is launching a pilot project to tokenize financing for hybrid renewable energy systems, starting with an on-site solar and battery installation at a supermarket in Spain. The initiative aims to demonstrate how blockchain-based debt instruments can fund distributed energy projects.

The project is being developed in collaboration with digital asset infrastructure firm Taurus and the Stellar Development Foundation. According to an announcement, the pilot will test how tokenized financing can support liquidity and improve capital access to renewable energy funding.

Energy-as-a-Service is a model that allows customers to pay for energy use or performance without owning any equipment. It allows businesses to access clean energy through subscription-style contracts while providers handle installation, maintenance and operation.

The pilot will tokenize debt financing for on-site Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) using Turbo Energy’s SUNBOX solar storage systems. The model aims to create a scalable framework for financing commercial and industrial solar projects worldwide.

Taurus will issue and manage Turbo Energy’s renewable-energy tokens using the Stellar blockchain, which will enable fractional, onchain financing, allowing more investors to participate in funding clean-energy projects.

According to data from Grand View Research cited by Turbo Energy, the global EaaS sector was valued at $74.43 billion in 2024 and is expected to more than double to $145.18 billion by 2030.

Clean energy in blockchain

In Bitcoin’s early years, critics often claimed that its heavy energy use made it harmful to the environment. While it is true that Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains consume significant amounts of electricity to secure their networks, innovation within the crypto ecosystem is also driving eco-friendly solutions.

In January, Italian renewable energy company Enel Group teamed up with crypto wallet company Conio to let investors buy tokenized shares of solar panels on the Algorand blockchain. The offering allowed Italian investors to purchase fractional ownership in Enel’s solar farms and apply the generated energy to offset power consumption in their homes.

In October, Thopen, a Brazilian solar power company, announced it was considering a pivot into Bitcoin mining to “absorb local generated energy” from the country’s renewable sector.

In August, the UK-based publicly traded company Union Jack Oil, announced plans to use natural gas from undeveloped wells to generate electricity for Bitcoin mining.

[TITLE]China Opens State Energy Projects to Private Investment:
[TEXT]
China is encouraging private investment in state-led major energy and infrastructure projects and could allow private investors to have more than 10% in certain projects, the government said in a landmark directive aimed at boosting investment and reinvigorating the economy.

The projects open to minority private shareholding will need state approval and can be in railways infrastructure, nuclear power, hydropower, inter-provincial and inter-regional transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, LNG import and storage facilities, and water supply projects, the cabinet said.

The authorities will conduct feasibility studies to assess the revenue potential and returns on investment for the projects.

Private capital participation is encouraged and supported, China says. The project's status will determine the specific stakes in each project, the willingness of private enterprises to participate, and relevant policy requirements.

For eligible projects, private capital shareholding may be 10% or higher, the cabinet said in the first explicit reference that it is open to raise the private capital ceiling above 10%.

“We will further strengthen policy support for attracting private capital into the energy sector,” Xu Xin, deputy head of the legal affairs department at the National Energy Administration, said at a media briefing, as carried by Reuters.

Guan Peng, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission, told a briefing on Tuesday that “The policy puts forward clear requirements on encouraging and supporting the participation of private capital in key areas and projects.”

“It sends a signal of promoting the development of private investment,” Peng said, as carried by Bloomberg.

Earlier this year, during the peak of the trade war with the United States in the spring, China adopted its first fundamental law, specifically focused on promoting the private economy. This is “a significant step in revitalizing a sector that is key to growth and greatly boosting entrepreneurs’ confidence and expectations,” China’s Ministry of Justice said in May.

[TITLE]World Bank, Tunisia sign 430-mln-USD energy transition deal:
[TEXT]
TUNIS, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank said Tuesday that it has signed a 430-million-U.S. dollar financing agreement with Tunisia to support the country's transition to cleaner and more reliable energy under a five-year initiative.

The funding, which includes 30 million dollars in concessional financing, will be implemented under the Tunisia Energy Reliability, Efficiency, and Governance Improvement Program, which aims to strengthen the national electricity utility, promote renewable energy, and enhance energy sector governance, it said in a statement.

The initiative aims to mobilize 2.8 billion dollars in private investment to add 2.8 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity in Tunisia by 2028. It is expected to create over 30,000 construction jobs and reduce electricity supply costs by 23 percent, among others.

It "will strengthen Tunisia's position in clean energy, creating economic opportunities and ensuring long-term energy security," said World Bank's Country Manager for Tunisia Alexandre Arrobbio.

[TITLE]Kenya’s Gulf Energy Sets 2026 Target for First Oil:
[TEXT]
Kenya’s long-stalled Turkana oil dream has a new driver. Gulf Energy Ltd., a Nairobi-based trader, plans to start producing crude from the South Lokichar Basin by the end of 2026—nearly fifteen years after Tullow Oil’s original discovery.

Tullow sold its long-delayed Turkana project to Gulf Energy in April for $120 million, finally bowing out after years of trying — and failing — to get the oil out of the ground. Tullow's partners, TotalEnergies and Africa Oil, had already walked away the year before when financing for the multi-billion-dollar plan fell apart, leaving Tullow holding the bag on a project it could no longer afford to carry. The British explorer’s field development plan was later rejected by Kenya’s energy ministry for lack of capital backing, effectively forcing its exit.

Gulf Energy’s field plan has cleared the Energy Ministry and now heads to Parliament for final approval, according to Energy Minister Opiyo Wandayi. If it passes, drilling could start soon after, with first oil targeted for December 2026.

The South Lokichar project holds an estimated 560 million barrels recoverable, with early production expected in the 60,000–100,000 barrel-per-day range. A future 895-kilometer export pipeline to Lamu remains on the table, but early cargoes could once again be trucked to Mombasa, echoing Tullow’s pilot exports in 2019.

For Kenya, the hand-off from a debt-burdened multinational to a domestic player marks a rare second chance to establish itself as an oil producer. The government has sweetened the investment climate with tax breaks and new exploration rounds for 10 blocks.

If Gulf delivers on schedule, Kenya could finally join Uganda and South Sudan as East Africa’s oil producers—transforming a project once written off as too remote, too expensive, and too cursed by bad timing into the nation’s first real test of homegrown energy ambition.

[TITLE]Proposed rules for RE generators questionable:
[TEXT]
The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has proposed a draft with significant changes to the Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM), which governs penalties when renewable generators deviate from their scheduled output. The reforms are aimed at strengthening grid stability or grid balancing, which is important looking at India’s main target to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based installed electricity capacity by 2030, a goal set at COP-26.

But, the proposed draft, on which CERC has sought industry feedback, is already creating concerns among the key players both in solar and wind energy categories. They argue that it could raise costs and risks for renewable energy developers, particularly wind projects. The Commission has invited stakeholder comments and industry bodies like Wind Independent Power Producers Association (WIPPA) have already appealed against the proposals.

So, what is grid balancing and why it is important? The textbook definition of grid balancing is the process of keeping electricity supply and demand equal at all times to maintain a stable power grid. The power plants do this by adjusting their output, while consumers adjust their usage to prevent blackouts or overloads. This has become increasingly important with the rise of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar. For balancing, services grid operators use mechanisms like battery energy storage, to quickly react to any imbalances and maintain a consistent grid frequency.

Key changes

What are these key changes that CERC proposes to bring into effective April 1, 2026? Under the current system deviations are measured against available capacity. Under the proposed system, a hybrid formula has been worked out based on both scheduled generation (expected supply to discoms) and available capacity, with more emphasis on the former with the passage of time. Deviation from scheduled generation is a factor in grid instability, as it disrupts discoms’ planning. This change will make deviation charges stricter and costlier for wind and solar projects.

It proposes tighter tolerance bands which would mean projects will be penalised for smaller deviations, raising compliance and forecasting pressures.

According to Aditya Pyassi, CEO of the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturer Association (IWTMA), “ The CERC endeavours of fostering greater grid discipline are welcome. However, we need to see and acknowledge the fact that India is on a historic path targeting the integration of 500 GW of renewable by 2030 and to maintain RE project viability, and it is very important to go

[TITLE]Mergers Are Back — But Wall Street’s Not Buying the Hype:
[TEXT]
Mergers are back in fashion, especially now that the government no longer objects as much as before. Why do a merger? Well, the merging parties always say that the merger will strengthen competition (good for the public), lower operating costs (good for shareholders), and be transformative (which we can’t translate). Cynics say the merger partners and arrangers have other motives, because the mergers produce huge fees for bankers and lawyers and bonuses for the executives, and ongoing benefits for executives because the bigger the company becomes, the bigger their paychecks. Academic studies have shown that a significant percentage of mergers destroy value for shareholders of the acquiring firm, so don’t dismiss the cynics.

Some mergers have produced spectacular losses. Bayer’s decision to buy Monsanto a number of years ago saddled the German company with billions of dollars of losses from lawsuits. This may be why Kimberly-Clark shareholders reacted negatively when the company announced that it would buy the producer of Tylenol. The energy sector saw something similar. Chart Industries, which is in hydrogen, LNG, and cryogenics, almost doubled its size by purchasing a manufacturer of air moving equipment. A transformative merger creating scale and scope? Chart’s stock quickly fell by half. Critics said the acquired firm had lower value products than Chart and that Chart overpaid. The deal involved too much borrowing, they may have thought as well. Chart never reached pre-merger highs, but finally got close when a bigger firm with presumably transformative ideas proposed to buy it.

Let’s take a look at three recent, energy-related mergers to see how the market reacted to what was offered.

SABESP is a giant Brazilian water company, recently privatized. On October 25, it announced that it would buy shares representing a 70% economic interest in EMAE. The acquired company owns reservoirs easily integrated into the SABESP network as well as power generation stations (SABESP is a big electricity buyer for pumping.) The investment will earn the cost of capital. No additional financing required. Adds less than 2% to assets. SABESP stock has risen 3% since the announcement. No claims of transformation. It just gets SABESP into power generation and greatly improves the reliability of the water distribution system, via a profitable investment in a business they understand. Or so it seems.

On October 27, American Water Works (AWK) announced a merger with Essential Utilities, which itself is the result of a merger between Pennsylvania-based gas and water utilities not that long ago. The new company would be roughly 10% gas and 90% water and it looks as if the gas company will be on the block, so essentially the merger increased AWK’s water business by
