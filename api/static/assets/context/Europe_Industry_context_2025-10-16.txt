Stellantis plans to invest $13 billion over the next four years to expand its manufacturing capacity in the United States

Stellantis says it will invest $13B to expand its US operations, adding more than 5,000 jobs

Stellantis says it will invest $13 billion over the next four years to expand its manufacturing capacity in the United States, a move that the automaker says will increase its domestic vehicle production by 50% and add more than 5,000 jobs.

The world’s fourth-largest carmaker said Tuesday the investment will support the introduction of five new vehicles, including a Dodge Durango to be built in Detroit and a midsize truck to be assembled in Toledo, Ohio. The new jobs will be spread across plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

Stellantis, which was created 4½ years ago from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Peugeot, is hoping to counteract some of the expected 1.5 billion-euro ($1.7 billion) cost of tariffs this year on cars produced in Canada and Mexico by boosting North American profitability with new model launches like the discontinued Jeep Cherokee.

The new product launches will be in addition to 19 “refreshed” products across all U.S. assembly plants and updated powertrains planned through 2029, the company said.

“This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the company’s history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement.

Stellantis' operations in the U.S. include 34 manufacturing plants, parts distribution centers and research and development sites across 14 states.

Of the 16 million cars Stellantis produces for sale in the U.S. market, 8 million are made in domestic plants, and another 4 million in Canada and Mexico — all with a large number of U.S. components. Another 4 million are imported from Europe and Asia, with virtually no U.S. components.

In pursuit of a U.S. turnaround, Filosa is also relaunching in the second half of 2025 models that previous management nixed two years ago: a new Jeep Cherokee, which will be produced in Mexico and the popular ICE Dodge Charger.

Earlier this year, Stellantis also relaunched the Ram Hemi V8 because of dealer and customer demand.

In July, the Netherlands-based automaker reported half-year results that included losses of 2.3 billion euros (nearly $2.7 billion). During the period, U.S. shipments were down by nearly a quarter as the carmaker reduced the importation vehicles produced abroad.

Shares in Stellantis fell sharply in after-hours trading after closing 4.8% lower during regular trading Tuesday.

Stellantis says it will invest $13 billion US over the next four years to expand its manufacturing capacity in the United States, a move the automaker says will increase its U.S. vehicle production by 50 per cent and add more than 5,000 jobs.

The world’s fourth-largest carmaker said Tuesday the investment will support the introduction of five new vehicles, including a Dodge Durango to be built in Detroit and a midsize truck to be assembled in Toledo, Ohio. The new jobs will be spread across plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

Stellantis, which was created four-and-a-half years ago with the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Peugeot, hopes to counteract some of the expected 1.5 billion-euro cost of tariffs this year on cars produced in Canada and Mexico by boosting North American profitability with new model launches like the discontinued Jeep Cherokee.

The new product launches will be in addition to 19 “refreshed” products across all U.S. assembly plants and updated powertrains planned through 2029, the company said.

“This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the company’s history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement.

The announcement comes amidst major headwinds for the Canadian auto industry, which is grappling with tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants to see more domestic vehicle production.

Stellantis' operations in the U.S. include 34 manufacturing plants, parts distribution centers and research and development sites across 14 states.

In Canada, the company has a plants in Windsor and Brampton, Ont., and a casting facility in Toronto. Its Brampton plant has been shut down since early 2024.

Of the 16 million cars Stellantis produces for sale in the U.S. market, 8 million are made in domestic plants, and another four million in Canada and Mexico — all with a large number of U.S. components. Another four million are imported from Europe and Asia, with virtually no U.S. components.

In pursuit of a U.S. turnaround, Stellantis is also relaunching in the second half of 2025 models that previous management nixed two years ago: a new Jeep Cherokee, which will be produced in Mexico, and the popular gas-powered Dodge Charger, which is made in Windsor, Ont.

In July, the Netherlands-based automaker reported half-year results including losses of 2.3 billion euros. During the period, U.S. shipments were down by nearly a quarter as the carmaker reduced the importation vehicles produced abroad.

AUBURN HILLS, Michigan, October 14, 2025 – Stellantis announced today plans to invest $13 billion over the next four years to grow its business in the critical United States market and to increase its domestic manufacturing footprint. The investment is the largest in the Company’s 100-year U.S. history and will support the introduction of five new vehicles across the brand portfolio in key segments; production of the all-new four-cylinder engine; and the addition of more than 5,000 jobs at plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

The new investment will further expand Stellantis’ already significant U.S. footprint, increasing annual finished vehicle production by 50% over current levels. The new product launches will be in addition to a regular cadence of 19 refreshed products across all U.S. assembly plants and updated powertrains planned through 2029.

“This investment in the U.S. – the single largest in the Company’s history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis CEO and North America COO. “As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love.”

“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” Filosa said.

Plant Investment Details1

The $13 billion investment plan includes research and development and supplier costs to execute the Company’s full product strategy over the next four years as well as investments in its manufacturing operations. The details of the plant-specific investments follow:

Illinois

Stellantis intends to invest more than $600 million to reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant to expand production of the Jeep ® Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market. With an initial production launch expected in 2027, these actions are anticipated to create around 3,300 new jobs.

Ohio

With an investment of nearly $400 million, assembly of an all-new midsize truck, previously allocated to the Belvidere plant, plans to move to the Toledo Assembly Complex, where it will join the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator. The production shift could create more than 900 jobs. Launch timing is expected in 2028.

The Company also intends to continue with investments in its Toledo operations as previously announced in January. This includes additional technologies and strong product actions for both the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator, and more components critical to production at the Toledo Machining Plant.

Michigan

Stellantis plans to develop an all-new range-extended EV and internal combustion engine large SUV that will be produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant beginning in 2028. The Company will invest nearly $100 million to retool the facility. It is anticipated that the new program will add more than 900 jobs at the plant, which currently assembles the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

The Company also expects to invest $130 million to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson for production of the next-generation Dodge Durango, reaffirming its commitment from January. Production is anticipated to launch in 2029.

Indiana

The Company confirms its January announcement to make additional investments in several of its Kokomo facilities to produce the all-new four-cylinder engine – the GMET4 EVO – beginning in 2026. The Company plans to invest more than $100 million and to add more than 100 jobs to ensure that the U.S. will be the manufacturing home of this strategic powertrain.

Stellantis’ U.S. footprint includes 34 manufacturing facilities, parts distribution centers and research and development locations across 14 states. These operations support more than 48,000 employees, 2,600 dealers and nearly 2,300 suppliers in thousands of communities across the country. Today’s announcement builds on the previously announced actions in January 2025.

NOTES

(1) Investments detailed in this release are subject to the successful negotiation and final approval of development packages with appropriate state and local governments.

[TITLE]How Global Offshore Wind Is Battling a Perfect Storm of Challenges:
[TEXT]
Over the past couple of years, the global offshore wind sector has been facing growing pains, with supply chain constraints, policy volatility, and economic headwinds threatening a power segment that has been slated to become the most dominant wind energy source in many regions. These challenges are increasingly forcing companies in the space to abandon projects and undergo strategic restructuring as the momentum for offshore wind and other nascent clean energy industries, such as hydrogen, wanes. To wit, last year, Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced plans to cease new offshore wind investments and split its power division as CEO Wael Sawan looks to boost the company’s profitability. Shell appears to be systematically scaling back its clean energy investments: Earlier in the year, the company also ditched plans to build a low-carbon hydrogen plant on Norway's west coast due to a lack of demand.

Earlier in the same year, Norway's state-controlled energy giant Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) abandoned plans to invest in Vietnam's offshore wind sector, dealing a significant blow to the country's green energy ambitions. According to the World Bank, over the past couple of years, Vietnam has attracted plenty of interest in its clean energy sector thanks to the country’s strong winds in shallow waters near coastal, densely populated areas. Unfortunately, recent political turbulence in the country has paralyzed regulatory reforms and discouraged investors. That marked the first time Equinor had abandoned offshore wind development; in contrast, the company had previously exited more than a dozen fossil fuel projects to focus on renewables and low-carbon systems. Back in 2023, Danish offshore wind giant Ørsted A/S (OTCPK:DNNGY) paused its multi-gigawatt offshore wind plans in Vietnam, citing issues with the "route to market," business ethics, and a lack of a comprehensive legal framework for the sector.

Related: North Sea Oil: Booming in Norway and Doomed in the UK

Unfortunately, the offshore wind sector woes appear to be going nowhere. Back in July, Ørsted paid $110 million to Danish offshore wind services provider Cadeler (NYSE:CDLR) as compensation for the cancellation of the construction of a wind turbine installation vessel (WTIV) for the 2.4 GW Hornsea 4 offshore wind farm in the UK. In May, Ørsted announced the cancellation of the project, citing higher rates, rising supply chain costs and increased construction risks as some of the challenges. Ørsted was among the developers who were awarded contracts in the UK’s Allocation Round 6 (AR6) in 2024 that procured 9.6 GW of clean energy capacity from offshore and onshore wind and solar energy. AR6 marked a major improvement from AR5, which failed to secure any new offshore wind projects.

On a brighter note, Cadeler’s short-term financials will receive a boost from the receipt of the termination compensation, with the company recently upgrading its full-year 2025 revenue to the range of EUR 588 million to EUR 628 million, up from EUR 485 million to EUR 525 million, while the EBITDA forecast for 2025 is expected to clock in at EUR 381–421 million, up from EUR 278–318 million.

Meanwhile, Singapore’s Seatrium Ltd (OTCPK:SMBMF) recently received a notice of the termination of a WTIV contract by Maersk Offshore Wind valued at $475 million. Seatrium had secured the contract in 2022 while still operating as Sembcorp Marine, before it merged with Keppel Offshore and Marine in 2023 in a $3.34 billion deal. Maersk says it will try and recover monies already paid to Seatrium, adding that it will not accept delivery of the unit due to delays in the construction schedule despite the project being ~ 98.9%. Seatrium shares have tanked nearly 15% after the announcement of the Maersk decision.

Maersk's cancellation of the Seatrium deal could signal that it’s abandoning the offshore wind business, which says something considering the startling fall of its core container shipping business. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that container shipping rates for the busy Shanghai to Los Angeles route have declined by nearly 60%, meaning the company is likely receiving below $2,200 per container it requires to break even.

That said, the U.S. offshore wind sector could fare worse than its European peers thanks to policy headwinds by the Trump administration. Trump has cancelled ~$679 million in U.S. offshore wind project funding, stifling growth and development of the nascent sector. In contrast, WindEurope recently reported it built 6.8 GW of wind power across Europe in the first half of 2025, comprising 6 GW onshore and 0.7 GW offshore. Europe is, by far, the biggest offshore wind market in the world, commanding 92% of the floating offshore wind market. However, Asia-Pacific is enjoying the fastest growth, with the region projected to expand at a torrid 156% CAGR through 2030.

[TITLE]Kitchen cabinet companies hope new U.S. tariffs pay off in the long run:

By MAE ANDERSON

Cabinet dealers, interior designers and remodeling contractors in the U.S. hope new tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered wooden furniture that kicked in Tuesday will create more business for them and eventually boost domestic production of those products.

But several small business owners in the home improvement industry say they expect some short-term pains from the import taxes: Clients with projects already on the books might balk at having to pay more for the budget-priced cabinets they selected. Potential customers may postpone kitchen and bathroom renovations until costs — and the economy — seem more stable.

“I think the volatility around pricing is damaging to the remodeling industry,” said Allison Harlow, an interior designer in Michigan whose company, Curio Design Studio, creates and builds custom bathrooms and kitchens. “Most people will hear the headline of ‘Kitchen cabinets will go up 50%’ and might just opt out of even reaching out to our company.”

Despite high mortgage rates having depressed sales of existing homes in recent years, a forecast of remodeling activity by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies predicts that homeowner spending on improvements and maintenance will remain steady into the middle of 2026.

A proclamation that President Donald Trump signed on Sept. 29 cited national security and foreign trade practices as grounds for imposing the tariffs on certain finished wood products and product components.

Of them, imported vanities and kitchen cabinets incurred the steepest tax rates: 25% until the end of the year and 50% starting on New Year’s Day.

Upholstered chairs, seats and sofas also are subject to a 25% worldwide tariff effective Tuesday, with the rate scheduled to increase to 30% on Jan. 1. In addition, the presidential proclamation put a 10% import tax on softwood timber and lumber, which comes from evergreen trees like pine and cedars.

Copper Overview

The global copper market is experiencing robust growth, driven by increasing demand across various sectors, including electrical and electronics, construction, and transportation. The shift towards renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has significantly boosted the need for copper in infrastructure development. Additionally, the rise in electric vehicle production has further intensified copper consumption, as these vehicles require more copper than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Technological advancements and innovation in copper processing and recycling are also contributing to the market’s expansion.

Copper Market Key Factors Behind the Recent Price Surge

Supply Disruptions : Major production challenges across key mining regions have created significant supply shortfalls. Recent mining disruptions in several copper-producing countries have tightened market conditions considerably, leaving buyers competing for limited available supply.

Recent mining disruptions in several copper-producing countries have tightened market conditions considerably, leaving buyers competing for limited available supply. Currency Influences : The weakening U.S. dollar has played a substantial role in supporting copper prices. As the dollar loses strength against major currencies, dollar-denominated commodities like copper become more affordable for buyers using other currencies, stimulating additional demand.

Structural Market Changes: The copper market is experiencing a fundamental transformation as demand shifts from traditional industrial cycles to green energy applications. This evolution creates new consumption patterns that may be less cyclical and more structurally persistent than historical demand trends.

What Role Is China Playing in Copper Market Dynamics?

China's influence on global copper markets remains paramount, with its consumption patterns, strategic priorities, and economic policies serving as critical price determinants. Understanding Chinese market behavior provides essential context for interpreting current price trends.

Chinese Demand Patterns

China's consumption patterns remain the dominant influence on global copper markets, accounting for approximately 50% of global refined copper demand. Recent industrial recovery efforts and infrastructure stimulus measures have provided support for prices.

This outsized market share means even modest changes in Chinese consumption patterns can create significant global market impacts. Recent industrial recovery efforts following pandemic-related disruptions, coupled with infrastructure stimulus initiatives, have underpinned price strength through 2025.

The country's Five-Year Plan priorities and infrastructure development goals continue to drive substantial copper price prediction requirements across construction, manufacturing, power infrastructure, and transportation sectors. These strategic imperatives provide a floor for Chinese copper demand even during periods of broader economic adjustment.

Price Sensitivity Thresholds

Market analysts have identified key price thresholds where Chinese buyers may adjust their purchasing behavior:

Price Level (USD/ton) Expected Buyer Response Below $9,000 Aggressive purchasing $9,000-$11,000 Normal procurement Above $11,000 Potential demand destruction

These thresholds reflect both economic considerations and strategic priorities. At lower price points, Chinese buyers often accelerate purchases to build inventories and secure supply. As observed in mid-2024, when prices exceeded $11,000 per ton, Chinese buyers demonstrated restraint, implementing a more selective procurement approach.

Understanding these behavioral thresholds provides valuable insight into potential price ceiling effects. The current price level around $10,775 sits near the upper boundary of normal procurement behavior, suggesting prices may face resistance if they move substantially higher.

Strategic Stockpiling

China's strategic metal reserve activities can significantly influence market sentiment and price direction, though these movements are often not transparent to market participants.

The country's State Reserve Bureau periodically engages in both buying and selling activities as part of its broader commodity management strategy. These interventions, which can involve substantial volumes, often occur with limited market visibility, creating price volatility when they become known.

Beyond official stockpiles, various forms of "invisible inventory" exist throughout China's industrial supply chain, providing buffers against supply disruptions and price volatility. These inventories can be rapidly deployed during periods of market tightness, potentially dampening price rallies.
