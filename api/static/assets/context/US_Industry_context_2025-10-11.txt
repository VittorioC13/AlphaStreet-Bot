[TITLE]HavocAI raises $85M to sell autonomous boats to the U.S. military:
[TEXT]
In the aftermath of the passage of President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill—which set aside billions of dollars for the rapid prototyping and integration of artificial intelligence systems for the Defense Department—startups are in a mad dash to raise capital so they can compete for the funding.

One of those companies is HavocAI, a Rhode Island–based startup that demonstrated its autonomous vessels just last summer and is already selling boats to the U.S. military and its allies. HavocAI closed an $85 million venture funding round at the end of September so that it can be prepared to manufacture thousands of autonomous boats and incorporate its autonomous tech stack into new types of vessels at a moment’s notice, its cofounder and CEO, Paul Lwin, tells Fortune.

“When the reconciliation bill came out, all of our existing investors said: ‘Hey, don’t go and try to raise money and take six months doing it.’ They said: ‘You need to run fast,’” Lwin notes.

HavocAI put together the new round within three months, Lwin said—bolstering the startup’s total funding raised to nearly $100 million since the company launched just last January. This most recent round—which included venture capital firms B Capital, Up.Partners, Scout Ventures, and Outlander Ventures; the CIA’s venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel; defense behemoth and strategic partner Lockheed Martin; and Taiwan’s public and private venture capital fund, Taiwania Capital—will position the startup to compete for a piece of the more than $3.3 billion that the new legislation set aside specifically for the development of medium and small unmanned surface vessels. Lwin declined to provide a valuation.

HavocAI’s strategy is all

[TITLE]Stoke Space’s $510M round shows the future of launch belongs to defense:
[TEXT]
Stoke Space announced a massive capital raise on Wednesday that might seem, at first glance, like just another bet on the commercial launch market. The details tell a different story.

Led by billionaire Thomas Tull’s U.S. Innovative Technology (USIT), a fund that explicitly invests in technologies tied to national security, the $510 million Series D round underscores a larger shift in the launch industry. The old assumption was the winners of launch would be the companies that capture the lion’s share of commercial payloads.

While there is still demand on the commercial side from private constellation developers and for emerging use cases like in-space manufacturing or lunar payloads, the center of gravity has shifted decisively toward defense.

Just a few years ago, space startups were selling investors on visions of a rapidly expanding commercial market for weather monitoring, broadband, and remote-sensing satellites. Astra, for example, told investors in its 2021 SPAC deck that it would eventually launch hundreds of rockets per year to serve a growing small satellite market. Relativity Space pitched investors on a 3D printing revolution that would make rockets cheap enough to unlock large commercial demand.

But there are only so many commercial payloads to fly, and only one company — SpaceX — has managed to consistently launch them cheaply and reliably.

Defense, meanwhile, is on an opposite trajectory.

Geopolitical shifts, like Russia’s war against Ukraine and growing competition in space from China, have created new tailwinds. The Pentagon’s new “Golden Dome” initiative, a multibillion-dollar project aimed at creating a layered missile defense shield over the continental United States, has flooded the aerospace ecosystem with lucrative new opportunities.

Meanwhile, programs like the Space Force’s National Security Space Launch (NSSL) and the Space Development Agency’s missile-defense satellite constellation are promising years of predicable, high-value contracts.

Launch startups have noticed. Their language, investors, and business models have realigned toward a single buyer: the U.S. government.

[TITLE]Xtreme One Entertainment Board Approves Strategic Expansion Including up to $25 Million Capital Raise, Planned Uplisting to OTC, and Near-Term M&A Strategy in Mixed Martial Arts & New Sports Vertical:
[TEXT]
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Oct. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Directors of Xtreme One Entertainment, Inc. (OTCPink: XONI) (“Xtreme One”), a leading innovator in live sports and entertainment and the parent company of Xtreme Fighting Championships (XFC), announced it approved a multi-tiered strategy set to kick off this month with the expected completion of its audited financials. The expansion plan, fueled by a planned $25 million Tier 2 Regulation A (Reg A) stock offering, includes a planned uplisting from the OTC Pink Sheets to the OTCQB Venture Market, beginning its M&A strategy aimed at adding complementary regional mixed martial arts (MMA) promotions, and a Board sub-committee aimed at entering a new sports vertical through M&A.

The Board also reviewed an independent valuation of Xtreme One, which it commissioned from the sports and entertainment practice at a top 10 U.S. accounting firm in advance of pricing Xtreme One’s planned Reg A offering. The Board accepted and approved an independent valuation of $46 million, a significant premium to the Company’s current market capitalization, underscoring its growth trajectory, the fast-growing sports category, and the need for Xtreme One to move up to a more liquid, higher exposure market.

“The last two years under the leadership of a new Board and new management team have been focused on execution, disciplined growth, and building on the 20-year heritage of the XFC as the development league for the next generation of great MMA fighters,” said Xtreme One Chairman of the Board Jeff Lambert. “We’re poised to be to the UFC what the G-League is to the NBA or what minor league baseball is to the MLB, and discovering, developing and launching pro MMA athletes to the pinnacle of the sport.

“We’ve laid the groundwork for a breakout fourth quarter that will see us do our first international fight in a decade, close on our first M&A deal, and deliver on our promise to expand into a complementary sports vertical to leverage our media, production and marketing expertise,” Lambert added.

Xtreme One said it expects to complete its long-anticipated financial audit by the end of October 2025 and will immediately file to uplist to the OTCQB exchange. The Audit will also trigger the Company filing an amended Reg A offering with the SEC to raise up to $25 million. Xtreme One received SEC qualification for its Reg A offering in the first quarter of 2025, but elected to pursue the more rigorous, yet greater reach and scale potential afforded by a Tier 2 Reg A offering, which requires two years of audited financials among other standards.

Proceeds from the offering will support expansion of XFC’s original content, the addition of more fights across new geographies, strategic M&A, entry into new sports verticals, and investments in technology designed to enhance fan and athlete experiences.

“We’re building the team, operational excellence, reporting standards and transparency of a large public company because that’s our destination,” said Chris Defendis, President of Xtreme One. “We’ve engaged an independent audit firm, a top 10 accounting firm for our valuation, we have world-class Board members and talent, and we’re attracting fighters from the top gyms and from around the world that see our commitment to being a fighter and fan-first organization.”

The planned OTCQB uplisting is expected to deliver greater visibility among retail and institutional investors, attract more market makers, enhance liquidity for shareholders, and build a stronger corporate profile for Xtreme One and its fans.

[TITLE]Fintech startup Niro shuts business after failing to raise capital amid regulatory crackdown:
[TEXT]
Embedded consumer-lending fintech Niro , which had raised capital from Rebright Partners and GMO Venture Partners, has ceased operations. ``We had to shut down due to challenges around raising capital,’’ its founder Aditya Kumar told ET.Earlier, in a LinkedIn post, Kumar had said, “$20 million in funding, $200 million in loan disbursements, 30 partnerships and 4.5 years later — we’ve had to shut down Niro.”.The Bengaluru-based startup cited regulatory headwinds and failing to secure further funding as reasons for its shutdown. Founded in 2021 by Kumar and Sankalp Mathur, Niro to date has raised close to $20 million, as per Tracxn data. It offers embedded lending to customers of consumer internet platforms such as Snapdeal, Quikr, and Housing.com, among others.“Despite scouring the globe for capital and the country for suitors — I was unable to bring this one home,” Kumar wrote. Niro did not respond to a request for comment.The company is known for its instant personal loans, ranging between Rs 50,000 to 7 lakh, delivered through partner platforms like L&T Finance and Muthoot Finance . Such personal loans are typically unsecured credit given by financial institutions without collateral.This comes at a time when unsecured lending has faced multiple regulatory headwinds, leading to many platforms moving towards secured products (loans against collateral). Over the last eight months, venture capital funding in digital lending has dropped nearly 50%, as reported by ET last month.Like Niro, there are many fintech players that provide instant personal loans online, including Accel-backed Money View, Premji Invest-backed Kreditbee, and so on.While accepting the regulatory challenges, Kumar also pointed to the issues with distribution and data in financial institutions. “Financial institutions (FIs) lack proprietary distribution and differentiated data for underwriting, which fundamentally makes their distribution low quality and expensive, and the underwriting commoditised,” Kumar said."On the other hand, consumer internet platforms have solved for this, but don’t speak (or understand) the language that financial institutions with ultra-low risk appetites, low product capabilities, and increased regulatory scrutiny do. FIs’ inability to innovate and build products contextually compounds these issues,” he added.Kumar doesn't have any plans of starting anything immediately, although he’s hopeful about fintech platforms."The idea is to decompress a bit. However, there's a huge opportunity for AI-enabled infrastructure platforms in embedded financing," he said. "With technology solutions and AI, distribution cost is going down drastically, enabling customer acquisitions to be done cheaper."

[TITLE]ProStar Geocorp Launches LinQD: A Next-Generation Data Exchange Platform for Critical Infrastructure:
[TEXT]
GRAND JUNCTION, Colo., Oct. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProStar® Holdings Inc. (“ProStar®” or “the Company”) (TSXV: MAPS, OTCQX: MAPPF, FSE: 5D00), the developer of PointMan® Precision Mapping Solutions®, is pleased to announce the official launch of LinQD™ (Linking Quantitative Data), an open API next-generation data exchange platform designed to create a unified ecosystem to improve the management of critical infrastructure.

Over decades of operating, many large construction companies, utility owners, municipalities, and transportation agencies have accumulated multiple systems of record and other applications that store and manage information critical to their operations. This has created data siloing and the inability to easily access and share mission critical data with the field or office operations.

LinQD addresses these challenges by integrating fragmented systems of record and other applications into a single, cloud-based platform. Using open API architecture, LinQD seamlessly integrates both legacy systems with emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augment Reality (AR), into a single, unified platform. This powerful interoperability eliminates silos, enhances efficiency, and enables organizations to modernize operations and combine emerging technologies with existing systems, creating a unified digital data exchange ecosystem. By permitting the integration of 811, GIS, CAD, and other disparate legacy systems with modern technologies into a unified platform, stakeholders gain instant access to improved geospatial intelligence and mission-critical data imperative for effective planning, maintenance, and safety operations.

“Disparate and fragmented legacy systems continue to plague the utility industry, limiting the ability to fully utilize mission-critical data across both field and office operations,” said Page Tucker, CEO and Founder of ProStar. “LinQD eliminates these challenges by enabling legacy and modern technologies to be seamlessly integrated into a single operating platform. This makes data easily accessible and shareable while unlocking the power of emerging technologies such as AI and AR. This marks a major milestone in our mission to lead the industry into the digital era.”

LinQD with PointMan

Linking Quantitative Data

LinQD with PointMan provides quantitative data from multiple sources, enabling engineers, construction crews, and asset owners to make informed, verifiable decisions both in the field and in the office. With the launch of the LinQD integration and quantitative data platform, ProStar expands its PointMan Software-as-a-Service offering. LinQD is an open API platform that enables seamless integration with third-party systems, allowing real-time data exchange across a unified technology ecosystem. LinQD creates new revenue channels through strategic partner integrations and enterprise subscriptions.

[TITLE]Trump Is Using the Shutdown to Supercharge His War on Equity:
[TEXT]
As the federal government shutdown stretches into its second week, President Donald Trump is targeting nearly $30 billion in cuts to federal funding almost exclusively to Democratic states and cities. The impact of the cuts to public transit, energy projects, and fundamental civil rights programs could carry far-reaching harms across the nation and the economy.

The cuts are the next step in the implementation of executive orders issued by Trump that strive to eradicate policies that advance racial and gender equity, tackle the climate crisis, and threaten the fossil fuel industry.

Democrats are holding firm for concessions to lower health care costs, while Republicans in the House have sent their members home until at least Tuesday. The shutdown has shuttered services and programs Americans rely on and furloughed 750,000 government workers deemed “nonessential,” including almost 90 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency. Rather than try to end the shutdown, Trump is reveling in it. Calling it an “unprecedented opportunity,” Trump is leveraging the shutdown to exact revenge on his perceived enemies and to blame Democrats for painful cuts to government jobs and programs he has long opposed.

In immediate jeopardy is funding for over $20 billion for public transportation expansions in Chicago, New York City, and the Hudson River Rail Tunnel between New York and New Jersey that would affect hundreds of thousands of rail travelers throughout the Eastern Seaboard; nearly $8 billion for energy projects in over a dozen states across the country; and core civil rights programs providing equity in federal contracting.

“In Donald Trump’s authoritarian America, even the trains won’t run on time,” wrote New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer.

Democrat Zohran Mamdani, the frontrunner in New York’s upcoming mayoral race, slammed “Trump and his sycophants” for treating people as mere “political pawns” and taking actions that will have immensely serious consequences on their lives and livelihoods. “This is
