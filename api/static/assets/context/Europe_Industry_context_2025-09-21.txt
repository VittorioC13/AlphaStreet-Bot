[TITLE]STMicroelectronics to Advance Next-Gen Chip Manufacturing Technology with New PLP Pilot Line in France:
[TEXT]
"The development of our PLP capabilities in our Tours site is aimed at advancing this innovative approach to chip packaging and test manufacturing technology, boosting efficiency and flexibility so it can be rolled out across a wide portfolio of applications, including RF, analog, power and microcontrollers. A multidisciplinary team of experts in manufacturing automation, process engineering, data science and analytics, as well as technology and product R&D, will collaborate on this program, which is a key part of a larger strategic initiative focused on heterogeneous integration - a scalable, efficient new approach to chip integration," said Fabio Gualandris, President Quality, Manufacturing and Technology of STMicroelectronics. "With our fab in Malta, ST has already demonstrated its capability to deliver high-performing chip packaging and test in Europe. As we reshape our global manufacturing footprint, this new initiative in Tours will expand our process, design and manufacturing innovation capabilities supporting the development of next-generation chips in Europe".

STMicroelectronics, a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, today announced new details regarding the development of the next generations of Panel-Level Packaging (PLP) technology through a pilot line in its Tours site, France, which is expected to be operational in Q3 2026.PLP is an advanced, automated chip packaging and test process technology bringing increased manufacturing efficiency and reducing costs, and a key enabler for creating the next generation of smaller, more powerful, and cost-effective electronic devices. The large-area carrier in PLP (large rectangular shapes in place of circular wafers) enables higher manufacturing throughput, making it a more efficient solution for high-volume production. Building on its first-generation PLP line in operation in Malaysia and its global technology R&D network, ST plans to develop the next generations of its PLP technology to maintain its technological leadership and extend the use of PLP across many other ST products for automotive, industrial and consumer applications.The development of the new PLP pilot line in Tours is supported by a capital investment of over $60 million, already allocated as part of the company-wide program to reshape the Company's manufacturing footprint. Additional synergies are expected with the local R&D ecosystem, including the CERTEM R&D center. As previously announced, this program is focused on advanced manufacturing infrastructure and brings redefined missions for some sites in France and Italy to support their long-term success.For decades, the industry has relied on wafer-level packaging (WLP) and flip-chip technology to connect silicon chips to external circuitry. However, as devices become smaller and more complex, these methods have begun to reach their limits in terms of scalability and cost-effectiveness. For advanced packaging, different approaches exist or are under development; PLP is one of them.Panel Level Packaging is a method where multiple ICs are packaged on a single, larger rectangular substrate panel, rather than on individual circular wafers. This allows for more ICs to be processed simultaneously, reducing costs and improving throughput. ST has not only adopted PLP-DCI but has also been at the forefront of its development since 2020. The company's research and development teams have worked to prototype and scale the technology, culminating in a state-of-the-art PLP-DCI process currently in production at very high volumes of over 5 million units per day on a highly automated line using very large, 700x700mm panels.ST's PLP technology focuses on Direct Copper Interconnect (DCI). Direct copper interconnections replace the traditional wire connections of chips with their encapsulation support. DCI is the process by which these ICs are electrically connected to the panel substrate using copper, which is known for its excellent electrical conductivity. DCI offers superior performance compared to traditional methods that use solder bumps, which can be less reliable. This technology with direct connection without wire supports new product development by reducing power losses (such as resistance and inductance), enhancing heat dissipation and enabling miniaturization. This leads to better overall power density.PLP-DCI also allows the integration of multiple chips within advanced packages, known as System in Package (SiP).

[TITLE]Industrial action against plans to cut pay by 20% at Cork pharma plant halted:
[TEXT]
A DEADLOCK AT two biopharmaceutical plants in Co Cork has been broken following anger attempts to cut 20% of the pay for a number of workers.

Technicians, including electricians and other tradespeople, took industrial action over the plans by management at the science and technology equipment supplier Merck Millipore at its plant in Blarney.

The action, which began last month, was set to see workers down tools on two days this week before a deal was struck between the management and trade union Connect.

The union also criticised what it described as unilateral changes to terms and conditions for workers at the German company’s plant in Carrigtwohill.

But peace broke out between the two sides after Merck agreed to set up negotiations with an independent moderator.

Mark Dobbyn of Connect told The Journal this was a “significant” move as the trade union had sought for much of the past decade to have a similar process set up to discuss changes the company was planning on introducing to workers’ terms.

“There was going to be 20% taken away from our members in Blarney, with no engagement around it at all. Our members balloted for industrial action overwhelmingly but it’s frustrating to end up in situations where our members have no alternative,” Dobbyn said.

“There’s now a process that allows issues to be raised collectively, which was never there previously. And if they’re not resolved the company brings in a mutually agreeable third partner – before these facilitators were whoever the company wanted,” Dobbyn said.

Dobbyn added that Merck Milipore had traditionally refused to union recognition, resulting in a case brought by Connect and Siptu to the Labour Court in 2022, which found that the company should engage with the unions.

Dobbyn added that the unilateral changes by management in the past had seen some benefits bestowed on the workforce, including positive changes to paternity leave and fertility benefits – but he said that the latest plans showed the importance of discussions with staff.

This week saw a new €150m filtration manufacturing facility opened at the plant’s site at Blarney Business Park.

The company said this was part of a €440m investment committed across its Cork operations in Blarney and Carrigtwohill.

Faisal Islam: Will the US tech bromance turn around the UK economy?

1 day ago Share Save Faisal Islam Economics editor Share Save

EPA The Tech Prosperity Deal inked by this week tacitly aligns the UK with the US administration's pro-tech approach

In the old Camden Town Hall opposite London's St Pancras station, away from the white tie and tails of the pageantry at Windsor Castle, was perhaps the most substantive display of the consequences of US President Donald Trump's state visit. In front of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, many members of the British and US cabinets and the cream of the European tech industry, a highly-crafted video played, featuring the long history of UK science. It included George Stephenson, Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing and Sir Demis Hassabis, with dozens of UK start-up companies from every corner of the country listed. It was a cross between a UK government investment promotion video and the Danny Boyle 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony, except for one crucial detail - it was voiced by Jensen Huang, the American Nvidia artificial intelligence (AI) and microchip magnate. This week, Trump said the tech tycoon "was taking over the world" and the boss of the company, which hit a market value of $4tn (£2.9tn) this summer, appears to have gone all-in on the UK in quite an extraordinary way.

Huang shouted out the long list of British entrepreneurs Nvidia has taken stakes in and had expanded after a further £2bn of investment. He invited Business Secretary Peter Kyle and his US counterpart Howard Lutnick onto the stage to address the assembled British entrepreneurs. Lutnick, the face of the global trade war, said: "We are America first, but we are not America only... We want to win, we want you to win." This was one vignette from the striking array of the world's biggest Silicon Valley tech companies turning on the transatlantic investment tap. The "tech bromance" embraced the UK this week with a hat-trick of multi-billion investments from Nvidia, Microsoft and Google. It was an early win for the government's strategy in attracting this sort of investment to help transform Britain and the UK economy long term. But it is not necessarily proof that this strategy will win in transforming the economy, living standards, and turning the tide on more general negative vibes from the economy and politics.

Indeed, the infectious enthusiasm of the US tech giants

[TITLE]Oil Majors Rethink Green Projects Amid Anti-ESG Push:
[TEXT]
The re-election of Donald Trump as US President has further accelerated the anti-ESG momentum, leading to rollbacks of climate action policies and executive orders banning ESG investing.

The United States has become the global epicenter of the anti-ESG movement, with a significant increase in anti-ESG bills proposed across states since 2021.

Back in 2021, Texas passed two laws that restricted the state from doing business with companies deemed hostile to the fossil fuels and firearm industries. The Lone Star State barred pensions and other state entities from investing in approximately 350 funds that promote environmental, social and governance, aka ESG investing, claiming that ESG investing does not act in the best financial interests of their clients.

To wit, the Republican-leaning state banned Wall Street giants Citigroup Inc., BlackRock Inc., Barclays Plc and members of Net Zero Banking Alliance, saying ESG is “…just a hate factory.” The anti-ESG movement has since gained traction, mostly targeting financial services like banks, pension funds and asset managers, as well as the energy sector.

And now a new report by GlobalData reveals how the U.S. has become the epicenter of a rising tide of anti-ESG sentiment across the globe. The report points to a Pleiades Strategy tracker that reveals that a total of 370 anti-ESG bills were submitted to the legislatures of 40 U.S. states between 2021 and 2024.

GlobalData notes that, whereas few of those bills were signed into law, this does not signify that the anti-ESG movement has weakened. Indeed, an analysis by Ropes & Gray found that anti-ESG bills filed in 2024 enjoyed a significantly higher rate of success than those filed in prior years, indicating that the architects of these bills are becoming more effective at drafting legislative challenges.

Not surprisingly, the anti-ESG movement has gained massive momentum since the re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. President.

Trump has rolled back many climate action policies by the previous administration, taken aim at DEI policies and passed executive orders banning ESG investing. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) has rolled back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Whereas OBBBA did not outright cancel the Section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credits as earlier feared, it did accelerate the deadline for projects to begin construction to be eligible for the credit, bringing the deadline forward to December 31, 2027, from January 1, 2033, as originally envisioned in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.

Trump’s anti-climate actions are similar to his stance in his first term when he unraveled more than 100 climate policies. There are estimates that nearly $28 billion-worth of wind, solar, EV and battery projects have been delayed or cancelled since Trump took office, with a potential 19,000 jobs chopped.

“Since President Trump’s re-election in November 2024, the efforts of the anti-ESG movement have ratcheted up, and all companies (not just those in the financial services industry) lie within the movement’s scope,” the GlobalData report states. “Trump has unravelled much of the previous administration’s climate action policies, passed executive orders banning ESG investing and taken aim at DEI policies.”

Meanwhile, efforts by the European Union to simplify its regulatory landscape have frequently seen the bloc slide towards anti-ESG, with growing right-wing populism bolstering climate skepticism across the globe. International markets have opposed advancing ESG standards through initiatives like the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and European Green Deal that enforce sustainability criteria by requiring disclosure of ESG-related risks. GlobalData has predicted that the anti-ESG movement will ultimately impact companies across all industries, including institutions and other entities previously considered to be fully independent.

Not surprisingly, Big Oil companies have been scaling back their clean energy investments. Last year, oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) announced that it will not move forward with one of the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen projects if the federal government failed to provide tax incentives for natural gas-fed facilities. Current guidelines provide incentives for projects that produce "green" hydrogen by using water and renewable energy, but Exxon wants them extended to"blue" hydrogen from gas by trapping carbon emissions. That’s an interesting take because Exxon CEO Darren Woods previously expressed his doubts

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has moved to block a Massachusetts offshore wind farm, its latest effort to hobble an industry and technology that President Donald Trump has attacked as “ugly” and unreliable compared to fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, filed a motion in federal court Thursday seeking to take back its approval of the SouthCoast Wind project’s “construction and operations plan.'' The plan is the last major federal permit the project needs before it can start putting turbines in the water.

SouthCoast Wind, to be built in federal waters about 23 miles south of Nantucket, is expected to construct as many as 141 turbines to power about 840,000 homes in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

The Interior Department action is the latest by the Trump administration in what critics call an "all-out assault” on the wind energy industry.

Trump's administration has stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.

The moves are a complete reversal from the Biden administration, which approved construction of 11 large offshore wind projects to generate enough clean energy to power more than 6 million homes. The projects now face uncertain futures under Trump.

Last week, the Interior Department asked a federal judge in Baltimore to cancel a previous approval by BOEM to build an offshore wind project in Maryland. The ocean agency has concluded that its prior weighing of the project's impacts was “deficient” and intends to reconsider that analysis to make a new decision, the department said.

Developer U.S. Wind has not yet begun construction, but plans for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project call for up to 114 turbines to power more than 718,000 homes.

BOEM had approved SouthCoast’s operations plan on Jan. 17, 2025, three days before Trump’s second term began.

“Based on its review to date, BOEM has determined that the COP approval may not have fully complied with the law" and "may have failed to account for all the impacts that the SouthCoast Wind Project may cause," Interior said in its legal filing. The agency asked a federal judge to allow reconsideration of the project.

In a statement, developer Ocean Winds said the company “intends to vigorously defend our permits in federal court.”

"Stable permitting for American infrastructure projects should be of top concern for anyone who wants to see continued investment in the United States,'' the statement said.

Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups, said Trump “is threatening good jobs while he pursues his senseless vendetta against offshore wind."

Pulling energy project permits and canceling lease sales isn't new. Biden revoked the permit to build the long-disputed Keystone XL oil pipeline on his first day in office, halting construction. He canceled scheduled oil and gas lease sales.

But Trump's efforts to dismantle the offshore wind industry are much more extensive than the way Biden targeted fossil fuels, said Kristoffer Svendsen, assistant dean for energy law at the George Washington University Law School. He thinks offshore wind developers will now see the U.S. as too risky.

“They have plenty of options. They can invest in Europe and Asia. There are good markets to invest in offshore wind. It's just the U.S. is not a good market to invest in,” he said.

The Trump administration has stopped construction on two major offshore wind farms, so far. One of them, the Empire Wind project for New York, was allowed to resume construction. The Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut is paused, and both the developer and the two states sued in federal courts.

The Danish energy company Orsted is building Revolution Wind. The Danish government owns a majority stake in the company.

Besides SouthCoast, the Trump administration has said it is reconsidering approvals for another wind farm off the Massachusetts coast, New England Wind. It previously revoked a permit for the Atlantic Shores project in New Jersey.
