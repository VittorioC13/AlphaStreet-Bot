[TITLE]Are for-profits, private equity to blame for rising medical costs, reduced quality, choice? — Harvard Gazette:
[TEXT]
For-profits, private equity can boost innovation, growth, care, according to co-author of new paper. But gains need to be aligned with patient outcomes.

Frustrated by the relentless rise in healthcare costs, many Americans think they know who’s to blame for the high cost of prescription drugs, the shuttering of local hospitals and clinics, and the merger of their favorite doctor’s medical practice with a competitor: for-profit corporations and private equity firms.

This growing trend in the U.S. is known as corporatization. Investors supply much-needed funding to pharmaceutical and biomedical companies, healthcare institutions, and physicians to help pay for drug development, meet escalating expenses, and increase efficiency and scale. But too often, critics say, the push for profit ends up leaving patients with reduced quality and choice, and ever-surging costs.

In a new paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, co-author Amitabh Chandra argues private investment in the healthcare system fills a critical need that others, like the federal government and nonprofits, simply cannot.

In this edited conversation, Chandra, who is director of the Malcolm Wiener Center for Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School and the Henry and Allison McCance Family Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, said contrary to popular opinion, profit-seeking in healthcare doesn’t necessarily mean that patients will be worse off.

What is corporatization?

Corporatization is essentially a deal between a medical organization and investors. The organization receives capital that can be used for new technologies, upgraded facilities, research, or competitive salaries.

In return, investors expect a share of the profits. The share might be small or large — 1 percent, 10 percent, or even 50 percent — depending on the terms of the agreement. At its core, corporatization “unlocks” money for growth, but it does so in a way that prioritizes profits, since investors can always move their funds elsewhere if returns are lacking

You say private investment in healthcare isn’t necessarily bad. What are some of the benefits besides an infusion of cash?

The deal between an investor and a medical organization is voluntary, so it clearly benefits those two parties. But the real question is whether it benefits society — and that’s not always obvious.

The key measure is what happens to patient outcomes when corporatization occurs. In some areas, such as nursing homes, the record is poor. Here, some private equity firm owners may cut staffing and reduce quality to boost profits, which has been linked to higher patient mortality.

“The key measure is what happens to patient outcomes when corporatization occurs.”

But in other areas, corporatization has delivered real benefits. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is one example. Because IVF is capital-intensive, larger corporate networks can use scale, data, and investment in technology to improve success rates. Patients benefit because quality is measurable (pregnancy rates), and clinics compete directly on outcomes and price.

Similarly, in the biopharmaceutical industry, private investment has been indispensable for funding the huge costs of drug development, enabling the creation of treatments that otherwise wouldn’t exist.

So, the benefits of corporatization beyond just “more money” depend on whether the investment is used to expand scale, improve processes, or foster innovation in ways that actually improve patient outcomes.

Because healthcare and scientific R&D are so expensive, isn’t tension between market incentives and health outcomes, between patients and profits, inevitable?

I don’t think so. The “inevitable tension” view assumes that anytime profits are involved, patients’ well-being is compromised. But imagine a world without profits — would patients automatically be better off? The answer is no.

Much of healthcare depends on improving quality and driving innovation: treating a heart attack patient better this year than last, developing new medicines, or adopting better technologies. All of that requires capital, and profits are what attract that capital.

It’s true that people worry — often rightly —

[TITLE]Igyxos Biotherapeutics Awarded EUR 5.7 Million from the French Government to Accelerate Development of its First-in-class Monoclonal Antibody for the Treatment of Infertility:
[TEXT]
TOURS, France, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Igyxos Biotherapeutics, a biotechnology company dedicated to developing innovative monoclonal antibodies for infertility treatment, today announced that it has secured a EUR 5.7 million grant under the France 2030 programme, via the “Biotherapies and Bioproduction of Innovative Therapies” call for projects (AAP), operated by Bpifrance on behalf of the French Government.

The non-dilutive funding will support Phase 2 clinical trials, in France and Europe, of the Company’s lead asset, IGX12. IGX12 is a first-in-class potentiating monoclonal antibody developed to enhance the potency and efficacy of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), a critical hormone involved in female and male gametogenesis.

Florent Ferré, Chief Executive Officer of Igyxos Biotherapeutics, said, “This funding marks another important new milestone in the clinical development of our innovative approach to treating infertility. Unlike current IVF treatment regimes, our approach addresses both female and male infertility. Male infertility accounts for nearly half of all infertility cases and currently has no approved treatment. Our goal is to advance IGX12 through Phase 2 clinical trials in both men and women, with the long term ambition of bringing to market a new therapeutic option for the millions of couples facing fertility challenges around the world.”

In the fourth quarter of 2025, Igyxos expects the latest results from its Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. Interim results have demonstrated good safety and tolerability of IGX12 both in men and women.

Key Factors Driving the Growth of the Lyme Disease Market

Rising Case Numbers and Expanded Surveillance

The increasing number of reported cases and broader surveillance are driving demand for diagnostics, treatments, and prevention tools, thereby fueling the growth of the Lyme disease market across testing, therapeutics, and public health services.

Growing Diagnostics Market

Demand for more accurate, faster, and higher-volume testing (ELISA, modified two-tier algorithms, PCR, point-of-care assays) is pushing market expansion and investment in new platforms. Recent market analyses show multi-billion-dollar global testing markets and mid-single-digit to low-double-digit CAGRs.

Launch of Emerging Lyme Disease Therapies

Companies worldwide are diligently working to develop novel therapies, achieving considerable success over the years. Key players, such as Valneva/Pfizer (VLA15), Tarsus Pharmaceuticals (TP-05), Moderna (mRNA-1982 and mRNA-1975), and others, are developing therapies for the management of Lyme disease.

Lyme Disease Market Analysis

The approach to treating Lyme disease depends on the stage of the illness, as the underlying pathophysiology differs at each stage. Consequently, antibiotic therapy must be tailored to the specific clinical manifestations. Current guidelines and recommendations follow this stage-specific strategy to help select the most appropriate antibiotics for each situation.

In 1998, the FDA approved LYMERIX (GSK), a recombinant Osp-A–based vaccine designed to prevent Lyme disease in adults. The vaccine required three doses administered over two tick seasons and demonstrated approximately 76% efficacy in preventing Lyme disease after completion of the whole series. LYMERIX and other Osp-A vaccines work by producing antibodies that block the transmission of Borreliella spirochetes from infected ticks during feeding on humans. However, public acceptance was low due to several factors, and in 2002, Smith-Kline Beecham withdrew LYMERIX from the market. Subsequent attempts by companies such as MedImmune, Baxter, and Connaught Laboratories to develop Lyme vaccines were also discontinued, leading to a decline in industry interest.

Two decades after LYMERIX, renewed efforts are underway to create next-generation human vaccines for Lyme disease prevention. A significant challenge for these vaccines is addressing the genetic diversity of pathogenic Borreliella species and strains in different regions. To overcome this, current vaccine candidates are designed to include multiple immunogenic antigens or several serotypes of a single antigen to broaden protection.
