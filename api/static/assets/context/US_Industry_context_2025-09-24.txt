[TITLE]How Intel's Nvidia deal could help Intel's next generation of chip manufacturing:
[TEXT]
By Stephen Nellis

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nvidia's deal with Intel could put the struggling chipmaker's next-generation manufacturing technology on a stronger footing, even without a direct commitment from the AI chip leader to use that technology to make its own chips, analysts said.

Nvidia on Thursday invested $5 billion in Intel for a stake of roughly 4%, and the two firms agreed to a deal to supply chips to one another to create "multiple generations" of joint products. Those products will connect Intel's central processors and Nvidia's artificial intelligence and graphics chips with a speedy and proprietary Nvidia connection technology called NVLink.

This could give Intel a leg up against rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices because its chips will be attached to Nvidia's flagship products in a way that no other third-party chips currently are, analysts said. The joint products - in early stages of development and likely to be made on future manufacturing lines - could also provide an indirect boost to Intel's 14A manufacturing process slated for 2027. Analysts have said this process is critical to its success, and Intel itself has warned it may not be able to pursue 14A if the company fails to get enough customer commitments to justify the expense of building it.

"Any relationship with Nvidia at this point, while not explicitly talking

[TITLE]Barfresh Enters into Stock Purchase Agreement for Strategic Acquisition of Manufacturing Company: Arps Dairy:
[TEXT]
Company Increases Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue Guidance to Range of $14.5 million to $15.5 million

Company Issues Preliminary Fiscal Year 2026 Pro Forma Revenue Guidance of $30 million to $35 Million; a 126% increase compared to the high range of fiscal 2025 guidance

Acquisition Dramatically Increases Bottling Production Capacity and is Expected to be Accretive to Earnings in Fiscal 2026

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barfresh Food Group Inc. (the “Company” or “Barfresh”) (Nasdaq: BRFH), a provider of frozen, ready-to-blend and ready-to-drink beverages, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding capital stock of Arps Dairy, Inc., an Ohio-based dairy processing company, for approximately $1.6 million in debt repayment, which the company was able to do by increasing its line of credit. The strategic acquisition positions Barfresh to significantly enhance its manufacturing capabilities while reducing operational costs and improving margins. The acquisition includes Arps Dairy's existing processing facility in Defiance, Ohio, consisting of 15,000 square-feet as well as an almost completely constructed 44,000-square-foot state-of-the-art manufacturing facility that Barfresh plans to complete construction and install processing equipment during 2026, creating a modern production hub that will serve as a cornerstone of the Company's expanded manufacturing strategy. In addition, Arps Dairy has been preliminarily approved for a $2.3 million government grant to be used towards finalizing the construction and equipment installation of the additional 44,000 square-foot facility.

Riccardo Delle Coste, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, "This manufacturing transaction represents a transformational step in our operational evolution and growth trajectory. By bringing the majority of our manufacturing in-house, we’re eliminating third-party manufacturing fees, reducing freight costs, and gaining greater control over our supply chain while positioning ourselves for accelerated growth and expanded market opportunities. The manufacturing facility acquisition provides us with the operational foundation and cost efficiencies necessary to scale our business profitably. The synergy of this acquisition will attract production opportunities and position us to capture significant value creation opportunities in 2026 and beyond, while delivering enhanced returns to our shareholders through improved operational efficiency and expanded market reach."

Barfresh is purchasing Arps at a discount to the projected completion value of its net assets, in addition to the benefit of an expected $2.3 million government grant, and has already commenced manufacturing certain products at Arps Dairy’s existing facility and expects to expand production immediately upon closing of agreement. This acquisition delivers multiple operational advantages including elimination of third-party manufacturing fees, more efficient ingredient procurement and reduced freight costs, lower cold storage costs through integrated operations, and enhanced oversight of production processes. Based on the expected operational benefits from the manufacturing capacity expansion and new market expansion opportunities enabled by the Arps acquisition, Barfresh is raising its fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance to $14.5 million to $15.5 million, representing an increase from the previous guidance range of $12.5 million to $14.0 million. The Company is also providing preliminary fiscal year 2026 revenue guidance of $30 million to $35 million, reflecting the full-year impact of the enhanced manufacturing capabilities, operational synergies and expanded market reach from the increased production capacity.

The acquisition is structured as a stock purchase for approximately $1.6 million, representing the repayment of certain existing Arps Dairy debt, including an asset-based revolving facility, with closing subject to customary conditions.

Barfresh expects the transaction to close by October 1, 2025.

[TITLE]Largest US rail union endorses Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern merger:
[TEXT]
By Sabrina Valle

(Reuters) -The largest U.S. railroad union said Monday it will support Union Pacific's $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, helping to advance a deal that surprised competitors and had been expected to face resistance from labor and regulators.

The endorsement marks a shift from the initial opposition by SMART-TD, the transportation division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers. When the merger was announced in July, the union said it would oppose the deal on concerns about job security, competition and infrastructure access.

SMART-TD said its members working in train and yardmaster services will have job protection for the length of their careers following the transaction.

"For generations, railroaders have worried about what mergers might mean for their jobs. Today, we can say with confidence that the biggest railroad and the biggest rail union in America are breaking new ground," SMART-TD President Jeremy Ferguson said in a

[TITLE]Biggest rail union joins others in endorsing Union Pacific merger but some still have reservations:
[TEXT]
OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The nation's largest railroad union joined the list of companies endorsing Union Pacific's proposed $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern Monday after securing promises to protect jobs, but other unions and chemical makers that rely on the railroads are still expressing concerns about the deal.

The SMART-TD union that represents conductors and other rail workers said Union Pacific put CEO Jim Vena's promise not to lay off any of its workers as a result of the merger in writing and promised to protect their jobs throughout their careers. But the head of one of the next biggest unions said he doesn't think this deal does nearly enough to protect rail jobs, so he's not ready to support the merger that would create the nation's first transcontinental railroad.

The union's endorsement comes just days after President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he deal sounds good to him, but groups like the American Chemistry Council and the Rail Customer Coalition have said they worry that allowing two of the six largest railroads to merge will only hurt competition and lead to even higher shipping rates.

The president of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union said he believes his Teamsters have enough influence with the White House that he may be able to change Trump's mind once he gets a chance to explain some of the details and the tactics he believes the railroad will use to eliminate jobs.

Rail unions divided over the merger

But SMART-TD President Jeremy Ferguson, who initially criticized the merger and promised to oppose it, said Monday that he now believes it is for the best after the railroad promised to protect jobs.

“For generations, railroaders have worried about what mergers might mean for their jobs and whether or not they would be given the opportunity to reach retirement on the rail," Ferguson said. “Today, we can say with confidence that the biggest railroad and the biggest rail union in America are breaking new ground. We are protecting jobs, protecting families, and protecting the future of the U.S. supply chain.”

Tony Cardwell, president of the BMWED, said his union rejected similar offer from Union Pacific a couple weeks ago because the railroad wouldn't agree to protect workers if it decides to lease more of its tracks to short-line railroads to handle the final deliveries as it has already done in a couple locations. He said what good is a promise of a job if it means either taking a pay cut to go to work for a smaller railroad or moving across the country to keep a job with Union Pacific.

[TITLE]New York Life Lends $130M for SoCal Industrial Portfolio:
[TEXT]
The investment affiliate of an Orange County, Calif.-based construction company has landed a nine-figure refinancing loan, from one of the nation’s most prominent lenders, for 1.1 million square feet of Southern California industrial space, Commercial Observer can first report.

Sukut Real Properties, which shares an address with Santa Ana-based Sukut Construction, secured a five-year, $130 million loan toward 21 properties across Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, as well as the Inland Empire region. New York Life provided the fixed-rate loan, a source told CO.

The 1.1 million-square-foot portfolio is currently 98 percent leased, according to broker JLL, with tenants in the automotive, biotech and logistics industries, among others. Yet the exact addresses, names and square footage of the properties were not immediately available. The properties were developed between 1968 and 2016, per JLL. A representative for Sukut did not immediately respond to a request for comment or more information.

JLL’s Greg Brown, Allie Black and Nick Englhard arranged the financing on behalf of Sukut.

“Sukut Real Properties has assembled an exceptional collection of assets that benefit from irreplaceable locations, strong tenant relationships and significant mark-to-market opportunities,” Brown said in a statement. “The portfolio’s geographic and tenant diversification, combined with its proximity to major transportation infrastructure, positions it to capitalize on Southern California’s continued industrial demand growth driven by e-commerce, manufacturing and logistics operations.”

Southern California’s industrial market is the largest in the Western Hemisphere, yet general economic and tariff uncertainty continue to cause anxiety among developers and investors within the region.

Still, the market’s fundamentals are too good to ignore, despite the risks. Metlife Investment Management, for example, recently sold a three-property industrial portfolio in separate deals for a total of $165.5 million.

[TITLE]Construction Spending Strategic Business Report 2025: Market to Reach $5 Trillion by 2030 - Growth in Public-Private Partnerships Spurs Investment in Large-Scale Projects:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Construction Spending - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Construction Spending was estimated at US$4.0 Trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$5.0 Trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.5% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Construction spending refers to the total expenditure on construction projects over a specific period. It encompasses a broad range of activities, from residential and commercial building to infrastructure development such as roads, bridges, and utilities. This measure is an important economic indicator, reflecting both public and private sector investment in building and infrastructure works. The figures are closely monitored by economists, investors, and policymakers because they provide insights into the health of the construction industry, which is a significant component of gross domestic product (GDP) and directly correlates with the overall economic health of a country.

In recent years, the landscape of construction spending has been shaped by a variety of trends and shifts in both residential and commercial sectors. Residential construction has seen a notable upswing driven by low interest rates, increasing demand for housing, and an evolving preference for suburban and rural homes - a trend accelerated by the global shift towards remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the commercial front, there has been a significant transformation with increased investments in industrial facilities, especially those related to e-commerce and logistics. Conversely, the office and retail construction sectors have faced declines, as businesses reevaluate their space needs in response to increasing online shopping and ongoing adjustments to where and how people work.

The growth in the construction spending market is driven by several factors, including technological advancements in building materials and construction methods. The adoption of green building practices, aimed at reducing carbon footprints and enhancing energy efficiency, has spurred new projects that adhere to stricter environmental regulations. Furthermore, government fiscal policies, particularly public spending on infrastructure projects, significantly influence construction spending.

Economic recovery packages, often including substantial allocations for infrastructure, can lead to surges in sector activity. Consumer behavior, particularly the increased demand for customized and luxury residential properties, also plays a critical role in driving construction spending. These multifaceted growth drivers ensure that the construction industry remains robust and capable of adapting to evolving economic and environmental landscapes.

[TITLE]GE Aerospace reaches five-year labor deal with 600 striking UAW workers:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) - GE Aerospace reached a five-year labor agreement with more than 600 striking workers of the United Auto Workers union at its Ohio and Kentucky distribution facilities, the aircraft engine supplier said on Friday.

The agreement ends a three-week strike at GE Aerospace's Evendale plant in Ohio that produces marine and industrial engines for the U.S. Navy and its Erlanger facility in Kentucky that supplies parts to some of the company's engine plants.

The tentative deal outlined by the union includes a base wage increase ranging from 3% to 5% through 2029, along with about $3,500 in cash payments per employee to help offset rising healthcare costs.
