Indian investors are showing growing faith in Reliance Industries (RIL), the country’s most valuable company — even as foreign funds take a step back.In the September 2025 quarter, retail investors slightly increased their stake in Reliance to 7.08%, up from 6.92% in the June quarter, according to shareholding data. That means over 42 lakh small investors now collectively own around 94 crore shares of Reliance Industries.At the same time, mutual funds also boosted their exposure, raising their stake from 9.32% to 9.66%. The move indicates growing domestic conviction in Reliance’s prospects — even though the stock’s performance has been far from stellar lately.In sharp contrast, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) trimmed their holdings in the company, cutting their stake from 19.21% to 18.65%. The number of foreign investors fell as well — from 2,280 to 2,146 — suggesting that global funds may be taking a more cautious stance toward Indian equities or booking profits after a long rally.This shifting ownership pattern comes at an intriguing time.

[TITLE]Peachtree Supplies $35M Acquisition Loan for Chicago-Area Retail Center – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Core Acquisitions has nabbed a $35 million loan to acquire a grocery-anchored shopping center in suburban Chicago, Commercial Observer has learned.

Peachtree Group originated the acquisition loan for Core’s $44 million purchase of the Deerbrook Shopping Center in Deerfield, Ill., from global investment firm DWS.

Taylor Pike, senior vice president at Peachtree, said the property has strong retail fundamentals with a lease through 2035 with anchor tenant Jewel-Osco, the largest grocer in the Chicago metropolitan area. It has been at the site since 1968. The 428,000-square-foot property also includes Marshalls, Floor & Décor, Panera Bread, Starbucks and Sky Zone.

Pike said the northern area of the property has strong foot traffic from a number of national chains, while the southern portion has vacancy with potential for “value-add” redevelopment. He noted that another draw for the deal was Chicago-based Core Acquisitions’ strong institutional knowledge of the market.

“They all live here and drive past the center every single day, and we really like the fact that they’re going to be super hands-on,” said Pike of Core. “They’re going to know a bunch of people that go there, and we like that story and that kind of commitment because they’re going to be in there every single day, working it, trying to make it the best that it can be.”

Deerbook Shopping Center is located at 16 South Waukegan Road, 40 miles north of Downtown Chicago. Pike said the shopping center draws plenty of traffic, with access to Interstate 94 and Metra commuter rail. He also noted new multifamily projects are being developed near the shopping center that will potentially add more foot traffic.

Core Acquisitions did not immediately return a request for comment.

[TITLE]There could be a buying opportunity in consumer packaged goods stocks, Jim Cramer says:
[TEXT]
CNBC's Jim Cramer told investors why he thinks it might be a good time to invest in packaged good stocks that have been lagged as of late, naming companies including Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark as undervalued winners in the sector.

"Right now, I'm concerned that we might be missing a bottom in a group of stocks that I haven't particularly cared for at all, especially in a long time," he said.

Wall Street has largely soured on the packaged goods group for a while, Cramer suggested, saying there has been too much inflation and not enough growth.

But inflation may be nearing a peak, Cramer said, which would drive consumer giants' costs down. The Trump administration's lenient attitude towards antitrust enforcement also makes it easier for companies to merge and dominate the industry, Cramer suggested.

Kimberly-Clark just announced it plans to buy Kenvue , Cramer noted, and he praised the latter's brands even as Trump officials promote unproven theories that question the safety of Tylenol, one of its popular drugs. He lauded Procter & Gamble as an inventive company that has the size and scale to make products cheaper. Clorox , which is one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 , also caught Cramer's eye, and he said he likes its namesake cleaner as well as brands like Burt's Bees, Hidden Valley and Brita. He added that investors willing to take on risk might want to buy General Mills — but only if they're betting on a takeover, as the popularity of weight loss drugs is putting food stocks under pressure.

Cramer also said investors can look beyond traditional consumer packaged goods stocks and into pharmaceuticals, saying he expects big mergers in that industry. He named Johnson & Johnson and Amgen as solid picks.

There's "too much opportunity to pass up," Cramer said, "given that these are currently among the most hated companies in the universe."

[TITLE]Trump cuts tariffs on goods like coffee, bananas and beef in bid to slash consumer prices:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.

President Donald Trump on Friday exempted key agricultural imports like coffee, cocoa, bananas and certain beef products from his higher tariff rates.

The move comes as Trump faces political blowback for high prices at U.S. grocery stores. Some distributors of beef, coffee, chocolate and other common food items have raised prices as Trump's tariffs took hold this year, adding to pressure on household budgets created by decades-high inflation in recent years.

Trump's action Friday also exempts a range of fruits including tomatoes, avocados, coconuts, oranges and pineapples. Along with coffee, the tariff reductions extend to black and green tea, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.

The move marks a reversal for Trump, who has insisted tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. businesses and workers. He has contended U.S. consumers will not ultimately pay for the higher duties.

The exemptions come just a day after Trump reached trade framework agreements with four Latin American countries – including 10% tariffs on most goods from Argentina, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and 15% from Ecuador. It also removes duties specifically on products not grown or produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities, like bananas and coffee.

Rising food prices have hampered U.S. households for several years. Consumer Price Index data show food-at-home prices increased approximately 2.7% year-over-year in September. (More recent data was delayed because of the government shutdown).

The tariff exemptions aim to help moderate these grocery price increases, although experts caution that other factors such as global supply shortages also influence prices, especially for coffee and beef.

Here's more background on how industries like beef, coffee and cocoa have reacted to tariffs and rising prices.

[TITLE]Redesdale invests in Talio Technologies to forecast emerging food trends through AI:
[TEXT]
Redesdale invests in early-stage companies in the food, drink and nutrition sector.

John Conroy’s Redesdale Fund has invested in a company that uses artificial intelligence to help food businesses identify emerging consumer trends.

Talio Technologies uses AI agents to gather and analyse data on menus, retail trends and social habits to help food companies make faster and better-informed decisions on new products and marketing.

Founded in Dublin by Oran O’Flynn and Ciaran O’Connor, Talio says it works with food and beverage groups to support trend forecasting, concept development and long-term innovation planning. It numbers Kerry Group and Valeo among its clients.

Talio says its AI allows customers to differentiate between short-term fads and more sustained shifts in taste.

“This is a very exciting opportunity for Redesdale as it brings us into the AI technology space in food and we are partnering with first-class entrepreneurs in Oran and Ciaran, who have shown tremendous drive and skill to bring this product to market,” said Redesdale partner Michael Cantwell.

It is the venture capital group’s first AI-related investment.

“Innovation in the food and beverage industry has never moved faster,” Talio said. “For enterprise teams, predicting what’s truly next – beyond the hype – can mean the difference between a blockbuster launch and a costly misfire.”

The Redesdale Fund focuses on investment in early-stage businesses in the food, drink and nutrition sectors. Talio is the fifth investment by the €27 million fund which is backed by Enterprise Ireland, US-based Lord Abbett, Musgrave, Coca-Cola, Monaghan Mushrooms and Tate & Lyle.

The fund is expected to ramp up its investment portfolio over the coming months.

The group’s investments to date include: Dundalk-based Soothing Solutions, which says its dissolvable honey-based jelly pop harnesses natural ingredients to provide relief for children with sore throats; Thanks Plants, which produces a range of plant-based products such as frankfurters, sausages and roasts for health-conscious consumers; Fiid, a maker of plant-based microwaveable meals for the convenience meal market; and Kwayga, a company that has developed technology to help supermarket buyers cut their sourcing times dramatically.

[TITLE]Raising Cane's Founder Calls Out Venture Capital in Fast Food 'If Your Motivation is Money, Then You're Not Gonna Care':
[TEXT]
Venture capital firms investing in fast food restaurants have caused once-beloved chains to give up the things that made them famous, Raising Cane founder and co-CEO Todd Graves said recently.

"It's like death by a thousand cuts," Graves said on the YouTube talk show "Hustle Meals." "Ultimately, if your motivation is money then you're not gonna care. You're going to let those great quality things go down…that's what's happened to fast food."

Don't Miss:

Graves was responding to a comment from "Hustle Meals" host Josh Scherer about how fast food is typically seen as successful due to its replicability and consistency. "However, we've seen with so many chains as they expand, that consistency drops," Scherer said.

The investment firms that take controlling interest in fast food chains often value profits over customer service, Graves said. "That's when the CFOs jump in and say, ‘You know what? We don't need to make our sauce in house at every restaurant,'" he said. "We can make it in a commissary and we'll save ‘X.'"

He also said there's a "lack of founders that care" about their restaurants. "I care that everybody gets a good quality, craveable meal in a place that's food-safe, friendly, and we're getting them their food fast," he said.

Investment firms in fast food

Many fast food and fast-casual restaurant brands have been acquired by private equity and venture capital firms in recent years. Roark Capital has controlling interests in Subway, Dunkin', Arby's, and Buffalo Wild Wings.

Diner chain Denny's was taken private by TriArtisan Capital Advisors, Treville Capital Group, and Yadav Enterprises earlier this month.

“Private equity and venture capital firms are drawn to fast-food and fast-casual concepts because they combine reliable, recurring revenue with scalable unit-level economics," Brian Alas, managing director at investment bank Boxwood Partners, said in a statement to Benzinga. "These businesses operate on predictable margins, require relatively low capital to replicate, and benefit from consistent consumer demand even during economic downturns."

[TITLE]Nike Announces World’s First Powered Footwear To Help People Walk Faster and Farther:
[TEXT]
As an activewear company, Nike has been at the forefront of athletic apparel and footwear for several decades now, and they continue to innovate as technology moves forward. Their latest endeavor, called Project Amplify, goes a step further. Bringing robotics into the equation, Project Amplify is lauded as the world’s first powered footwear system for running and walking, allowing users to go faster and farther with less effort.

Developed alongside bionic footwear and apparel brand Dephy, this accessory works by boosting natural lower leg and ankle movement. Nike has described the device as “a second set of calf muscles.” With a shape that evokes an ankle brace, it features a light but mighty motor, a drive belt, and a rechargeable cuff battery. The entire system integrates seamlessly with a running shoe that can be worn with or without the brace.

While this is the latest in sports technology, Nike didn’t create Project Amplify with professional athletes in mind. Instead, it wants to boost the millions of regular folks who use their products in their everyday lives. After all, for Nike, there is no divide in who qualifies as an athlete—if you have a body, you’re part of the club. That’s why Nike tested it on 400 athletes of all abilities and intensities.

“Akin to how electric bikes have made it easier to ride farther and more frequently, revolutionizing urban commuting,” the company explains, “Nike is developing Project Amplify to make slower running, jogging and walking easier and more fun, with a focus on athletes running between a 10- and 12-minute mile pace.”

As Project Amplify continues to be tested, Nike is also working on new developments in fields like advanced cooling and mind science. “We’ve always believed movement is medicine, and Project Amplify is the next chapter in that story. It’s a bold leap forward, crossing a new threshold of putting power directly into your stride,” says Michael Donaghu, VP of Create The Future, Emerging Sport and Innovation at Nike. “The fun comes from realizing you can do more than you thought you could—whatever ‘more’ means to you.”

Nike’s latest endeavor, Project Amplify, is lauded as the world’s first powered footwear system for running and walking.

Developed alongside bionic footwear and apparel brand Dephy, it works by boosting natural lower leg and ankle movement.

Instead of focusing on professional athletes, Nike created this revolutionary system with pedestrians in mind, allowing them to go faster and farther with less effort.

[TITLE]Beyond Discounts: iGaming's New Deal:
[TEXT]
The frantic, coffee-fueled-refresh-hitting of Cyber Monday is starting to lose its magic. That “50% Off!” email, which once felt like a secret key to massive savings, now just feels… predictable. We’ve all felt the “deal fatigue.” We buy a discounted toaster or a pair of headphones, and the excitement is fleeting. But as the thrill of traditional e-commerce sales wanes, a new contender for the “best deal” crown has emerged: the iGaming industry. This sector isn’t just offering discounts; it’s fundamentally redefining what “value” means to a consumer.

The core difference lies in the value proposition. A Cyber Monday deal, at its heart, is a discount on an expense. You have to spend $200 to “save” $50. The iGaming industry completely flips this script. Its deals are built around multipliers. A typical offer isn’t “spend less”; it’s “get more.” An offer to “deposit $50 and play with $100” feels psychologically different. It’s not a rebate; it’s a value-add that doubles your entertainment potential from the very start.

This shift is evident across the digital entertainment landscape. Consumers who are savvy about value now compare a 20% discount on electronics to the kinds of welcome offers available on various platforms. For instance, in the iGaming space, promotions are a core part of the user experience, not just a seasonal event. Enthusiasts visiting a site like VulkanBet casino often find that the value lies in the added playtime and enhanced experience, which a simple e-commerce discount struggles to match. This model is built on engagement, not just transactions.

The Psychology: A Bonus vs. A Discount

The power of the iGaming model lies in its deep understanding of behavioral psychology. A discount is passive; a bonus is active. It taps into our desire for gamification and a sense of “beating the system.”

The Gamification of Loyalty

E-commerce loyalty programs are often slow and uninspired, offering tiny points that eventually lead to a minor discount. The iGaming industry, by contrast, has mastered gamification. Loyalty is rewarded instantly and in tiers. Players unlock new levels, “free spins,” or exclusive bonuses simply by participating. This creates a compelling loop that makes the user feel valued and rewarded for their time, not just their money. The “deal” is an ongoing, interactive experience rather than a single, boring transaction.

Personalization at Scale

Cyber Monday deals are a broadcast, a one-size-fits-all digital flyer. They might be based on your browsing history, but they often feel impersonal. iGaming platforms excel at personalization. The deals you are offered are often tied directly to your play style, your favorite games, or your loyalty status. A “VIP” player gets a different, more substantial bonus than a casual new user. This targeted approach makes the user feel recognized and understood, making the “deal” feel far more exclusive and valuable than a generic 20% off coupon code.

More Than Just a Transaction

When you break it down, the e-commerce model and the iGaming model are selling two completely different things. One is selling a product; the other is selling an experience.

The Entertainment Factor

When you buy a discounted laptop on Cyber Monday, the “fun” part (the deal) is over in a click. The real product (the laptop) is the goal. In iGaming, the “deal” is the product. A 100% deposit bonus or a set of free spins directly translates to more entertainment. The value isn’t a physical item; it’s extended playtime, more chances for a thrilling win, and a longer, more engaging experience. You are, in effect, buying “fun,” and the bonus is just “more fun” for your money.

Immediacy is King

Let’s not forget the most powerful psychological driver of all: instant gratification. You find a Cyber Monday deal, you click “buy,” and then… You wait. You track the shipping for three to five business days. The iGaming bonus is immediate. The moment you make your deposit, the bonus funds are credited to your account, ready for use. This instant, tangible reward provides a dopamine hit that the “your item has shipped” email simply cannot compete with.

What E-Commerce Can Learn

This doesn’t mean Cyber Monday is dead, but it does mean e-commerce platforms are no longer the undisputed kings of value. To compete, they need to think less like digital department stores and more like entertainment platforms.

They can start by shifting their focus from simple discounts to more engaging reward structures.

Focus on Gaining, Not Saving: Instead of just “50% off,” offer “Buy one, get one” or “Spend $50, get a $25 credit” on a future purchase. This reframes the value from losing less to gaining more.

Gamify the Shopping Experience: Implement meaningful loyalty tiers that offer tangible, instant rewards, not just points that expire. Create “missions” or “challenges” for shoppers to unlock exclusive deals.

Personalize Rewards: Use data to offer rewards that truly matter to the individual, making them feel like a valued VIP, not just another name on an email list.

A Shift in Value Perception

The battle for the consumer’s dollar is no longer just about the lowest price. It’s about the best experience and the greatest perceived value. While Cyber Monday will continue to be a day for stocking up on goods, the iGaming industry has proven that a well-designed, bonus-driven ecosystem can create far more excitement and loyalty. It has shifted the goalposts from “saving money” to “getting more,” and in a digital world, that’s a much more compelling game to play.

Which do you find more appealing: a 50% discount on a product, or a 100% bonus to enhance an experience? Share your thoughts below.
