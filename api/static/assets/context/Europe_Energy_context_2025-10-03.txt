[TITLE]Russian shelling cuts power to decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) -Russian air strikes have cut power to the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukraine's Energy Ministry said on Wednesday, including a new containment unit erected to minimise contamination from the world's biggest nuclear accident.

Energy officials also said the shelling had caused mass power outages in nearby Chernihiv region, cutting off 307,000 customers near Ukraine's northern border with Russia.

The Chernihiv region's governor said generators had been set up for key sites like hospitals, and emergency crews were working on restoring the power network.

The Energy Ministry statement made no mention of any possible increased risk of radioactive release as a result of the power cutoff to the defunct Chernobyl station. But it said emergency crews were working to restore the power supply.

"Due to Russian shelling of energy infrastructure in the Kyiv region in the city of Slavutych, an emergency situation has arisen at the facilities of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant," a ministry statement said.

"As a result of power surges, the new safe confinement facility, which isolates the destroyed fourth power unit of the Chernobyl station and prevents the release of radioactive materials into the environment, was left without power supply."

The statement said teams of experts were working on restoring power to the facility.

After the Chernobyl station's fourth reactor exploded in April 1986 and spread radioactivity throughout Europe, Soviet engineers hurriedly erected a "sarcophagus" around the reactor.

This was replaced by a new confinement structure in 2016, while the plant's other three reactors were gradually taken out of service.

The plant was briefly occupied by Russian forces at the beginning of their 2022 invasion of Ukraine. And a Russian drone pierced the confinement structure's roof in February.

The Kremlin has played down safety fears around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in occupied southeastern Ukraine – the biggest such facility in Europe – as Kyiv said it faced a “critical” situation after relying for a week on emergency generators.

Russian troops seized the plant shortly after launching their all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Russian technicians now oversee the cooling and other systems that ensure the safety of its six reactors – all of which are shut down – and of spent nuclear fuel stored at the site.

Ukraine and Russia blame each other for shelling and drone strikes in the area that have repeatedly damaged electricity lines to the plant, forcing it to rely on backup diesel generators that have now been powering the facility for more than a week.

“It is now the seventh day – something that has never happened before,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Tuesday night.

“The situation is critical ... The generators and the plant were not designed for this, have never operated in this mode for long, and we already have information that one generator has failed. It is Russian shelling that prevents repair of the power lines to the plant and the restoration of basic safety,” he added.

“This is a threat to everyone – no terrorist in the world has ever dared to do to a nuclear plant what Russia is doing. And it is right that the world does not stay silent.”

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its monitors had reported that emergency generators at the plant were working and that water supply for cooling systems for the reactors and spent fuel storage sites was sufficient.

“While the plant is currently coping thanks to its emergency diesel generators – the last line of defence – and there is no immediate danger as long as they keep working, it is clearly not a sustainable situation in terms of nuclear safety. Neither side would benefit from a nuclear accident,” said IAEA director general Rafael Grossi.

“I’m in constant contact with the two sides with the aim to enable the plant’s swift reconnection to the electricity grid,” he added. “It is extremely important that off-site power is restored. I strongly encourage both sides to work with us and enable these essential repairs to take place.”

Next April will mark 40 years since the world’s worst nuclear accident, at Chernobyl in northern Ukraine, and Ukrainians are very concerned about the safety of the occupied Zaporizhzhia site and three functioning nuclear plants that remain under Kyiv’s control.

“It is foolish, to say the least, to accuse the Russian side of bombing a plant it controls ... This is a Russian facility, it is under our control and therefore the Russian side ensures security at this plant,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.

“The Russian side is in constant contact with the IAEA and, in accordance with accepted norms and rules, informs the IAEA about the situation at the plant.”

It is not clear whether diesel supplies to the plant could be affected by growing fuel shortages in parts of Russia and Russian-occupied territory. Analysts say 38 per cent of Russian oil refining capacity was out of action in late September, predominantly due to long-range Ukrainian drone attacks.

As fighting and Russian air strikes continued in eastern Ukraine, at least nine people were killed in flash floods in and around the southern port of Odesa. Hundreds of people had to be rescued and thousands suffered blackouts due to torrential rain.

Mr Zelenskiy ordered a high-level review of why the downpours led to what he called “a horrific situation” in the Black Sea city.

[TITLE]Macron, Meloni argue for caution in responding to Russian ‘provocations’:
[TEXT]
EU leaders meet in Denmark after a series of drone incidents near the country’s airports and military bases over the last week.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has called on Europe to arm itself to respond to Russia’s hybrid warfare, but other major continental leaders have argued for caution against getting trapped in a tit-for-tat cycle of escalation with Moscow.

“I hope that everybody recognises now that there is a hybrid war and one day it’s Poland, the other day it’s Denmark, and next week it will probably be somewhere else that we see sabotage or we see drones flying,” Frederiksen told reporters on Wednesday.

She made the comments while hosting a summit of European leaders as they discussed joint efforts for better deterrence and defence.

French President Emmanuel Macron, also at the summit, however, urged the European Union to proceed with circumspection.

“I think we all have to be very cautious because we are in a time of confrontation with a lot of hybridity,” Macron said on Wednesday on the sidelines of the summit in Copenhagen.

“This is why we have to be strong to deter any aggressions, but we have to remain very cautious and avoid any escalation,” he added.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also warned against overreacting.

“Despite everything, I think we have to think calmly. I think we shouldn’t respond to provocations. We have to equip ourselves; that certainly is true,” she said.

Hybrid warfare involves the use of conventional methods, such as tanks and missiles, as well as nonconventional ones, such as cyberattacks and internet disinformation.

Russia has been “a very aggressive player” for several years, the French president said, citing cyberattacks during elections, its war against Ukraine, the use of nuclear threats and recent airspace violations.

The heads of state and prime ministers of the EU countries were meeting in Denmark’s capital following a series of drone incidents near the country’s airports and military bases over the last week.

Before the meeting, a special radar system was set up at Copenhagen airport to help keep watch. Unidentified drones forced the closure of the airfield a week ago, causing major disruptions.

France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom also sent aircraft, ships and air defence systems to Denmark in advance of the talks.

While the Danish authorities have not identified those believed to be responsible, Frederiksen said, “there is only one country that is willing to threaten us, and it is Russia, and therefore we need a very strong answer back”.

The Danish prime minister appealed for rearmament in the face of growing threats.

“I want us to rearm. I want us to buy more capabilities. I want us to innovate more, for example, on drones,” she said. “When I look at Europe today, I think we are in the most difficult and dangerous situation since the end of the Second World War.”

Airspace violations

Serious airspace violations have been recorded in Europe over the last month, but not all nations in the bloc agree on how to respond.

After Russia was blamed for drone incursions into NATO members Poland and Romania, Macron last week said the alliance’s response would have to “go up a notch” in the case of “new provocations” from Moscow.

Macron did not rule out downing a Russian fighter jet if it were to breach European airspace.

“In accordance with the doctrine of strategic ambiguity, I can tell you that nothing is ruled out,” he said in an interview with German daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.

Last month, Poland said it had shot down Russian drones that violated its airspace as Moscow launched a barrage against Ukraine, while Romania’s Ministry of National Defence said the country’s airspace had been breached by a drone during a Russian attack on infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine.

On Wednesday, Macron also alleged that an oil tanker off the French coast had committed “very serious wrongdoings” and linked it to Russia’s shadow fleet, which is avoiding Western sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine.

The tanker was sailing off the coast of Denmark last week and was cited by European naval experts as possibly being involved in drone flights over the Nordic country.

After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, leaders and intelligence services believed that Russia could mount an assault elsewhere in Europe in three to five years, and that President Vladimir Putin is intent on testing NATO amid doubts about United States President Donald Trump’s commitment to the organisation.

Other defence experts, however, question the readiness of Russia’s military for another large-scale war.

[TITLE]Dynamic database addresses vanadium supply flow:
[TEXT]
This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Geographic distribution of global vanadium production and selected VFB installations. Credit: Joule (2025). DOI: 10.1016/j.joule.2025.102139, https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00320-4

Scientists at PSI have created a dynamic database for vanadium, an important raw material. This metal has enormous potential for the energy transition. Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) can store electricity for longer than the widely used lithium-ion technology.

This makes them particularly suitable for storing surplus wind and solar power in large facilities and feeding it back into the grid at a later time. They can therefore serve as energy buffers, stabilizing the power grid and ensuring electricity supply even during a dunkelflaute, a period when neither the wind nor the sun are producing enough electricity. The lack of such storage facilities is considered one of the biggest challenges for the energy transition because the supply of wind and solar power is less steady than that of electricity from coal or gas-fired power stations.

Benjamin Rogers, a Ph.D. student at PSI and ETH Zurich, spent over two years collecting data from all the players in the vanadium industry worldwide—from mine operators to the processing industry—to compile the database. He conducted this work within the team of Sarbajit Banerjee, Head of the Laboratory for Battery Research at the PSI Center for Energy and Environmental Sciences and Professor of Chemistry at ETH Zurich.

The database includes information on suspected and confirmed ore deposits from which vanadium could be extracted economically, as well as planned and achieved mining volumes, demand, processing methods and quantities, prices and other relevant key figures. All this data has been incorporated into a kind of "living global map" for vanadium, which is constantly updated to reflect current developments and is available to all industry players—companies, governments and scientists.

The work is published in the journal Joule.

"It's a matter of creating a reliable basis for making investment and policy decisions," says Rogers, "something that has been lacking until now."

As a result of this, the comparatively small vanadium market is still highly volatile: prices fluctuate a great deal, which is why many companies are reluctant to invest in mining it. Consequently, the supply of the metal is not reliably assured.

Market dominance and price volatility

Although there are sufficient vanadium deposits worldwide, the metal was long considered too rare and too expensive to be a comprehensive solution for storing surplus green electricity. Prices have since fallen—but so much so that planned new mines in Australia are on the brink of economic collapse. The main reason for these pronounced fluctuations is market concentration: over 60% of the 150,000 tonnes produced annually worldwide comes from China, with the rest being mined almost exclusively in Russia, South Africa and Brazil. Countries such as Australia, Canada, the U.S. and Kazakhstan also have large reserves, but these have hardly been tapped.

Until now, vanadium has mainly been used to strengthen structural steel alloys. A change in Chinese law following the severe earthquake in 2008 made the addition of vanadium mandatory, causing demand—and prices—to rise sharply. However, the end of the Chinese construction boom led to a drop in prices, which jeopardized mining projects already underway in Australia.

Reliable data on raw materials

"The aim of our project is to avoid such price extremes, thereby allowing vanadium production to become more reliable and sustainable," says Sarbajit Banerjee. A chemist by training, he has been studying this metal for years as a material for cathodes in batteries, catalysts and computer technology. His research group has already given rise to two start-ups in the sector. One is designing vanadium cathodes, the other developing processes for extracting lithium from water using vanadium. "In this respect, we've been well-connected in the scene for quite a time, and everyone recognized the need for a project like ours," Banerjee reports.

The main partner in the development of the database is Vanitec, an association comprising many industry players specializing in vanadium.

To guarantee the reliability of the data, the researchers have it independently verified—as far as possible. "The most difficult part was not obtaining the data," says Rogers, "but harmonizing it." The incoming data is based on a wide variety of counting methods and must be standardized to ensure good comparability.

Innovative financing models are needed

Reliable parameters allow large and small companies, investors and policymakers to plan for the long term. This is important not least because it often takes ten or even fifteen years from the discovery of a deposit to the actual extraction and sale of the metal.

"Many large mining companies that can afford to bridge this period without investors won't even enter the vanadium market until it reaches a volume of at least 500,000 tonnes per year," says Banerjee.

This is why his team suggests that, in addition to data, innovative financing models are needed. One idea is long-term purchase guarantees. India, which needs a lot of vanadium, could for example promise Australia that it will buy a certain amount per year as soon as the mines there start producing it.

Another option is known as resource leasing which is already common practice for some other metals. The vanadium-mining country "leases out" its vanadium for a set period of time, so to speak. This allows countries that produce natural resources to retain ownership of them, while reducing the buyer's capital investment and risk and ensuring that demand remains stable.

The world's largest battery storage facility soon to be completed in Switzerland

Vanadium redox flow batteries are primarily used as large-scale stationary storage systems to stabilize the power grid, particularly in wind and solar parks or for industrial consumers. However, they are also suitable for use in larger residential complexes and for supplying power to data centers, which require more and more electricity—not least due to the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.

The world's largest vanadium redox flow battery plant is currently being built right next door to an AI data center in Laufenburg, Switzerland. With 960 tanks and 250 million liters of liquid electrolyte, the plant is expected to provide a storage capacity of 1.6 gigawatt hours.

Banerjee and Rogers hope that this example will set a precedent in Europe and that vanadium redox flow batteries will be used more widely to advance the energy transition.

"We are at an important junction," says Banerjee. "If we succeed in extracting vanadium efficiently and economically and producing batteries like these in large numbers, this could contribute significantly to a stable, sustainable energy supply."

With the new dynamic database, PSI researchers are helping other markets to access the necessary information and utilize the potential of this technology more quickly.
