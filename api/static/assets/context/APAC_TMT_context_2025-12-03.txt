The big story

Sitting in his new Beijing office, AI2 Robotics Founder and CEO Eric Guo wistfully reflected on fundraising challenges in China — and noted that U.S.-based humanoid rival Figure recently raised $1 billion in a single round, at a $39 billion valuation. That's far more than what a Chinese robotics company can typically raise, he said. His strategy for growth? Do more with less. That means, for instance, developing a robotics AI model that uses less than 10% of the parameters required to train Alphabet's RT-2 AI model, as laid out in one of Guo's widely cited papers. Guo, who holds a Ph.D. from Purdue University, previously worked at Microsoft, smartphone maker Oppo and electric vehicle company Xpeng. It mirrors how DeepSeek and other Chinese players have slashed AI costs for users, and allowed them to claim AI development budgets far below OpenAI's estimated spending, which has exceeded $100 billion. That strategy is enough to make AI2 Robotics one of China's hottest investment targets. The Shenzhen-based startup hit a $1 billion valuation this fall, reaching unicorn status just over two years after launch — thanks to a whopping nine fundraising rounds so far this year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

A fraction of the money

The hot U.S. AI trade has shifted to Alphabet this week following rave reviews of its newest AI model — just weeks after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a rare tech position in the stock. Michael Burry, known for calling the U.S. housing crash before 2008, was the latest voice to warn of bubble risks in U.S. AI names that have powered recent market gains on Monday. But whatever's bubbling up in China's tech sector, it pales in comparison with the U.S. U.S. venture deals in AI and robotics have more than quadrupled since 2023 to exceed $160 billion so far this year, according to a CNBC analysis of PitchBook data. Comparable deals in China this year are just over $10 billion — only slightly more than the $9.24 billion recorded in 2023, the data showed. It's a confluence of regulatory pressures in China, U.S. export controls and a scrappy startup environment where locals have overcome stringent pandemic lockdowns to stay competitive. Global investors are increasingly interested. Bubble risks for Chinese AI firms appear far more contained than in the U.S., said Vincent Lu, partner and head of private equity at Australian asset manager Boman Group. The Melbourne-based firm oversees AU$910 million ($591.26 million), mostly allocated in Australia and North America, and has participated in funding rounds for U.S.-based Anthropic earlier this year and OpenAI last year. Lu was "so intrigued" by China's AI and robotics scene that he moved back to Shanghai from Melbourne last year to scout deals, and is just starting to get serious

BANGKOK -- Asian shares began the week mixed, with Tokyo’s benchmark falling nearly 2% on Monday after the release of data showing weak factory activity, while U.S. futures fell.

Oil prices surged more than $1 a barrel.

In Japan, the Nikkei 225 declined 1.9% to 49,285.66 after the government reported weaker than expected corporate investment data.

Regional reports on manufacturing activity are being closely watched for signs of how U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs are affecting Asian economies.

A survey of Japanese factory managers showed activity slowing in November. The S & P Global Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers index, or PMI, was at 48.7 last month, a slight improvement from 48.2 in October but still in contractionary territory on a scale of zero to 100 where 50 marks the cutoff for expansion. It was the fifth straight month of contraction.

“The latest PMI data showed that Japan’s manufacturing sector continued to struggle with weak demand conditions in November, with firms signaling another solid decline in overall new business,” Annabel Fiddes, economics associate director at S & P Global Market Intelligence, said in a report.

China’s factory activity contracted for the eighth straight month in November, according to an official survey released Sunday, underscoring challenges for the country’s economy despite an extension of the trade truce between the U.S. and China.

But Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.8% to 26,068.05,

Big online food delivery company Meituan's shares fell 1.5% after the company reported it fell to a net loss in the last quarter as intense competition in the delivery industry pushed prices lower, even as the company's revenues rose.

The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.4% to 3,904.90.

In Seoul, the Kospi was nearly unchanged at 3,926.20. Australia's S & P/ASX 200 declined 0.3% to 8,583.30.

Taiwan's Taiex lost 0.5% and the Sensex in India was up 0.3%.

Across Asia, PMI readings reflected weak factory activity for November, though exports from the region have been rebounding in recent months, Shivaan Tandon, Asia economist for Capital Economics, said in a commentary.

Consumer spending on the Black Friday and Cyber Monday retailing bonanza was expected to exceed expectations, despite uncertainty over the outlook for the U.S. economy.

Early Monday, the future for the S & P 500 was down nearly 0.7% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4%.

Trading was halted for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S & P 500 and Nasdaq for hours on Friday due to a technical issue at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The CME said the problem was tied to an outage at a CyrusOne data center.

During Friday’s abbreviated post Thanksgiving session, the S & P 500 rose 0.5% and the Dow gained 0.6%. The Nasdaq gained 0.7%.

Stocks rallied last week on hopes for another Federal Reserve rate cut after swooning in mid-November as investors fretted over the durability of the frenzy around artificial intelligence.

Nvidia lost 1.8% Friday, ending the month with a double-digit loss. Oracle fell 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%.

Some tech stocks did notch monthly gains, most notably Alphabet, which rose nearly 14%, due to excitement

[TITLE]US stocks fall to their first loss in 6 days as bitcoin tumbles:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks gave back some of last week’s rally, as bitcoin fell again on Monday.

The S&P 500 slipped 0.5% and broke a five-day winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427 points, or 0.9%, and the Nasdaq composite dipped 0.4%.

Last week’s rally was largely due to rising hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate next week to help shore up the slowing job market. Such hopes are still high, with traders betting on a roughly 85% chance the Fed will cut at its next meeting, according to data from CME Group.

But yields for longer-term Treasurys nevertheless rose in the bond market Monday. It was part of a worldwide climb for yields after the head of the Bank of Japan hinted at a possible hike to interest rates there.

When bonds are paying higher yields, they can attract investors who would otherwise buy stocks or cryptocurrencies. Higher yields undercut prices for all kinds of investments, particularly those seen as the most expensive.

Bitcoin, which was soaring around $125,000 in October, dropped toward $85,500. That’s down roughly 6% from a day earlier.

That in turn sent stocks lower across the crypto industry. Coinbase Global sank 4.8%, and Robinhood Markets fell 4.1%, for example.

Strategy, the company that used to be known as MicroStrategy and now raises money just to buy bitcoin, lost 3.3%. It said that it sold its stock and raised a fund of $1.44 billion in U.S. dollars, not in bitcoin, to help pay for its dividends on preferred shares and interest on its debt.

On the winning side of Wall Street was Synposys, which rose 4.9%. It said Nvidia is investing $2 billion in its stock as part of an expanded partnership. Nvidia, which has become Wall Street’s most influential stock, swung from an early loss to a gain of 1.6%.

The market, meanwhile, had a mixed reaction to what seems like a strong start for the holiday shopping season. Consumer spending during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday retailing bonanza was expected to exceed expectations, despite uncertainty over the outlook for the U.S. economy.

Williams-Sonoma climbed 1.3%, but Best Buy fell 2.6%.

All told, the S&P 500 fell 36.46 points to 6,812.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427.09 to 47,289.33, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 89.76 to 23,275.92.

In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Asia and Europe.

France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.3%, dragged down in part by a 5.8% loss for Airbus.

The European aerospace giant said Monday that most of its fleet of 6,000 A320 passenger jets have received an update after a weekend software glitch that could have affected flight controls. Travelers faced minor disruptions as airlines scrambled to push the software updates out after Airbus warned of the problem Friday.
