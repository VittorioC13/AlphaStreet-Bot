Company continued to execute on construction of pre-operating fleet, placing 20 assets into commercial operation, representing 64 MW of new solar generation capacity and 6 MWh of additional energy storage, year over year.

Company formally announces engagement of Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo to advise on strategic review focused on supporting positive outcomes for shareholders by potentially providing liquidity and long-term growth for the Company.

focused on supporting positive outcomes for shareholders by potentially providing liquidity and long-term growth for the Company. Greenbacker’s sustainable infrastructure assets contribute to more resilient and secure national energy system; since 2016, Company has generated 13.9 million MWh of energy,1 abated 9.3 million metric tons of carbon,2 conserved nearly 10 billion gallons of water,3 and supported thousands of energy-related jobs,4 while delivering power to communities and businesses across the U.S.

NEW YORK, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company, LLC (“Greenbacker” or the “Company”), an energy transition-focused investment manager and independent power producer (“IPP”), has announced financial results and operational updates for the third quarter of 2025.5

“Greenbacker’s performance this quarter underscores the strength of our core operating fleet and the resilience of our business model,” said Dan de Boer, CEO of Greenbacker. “Our teams not only drove revenue growth but also achieved critical milestones on flagship projects that will power communities for decades to come. These results reflect our commitment to accelerating the energy transition and creating long-term value for our shareholders.”

IPP generates total operating revenue of $52 million in the quarter, representing 3% year-over-year increase, driven by wind and solar PPA revenue of $41 million, as fleets produced 693,000 MWh of power.

Greenbacker generated total operating revenue of $52.2 million within its independent power producer (“IPP”) segment during the third quarter of 2025, as the Company’s wind and solar fleets produced approximately 693 million kWh of clean energy. This was driven by revenue from the long-term power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) in place across the Company’s wind and solar fleets, which generated a combined $40.7 million.

The $52.2 million revenue represents a year-over-year increase of 3%, or approximately $1.7 million of additional revenue in the quarter. This increase occurred despite a 2.3% year-over-year decrease in operating fleet capacity—as Greenbacker continued to advance its strategic focus on scaled clean energy projects via the sale of smaller non-core asset sales. The revenue increase reflects Greenbacker’s strategic timing around the sale of renewable energy credits (“RECs”) generated by its portfolio of renewable energy projects, as well as continued solid performance from the higher-impact assets across the Company’s core operating fleet.

Third-quarter net loss attributable to Greenbacker in 2025 was $(41.6) million, a favorable year-over-year change of 10%, driven by fewer impairment charges in the quarter compared with the prior year. Adjusted EBTIDA6 was $25.2 million, a year-over-year increase $23.2 million. This significant increase was largely the result of the termination and related non-recurring expenses associated with a module supply agreement incurred in 2024, as well as the Company’s ongoing cost reduction efforts, both of which contributed to the significant comparative increase on a year-over-year basis.

Operating Fleet 3Q25 3Q24 YoY Increase (total) YoY Increase (%) Clean power produced by solar assets (MWh) 464,590 471,684 (7,094) (1.5)% PPA revenue generated by solar assets ($M) $ 28.3 $ 28.7 $ (0.3) (1.2)% Clean power produced by wind assets (MWh) 228,003 241,533 (13,530) (5.6)% PPA revenue generated by wind assets ($M) $ 12.4 $ 12.7 $ (0.3) (2.6)% Total clean power generated by wind and solar assets (MWh) 692,511 713,217 (20,706) (2.9)% Total PPA operating revenue generated by wind and solar assets ($M) $ 40.7 $ 41.4 $ (0.7) (1.6)%

Some figures may not add to stated totals due to rounding. Total clean power generated does not include assets in which the Company holds a preferred equity position.

Greenbacker continues to advance review of strategic alternatives designed to support positive outcomes for shareholders and long-term growth for the Company.

As announced earlier this year, the Greenbacker Board of Directors (“Board”) is actively reviewing a full range of operational and financial alternatives aimed at aligning with shareholder interests—including potential liquidity options—and positioning the Company for sustained growth.

To assist with this review, Greenbacker has retained Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo as financial advisors. The strategic review remains ongoing, and the Board is committed to a disciplined, rigorous process focused on creating long-term value for shareholders.

Lori and Rick Findlay like to be climate-conscious, which prompted them to take a closer look at their investments. (Submitted by Rick and Lori Findlay)

Lori Findlay, a retired school principal living in Toronto, said she and her husband, Rick, try to make decisions in their daily lives that "will have the least negative impact on others and on our planet."

From fixing rather than replacing broken items to taking public transit and limiting air travel, the 68-year-old couple likes to be climate-conscious. Rick, who is semi-retired and works in clean technology ventures, took a closer look at how they had invested their savings.

"I found sort of down deep in these funds, a lot of fossil fuel and I just said, 'OK, that's it. We have to make a change,'" he said.

[TITLE]PIND & Ford Foundation Boost Host Community Development:
[TEXT]
The Foundation for Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta and the Ford Foundation have concluded the Bridges Project with a high-level stakeholders’ dialogue aimed at strengthening the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act’s Host Community Development Trusts in the oil-producing region.

In a statement, the two organisations closed the project at a two-day forum titled ‘Four Years of the PIA: Lessons, Gains, and the Path Forward for Host Community Development Trusts (HCDTs)’, which brought together more than 150 participants from government agencies, settlers, regulators, community leaders and development partners.

They said the Bridges Project, launched in 2023, provided a platform that improved dialogue among regulators, settlers and host communities. The project also promoted transparency and trust in implementing the Host Community Development Trust framework, which the PIA created to ensure that host communities “benefit directly from extractive activities”.

Executive Director of PIND Foundation, Sam Daibo, said the forum marked an important step in consolidating lessons learnt from the Bridges Project.

Daibo said, “The Bridges Project has demonstrated that the success of the PIA, and especially the HCDT model, relies not only on compliance but also on collaboration, trust, and shared accountability.

“The lessons learnt from this process offer a roadmap for the future, guiding how we strengthen partnerships, deepen community involvement, and maintain the progress of host community development.”

Organisers said the meeting featured the presentation of the Bridges Project Status Report, which outlined improvements in awareness of PIA provisions, stronger stakeholder collaboration and the development of models that support participatory governance across host communities.

Delivering the keynote on behalf of the Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Gbenga Komolafe, the NUPRC’s Manager of Host Community Development Administration, Omolade Awah, commended the partners for promoting engagement that enhances transparency in the sector.

Awah said the Host Community Development Trust “is already producing tangible results across the Niger Delta, from infrastructure and human capital projects to increased community trust and stability.”

Awah added that the Commission remained committed to ensuring that the HCDT continued to serve as “a credible mechanism for sustainable development, peacebuilding, and shared prosperity in host communities”.

Also speaking, Honourable Commissioner, Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning, Akwa Ibom State, Dr Linus Nkan, said, “The success of the HCDT implementation depends on shared accountability, trust, and continuous learning,” and recommended that its adoption “should also be extended to government houses of all the Niger Delta states.”

With the Bridges Project coming to a close, PIND and the Ford Foundation reaffirmed their commitment to sustaining the Multi-Stakeholder Platform, supporting capacity building for HCDTs and promoting a Niger Delta where peace and prosperity are “community-driven and sustainable.”

[TITLE]Putin questions US punishing India for buying Russian oil:
[TEXT]
"US BUYS NUCLEAR FUEL FROM RUSSIA"

New Delhi and Moscow have strong ties going back to the days of the former Soviet Union, and Russia has been the main source of arms for India for decades. India has also emerged as the top buyer of seaborne Russian oil despite Western sanctions imposed after Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

India's crude imports, however, are set to hit a three-year low this month following a punitive US tariff on Indian goods and a tightening of sanctions on Russia, as US President Donald Trump's administration says India's purchases of cheap Russian oil help finance Moscow's war in Ukraine.

"The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants. That is also fuel," Putin told India Today.

"If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege? This question deserves thorough examination, and we stand ready to discuss it, including with President Trump," he said.

India has said Trump's tariffs are unjustified and unreasonable and pointed at ongoing US trade with Moscow. The US and European Union continue to import billions of dollars worth of Russian energy and commodities, ranging from liquefied natural gas to enriched uranium.

European automaker shares rose sharply on Thursday after President Donald Trump moved to roll back U.S. fuel economy limits established under Joe Biden, according to Reuters. The administration framed the proposal as a way to lower consumer costs by making it easier for companies to sell gasoline-powered vehicles.

By mid-morning, Porsche shares were up more than 5%, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo Car gained nearly 4%, Renault rose 3.3%, and Stellantis climbed around 2.7% after an 8% rally the previous day.

Speaking from the Oval Office alongside industry executives and lawmakers, Trump announced the reversal of the Biden-era rules, saying, “We’re officially terminating Joe Biden’s ridiculously burdensome, horrible, actually, CAFE standards that impose expensive restrictions and all sorts of problems — gave all sorts of problems to automakers.

[TITLE]Europe strikes a deal to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027:
[TEXT]
Brussels Reuters —

The European Union agreed Wednesday to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decade-long dependency on Russian energy.

Representatives for EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement in the early hours of Wednesday on proposals set out by the European Commission in June to end shipments from the EU’s former top gas supplier following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move toward a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.

“Today, we are stopping these imports permanently,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement. “By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

For short-term contracts concluded before June 17 this year, the prohibition will apply from April 25, 2026, for LNG and from June 17, 2026, for pipeline gas.

For long-term contracts concluded before June 17, the cut-off dates will be the start of 2027 and the start of October 2026, with a possible one-month extension for EU members facing difficulties reaching required storage levels.

As of October, Russia accounted for 12% of EU gas imports, down from 45% before its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Hungary, France and Belgium among the countries still receiving supplies.

The European Commission is also committed to phasing out remaining oil imports from Russia by the end of 2027, with a legislative proposal to be presented early next year.

Under Wednesday’s agreement, EU members will submit “national diversification plans” regarding oil and gas supplies to the commission by March 1, and will be required to notify the EU executive whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national bans in place.

The commission will issue recommendations based on this feedback.

[TITLE]The AI power crunch: Grid realities collide with tech ambition – NaturalNews.com:
[TEXT]
The AI power crunch: Grid realities collide with tech ambition

Surging electricity demand from AI data centers is colliding with a strained U.S. power grid, risking reliability.

The nation’s nuclear energy ambitions face severe fuel supply chain vulnerabilities, including dependence on Russian uranium.

Utilities struggle to forecast real AI power demand as tech companies shop large projects to multiple regions.

Supply chain bottlenecks for critical minerals and electrical equipment threaten all new power generation projects.

Policymakers and industry lack a coherent, long-term strategy to meet unprecedented energy needs while ensuring affordability and security.

The United States is barreling toward an unprecedented energy crisis, driven not by OPEC but by the insatiable power demands of artificial intelligence. As tech giants race to build sprawling data center complexes, their staggering electricity needs are exposing critical vulnerabilities in America’s aging power infrastructure, fragile supply chains and long-term energy strategy. The collision between rapid technological ambition and the slow realities of energy production threatens grid reliability, national security and economic stability.

The scale of the demand shock

The artificial intelligence revolution requires computational power on a scale that is rewriting forecasts for U.S. electricity consumption. Data centers, once modest power users, now routinely require hundreds of megawatts, with single projects like the planned "Stargate" facility aiming for multiple gigawatts—equivalent to the power needs of a major city. Consulting firm Grid Strategies estimates an additional 120 gigawatts of demand by 2030, with half coming from data centers alone. This surge represents the most significant spike in U.S. power demand since the era of widespread electrification, occurring after decades of relatively flat growth. The grid, already stressed by the retirement of traditional power plants and the integration of intermittent renewables, is unprepared for this sudden, massive load.

Nuclear’s promise hamstrung by supply chain peril

In response, policymakers and industry are looking to nuclear power, a reliable, zero-emissions baseload source. The Trump administration has issued executive orders to spur a nuclear revival, and companies like Meta and Microsoft are signing long-term power purchase agreements with existing nuclear plants. However, a national build-out faces a daunting obstacle: the fuel supply chain. The U.S. commercial nuclear fleet has been dependent on Russian-enriched uranium for the past decade, a critical national security vulnerability. Efforts to restart domestic enrichment, such as at the Piketon, Ohio facility, are in nascent stages and wildly insufficient for projected needs. Building the new large-scale or advanced micro-reactors needed to meet AI demand would require thousands of metric tons of specialized fuel, a manufacturing and industrial capacity that simply does not exist today.

The forecasting fog and infrastructure bottlenecks

This uncertainty is compounded by a fog of forecasting. Utilities report that AI companies are shopping identical multi-gigawatt projects to different regional grids simultaneously, making it nearly impossible to distinguish real, imminent demand from speculative proposals. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman David Rosner has warned that misjudging load forecasts by even a few percentage points can impact billions in investment and consumer bills. Meanwhile, the physical build-out faces severe bottlenecks. The supply chain for critical electrical equipment like transformers is constrained, and new natural gas turbines are sold out for years. While renewable energy can be deployed faster, policy uncertainty and interconnection queue delays persist. The result is a looming gap between AI’s power needs and the nation’s ability to generate and deliver electrons.

A strategic imperative beyond the bubble
