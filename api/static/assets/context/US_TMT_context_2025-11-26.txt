[TEXT]
Onsemi aims to complete the new SiC chip plant by 2027. Credit: IM Imagery/Shutterstock.com.

The European Commission (EC) has approved a €450m ($518m) subsidy from the Czech government for onsemi to establish a new silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor fabrication facility in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Czechia.

The funding forms part of the US-based chip manufacturer’s planned €1.64bn investment and is expected to enable the completion of the plant by 2027.

Upon completion, the Rožnov pod Radhoštěm plant is expected to become the first integrated SiC device manufacturing site of its kind in the European Union (EU).

The facility will handle all stages of SiC device production, from crystal growth to finished semiconductors.

In June 2024, onsemi confirmed plans for a multi-year brownfield investment in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm.

The company’s existing local operations include silicon crystal growth and wafer manufacturing. The new facility will build on this foundation with vertically integrated SiC production capabilities.

[TITLE]AMD to allegedly raise graphics card prices by at least 10% in 2026 — price surge attributed to ongoing AI-related DRAM supply crisis:
[TEXT]
After weeks of hints and speculation, it's now (almost) official: AMD has told its supply partners that it will raise graphics cards prices by at least 10% in the new-year due to rising memory prices, as per analyst Dan Nystedt (via UDN). This is reportedly the second time AMD has raised its prices in recent months, though the first was kept internal and just ate into AMD's margins. This time though, it's passing it on to the partners, who will in turn pass it on to consumers.

AMD has notified supply chain partners it will raise graphics card prices 10% across the entire product line due to rising memory chip prices, media report. It will reportedly be AMD’s 2nd such price increase. $AMD $NVDA #Semiconductors https://t.co/pi2hsmmhCANovember 24, 2025

The subject of graphics card pricing has been a contentious one for a number of years now. Prices and power draw have risen generation upon generation, and cryptocurrency-induced shortages have occasionally spiked demand and the cost of a new GPU in turn. 2025 started with something similar, though that seemed to be more down to deliberately constrained supply — or perhaps a shift of Nvidia and AMD's focus to AI.

That's only become more apparent throughout the year, and as data centers the world over ate up GPUs, CPUs, memory, storage, and anything else they could get their hands on (including entire power plants), prices for most components have risen in turn. None quite so much as memory, though, which has jumped close to 200% per stick in recent months, and that shortage is now making its way into other industries: most notably, graphics cards.

PowerColor recently warned that GPU price rises were coming, and AMD seems to have now confirmed it to its suppliers and board partners. In the translated text, UDN's sources claim it'll be by at least 10%, suggesting that could be the floor of AMD's potential price rises. However, Mr Nystedt suggests that 10% is the figure, so we'll have to wait and see how it shakes out or for an official announcement from AMD, to know for sure.

This is unfortunate timing for AMD which has struggled to get the price of its flagship RX 9070 XT even close to its recommended retail price throughout the year. It just managed it this week, hitting $599 for the first-time since release as part of Black Friday. But that seems likely to be incredibly short-lived. Not least because that's a decent deal for a great graphics card.

AMD is unlikely to be alone in its GPU prices rises either. Nvidia is expected to have delayed the launch of an RTX 50 Super series of graphics cards because of memory shortages, and unlikely to lose profit on its graphics cards when selling to gamers since it makes so much selling them to data center developers.

If you're keen to get ahead of the price rises and want to buy a graphics card before the end of the year, here's our list of the best graphics cards out there right now. Better yet, check out our Black Friday deals page to see if there's something you can snap up before anyone else.

[TITLE]Investors fearful of AI bubble burst are missing out: Strategist:
[TEXT]
00:00 Speaker A

In terms of risks, though, all right, history suggests positive milestones.

00:02 Speaker B

Yes.

00:02 Speaker A

What would be on Kevin's wall of worry there?

00:05 Speaker B

I think there's multiple walls of worry. And I don't subscribe to the AI bubble is about to burst camp. In fact, I think those investors who are fearful of an imminent bursting of the AI bubble, that fear is either misplaced, premature, or potentially even both. And if you're waiting for that bubble to burst, you're likely to miss out on the most significant returns that the AI revolution may have to offer.

00:27 Speaker B

But the risks to me are, what does the Federal Reserve do or not do with respect to interest rates? Ultimately, what happens with US China trade policy, and of course, valuations. Valuations remain stretched right now, and the money keeps going into the areas of the market that are the most stretched in terms of valuations.

00:46 Speaker B

So I look beyond that. I look to areas like industrials, utilities, maybe some communication services name as well, because they're all part of the AI revolution and they're not as stretched in some places in terms of valuations as some of the semiconductors and chip plays.

01:00 Speaker A

On AI, Kevin, I know you you're in the camp that says, okay, this looks to you like early innings. Yes. I know other strategists say to, you know, forget early innings, we're still we're not even at the plate yet.

01:06 Speaker B

Batting practice, that's me.

01:07 Speaker A

Okay, let me ask you though, what to that point though, my friend, what are as an investor, what are the signals that you looked at that tell you this is early, not peaking.

01:21 Speaker B

Sure. So, what I look to is Jensen Huang. The godfather of AI, the CEO of Nvidia. What he told us is that he believes there'll be somewhere between three to four trillion dollars with the T spent on AI infrastructure investment by the end of this decade.

01:34 Speaker B

So, if we're at about 700 billion right now, to get to 3 to 4 trillion in the next four years, that's a lot of spending that's coming down the road. And where's that spending going to go? In the batting practice, the infrastructure builder, the data centers, the power solutions, the cooling solutions.

01:45 Speaker B

Not necessarily the AI algorithms and the hardware and the software plays, that's going to come when we start playing the games. And that ROI, Josh, won't be reached for years to come.

01:54 Speaker B

So investors are going to have to be patient on that front and try to identify more winners than losers and building a diversified portfolio. But for now, the infrastructure play continues.

India and Israel have revived negotiations for a long-pending Free Trade Agreement (FTA), nearly a decade after the last formal talks stalled, with experts saying the emphasis should be on strategic collaboration rather than merchandise trade.The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) on Monday said that India–Israel trade remains modest, and the renewed push should focus on areas such as defence manufacturing, electronics, semiconductors, water and irrigation technology, precision agriculture, cybersecurity, and frontier R&D.“For both countries, therefore, the value of the renewed FTA effort lies less in merchandise trade and more in strategic cooperation -- in defence manufacturing, electronics, semiconductors, water and irrigation technology, precision agriculture, cybersecurity, and frontier R&D,” GTRI Founder Ajay Srivastava said.India and Israel first opened FTA talks in 2010 and held several rounds of discussions through 2012–13. However, the negotiations stalled after 2014 amid disagreements over tariffs, standards, and access for sensitive products.Following a series of high-level exchanges in 2024–25, the two governments have now finalised new Terms of Reference to relaunch negotiations. Last week, they formally inked these terms, signaling the restart of talks.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, after his visit to Israel from November 20–22, indicated that the FTA discussions may follow a two-phase approach: an initial package focused on tariff reductions for goods, followed by a broader agreement covering investment, technology transfer, defence, space, agri-tech, cybersecurity, AI, fintech, R&D, innovation, and drip-irrigation systems.Bilateral merchandise trade between India and Israel remains relatively small at $3.6 billion in FY2025.India’s exports to Israel totaled $2.1 billion, dominated by cut and polished diamonds ($555 million), rice ($102 million), organic chemicals ($96 million), ceramic tiles ($81 million), and aircraft parts ($54 million).Imports from Israel reached $1.5 billion, led by diamonds ($333 million), electronics ($350 million) -- including integrated circuits ($117 million) and electronic components ($66 million) -- as well as fertilisers ($135 million), insecticides ($63 million), and machinery ($91 million).GTRI noted that even with an FTA, Indian exports may struggle to expand significantly. Israel, a high-income, technology-driven market of under 10 million people, has limited demand for Indian mass-market products such as textiles, automobiles, and general engineering goods.In sectors where India is competitive -- agriculture, generics, steel, chemicals -- Israel is either self-sufficient, tightly regulated through quality and phytosanitary norms, or already extends tariff preferences to partners such as the EU and the US.This keeps Indian products at a structural disadvantage.“As a result, commerce remains concentrated in a few niche categories such as diamonds, rice, and ceramic tiles,” the GTRI brief said.The think tank stressed that the real value of the FTA lies in strategic collaboration. Beyond goods trade, the two countries are expected to deepen cooperation in defence manufacturing, electronics, semiconductors, water and irrigation technologies, precision agriculture, cybersecurity, and frontier R&D -- sectors where both nations have complementary strengths.With the renewed push, India–Israel economic ties are entering a phase where the focus is likely to shift from modest merchandise trade to broader strategic and technological collaboration, setting the stage for a more future-oriented partnership.

[TITLE]Denmark Data Center Colocation Supply & Demand Analysis Report 2025: Market to Grow at a CAGR of 34.57% During 2024-2030, Driven by AI Adoption, Cloud Growth, and Sustainability Push:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Denmark Data Center Colocation Market - Supply & Demand Analysis 2025-2030" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Denmark data center colocation market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 34.57% from 2024 to 2030

The report covers retail colocation pricing (with add-ons) and wholesale colocation pricing with trend analysis, alongside an assessment of the latest market trends, potential opportunities, growth restraints, and overall prospects for Denmark’s colocation data center industry. It also outlines the competitive landscape, including market share analysis of colocation operators based on IT power capacity and revenue.

Denmark is one of the growing colocation data center markets in the Nordics region. The average occupancy rate of data center facilities is expected to reach around 90%, indicating that the vacancies will be only around 10% by 2030.

The Danish data center market is driven by several growth factors, including the surge in AI adoption, increasing cloud services, rising government support for data centers, rapid digitization, sustainability initiatives in data centers, increasing submarine cables development, and the adoption of advanced technologies such as 5G, big data, and IoT. However, the country also faces some challenges, such as Power constraints, high construction costs, and high power costs.

Some of the leading colocation data center operators in the market include Digital Realty, GlobalConnect, Cibicom, Aeven (NNIT), Bulk Infrastructure, STACK Infrastructure, and Others.

In Denmark, demand for retail colocation is expected to decline, while demand for wholesale colocation is projected to grow over the forecast period. This shift is driven by companies across various industries - such as finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and telecommunications - rapidly migrating their operations to cloud platforms to enhance scalability, data accessibility, and operational efficiency.

The Danish government takes initiatives to support digitalization across the country. For instance, in February 2024, the Danish government announced its plans to establish a new digitalization strategy for 2024-2027 in Denmark, focusing on the development of artificial intelligence, digital education, digital skills enhancement, the green transition, and the digital transformation of SMEs in Denmark.
