[TEXT]
Transcript

[00:00:00] Sara Green: The gut reaction for many hotels. Is just to slash prices. We know the phrase ‘heads and beds’, and it’s simple. We want people in our rooms no matter the cost. Yes. It is a short term burst in occupancy, but it comes with some serious long term consequences if he values your brand.

[00:00:22] Karen Stephens (Intro): Welcome to the Hotel Moment podcast presented by Revinate, the podcast where we discuss how hotel technology shapes every moment of the hotelier’s experience. Tune in for our guest episodes where we explore the cutting edge technology transforming the hospitality industry and hear from experts and visionaries shaping the future of guest experiences. Alongside our conversations with guests, we have episodes for you hosted by Revinator, Brenna Turpin, on resources available to you all. These resource packed episodes have granular advice on overcoming industry and operational challenges so you can emerge as a hotel superhero. Whether you’re a hotelier or a tech enthusiast, you’re in the right place. Let’s dive in and discover how we can elevate hospitality together.

[00:01:08] Brenna Turpin: As a hotelier, you have three major holidays to pay attention to before Christmas and New Year’s. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and now the increasingly popular Travel Tuesday. To give you an idea of how important it is to plan campaigns for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, last year, the Hotel Network gathered global data to find that hotel website campaigns for these holidays increased direct bookings by 64%. 64%. That’s significant. And we’re sure you have campaigns lined up to capture direct bookings via your brand website, but if you include the email and the voice channel as part of your campaigns, you’re going to have more opportunities to reach your guests, collect their data, and personalized offers for them to boost and sell your revenue. And on a global scale, travel Tuesday is taking place on December 2nd and is starting to become one of the most anticipated holidays in hospitality. Hotel bookings on that day were up 28% compared to a two week window before and after the holiday last year. And this year, guests are likely to keep their eyes out for the best of the best deals, especially since inflation is still breathing down their necks in The US and other parts of the world. Pay attention to your mobile channels, mobile bookings, and offer mobile only perks to capture guests’ search for convenience. And don’t be afraid to slot in offers for your loyalty program as this can be a prime time for members to rack up rewards. We’re still months away from these holidays, but the time is now if you wanna prepare like an expert. The webinar we’re featuring today from our Hotel Moment Deep Drive series covers the latest industry trends and how to adapt your offers for maximum appeal, how to capitalize on peak season demand by leveraging Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Travel Tuesday to fill your booking pipeline well into the new year. We’ll also show you how to implement proven revenue driving campaigns from top performing hotels that use segmentation to maximize conversions.

[TITLE]Budapest Central European Fashion Week Showcased Designers on a Global Scale:
[TEXT]
From Sept. 1-7, Budapest Central European Fashion Week (BCEFW) showcased its biggest event to date — now in its 16th edition. Bringing together more than 70 designers from Hungary and 30 from the Central European region of Slovakia, Serbia, Slovenia, Romania, Ukraine and the Czech Republic to showcase their spring 2026 collections, the event was a combination of both emerging designers and established brands.

Hosted by the Hungarian Fashion & Design Agency, the runway shows celebrated innovative designs, craftsmanship and a modern fusion of fashion with the arts. BCEFW has continued to be a regional hub in Hungary to foster talent, sustainability and collaboration on an international scale — while simultaneously spotlighting Central Europe’s impact on business and fashion.

“The BCEFW spring 2026 show was truly a milestone for us,” said Zsófia Jakab, chief executive officer of Hungarian Fashion & Design Agency and Ministerial Commissioner for Creative Industry Development and Sectoral Coordination. “We managed to create a professional platform that showcased Hungarian and regional fashion in its widest scope to date. Almost 100 designers presented their spring 2026 collections on the runway — an exceptional number in the Central European context. Beyond Hungary, six regional countries were also represented, which underlines the event’s regional relevance.”

Experts in attendance included editors and photographers from the world’s leading fashion and lifestyle magazines, buyers and more from Japan and Italy and the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode and Tranoï institutions. The event hosted a record 7,000 visitors to its shows and presentations — with more than 50 adjacent events in Budapest.

Graduates from the Budapest Metropolitan University also presented their collections at the Hungarian National Museum, while Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design students showcased their forward-thinking work on campus.

Jakab said that these institutional presentations mark a milestone for the event’s program for both the students and the larger fashion industry, as the events promoted multidisciplinary collaboration and emphasized stronger ties between the schools and professional spaces.

The initiative will also help with the long-term growth of creative industries across Central Europe. Notably, fashion has become one of the top growth sectors for the Hungarian economy. In 2024, there were more than 7,400 SMEs within the textile, apparel, leather and leather goods manufacturing industries — 80 percent of its revenue came from exports.

Therefore, Jakab said that supporting the creative industry is of utmost importance and is an investment into Hungarian jobs, exports and the country’s overall image. This year, the event welcomed Dora Fung, editor in chief of 10 Magazine USA, as part of its BCEFW International Advisory Board to help strengthen its international visibility.

“Our key goal is to provide an increasingly broad and colorful picture of the region’s fashion world season after season. In doing so, we attract focused international attention to Hungarian actors, contributing to their stronger visibility, expansion of business relations and increased sales. All of this not only amplified the visibility of the collections globally but also spotlighted Budapest’s cultural heritage and its vibrant creative scene. We aim to establish Central Europe’s leading creative hub, linking East and West and connecting to the world’s fashion capitals.”

[TITLE]Carter’s adopts poison pill after hedge fund amasses nearly 17% of shares:
[TEXT]
Listen to the article 2 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Carter’s, Inc.’s board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill, following an investment firm’s “rapid accumulation of a significant amount” of its common stock, the children’s wear retailer said in financial filings Wednesday.

Hedge fund Roseman Wagner Wealth Management earlier this month disclosed it had acquired nearly 17% of the company’s shares, making it the retailer’s top shareholder.

“Carter’s was given no advance notice of the stock accumulation by RWWM, and there has been no communication from RWWM, despite attempts by Carter’s management to contact RWWM,” Carter’s said in its filing. “It is possible that RWWM is continuing to accumulate stock.” RWWM did not reply to Retail Dive’s requests for comment.

The firm’s move prompted the new policy, which will expire in

[TITLE]The Nutriment Company stalks twin pet-food deals in sales growth quest – CEO Anders Kristiansen talks M&A, strategy:
[TEXT]
The Nutriment Company CEO Anders Kristiansen: Credit: TNC

Pet-food group The Nutriment Company has been acquisitive in recent years under CEO Anders Kristiansen, supported by backing from Nordic private-equity firm Axcel – and a couple more deals are on the cards to round out 2025.

Sweden-based The Nutriment Company was founded in 2014 as Voff Premium Pet Food but rebranded last year to what is now commonly known as TNC.

Specialising in fresh pet food for dogs and cats, with a smaller presence in pet treats and supplements targeted at the European market, Kristiansen chats with Just Food’s Simon Harvey to discuss what the future holds.

Simon Harvey (SH): You guys have been going crazy with acquisitions.

Anders Kristiansen (AK): We’re not going crazy but we have a solid plan. I came to the business two and a half years ago. Back then, we had bought an average of one business a year and I thought we should try and accelerate that but you can’t accelerate before you have a team.

We started putting an infrastructure in place with a bigger M&A team but it’s not enough just to have a bigger M&A team, you also have to have a team that can integrate the businesses. We have invested time, money and energy in building that infrastructure. Now we have the infrastructure, we can progress super quickly.

We have bought seven companies this year and we will announce one in the beginning of October, which is a sizable one in a new market for us.
