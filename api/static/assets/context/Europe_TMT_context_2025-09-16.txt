The $1.6 billion investment is from companies including PayPal, Bank of America and Citigroup and will create 1,800 jobs in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the U.K. Department for Business and Trade said Saturday (Sept. 13).

“Strengthening ties with the U.S. boosts our economy, creates jobs, and secures our role in global finance, delivering on our Plan for Change,” said Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle. “These investments reflect the strength of our enduring ‘golden corridor’ with one of our closest trading partners, ahead of the U.S. presidential state visit.”

That visit is set to happen Tuesday (Sept. 16), with President Donald Trump due to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to sign a multibillion-dollar technology agreement.

As Reuters reported, that agreement will center on technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, telecommunications and quantum computing.

“Cutting-edge technology such as AI and quantum computing will transform our lives,” U.K. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said in a statement.

The Reuters report noted that Trump is expected to be joined during his three-day visit by U.S. tech executives such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI head Sam Altman.

Both countries have this year put forth AI action plans, Reuters added, with companies like OpenAI and Anthropic opening international offices in London, and U.K.-based firms like DeepMind investing in trans-Atlantic partnerships.

Mumbai: The global automobile industry is starting to regain confidence after pausing product and investment decisions initially due to the upheaval caused by Trump's tariffs , said a senior executive at Tata Technologies The Tata Group engineering firm is also pressing ahead with expansion, acquiring Germany's ESTEC for ₹75 million (₹750 crore) to strengthen its software-defined vehicle capabilities and also establish a base in Europe's auto hub."Tariffs initially prompted many of our customers to revisit product plans. Over the past few months, however, we're seeing decisions start to flow again as the market comes to terms with the new normal," Warren Harris , CEO & MD, told ET.While geopolitical volatility-particularly US-Russia tensions-remains a distraction, customers are increasingly committing to long-term product investments, according to Harris. The US and Mexico together account for about 21% of Tata Technologies' total revenue, with the US accounting for nearly the entire tally.ESTEC's 300-strong team brings advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and comfort electronics expertise, complementing Tata Tech's strengths in infotainment and e-powertrains. "They operate at the top end of the software and embedded electronics V-curve-systems architecture, requirements definition, test and validation," said Harris.The acquisition also expands Tata Tech's European strategy. The company's joint venture with BMW , inked last year, currently has 1,200 engineers in India, giving it direct access to a marquee OEM. The deal is also attractive from a financial standpoint, said Harris. ESTEC has consistently delivered margins that exceed Tata Tech's, and the acquisition is expected to be accretive to both profitability and earnings per share from the first day, he added.The company sees the deal as a growth play without any headcount rationalisation and plans to expand teams in Germany, Morocco, and India. While ruling out opportunistic M&As, Harris said Tata Tech will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions aligned with its software-defined vehicle ambitions. "We've been thoughtful and patient with ESTEC, ensuring cultural alignment. That will remain our approach with any future targets," he said.On the domestic front, Harris expects GST 2.0 measures to support demand, particularly in the electric vehicle space. "Customers like Tata Motors will benefit in the short term, and we expect to intersect with that demand," he said.The company sees the deal as a growth play without any headcount rationalisation and plans to expand teams in Germany, Morocco, and India

[TITLE]Are tariffs actually working for Donald Trump and the US?:
[TEXT]
President Trump's confrontational approach to tariffs has dominated the transatlantic relationship since he returned to the White House in January.

Following months of negotiations between EU and US officials, an agreement in principle was reached on 27 July in Scotland, with a follow-up "framework agreement" announced on 21 August.

A costly trade war was averted, but it still left a baseline 15% tariff on most European exports to the United States.

Many issues remain unresolved and much is shrouded in uncertainty, not least since Donald Trump has a history of breaking trade agreements that he has signed.

So are tariffs actually working for the US president, or has the flurry of horse-trading that followed meant things have more or less stayed the same for industries in European countries?

To start with, EU officials insist negotiators will be working hard to get as many exemptions as possible from the 15% rate, and to get more products down to the zero-for-zero rate, which was Brussels’ original ambition.

Despite that, there’s been a heated debate on whether the EU should have taken a more confrontational approach to the negotiations.

Critics have accused Brussels of failing to stand up to President Trump and failing to use more powerful tools to threaten the US services and tech presence.

EU officials argue that this would have caused a costly trade war, pitting one member state against another, and could have prompted Mr Trump to pull support for Ukraine in retaliation.

The European Commission continues to argue that the framework agreement provides exporters with "short-term stability".

How have Irish companies been preparing for the new regime?

The US is Ireland’s main export market, with goods valuing €72.6 billion being shipped there in 2024.

Most of those goods were subject to a low or zero tariff rate, meaning that Irish companies had minimal customs or compliance problems when exporting.

New York: BlackRock Inc . plans to invest up to £500 million ($678 million) in Britain's data center market, a move unveiled as Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink prepares to join US President Donald Trump on his state visit to the UK.The asset manager has acquired a site in west London to seed a new venture with operator Gravity Edge, according to a statement. The partnership, called Digital Gravity Partners, will focus on buying existing data centers with underused capacity, said Thomas Mueller-Borja, BlackRock's global co-head of real estate. Global investors are racing into data centers, betting that the rise of artificial intelligence will fuel soaring demand for infrastructure to power it. That has pushed alternative asset managers to chase mega-projects designed for hyperscalers such as Amazon.com Inc.'s AWS, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.But Britain faces headwinds: some of the highest electricity costs in Europe and a power grid already strained by demand."We are trying to find existing assets that are underutilized but have power," Mueller-Borja said. "We aren't doing ground-up development for hyperscalers."BlackRock's initial investment of more than £100 million will come from its ₹1.2 billion Europe Property Fund VI, which closed in July. Targeting smaller facilities serving enterprise clients will broaden the pool of potential buyers for upgraded properties, contrasting with hyperscale projects that require billions in capital spending.

[TITLE]After suicides, calls for stricter rules on how chatbots interact with children and teens:
[TEXT]
A growing number of young people have found themselves a new friend. One that isn’t a classmate, a sibling, or even a therapist, but a human-like, always supportive AI chatbot. But if that friend begins to mirror some user’s darkest thoughts, the results can be devastating.

In the case of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old from Orange County, his relationship with AI-powered ChatGPT ended in tragedy. His parents are suing the company behind the chatbot, OpenAI, over his death, alleging that bot became his “closest confidant,” one that validated his “most harmful and self-destructive thoughts,” and ultimately encouraged him to take his own life.

It’s not the first case to put the blame for a minor’s death on an AI company. Character.AI, which hosts bots, including ones that mimic public figures or fictional characters, is facing a similar legal claim from parents who allege a chatbot hosted on the company’s platform actively encouraged a 14-year-old-boy to take his own life after months of inappropriate, sexually explicit, messages.

When reached for comment, OpenAI directed Fortune to two blog posts on the matter. The posts outlined some of the steps OpenAI is taking to improve ChatGPT’s safety, including routing sensitive conversations to reasoning models, partnering with experts to develop further protections, and rolling out parental controls within the next month. OpenAI also said it was working on strengthening ChatGPT’s ability to recognize and respond to mental health crises by adding layered safeguards, referring users to real-world resources, and enabling easier access to emergency services and trusted contacts.

Character.ai said the company does not comment on pending litigation but that they has rolled out more safety features over the past year, “including an entirely new under-18 experience and a Parental Insights feature. A spokesperson said: “We already partner with external safety experts on this work, and we aim to establish more and deeper partnerships going forward.

“The user-created Characters on our site are intended for entertainment. People use our platform for creative fan fiction and fictional roleplay. And we have prominent disclaimers in every chat to remind users that a Character is not a real person and that everything a Character says should be treated as fiction.”

But lawyers and civil society groups that advocate for better accountability and oversight of technology companies say the companies should not be left to police themselves when it comes to ensuring their products are safe, particularly for vulnerable children and teens.

“Unleashing chatbots on minors is an inherently dangerous thing,” Meetali Jain, the Director of the Tech Justice Law Project and a lawyer involved in both cases, told Fortune. “It’s like social media on steroids.”

“I’ve never seen anything quite like this moment in terms of people stepping forward and claiming that they’ve been harmed…this technology is that much more powerful and very personalized,” she said.

Lawmakers are starting to take notice, and AI companies are promising changes to protect children from engaging in harmful conversations. But, at a time when loneliness among young people is at an all-time high, the popularity of chatbots may leave young people uniquely exposed to manipulation, harmful content, and hyper-personalized conversations that reinforce dangerous thoughts.

AI and Companionship

Intended or not, one of the most common uses for AI chatbots has become companionship. Some of the most active users of AI are now turning to the bots for things like life advice, therapy, and human intimacy.

While most leading AI companies tout their AI products as productivity or search tools, an April survey of 6,000 regular AI users from the Harvard Business Review found that “companionship and therapy” was the most common use case. Such usage among teens is even more prolific.

A recent study by the U.S. nonprofit Common Sense Media, revealed that a large majority of American teens (72%) have experimented with an AI companion at least once. More than half saying they use the tech regularly in this way.

“I am very concerned that developing minds may be more susceptible to [harms], both because they may be less able to understand the reality, the context, or the limitations [of AI chatbots], and because culturally, younger folks tend to be just more chronically online,” Karthik Sarma a health AI scientist and psychiatrist at University of California, UCSF, said.

“We also have the extra complication that the rates of mental health issues in the population have gone up dramatically. The rates of isolation have gone up dramatically,” he said. “I worry that that expands their vulnerability to unhealthy relationships with these bonds.”

Intimacy by Design

Some of the design features of AI chatbots encourage users to feel an emotional bond with the software. They are anthropomorphic—prone to acting as if they have interior lives and lived experience that they do not, prone to being sycophantic, can hold long conversations, and are able to remember information.

There is, of course, a commercial motive for making chatbots this way. Users tend to return and stay loyal to certain chatbots if they feel emotionally connected or supported by them.

Experts have warned that some features of AI bots are playing into the “intimacy economy,” a system that tries to capitalize on emotional resonance. It’s a kind of AI-update on the “attention economy” that capitalized on constant engagement.

“Engagement is still what drives revenue,” Sarma said. “For example, for something like TikTok, the content is customized to you. But with chatbots, everything is made for you, and so it is a different way of tapping into engagement.”

These features, however, can become problematic when the chatbots go off script and start reinforcing harmful thoughts or offering bad advice. In Adam Raine’s case, the lawsuit alleges that ChatGPT bought up suicide at twelve times the rate he did, normalized his sucicial thoughts, and suggested ways to circumvent its content moderation.

It’s notoriously tricky for AI companies to stamp out behaviours like this completely and most experts agree it’s unlikely that hallucinations or unwanted actions will ever be eliminated entirely.

OpenAI, for example, acknowledged in its response to the lawsuit that safety features can degrade over long conversions, despite the fact that the chatbot itself has been optimized to hold these longer conversations. The company says it is trying to fortify these guardrails, writing in a blogpost that it was strengthening “mitigations so they remain reliable in long conversations” and “researching ways to ensure robust behavior across multiple conversations.”

Research Gaps Are Slowing Safety Efforts

For Michael Kleinman, U.S. policy director at the Future of Life Institute, the lawsuits underscore a pointAI safety researchers have been making for years: AI companies can’t be trusted to police themselves.

Kleinman equated OpenAI’s own description of its safeguards degrading in longer conversations to “a car company saying, here are seat belts—but if you drive more than 20 kilometers, we can’t guarantee they’ll work.”

He told Fortune the current moment echoes the rise of social media, where he said tech companies were effectively allowed to “experiment on kids” with little oversight. “We’ve spent the last 10 to 15 years trying to catch up to the harms social media caused. Now we’re letting tech companies experiment on kids again with chatbots, without understanding the long-term consequences,” he said.

Part of this is a lack of scientific research on the effects of long, sustained chatbot conversations. Most studies only look at brief exchanges, a single question and answer, or at most a handful of back-and-forth messages. Almost no research has examined what happens in longer conversations.

“The cases where folks seem to have gotten in trouble with AI: we’re looking at very long, multi-turn interactions. We’re looking at transcripts that are hundreds of pages long for two or three days of interaction alone and studying that is really hard, because it’s really hard to stimulate in the experimental setting,” Sarma said. “But at the same time, this is moving too quickly for us to rely on only gold standard clinical trials here.”

AI companies are rapidly investing in development and shipping more powerful models at a pace that regulators and researchers struggle to match.

“The technology is so far ahead and research is really behind,” Sakshi Ghai, a Professor of Psychological and Behavioural Science at The London School of Economics and Political Science, told Fortune.

A Regulatory Push for Accountability

Regulators are trying to step in, helped by the fact that child online safety is a relatively bipartisan issue in the U.S.

On Thursday, the FTC said it was issuing orders to seven companies, including OpenAI and Character.AI, in an effort to understand how their chatbots impact children. The agency said that chatbots can simulate human-like conversations and form emotional connections with their users. It’s asking companies
