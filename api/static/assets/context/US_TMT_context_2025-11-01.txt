[TITLE]ChatGPT-creator OpenAI announces massive new data center in Michigan:
[TEXT]

Jacob Hamilton | MLive.com

WASHTENAW COUNTY, MI – OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is opening a massive new data center in Michigan that state officials say will be one of the most advanced AI infrastructure facilities in the U.S.

The 2.2-million-square-foot data center will be built in early 2026 in Saline Township, a rural community in southeast Washtenaw County, the company announced Thursday, Oct. 30.

OpenAI said the facility will not need any additional power generation to operate, using a closed-loop cooling system that significantly reduces water consumption. DTE Energy will serve the data center, using existing excess transmission capacity so there won’t be any impact on local energy supply.

“Michigan has long been at the center of American engineering and manufacturing,” the company said in a news release. “We’re proud to build here and to continue expanding the infrastructure needed to ensure the benefits of AI reach everyone.”

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Michigan was selected for the multi-billion-dollar project because of the state’s strong construction and tech workforce, capable of both building and operating the facility.

“Today, we won the largest economic project in Michigan history,” Whitmer said in a statement announcing the project. “This transformational new Stargate OpenAI facility, built by Oracle and Related Digital, will create 2,500 good-paying union construction jobs, more than 450 permanent high-skill, high-paying jobs on site, and 1,500 more in the community while helping us lead the future of advanced manufacturing and technology.”

“I’m grateful to these cutting-edge companies for betting on Michigan, building on our work to compete for and win big projects in next-generation industries from cars and clean energy to semiconductors and batteries.”

The project, being developed by Related Digital, has been met with pushback from local officials in Saline Township. The fact that OpenAI was behind the project was previously undisclosed to the public.

Maintaining the area’s rural character has been a key issue among many of the dozens of residents who expressed concerns or outright opposed the data center proposal at township meetings. Worries also included electricity usage, the impact of construction, noise generation, and potential negative impacts on the environment and neighbors.

Whitmer said the project will preserve more than 700 acres of open space that will be retained and used as farmland, wetland, and forest. The Michigan Department of Transportation said the project will have minimal effects on local traffic.

Related Digital also agreed to invest $14 million toward local fire departments, a community investment fund and farmland preservation trust. The Saline Township Board of Trustees requested the investment as part of a deal allowing the data center to move forward.

DTE said the new power-hungry data center will increase the total demand on its system by 25%, adding 1.4 gigawatts in demand. DTE CEO Joi Harris said the utility planned to spend an additional $6 billion over the coming five years to serve the data center customer and continue modernizing its grid. Harris said the data center will not result in increased customer rates.

OpenAI has previously announced six other U.S. Stargate sites with Oracle and SoftBank, located in Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, and Ohio. Combined with those projects, Michigan’s new facility will bring Stargate to over 8 gigawatts of planned capacity, representing more than $450 billion in investment over the next three years, OpenAI said.

[TITLE]Ex-Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger praises cutting-edge Nvidia chip production with TSMC on US soil, despite Intel missing out — hails manufacturing milestone of US-based supply chain:
[TEXT]
Intel's former CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has praised the news that Nvidia's latest Blackwell GPUs are now being produced at its Arizona facility. It's important, he said, for the most cutting-edge silicon supply chains to be resilient, and that such moves would also help Nvidia develop and iterate faster and bigger into the future.

This comes as somewhat of a surprise, as it was under Gelsinger's leadership that Intel pushed so hard for Nvidia fabrication contracts. To date, Intel Foundry Services hasn't secured any of those contracts, even with the recent Nvidia deal and backing from the US government.

While some Nvidia fans were being duped by a nefarious deepfake scam on Tuesday, others watched Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the GTC DC show make the pitch for just how important Nvidia is to the US, and how much it would hurt US interests if its exports were restricted, as per CNBC. But Nvidia was playing its part too, Huang suggested, highlighting how the latest Blackwell GPUs were now produced within US borders, as well as at TSMC facilities in Taiwan, where the majority of the world's cutting-edge silicon is still manufactured.

Gelsinger was really pleased with this news, though, and took to X to say as such.

I have been affirming for years the need to build our most advanced products in the US and very pleased to see this step being taken. We need to have more resilient supply chains for the world's most important technology -- semiconductors. Well done, go faster, build more, go…October 29, 2025

Nvidia and many other major tech companies have announced large US-based infrastructure projects over the past year. That's partly down to companies hoping to avoid the mercurial trade tariffs and export restrictions that the Trump administration has levied across a range of industries and countries since coming back to power in January.

As part of a chicken-and-egg metaphor, it's also due to a global shift towards nationalized technology and multi-polar supply chains that don't necessarily rely on China, and vice versa. We've seen the US and China tussle over even seemingly unimportant chip companies, like Nexperia in the Netherlands, as well as argue over rare earth mineral exports.

The specter of China's potential future invasion of Taiwan, where 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors are manufactured, continues to loom over the whole endeavour, too.

Gelsinger was Intel CEO from 2021 to 2024, largely overseeing one of the worst periods in Intel's history. It fell severely behind AMD on the consumer and enterprise CPU front, and the fabrication plant he pushed to build in Germany was ultimately scrapped by his successor - although the Arizona facilities he had Intel build have recently come online.

[TITLE]5G in edge computing: Benefits, applications and challenges:
[TEXT]
Most telecom experts agree that the future of 5G technology lies in edge computing, in which 5G wireless networks with distributed computing resources are placed near the "edge" of the network or close to where data is generated.

The goal of 5G edge computing is to reduce latencies or delays so that organizations can process more data faster or store data locally for reliability or regulatory reasons. 5G, with its higher bandwidth, provides the connectivity backbone that makes edge deployments much more viable. It brings computing closer to the source, so the two together can support demanding new applications.

What is 5G edge computing? 5G edge computing is a paradigm in which computing, storage and network functions are placed closer to users or data sources, such as sensors, rather than being concentrated in remote data centers. "5G is the wireless protocol that we use to transmit over our devices to a tower and ultimately base station," said Jack Fritz, principal in Deloitte Consulting's technology, media and telecommunications practice. He added that combining 5G with edge technology brings more computing power to users' wireless applications. A key architectural model under 5G edge computing is multi-access edge computing (MEC), sometimes called mobile edge computing. MEC is defined by telecom standards-setting bodies European Telecommunications Standards Institute and Third Generation Partnership Project to provide an IT service environment, including computing, storage and network at the edge, enabling applications and services to run there with less latency, improved bandwidth efficiency and more control over where data is stored. MEC also supports multiple access technologies, including cellular, Wi-Fi and other technologies, so it is not limited to just one kind of network link. The 5G standard contains specifications for how to support edge computing in the 5G core -- that is, a 5G network's central control and management software -- as well as the radio access network. The architecture generally involves the following: Edge application servers deployed at edge nodes to host applications and services.

deployed at edge nodes to host applications and services. Edge enabler clients , which reside on user devices and communicate with edge enabler servers so that the device can discover and connect with edge services.

, which reside on user devices and communicate with edge enabler servers so that the device can discover and connect with edge services. User-plane function, which plays a key role in data transfer and packet processing, enabling traffic to be broken out or anchored locally so that data doesn't always have to travel back to core network servers. Key components Edge computing typically involves several components, including the following: Edge devices. These are the actual endpoints generating or consuming data. Examples include IoT smart sensors, cameras, vehicles, smartphones and robots that connect to edge nodes for processing.

Cloud integration layer. This layer of interfaces links the edge with central cloud data centers for coordination, backup and large-scale analytics.

Benefits of 5G in edge computing When 5G networks are paired with edge computing, applications can operate with faster responsiveness, higher reliability and greater efficiency than with traditional cloud models. The 5G-edge combination also supports real-time decision-making, enables more immersive experiences and provides the infrastructure for industries such as healthcare, transportation and manufacturing to innovate at scale. Among the benefits of 5G edge computing are the following: Lower latency. Because processing happens near the device rather than in faraway cloud servers, response times are drastically shortened. This makes applications like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), remote surgery and autonomous vehicles feasible, since even milliseconds of delay can make the difference between success and failure.

This makes applications like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), remote surgery and autonomous vehicles feasible, since even milliseconds of delay can make the difference between success and failure. Bandwidth efficiency. Not all raw data needs to travel across the entire network. Edge computing enables filtering, compression and preliminary analysis to occur locally, which reduces network congestion and cuts transmission costs.

By supporting real-time analytics and interaction, 5G edge computing makes it possible to deploy advanced use cases such as smart cities, connected healthcare, immersive gaming and industrial IoT. Data privacy and security. Processing sensitive information at or near its source helps organizations comply with data sovereignty laws and reduces the risk of exposure during long-distance transfers. "From the context of the cyber side, I can now have a resilient network using 5G and AI," said Dave Krauthamer, field CTO of QuSecure, which makes a post-quantum cryptography platform. "One of the elements we have is the ability to enhance the cryptographic fabric in real time based on threat patterns."

Applications of 5G in edge computing Among the applications that take advantage of the responsiveness, reliability and efficiency of 5G in edge computing are the following: Autonomous vehicles and intelligent transport. Edge nodes near roads can process sensor and camera data in real time, enabling safer navigation, collision avoidance and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication with very low latency.
