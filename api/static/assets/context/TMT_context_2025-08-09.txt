[TITLE]Cloud Software Group to Acquire Arctera : @VMblog:
[TEXT]
Cloud Software Group, Inc. announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arctera, a global leader in data management, from funds affiliated with global investment firm Carlyle. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Upon close, Arctera will operate as a standalone business unit within the Cloud Software Group portfolio.

Arctera is a global data management company created in 2024 following the combination of Veritas' Enterprise Data Protection business with Cohesity. Arctera's portfolio comprises Data Resilience delivered through InfoScale, Data Compliance through the Insight platform and Data Protection through Backup Exec. Arctera helps organizations thrive by delivering market-leading solutions that enable customers to trust, access and illuminate critical data. Headquartered in Pleasanton, California with employees and facilities around the world, Arctera delivers tailored data solutions to thousands of customers globally and generates more than $400 million of annual revenue and more than 40% adjusted EBITDA margins.

"This acquisition marks an exciting milestone for Cloud Software Group and an important step forward in our long-term growth strategy," said Tom Krause, Chief Executive Officer of Cloud Software Group. "We have a strong track record of continuing to invest in our portfolio of leading software brands, as evidenced by our work to improve profitability and long-term sustainability of the Citrix and TIBCO businesses. Looking ahead, we aim to acquire at-scale enterprise-focused software businesses that provide proven mission-critical capabilities and high value to public and private sector customers while also ensuring they're a good fit to operate within our proven Cloud Software Group model."

Krause continued, "We have long admired Arctera's business and the work that the Arctera and Carlyle teams have done to expand the business. Arctera has grown into a leading provider of data and enterprise infrastructure software solutions for customers worldwide, and we are confident that Arctera's portfolio of Data Resilience, Data Compliance and Data Protection products will be a natural complementary addition to Cloud Software Group. We look forward to expanding the services and products we provide for both sets of customers through this acquisition."

"We are thrilled to enter this next chapter in Arctera's evolution as we become a part of the Cloud Software Group team," said Lawrence Wong, Chief Executive Officer of Arctera. "Our mission has been to build on our pedigree of innovation across our three distinct product lines, each tailored to solve the most demanding data challenges for their customers. With Cloud Software Group's global resources, industry leading portfolio and seasoned leadership team, Arctera will be even better positioned to continue helping customers manage one of their most valuable assets: data."

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Cloud Software Group expects to fund the acquisition using cash on its balance sheet. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is acting as legal counsel to Cloud Software Group. Citi is serving as exclusive financial advisor and Alston & Bird LLP is acting as legal counsel to Arctera.

[TITLE]4 M&A trends keeping bankers busy this summer: JPMorgan:
[TEXT]

Forget summer Fridays.

The notion of "summer lull" has been gone from Wall Street since the pandemic, said Anu Aiyengar, global head of advisory and M&A at JPMorgan Chase. And it's never been more true than now: M&A activity has been rebounding even amid fears that Trump's trade wars could slow the economy.

"The last week of May and June and early July have all been pretty active with a good cadence of deal announcements," Aiyengar told Business Insider. "And more importantly, our pipeline and conversations continue to be active as well."

The bank on Wednesday released a report showing that M&A in the first half of the year hit its highest levels since 2022, driven largely by large deals. Here are four of the top trends keeping bankers busy as we head into a not-so-sleepy August:

Bigger is better

JPMorgan said total deal volume soared 27% to $2.2 trillion in the first half of 2025, including a 57% increase in deals over $10 billion.

Deals over $1 billion rose 72% — a 20-year high, the bank said.

Sector by sector

The bank said 7 out of 9 sectors saw double-digit volume growth, including:

Financial institutions (+56%)

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

Media & communications (+51%)

Diversified Industries (+41%)

M&A volumes seemed to favor technology (23%) and diversified industries (22%), the bank said.

Pie chart JPMorgan

Private equity dealmaking

Private equity firms, known in M&A parlance as financial sponsors, have ramped up dealmaking, leading to $168 billion in take-private deals in the first half of 2025, the highest levels since 2022, the bank said.

Four mega-deals accounted for more than 50% of that volume—indicating a highly concentrated but aggressive deployment of capital.

Minority stakes

Sponsors increased their minority stake transactions, especially in high-growth sectors. Sponsor-led minority deals rose 34% year-over-year and were 9% above the 10-year average of $81 billion.

A substantial share—35% of these deals—were in technology, driven by investments in AI, compute infrastructure, and data center capabilities.
