[TITLE]How Mexico Revived Its Renewable Energy Sector:
[TEXT]
After several years of stagnation in Mexico’s renewable energy sector, the introduction of more favourable reforms alongside several new solar energy agreements suggests that the Latin American country is pursuing a more diversified energy mix. After several years of energy policy that focused on greater nationalisation, the door is once again open for private participation, which is expected to include the development of several green energy projects and attract investment from various firms worldwide.

Under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), who led the Morena party from 2018 to 2024, Mexico’s energy sector underwent a significant nationalisation, during which time it became harder for private companies to participate in the industry. AMLO decided to nationalise Mexico’s energy sector, citing over-greedy international energy companies, sectoral corruption, and the need for enhanced national energy security.

During his presidency, AMLO supported fossil fuel expansion, bailing out the state-owned oil and gas company PEMEX several times, as well as investing heavily in the construction of major new refineries. Meanwhile, investments in green energy stagnated as AMLO did not prioritise renewable energy development at the national level or allow for investment from private companies.

Since President Claudia Sheinbaum came into office in 2024, Mexico’s energy sector has begun to undergo a transformation, following the introduction of a new energy reform in March 2025. Sheinbaum followed in AMLO’s footsteps by maintaining the national majority ownership of the electricity sector, meaning the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) must provide at least 54 percent of the country’s electricity. The reform also disbanded the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), replacing them with a centralised National Energy Commission (CNE).

While Mexico’s energy sector will continue to be dominated by state-owned companies, Sheinbaum has reopened opportunities for foreign investment in the sector. In her national economic development strategy, Plan México, Sheinbaum introduced the aim of adding almost 23 GW of new power generation capacity by 2030, as well as establishing 100 transmission and distribution projects.

During her electoral campaign, Sheinbaum stated her commitment to renewable energy, emphasising the potential to develop Mexico’s abundant solar and wind resources. “We are going to propel renewable energy in Mexico,” Sheinbaum said during her inauguration. “The objective is that by 2030, 45 percent of the country’s energy will be powered by renewable sources.”

The government plans to invest over $22 billion by 2030 to expand CFE’s electricity generation and distribution. Meanwhile, Mexico aims to attract between $6 and $9 billion in private investment to establish between 6.4 GW and 9.5 GW of new clean-energy capacity by 2030. The new energy reform allows both CFE and Pemex to enter mixed contracts with private companies, so long as they hold a majority share of the project.

In October, Mexico’s Energy Ministry invited private companies to participate in the construction of 34 new power plants to accelerate the expansion of the country’s electricity capacity. The projects include 23 solar photovoltaic and 11 wind power plants across 20 states. Operations are scheduled to commence between 2027 and 2030. Once completed, the facilities are expected to add 5.97 GW of installed capacity.

“The call is part of specific mechanisms to develop strategic and priority projects aligned with binding planning, ensuring an orderly and coherent approach to meeting the National Electric System’s capacity needs,” the Ministry’s announcement stated.

In late October, the Spanish clean energy firm The Cox Group announced an investment of $4.2 billion for new solar and wind farms in Mexico’s border state of Nuevo León. The projects will be developed in the state capital of Monterrey, as well as other municipalities, and are expected to support the creation of 4,000 temporary jobs and 250 permanent positions. The Cox Group and the state government are developing a comprehensive strategy that includes water treatment and reuse, gas cogeneration, and energy efficiency.

In November, the German utility RWE announced plans to launch solar projects in Mexico. RWE’s subsidiary Oyamel Recursos Ambientales is developing a 120 MW PV plant in Veracruz, while its Biznaga subsidiary aims to build the 90 MW Cerro Pelón PV plant in Jalisco. Meanwhile, Canadian Solar’s Recurrent Energy hopes to get approval for a $63 million solar plant in Zacatecas. Spain’s Global Dominion Access and Canadian Solar also submitted environmental permit requests to develop solar operations, while Iberdrola announced plans to develop two solar projects totalling 535 MW in Mexico.

A recent report by the energy think tank Ember forecast that private investment and energy storage in Mexico could grow to as much as 36 GW of solar power and 30 GWh of battery storage in the coming years, owing to a greater openness to private participation in Mexico’s energy sector. As much as 46 percent of the country’s electricity generation could come from private projects, suggesting the beginning of a shift away from nationalisation.

[TITLE]Brazil’s Oil Sector Rallies Against Oilfield Services Merger Plan:
[TEXT]
Oil majors in Brazil have decided they’ve seen enough of the proposed Subsea7–Saipem tie-up, and they’re pushing antitrust regulator Cade to slow it down or break it up. The merger, announced earlier this year, would create a new oilfield services deepwater heavyweight called Saipem7 — a company large enough to matter in any basin, but especially in Brazil, where subsea contractors are already a small club.

Cade has now asked both firms for fresh data, saying it still doesn’t have the information it needs to assess the deal. That request landed shortly after IBP — the industry group representing Brazil’s majors — warned that a combined Subsea7–Saipem could raise costs, delay projects, and lean on operators to sign long, exclusive contracts. In other words, the exact behavior regulators are supposed to prevent.

TotalEnergies went further, filing a study arguing that no set of remedies could fully offset the competitive risks. According to Total, the merged firm would control eight of the twelve ships worldwide capable of handling the toughest SURF work — the subsea umbilicals, risers, and flowlines essential for Brazil’s ultra-deepwater fields. Exxon also raised flags, and Petrobras joined the chorus asking Cade to either block the deal outright or force asset sales.

The scale is hard to ignore. Saipem7 would launch with a €43 billion backlog and about €21 billion in annual revenue. And while the two companies insist the merger is on track for late 2026, Cade is clearly taking its time — meeting not only with operators in Brazil but with regulators in the U.S., U.K., and Mozambique. The U.K. has already approved the deal; Brazil is shaping up to be the real test.

It’s a familiar story, really. The consolidation in oilfield services accelerates, offshore activity rebounds, and operators remember why they are not keen on concentrated supplier power.

[TITLE]UK Windfall Tax Puts $20 Billion in North Sea Oil Investment at Risk:
[TEXT]
The UK government’s decision to keep the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators could wipe out as much as $20 billion (£15 billion) of potential investment in Britain’s offshore oil and gas output, according to a Wood Mackenzie estimate cited by the Financial Times.

The government last week kept the windfall tax on operators in the Budget, dealing a blow to the industry.

Keeping the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), as the windfall tax is officially known since it was first introduced by a Conservative government at the height of the 2022 energy crisis, would wipe out all non-essential investment in the UK shelf, as it would compete with friendlier tax jurisdictions, according to WoodMac.

The UK has one of the highest tax rates of all major producing basins worldwide. Together with the windfall tax, which the government kept against industry calls for reform, operators are paying a massive 78% overall tax rate.

This has prompted many companies to halt investment in the UK and move to cut workforce numbers.

The latest announcement came from one of the top independent producers, Harbour Energy, which on Monday said it expects to reduce employee numbers by another 100, on top of 600 jobs already eliminated since 2023.

The industry slammed the government’s decision, arguing that the windfall tax will eventually bury the offshore oil and gas industry and threaten Britain’s energy security.

“The future of North Sea energy depends on investment, which won’t come without urgent reform of the windfall tax,” Offshore Energies UK Chief Executive, David Whitehouse, said in a statement.

“The government turned down £50 billion of investment for the UK and the chance to protect the jobs and industries that keep this country running. Instead, they’ve chosen a path that will see 1,000 jobs continue to be lost every month, more energy imports and a contagion across supply chains and our industrial heartlands,” Whitehouse added.

The Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce said it’s “Lights out for North Sea oil and gas as Chancellor keeps windfall tax.”

The Chamber’s chief executive, Russell Borthwick, commented that instead of heeding advice from industry, “the UK Government has instead opted for a cliff-edge end to North Sea production and to tax the industry to death inside five years. Jobs will be lost in their thousands as a direct result of this government’s failure to act.”

[TITLE]Europe strikes a deal to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027:
[TEXT]
Brussels Reuters —

The European Union agreed Wednesday to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decade-long dependency on Russian energy.

Representatives for EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement in the early hours of Wednesday on proposals set out by the European Commission in June to end shipments from the EU’s former top gas supplier following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move toward a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.

“Today, we are stopping these imports permanently,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement. “By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

For short-term contracts concluded before June 17 this year, the prohibition will apply from April 25, 2026, for LNG and from June 17, 2026, for pipeline gas.

For long-term contracts concluded before June 17, the cut-off dates will be the start of 2027 and the start of October 2026, with a possible one-month extension for EU members facing difficulties reaching required storage levels.

As of October, Russia accounted for 12% of EU gas imports, down from 45% before its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Hungary, France and Belgium among the countries still receiving supplies.

The European Commission is also committed to phasing out remaining oil imports from Russia by the end of 2027, with a legislative proposal to be presented early next year.

Under Wednesday’s agreement, EU members will submit “national diversification plans” regarding oil and gas supplies to the commission by March 1, and will be required to notify the EU executive whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national bans in place.

The commission will issue recommendations based on this feedback.

[TITLE]Claim: “lack of long-term revenue certainty” is Crashing Aussie Renewable Investment.:
[TEXT]
Essay by Eric Worrall

Are renewables investors worried the subsidies could cease?

Australia could miss clean energy target as solar and wind investment slumps, investors warn Expert cautions large pipeline of potential projects will not deliver required energy capacity unless companies make final investments Graham Readfearn and Adam Morton

Mon 1 Dec 2025 19.22 AEDT … Clean Energy Regulator data shows the government agency expects 2.5GW of industry-scale renewable energy capacity to reach a final investment decision this year, down from 4GW last year. The 12-month average for investment commitments on new developments is at its lowest since early 2017.

… … chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, Richie Merzian, said the lower financial investment decisions were a “symptom of deep structural issues, not just a blip”. “The structural issues include state planning delays, grid connection uncertainty, transmission constraints, rising project costs and lack of long-term revenue certainty,” he said. Merzian said the underwriting program had helped to develop a large pipeline of potential projects, but that they would not deliver the new energy capacity needed unless companies made final investments. “The contrast between the large pipeline and the limited number reaching [financial investment decision] indicates a system that is not functioning as intended,” he said. … Read more: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/01/australia-could-miss-clean-energy-target-as-solar-and-wind-investment-slumps-investors-warn

[TITLE]Abia power substation construction begins to boost supply:
[TEXT]
In a move expected to strengthen electricity supply in the Abia State capital, the state government and the Niger Delta Power Holding Company have flagged off the construction of a 7.5 MVA, 33/11 kV injection substation in Umuahia.

A statement by the NDPHC on Sunday disclosed that the substation construction started last Thursday. According to the statement, Governor Alex Otti, who performed the groundbreaking, said the project marked a transformative step in the state’s push to modernise its power distribution network and guarantee a more reliable supply for homes, businesses, and public institutions.

“This infrastructure represents the beginning of a broader, deliberate effort to upgrade and expand Abia’s power network for the benefit of our people,” Otti said, while praising the Federal Government and NDPHC for prioritising Abia in the intervention.

Executed under the National Integrated Power Project, the new facility will include a 1km 33kV line, 1.2km of 11kV line, two 300kVA distribution substations, and 2km of low-tension line, NDPHC said.

The governor also applauded President Bola Tinubu’s ongoing reforms in the electricity market, noting that the liberalised national framework had opened opportunities for stronger state-level participation, private investment, and global partnerships.

Otti disclosed that the state had already made budgetary provisions for another 7.5 MVA injection substation in the 2026 fiscal year. Once completed alongside the new project, he said, the Ogurube Layout axis of Umuahia would have a combined capacity of 15 MVA.

NDPHC’s Managing Director/CEO, Jennifer Adighije, represented by Executive Director, Networks, Bello Babayo Bello, reaffirmed the company’s resolve to deepen access to stable power nationwide.

“This project is a reflection of our mandate to empower communities, support economic development, and deliver sustainable electricity infrastructure across Nigeria,” she said.

Stakeholders at the event were quoted as saying that the partnership between the Federal Government, NDPHC, and the Abia State Government underscored the value of coordinated efforts in delivering critical public utilities.

When completed, the facility is expected to boost supply to Umuahia, support small businesses, promote industrial activities, and enhance the living standards of residents in the state capital and neighbouring communities.

[TITLE]Surge in Natural Gas Prices Sets The Stage for Coal Comeback:
[TEXT]
As U.S. natural gas prices jumped to a three-year high, coal has become a cheaper power-generating fuel for utilities, which are set to run coal-fired generators harder this winter.

U.S. benchmark natural gas prices at Henry Hub have jumped from $4.23 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at the start of November to above $5 per MMBtu by early December. Early on Friday, the front-month futures price was $5.084 per MMBtu.

That’s the highest price in three years, as a polar vortex with freezing temperatures and snowstorms gripped most of the U.S. and as U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports continue to set record highs as new plants ramp up liquefaction and shipments.

Near-month futures prices are at their highest since December 2022, while the price of the 12-month futures contract strip January 2026 through December 2026 climbed in one week by 26 cents to $4.302 per MMBtu, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its latest Natural Gas Weekly report.

The report also showed that working natural gas stocks totaled 3,923 Bcf for the week ending December 3, which is 5% more than the five-year average and less than 1% lower than last year at this time.

Although natural gas stocks are at levels higher than the five-year average, prices are rallying as heating and power demand jumps with the colder weather and LNG exports out of America are setting new highs.

The U.S. is set to export 14.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG this year, up by 25% from 2024, the EIA said in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) for November. Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana has ramped up exports more quickly than the EIA expected, leading the administration to raise its forecast of LNG exports in the current quarter by 3% compared with last month’s outlook. The EIA expects U.S. LNG exports to increase by an additional 10% in 2026.

As a result, soaring U.S. natural gas prices make gas-fired power generation more expensive for electric utilities and some of these are set to boost generation from cheaper coal.

The EIA expects in its latest STEO that the 2025 annual average price of natural gas paid by electric power plants will jump by 37% and the price paid by industrial sector customers will increase by 21% compared with the 2024 averages.

The Henry Hub natural gas spot price is set to average $4.00 per MMBtu in 2026, the EIA forecasts. The expected average price would be 16% higher than in 2025, primarily due to surging LNG exports amid flat gas production.

Coal, for its part, saw increased production this year, supported by the Trump Administration and the rising price of natural gas.

The coal production increase in 2025 is the result of rising demand, the EIA notes. Demand has increased due to higher natural gas prices, delayed coal plant retirements, and strong demand for heating in the earlier winter months this year. In response to higher demand, the EIA expects electric power coal inventories to end the year at 107 million short tons (MMst), which would be 17% lower than at the end of 2024.

Higher natural gas prices are setting the stage for increased coal use, at least in the coming months. But soaring power demand from AI could also support a quiet comeback for coal in the coming years.

Most coal-fired power plants could delay retirement because of the AI-driven power demand surge, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Reuters in September.

“Energy sobriety has returned to Washington, D.C. Our focus is on Americans and the price of utility and avoiding blackouts,” Wright said.

“We've got to stop existing firm capacity from retirement,” the Energy Secretary added.

The surge in U.S. electricity demand “is reviving hopes of at least a slightly brighter future for coal,” Ed Crooks, Vice Chair Americas at Wood Mackenzie, said in October.

“There is no doubt that the boom in data centre investment is helping to slow the decline of coal in the US, by prolonging the operational lives of some coal-fired power plants,” WoodMac reckons.

Two years ago, Wood Mackenzie’s base-case expectation was that U.S. coal-fired power generation would plunge by about 60% between 2025 and 2032. Now WoodMac expects the drop to be about 39%.

[TITLE]India plans to cut power bills with wider AI use in distribution networks: Power Ministry official:
[TEXT]
India aims to lower consumer power bills and improve energy utilisation through wider adoption of artificial intelligence across distribution networks, said Shashank Misra, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Power.Speaking to ANI, on the sidelines of the National Conference on the Use of AI/ML in the Power Distribution Sector in the national capital, Misra said that the government is pushing AI tools to help distributors detect theft-prone zones more accurately and respond faster."The aim is to reduce the bill of consumers and better utilise the energy," he said, highlighting the daily usage and earth leakages inside the house.Misra said AI-driven analytics will enable discoms to identify abnormal consumption patterns, target field inspections, and minimise technical and commercial losses, which remain a major cost burden for utilities and consumers.He added that the ministry is exploring the use of large language models , including GPT-based systems, to support decision-making, automate workflows and strengthen real-time monitoring across the distribution sector."These technologies will allow us to act quicker and improve overall efficiency," Misra said.Speaking at the same event yesterday, energy experts highlighted that India is uniquely positioned to capitalise on its already surplus power capacity, as the rapid expansion of data centres is driving unprecedented energy demand.According to the experts, the country has the potential to emerge as a global leader by treating electricity as a tradable commodity and demonstrating its capability to meet growing domestic and international energy needs.Earlier this October, the government released a draft of the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2025, aimed at making Indian industry and logistics more competitive by rationalising electricity costs and reducing hidden cross-subsidies.The Government has stated that the bill promotes cost-reflective tariffs to ensure the sector's financial viability, while fully protecting subsidised tariffs for farmers and low-income households.It aims to create a future-ready electricity sector that delivers reliable, affordable, and high-quality power to every consumer: farmers and households, to shops and industries.The Bill moves away from the old monopoly supply model and encourages a performance-driven approach, where both public and private utilities compete fairly to improve consumer service. It promotes better use of the existing electricity network with transparency and accountability so that citizens get more value for every rupee spent.
