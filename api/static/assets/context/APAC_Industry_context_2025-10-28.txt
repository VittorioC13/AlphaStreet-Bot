[TITLE]HSBC to take $1.1 billion hit after Luxembourg court ruling in Madoff case:
[TEXT]
LONDON :HSBC Holdings said on Monday it would book a $1.1 billion provision in its third-quarter results after losing part of an appeal in a long-running lawsuit tied to Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, history's biggest ever such fraud.

HSBC acted as a service provider to several funds that invested with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Herald Fund SPC sued HSBC's Luxembourg unit in 2009 seeking restitution of assets it said were lost in the fraud.

Last Friday, the Luxembourg Court of Cassation rejected an appeal by HSBC's unit over the restitution of securities claimed by Herald, although it accepted its appeal on a separate cash restitution claim, the bank said.

Herald had alleged that HSBC failed in its duties as a custodian to protect it from the fraud, previous court documents from the case show.

HSBC PLANS TO APPEAL FURTHER

The adverse ruling for HSBC dragged its shares down 1 per cent, threatened to mar its quarterly earnings due on Tuesday, and showed how banks are still vulnerable to long-running litigation, often tied to the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis.

HSBC now plans to lodge a second appeal with the Luxembourg Court of Appeal and, if unsuccessful, the bank said it would contest the amount to be paid.

It added that the eventual financial impact could differ significantly from its current estimate.

Europe's largest bank by assets said in July that Herald, which is in liquidation, was seeking the restitution of securities and cash worth $2.5 billion plus interest or damages of $5.6 billion plus interest.

HSBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the separate securities and cash amounts that Herald is seeking. The principal liquidators of Herald also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bank estimated that the provision would have an impact of around 15 basis points (or 0.15 of a percentage point) on its common equity tier 1 capital ratio, meaning little lasting impact on the key measure of financial strength, which stands at 14.6 per cent.

That would come on top of a 125 basis points impact arising from its $13.6 billion deal to take its majority-owned Hong Kong unit Hang Seng Bank private.

FALLOUT LINGERS FROM HISTORY'S BIGGEST EVER FRAUD

The charge could weigh on sentiment slightly but the impact should be limited as HSBC has already suspended share buybacks for the next three quarters due to the acquisition of Hang Seng Bank, said Lorraine Tan, director of equity research (Asia) for Morningstar.

Madoff's fraud was estimated as much as $64.8 billion, making it the biggest-ever Ponzi scheme, a kind of fraud whereby old investors are paid off with funds from newer ones while the organiser siphons off some of the money for themselves.

It went undiscovered for years until Madoff confessed to his sons in December 2008, one day after his firm's Christmas party. Madoff eventually pleaded guilty to 11 criminal counts. He died aged 82 in April 2021 while serving a 150-year prison sentence.

HSBC in 2012 settled with Kalix Fund for an undisclosed amount, also over losses the fund had suffered during the collapse of Madoff's financial empire. The fund had sued the bank for $35.6 million.

MANILA, Philippines -- MANILA, Philippines (AP) — World shares were mixed on Thursday following a retreat on Wall Street, while crude prices jumped more than $2 after U.S. President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Russian oil giants.

The sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil are intended to drive Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and help end Moscow’s brutal war on Ukraine.

Meanwhile, European Union leaders were holding a summit Thursday, aiming to greenlight still more sanctions against Russia and press ahead with plans to use Moscow’s assets that are frozen in Europe to fund Ukraine’s war effort and economy for at least the next two years.

U.S. benchmark crude oil gained $2.70 to $61.21 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose $2.85 to $65.44 per barrel.

The future for the S & P 500 was up more than 0.1% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1%.

In early European trading, Germany's DAX slipped 0.3% to 24,083.89. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.1% to 9,527.33, while in Paris, the CAC 40 rose 0.4% to 8,238.47.

Chinese shares rose from losses earlier in the day as leaders in Beijing were wrapping up an important Communist Party meeting that will set the agenda for the coming five years.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 0.7% to 25,967.98 while the Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.2% to 3,922.41 as reports indicated Washington may tighten restrictions on exports to China of products made using U.S. software.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 shed nearly 1.4% to 48,641.61 on reports that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is preparing a stimulus package larger than last year’s of nearly 14 trillion yen (about $92 billion). SoftBank Group led losers, with shares shedding more than 4% after it unveiled plans to finance its investments in artificial intelligence by issuing U.S. dollar and euro dominated bonds.

Takaichi has also said she favors keeping interest rates near their current low level of close to zero, and that has caused the Japanese yen to weaken against the dollar. The dollar rose to 152.59 Japanese yen Thursday, up from 151.94 yen.

South Korea's Kospi fell 1% to 3,845.56, with investors remaining cautious while trade negotiations with the U.S. made limited progress.

Australia's S & P/ASX 200 added less than 0.1% to 9,032.80.

Taiwan's Taiex slipped 0.4%, while India's BSE Sensex rose 0.6%.

On Wednesday, the S & P 500 sank 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7%, from its record set the day before. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.

Netflix helped drag the market lower after delivering a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The pressure is on the video streamer and on companies broadly to deliver solid growth in profits. That would counter criticism that their stock prices shot too high following a 35% romp for the S & P 500 from a low in April.

Capital One Financial rose 1.5%, and Western Alliance Bancorp climbed 3.2% following their own profit updates that beat analysts’ expectations. The report from Western Alliance was particularly welcome after it helped shake confidence in the industry last week. It’s one of several banks that had warned of potentially bad loans on its books, possibly because of fraud.

Beyond Meat, meanwhile, swung sharply through a manic Wednesday. After surging as much as 112% in the morning, its stock erased all of that to finish with a drop of 1.1%. It’s still up 454.5% for the week so far in the midst of its meme-stock run.

The maker of plant-based meat alternatives was the biggest holding in the Roundhill Meme Stock exchange-traded fund, as of Tuesday. The ETF holds stocks where investors have piled in because they’re hoping to catch a wave of momentum, almost regardless of how or even what the businesses themselves are doing.

In other dealings early Thursday, the price of gold recovered about 1.6% to $4,131.80 after sliding for two days from its record high.

The euro slipped to $1.1595 from $1.1610.

[TITLE]HKEX vets 300 listing applications after city becomes the world's largest IPO market:
[TEXT]
Bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), which topped this year's global rankings as the largest initial public offering (IPO) market, said the city continued to see strong momentum, as it vets hundreds of new listing applications.

Bonnie Chan Yiting, CEO of HKEX, on Wednesday said at an event in Shanghai that Hong Kong has more than 300 companies in the listing pipeline, which would ensure another strong quarter for fundraising in the city.

"International investors have been actively involved in new listings in Hong Kong this year," Chan said at a HKEX-organised summit in mainland China's financial capital. "These included long-term investors from Europe, the US, the Middle East and emerging markets."

Asian stocks rose on Tuesday as the prospect of easing trade tensions between the world's top two economies boosted risk sentiment, while the near-certainty of Sanae Takaichi becoming Japan's next prime minister sent the Nikkei to a record high.U.S. President Donald Trump said he expects to reach a fair trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping and downplayed risks of a clash over the issue of Taiwan.Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have weighed on the markets in recent weeks, with investor focus now on Trump's planned meeting with Xi on the sidelines of an economic conference in South Korea next week.The lingering hope that a resolution could be on the cards lifted investor sentiment . MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan hit an over four-and-half-year high and was last up 0.94%. China stocks rose 0.2% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was 1% higher in early trading.Australian shares surged as investors snapped up rare earths and critical minerals stocks after the country signed a supply deal with the United States.Japan's Nikkei rose 0.86% to a record peak and was on the cusp of hitting landmark 50,000 points ahead of a parliamentary vote later in the day that is expected to confirm fiscal dove Takaichi as the nation's next prime minister.Investor sentiment was also hit hard last week as a clutch of bad loans at U.S. regional banks spurred concerns over credit risks that threatened to spill into the broader markets. The prolonged U.S. government shutdown also weighed on risk assets.But investors so far this week have shrugged off those concerns and bought the dip, focusing on upcoming earnings from several large firms and betting that trade tensions would ease."The market has hurdled the wall of worry with ease, with new capital injected into risk and fresh oxygen into the market's lungs," said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.Market expectation of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in the next two meetings and comments from White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett that the federal government shutdown is likely to end this week also buoyed sentiment.A broad rally sent all three major U.S. stock indexes to a sharply higher close overnight with chip stocks hitting a record high.Analysts currently expect third-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth, on aggregate, of 9.3% year-on-year, marking an improvement over their 8.8% growth estimate as of October 1.The spotlight will be on the parliamentary vote later in the day as hardline conservative Takaichi is all but certain to become the country's first female prime minister.The yen was last 0.1% stronger at 150.61 per dollar, having fallen slightly in the previous session as investors anticipated that Takaichi's likely premiership after the backing of the right-wing opposition party Ishin. [FRX/]Analysts expect Takaichi to be pro-stimulus and against further hikes in interest rates, a negative for the yen and bonds but a plus for equities.Other currencies were mostly calm, with the euro steady at $1.164925. The dollar index was little changed at 98.575.Gold prices were stuck near record highs due to safe-haven flows and U.S. interest rate cut wagers. Spot gold eased a bit to $4,350 per ounce, just below the record peak of $4,381.21 hit on Monday.

[TITLE]City-States Without Limits – Part 2:
[TEXT]
In Part 1, we discussed the NRx technocrats’ ideas and how they have influenced the city-state model that seeks to capitalise on the global proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). We examined the role of functional oligarchies in this endeavor. In Part 2, we look at how that city-state model manifests internationally and what it implies, not just for global governance structures, but for humanity.

In Part 1, we explored the ideology that has been adopted by a powerful group of NRx technocrat-oligarchs and how their proposals align with the interests of their international oligarch partners. We discussed the venture capital impact investment strategy the NRx technocrats call “accelerationism” and how governments are actually “functional oligarchies.”

The model of “government” the NRx technocrats propose is unlike anything we are currently familiar with. It is much more akin to the kind of authoritarian dictatorships exercised by the feudal monarchs of Medieval Europe. These gov-corp Technates, as envisaged, effectively amount to dictatorial city-states under the direct control of oligarchs.

The NRx technocrats seek to break nation-states apart into technologically governed “enclaves” (gov-corp Technates). These “realms” will form an international “Patchwork,” with each enclave or “network archipelago” represented as a digital node, almost certainly on a single, overarching blockchain or “unified ledger.” The digital access permissions to the node, which serves as the digital twin for the physical realm of the city-state “enclave,” will be controlled by the “founder” or their selected administrators of the realm. This forms a gov-corp Technate ruled by a CEO King (oligarch) where “nothing officially exists” unless it is represented digitally on the realm’s ledger (blockchain).

The citizens of the realm are customers of the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) that rules the gov-corp Technate. The customers will have no individual sovereignty unless they purchase it from the “founder.” All value is digital in the realm. The life of your “digital twin,” monitored through the requirement to use digital ID, seamlessly links a customer’s offline life to that of their online digital twin.

By controlling the programmable digital currency allotted to the customer’s digital twin, via their digital ID, any misbehaviour can be punished by the founder or their delegated system administrators. For example, by freezing “their deposits” or locking people “out of all doors for a time period as a punishment.” There are no means of recourse in a gov-corp Technate. The only option open to the persecuted customer is to flee, if they have the means.

We also discussed how governments around the world have already started carving out nascent gov-corp Technates in the form of thousands of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Some of which, such as Shenzhen in China, have already been established as de facto city-states with their own increasingly independent jurisdictions and embryonic city-state governments.

At the heart of this effort to create a global patchwork of city-states are the NRx technocrats, perhaps most notably Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen in the US, and venture capital firms like NeWay Capital and Pronomos Capital. But they are far from alone. The NRx technocrat network is global and, at the highest governmental and intergovernmental level, the hope is to bring
