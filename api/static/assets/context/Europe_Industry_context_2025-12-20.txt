Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2025 Consolidated Financial Review

Total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased $35.4 million or 10% to $319.0 million compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the Marketing & Distribution segment, where a decrease in average per-unit avocado sales prices of 27% was partially offset by a 13% increase in avocado volume sold. Price and volume movements resulted from greater availability of Mexican fruit due to harvest disruptions in the previous year and higher Peruvian avocado production driven by more favorable weather conditions in the current year.

Gross profit was $55.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, consistent with the prior year, while gross margin increased 180 basis points compared to the same period last year, to 17.5% of revenue. The margin increase was driven by lower revenues compared to last year, resulting from lower per-unit pricing, as the Marketing & Distribution segment margin is primarily managed on a per-unit basis.

Selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) for the fourth quarter increased $0.5 million or 2% to $27.7 million, compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher general operating costs, inclusive of performance-based stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower statutory profit-sharing expense in the Peru and Mexico operations.

Net income attributable to Mission Produce for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 was $16.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $17.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the same period last year.

Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 13% to $22.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $19.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the same period last year.

Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.5 million or 12% to $41.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $36.9 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by increased owned avocado production in the International Farming segment and higher avocado volume sold in the Marketing & Distribution segment.

Fiscal Fourth Quarter Business Segment Performance

Marketing & Distribution

Net sales in the Marketing & Distribution segment decreased $47.7 million or 15% to $271.9 million for the fourth quarter, driven by the avocado volume and pricing dynamics described above. While pricing is driven by industry production dynamics, the Company manages the business primarily to volume and per-unit margins—leveraging its global platform and sourcing network to optimize per-unit margin performance regardless of the pricing environment.

Segment operating income increased $1.6 million or 9% and segment adjusted EBITDA increased $2.7 million or 11% compared to the same period last year, which is primarily attributed to higher avocado volume sold.

International Farming

The vast majority of fruit sales from the International Farming segment are made to the Marketing & Distribution segment, with the remainder of revenue largely derived from direct sales of fruit to third parties, as well as services provided to third-parties and the Blueberries segment. Affiliated sales are concentrated in the second half of the fiscal year in alignment with the Peruvian avocado harvest season, which typically runs from April through September of each year. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the International Farming segment is generally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year in alignment with the timing of sales.

Total sales in the International Farming segment for the fourth quarter increased $29.3 million or 97% to $59.6 million, compared to $30.3 million for the same period last year. Segment operating income improved by $4.7 million to $2.1 million compared to a loss of $2.5 million in the same period last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $5.7 million or 211% to $8.4 million compared to $2.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher yield from owned avocado orchards and supported by higher volume of avocado packing and cooling services provided to third parties.

Blueberries

Sales in the Blueberries segment have traditionally been concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year in alignment with the Peruvian blueberry harvest season.

Net sales in the Blueberries segment increased $4.9 million or 16% to $36.5 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $31.6 million for the same period last year, primarily due to higher volume produced on owned farms as a result of increased total acreage.

Segment operating income was $4.9 million for the fourth quarter compared to $11.6 million in the same period last year and segment adjusted EBITDA was $4.7 million compared to $8.6 million in same period last year. The decreases were due to higher unit costs resulting from lower projected yields per hectare in the current harvest season.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

Cash and cash equivalents were $64.8 million as of October 31, 2025, compared to $58.0 million as of October 31, 2024.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $88.6 million for the year ended October 31, 2025, as compared to $93.4 million last year, driven by higher working capital requirements. Working capital growth was primarily driven by lower grower payables, higher other assets and net movements in income tax receivable and payable balances, which were partially offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances and higher accounts payable balances. The movements in accounts receivable, inventory and grower payables correlated with reductions in avocado pricing levels. Other asset growth pertains to value-added tax balances in Mexico and Guatemala, while income tax movements are attributed to timing of payment requirements in operational taxing jurisdictions. Accounts payable growth is primarily attributed to higher farming production costs within our International Farming and Blueberries segments.

Capital expenditures were $51.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2025 compared to $32.2 million last year. Capital expenditures were comprised primarily of avocado orchard development, pre-production orchard maintenance and land improvements, packhouse construction in Guatemala and pre-production land development and blueberry plant cultivation in Peru.

Outlook

For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, the Company is providing the following industry outlooks that will drive performance:

Avocado industry volumes in the fiscal 2026 first quarter are expected to increase by approximately 10% versus the prior year period, driven by a larger Mexican crop in the current harvest season.

Pricing is expected to be lower on a year-over-year basis by approximately 25% compared to the $1.75 per pound average experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by higher supply conditions.

The blueberries harvest season in Peru will peak during the first quarter. The Company expects to see volume increases from owned farms resulting from new acreage in production, which should translate to higher revenue, as average sales prices are expected to be flat to slightly higher. Profitability will continue to be impacted by higher costs resulting from lower projected yields per hectare in the current harvest season.

For full year fiscal 2026, total capital expenditure is expected to be approximately $40 million.

[TITLE]Vehicle to Grid Market Set to Reach US$ 65.84 Billion by 2035 | Astute Analytica:
[TEXT]
Chicago, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global vehicle to grid market was valued at US$ 6.27 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach US$ 65.84 billion by 2035, growing at a CAGR of 26.50% between 2026 and 2035.

The year 2025 marks a definitive tipping point where global electric vehicle fleets, now approaching 40 million units, have transformed into essential grid assets. Such critical mass has effectively forced the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to evolve from experimental science projects into a scalable commercial necessity. Stakeholders have consequently shifted their focus from questioning technical feasibility to prioritizing operational revenue metrics. Utilities and fleet operators are actively deploying these virtual power plants to stabilize energy networks while simultaneously generating tangible cash flow. The conversation has moved beyond engineering pilots to hard unit economics.

Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/vehicle-to-grid-v2g-market

Maximizing revenue per kilowatt-hour now drives investment strategies across the sector, replacing earlier theoretical studies. Investors specifically focus on the proven capability of these aggregated assets to defer billions in infrastructure upgrades. Fleet operators, in turn, utilize the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to successfully convert depreciating vehicles into active profit centers. This transition creates a bifurcated value proposition where both grid stability and fleet profitability improve simultaneously through bidirectional integration. The sector currently stands at a juncture where integration creates immediate commercial viability for all participants.

Key Findings in the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Market

Market Forecast (2034) USD 65.84 billion CAGR 26.50% Largest Region (2025) North America (38.22%) By Vehicle Type Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (69.24%) By Charging Type Bidirectional Charging Type (60.10%) By Solution Hardware (69.25%) By Application Frequency Regulation (21.40%) By End User Commercial (33.84%) Top Drivers Rising intermittent renewable energy requires decentralized storage solutions.

Automotive OEMs actively forming aggregation partnerships for revenue generation.

Utilities deploying virtual power plants to manage peak loads. Top Trends Adoption of ISO 15118-20 standard for seamless interoperability.

Integration of AI for predictive energy trading and optimization.

Bundling of home solar, storage, and EV charging hardware. Top Challenges Lack of uniform interconnection standards across different utility regions.

Consumer anxiety regarding battery degradation from frequent discharging.

Complex certification processes for hardware to meet safety codes.

Mandatory ISO Standards Compel Hardware Makers To Adopt Interoperable Architectures

Mandatory implementation of ISO 15118-20 for new public chargers in Europe as of Summer 2025 has forced hardware manufacturers to ensure universal interoperability. These standards enable seamless "Plug & Charge" functionality, thereby eliminating the friction previously associated with manual authentication. Such protocols also facilitate the dynamic pricing communication required for real-time grid balancing. Regulatory mandates have effectively removed the fragmented technical barriers that previously stalled broader adoption within the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market.

Regional policy variances continue to shape deployment velocities differently across the globe, creating distinct pockets of opportunity. April 2025 saw Beijing and Shenzhen launch massive city-wide pilots explicitly integrating bidirectional charging into national renewable frameworks. North American states like California concurrently implemented interconnection reforms to drastically reduce approval times from months to weeks. These legislative actions provide the necessary regulatory certainty for the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to expand beyond pilot phases. Consequently, global manufacturers are aligning their supply chains to meet these harmonized requirements.

Commercial Fleets Leverage Revenue Stacking To Reduce Ownership Costs Significantly

Commercial fleets currently generate the most immediate financial returns through strategic revenue stacking, outpacing other segments. Data confirms that heavy-duty commercial vehicles now earn between USD 2,200 and USD 2,500 annually per unit by participating in frequency regulation markets. Fleet managers utilize the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to monetize idle time effectively, ensuring assets remain productive even when parked. Operational teams, therefore, no longer view vehicles solely as transport assets but as mobile energy storage units capable of substantial earnings.

Integration of bidirectional technology subsequently reduces the total cost of ownership by nearly 20% compared to standard electric fleets. Such savings often exceed the value of traditional government subsidies, making the technology attractive even without public funding. Financial directors increasingly prioritize these operational efficiencies to improve balance sheets and offset higher upfront vehicle costs. The Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market consequently offers a sustainable economic model that functions independently of external grant funding or temporary incentives, proving its long-term viability.

Smart Energy Management Slashes Peak Charges Driving Depot Profitability Upwards

Smart bidirectional charging strategies enable depots to cut peak power charges by up to 70% in high-demand zones. Facility managers leverage on-site batteries to flatten demand curves during expensive operational windows, thereby shielding the business from volatility. Avoiding punitive utility rates creates immediate savings that often outweigh direct revenue earned from grid services. The Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market thrives on these "behind-the-meter" optimizations because they require minimal external permissions compared to energy export schemes.

Depots control these energy assets directly to manage internal consumption patterns efficiently, ensuring operational continuity. Real-time load balancing ensures that high-power charging does not trigger excessive demand fees, preserving profit margins. Early adopters report seeing ROI immediately upon deployment through drastically reduced monthly utility bills. Operational independence drives rapid growth in the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market as fleets bypass complex interconnection procedures associated with exporting power to the main grid.

School Bus Predictability Accelerates ROI Payback Encouraging Unsubsidized Electrification Adoption

Electric School Buses represent the ideal asset class for bidirectional integration due to large 100kWh batteries and highly predictable downtime schedules. Analysis of 2025 pilots indicates that each bus earns approximately USD 3,000 per year through grid services during idle periods. The consistent availability of these vehicles allows for aggressive participation in capacity markets without compromising student transport. School districts subsequently leverage the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to transform student transportation into a revenue-generating utility service.

V2G revenue streams significantly alter the procurement logic for educational institutions by offsetting high capital costs. Earnings from grid services reduce the ROI payback period for electric buses by 2 to 3 years, making the investment far more attractive. Unsubsidized electrification becomes financially viable as the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market matures and monetizes these assets. Districts effectively utilize buses as stationary storage during summer months to maximize income, ensuring the fleet pays for itself year-round.

Distributed Storage Assets Defer Capital Expenditure Forcing Utility Business Model Evolution

Grid operators avoid constructing new power plants by utilizing distributed EV batteries as virtual buffers against demand spikes. A pivotal Dutch study estimates avoided grid reinforcement costs will reach USD 1.6 billion between 2025 and 2030 through widespread V2G adoption. Widespread utilization of these assets stabilizes the network against renewable energy fluctuations, reducing the need for peaker plants. Utilities increasingly rely on the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to manage peak loads without heavy infrastructure investment.

Deferring physical upgrades saves billions in capital expenditures (CAPEX) regarding substations and transformers, improving utility margins. Utility executives now design tariffs specifically to unlock these distributed storage resources and encourage customer participation. The macro-economic case compels power companies to offer incentives that align consumer behavior with grid needs. Strategic integration of the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market proves essential for maintaining grid reliability during the rapid energy transition.

Intelligent Algorithms Mitigate Degradation Risks Validating Long Term Asset Viability

Intelligent charging algorithms mitigate battery health concerns by keeping state-of-charge in optimal mid-ranges. Research from 2025 confirms that controlled V2G cycling increases degradation by only 9% to 14% over ten years. Economic compensation covers these minor wear costs five times over, making the trade-off highly profitable for owners. Battery longevity actually improves in some cases compared to vehicles left sitting at 100% charge, debunking earlier myths. The Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market validates that smart management preserves asset value while generating income.

Hardware preferences are shifting as mass-market vehicles adopt AC bidirectional solutions to lower costs for consumers. Commercial depots continue to favor DC wallboxes to ensure strict grid code compliance and higher power flows. Software platforms ensure that every kilowatt discharged delivers maximum value with minimum impact on battery health. Technology advancements reinforce the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market as a safe and profitable endeavor for asset owners concerned

[TITLE]AI-driven data centres to lift demand for gensets in India: Cummins:
[TEXT]
Engine and genset manufacturer Cummins Group is betting big on India’s data centre boom, with the 106-year-old US company expecting the country to emerge as one of the world’s fastest-growing data centre markets, on par with the US, China and Europe.Shveta Arya, Cummins Group's India region leader, said India was moving beyond data storage to power-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, increasing demand for reliable backup power.“By nature, data centres – whether they store data or process it – require 99.99% uptime. Backup power is critical, and that is where we come in,” Arya told ET.The AI boom remains favourable for Cummins and its generator sets, she added.Arya said India has a significant opportunity to convert data into digital assets. “We believe India is moving towards that phase, where both global and domestic players will train AI models locally and unlock the value of India’s data by digitising and analysing it.”Despite the strong demand outlook, Arya said challenges remain for data centre development in India. According to her, one of the biggest bottlenecks is site readiness. “Finding the right site, preparing it and securing the necessary approvals takes time,” she said, adding that the challenge is not technological in nature.In 2024-25, Cummins India sold over 25,000 generator sets and delivered more than 7,000 MW of power to customers across the country, according to its annual report.The company said demand is being driven by sectors that require uninterrupted, high-reliability power, with data centres, healthcare, commercial real estate, manufacturing and infrastructure emerging as key focus areas.Equipment manufactured in India is exported to markets across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, the company said.Beyond large data centres, Cummins is also targeting demand from quick commerce and commercial infrastructure.The company’s Indian operations, headquartered in Pune, recently launched an 82.5 kVA genset designed for quick commerce warehouses , commercial establishments, infrastructure projects, and construction sites.“When platforms such as Zepto, Swiggy or Zomato set up warehouses or cold storage facilities, they need reliable backup power. This genset is rightly sized for such warehouses,” Arya said.She added that in warehouse applications, return on investment is a key consideration. Customers want to maximise space for storage rather than allocate it to large gensets. “By reducing footprint and fuel consumption, we aim to lower operating costs for customers,” she said.Arya said hydrogen may be the fuel of the future, but felt the transition may not happen anytime soon. “It is not a light-switch transition. You cannot move from diesel to hydrogen overnight,” she said, adding that the shift could take 30 to 40 years.She said global research on hydrogen has also slowed due to limited collaboration. “When countries work together, progress is faster. Right now, that is not happening enough,” Arya said.Cummins already has a hydrogen internal combustion engine ready and expects it to be available commercially by around March 2027. “Customers were very interested a few years ago, but today they are cautious because hydrogen production in India has not scaled up,” she said.Arya said hydrogen has long-term potential for India as it can be produced locally and reduce dependence on imports. If made using renewable energy such as solar power, it can also be a zero-carbon fuel. However, hydrogen remains expensive and difficult to store and transport.Cummins India, a listed arm of Cummins Group, reported a strong performance for the September 2025 quarter with a 41.3% rise in net profit to Rs 637 crore. The company's shares closed at Rs 4,385 apiece on the NSE on Thursday.

[TITLE]TeraWulf and Fluidstack Announce Successful Pricing of Project Financing for 168 MW HPC Compute Joint Venture:
[TEXT]
EASTON, Md., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TeraWulf Inc. (Nasdaq: WULF) (“TeraWulf” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of vertically integrated, low-carbon digital infrastructure, today announced the successful pricing of project-level financing for their previously disclosed 168 MW high-performance computing (HPC) joint venture at the Abernathy, Texas campus.

The financing supports the development of a next-generation, liquid-cooled AI data center delivering up to 240 MW of gross power capacity (168 MW of critical IT load) under a long-term hosting structure with investment-grade credit support. The financing benefits from long-term credit enhancement provided through Fluidstack’s platform by a leading global hyperscale partner, materially strengthening the project’s credit profile and supporting efficient capital formation.

Proceeds will be used to fund construction, establish required reserves, and complete delivery of the facility, which remains on track for commissioning in the second half of 2026.

A Scalable Partnership Positioned for Sustained HPC Demand

The Abernathy project reflects the continued evolution of the TeraWulf–Fluidstack partnership, built on repeatable site design, disciplined capital formation, and efficient delivery of large-scale AI infrastructure. Together, the parties bring deep experience across development, financing, construction, and operations – enabling rapid deployment of capacity at scale.

Demand for high-performance HPC compute continues to grow at a pace that requires multiple sourcing paths and diverse infrastructure partners. Fluidstack’s platform serves a broad and expanding customer base, and capacity procurement is driven by a combination of time-to-market, total cost, reliability, and execution certainty. Within this environment, the Abernathy campus is positioned as a highly competitive solution given its scale, power availability, and advanced design.

In addition to the initial 168 MW phase, the joint venture retains the ability to expand capacity beyond the initial build, leveraging existing transmission, land, and development infrastructure to support incremental, high-density deployments as market demand continues to scale.

Early Leadership, Improving Economics

TeraWulf and Fluidstack have been early leaders in structuring and financing AI compute infrastructure, including executing one of the first large-scale transactions where the infrastructure owner funded the majority of development capital, establishing an early strategic relationship between the parties, and completing one of the first project financings of its kind in the AI colocation market.

As AI demand has accelerated and available capacity has tightened, market terms have continued to improve, particularly for owners with scalable sites and execution-ready platforms. The Company expects to deploy an incremental 250 MW – 500 MW of HPC capacity annually and has already secured more than 500 MW to date. With a substantial portion of its pipeline still available for contracting, the Company views the current market environment as increasingly favorable.

Leadership Commentary

“This financing represents another important step in scaling a platform that was designed from the outset to grow,” said Paul Prager, Chief Executive Officer of TeraWulf. “We focused early on building sites, relationships, and structures that could adapt as the AI market evolved. Today’s environment validates that approach.”

“Fluidstack is pleased to build on its existing partnership with TeraWulf through this financing for our Abernathy project," said Gary Wu, CEO and Co-Founder of Fluidstack. "This partnership strengthens our shared ambition to shape and deliver more next-generation capacity in our next joint venture development."

[TITLE]Rocket maker receives largest single job incentive award in Colorado history:
[TEXT]
The Colorado Economic Development Commission on Thursday approved its largest single incentive awards ever, extending $35.2 million in state tax credits to a rapidly growing developer and producer of solid rocket motors and hypersonic propulsion systems, matching the description of a company called Ursa Major.

In line with the practice of cloaking the names of applicants, the award was made to Project Ladybug. The Job Growth Incentive Tax Credits are conditioned on the unnamed company creating up to 1,850 jobs at an average annual wage of $128,108 over the next eight years.

Project Ladybug is a local aerospace company with 311 employees, including 255 in Colorado, which matches the headcount of Berthoud-based Ursa Major. The company told the state it was considering expanding in Mississippi, California and Ohio, a state where Ursa Major has a manufacturing plant. It appears the company will locate its expanded headquarters in Broomfield County.

The most telling clue is that the company in question received an Advanced Industries program award of $250,000 in 2017 from the state. That matches Ursa Major to a T.

Ursa Major raised $100 million in equity and $50 million in debt commitments in a Series E round that closed on Nov. 18, and now has an estimated value of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, according to CB Insights. That would make it a “unicorn” like SpaceX, just a lot smaller. The company has also disclosed that it has secured $115 million in contracts this year from commercial and defense industry customers.

Among the jobs it expects to add are roles in human resources, legal, finance, IT, market and compliance, as well as in production and research and development. Ursa Major broke ground on a new 400-acre solid rocket motor test site in Weld County on Sept. 10. That facility will allow it to design, build and test large solid rocket motor systems more efficiently.

“This facility represents a major step forward in our ability to deliver qualified SRMs that are scalable, flexible, and ready to meet the evolving threat environment,” said Dan Jablonsky, CEO of Ursa Major, in a release. “It’s a clear demonstration of our commitment and ability to rapidly advance and expand the American-made solid rocket motor industrial base that the country needs, ensuring warfighters will have the quality and quantity of SRMs needed to meet mission demands.”

The company is also making advances in liquid engine designs for hypersonic missiles, an emerging weapons system where the U.S. lags China and Russia. Those faster missiles can evade defense systems more easily and hit their targets more quickly, which is why the Department of Defense is pushing hard to close the gap.

Ursa Major’s Hadley H13 engine has been tested at sustained Mach 5+ hypersonic speeds and the company is also developing the Draper, a storable liquid engine with hypersonic applications.

Joe Laurienti, a former engineer at Blue Origin and SpaceX, founded Ursa Major Technologies in 2015. The company has grown to be an important player in the Front Range’s push to be recognized as “Aerospace Alley” or the next Silicon Valley of defense and aerospace.

Growing aerospace and defense companies and jobs is a priority for state economic development efforts. But the state tax credits offered are only useful when companies have profits to offset them. That often isn’t the case with startups and rapidly growing companies.

To boost the value of the incentives, state legislators in 2023 approved the CHIPS Refundable Tax Credits program that allows the state to pay out up to 80% of any credits not used to offset taxes for companies in advanced industries.

The commission on Thursday approved making $8 million in credits refundable to the company from this fiscal year’s allocation of $15 million per year under the program. It also agreed to earmark another $15 million from the next round of funding.

The credits awarded, if they are all claimed, will work out to a little more than $19,000 per job created.
