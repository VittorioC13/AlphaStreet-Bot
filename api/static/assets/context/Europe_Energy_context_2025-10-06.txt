[TITLE]Nayara Energy Adapts to EU Sanctions With Rupee Oil Payments:
[TEXT]
Nayara Energy, the Indian refiner that was slapped with EU sanctions because of its partial ownership by Rosneft, has started to recover from the blow, turning to payments in rupees for the oil it sources from the Russian company.

Bloomberg reported that Nayara had sought help from the Indian government and was currently working with local banks, including the State Bank of India, to pay for its crude oil purchases in local currency, according to unnamed sources.

Nayara Energy accounts for some 8% of India’s total refining capacity. It operates a 400,000-bpd refinery in Vadinar, which is the second-largest in the country. The facility is 49% owned by Russia’s Rosneft. Currently, the Vadinar facility is operating at 75% of capacity, and the level is rising, one of the Bloomberg sources told the publication.

The European Union included Nayara Energy in its 18th sanction package against Russia, announced in July. The sanctions disrupted the refinery’s operations, stranding tankers carrying fuels produced at the refinery en route to their destinations and prompting cancellations of purchase orders for the facility. That’s despite the fact that Nayara Energy was not really exporting any fuels to the European Union. Its main market in Europe was the UK, which has not adopted special sanctions against the company.

Meanwhile, Saudi Aramco and Iraq’s state oil marketing company SOMO stopped selling crude oil to the Nayara Energy refinery following the approval of the EU’s 18th sanction package. As a result, the refinery has boosted its intake of Russian Urals.

Also as a result of the sanctions, Nayara Energy has increased its focus on the domestic market. The company supplies more than 6,500 fuel stations in India, per Bloomberg, and has started selling more to a fellow refiner, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Nayara Energy has started loading more crude into floating storage and using tankers under Western sanctions to export its fuels.

[TITLE]Ticker: Trump administration cuts nearly $8B in clean energy projects in states that backed Harris:
[TEXT]
The Trump administration has announced the cancellation of $7.6 billion intended for clean energy projects across 16 states. Each of those are states where both senators voted against the Republican bill to keep the federal government open.

The Energy Department said in a statement that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. The cuts likely will affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects and more.

The announcement came after the Republican funding bill couldn’t muster enough votes to pass in the Senate, initiating a federal government shutdown. The Trump administration says the projects do not align with national energy needs, while critics argue the move is politically motivated and could raise energy costs and threaten thousands of jobs.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

Hungary clings to Russian oil and gas as EU and NATO push to cut supplies

Hungary remains firm in maintaining its supplies of Russian oil and gas, even as the European Union accelerates efforts to cut Russian energy imports. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán argues what he calls cheap Russian energy is crucial for Hungary’s economy and claims switching sources could cause an economic collapse.

Critics dismiss the idea that dropping Russian energy is unachievable. They point to other landlocked countries like the Czech Republic that already have stopped Russian oil imports. Some energy experts say the Hungarian leader’s commitment to Russian energy is more about politics than pipelines.

[TITLE]Balancing act: Can Turkey do without Russian energy? – DW – 10:
[TEXT]
Both the US and G7 nations have asked Turkey to stop buying Russian oil and gas. However, Turkey remains dependent on Russia for its energy and is pursuing a different strategy altogether.

The scene in the Oval Office as US President Donald Trump met Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan was noteworthy. Trump was effusive as he lavished praise on Erdogan in front of assembled journalists.

"It's a pleasure to be with President Erdoğan of Turkey," Trump said, "and we've been friends for a long time … he's a highly respected man. He's respected very much in his country and all throughout Europe."

He's doing an "amazing job," Trump added.

However all the sweeteners did come with a demand: Turkey should stop buying oil and gas from Russia.

There has also been increased pressure from the Group of Seven, or G7, nations around this topic.

Following a virtual meeting last week, finance ministers of the seven leading industrialized nations — Germany, the UK, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and the US — said they would take steps to increase pressure on Russia by targeting countries that are continuing to increase purchases of Russian oil or countries that are facilitating circumvention of energy sanctions.

Over half of oil imports from Russia

So far though Turkey hasn't responded to either Trump's requests or to the G7 statement. Then again maybe this shouldn't be surprising as Turkey is hugely dependent on Russia for its energy supplies.

According to Turkey's Energy Market Regulatory Authority, or EPDK, 66% of Turkish oil imports came from Russia last year. According to Turkish energy expert, Necdet Pamir, a year earlier, the number was 68%. At the end of 2022, it had been 41%.

Last year, Turkey also sourced 41% of its natural gas imports from Russia.

The high percentages are a direct consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Under sanctions from the European Union, Russia has been selling its oil at lower prices. Stopping Russian oil imports would not only jeopardize Turkey's energy security, it would also negate the price advantages Turkey is currently benefitting from.

Immediately after the Trump-Erdogan meeting, the Kremlin spoke out. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian gas pipelines to Turkey were operating at full capacity.

"We are continuing our trade and economic cooperation with the Republic of Turkey," Peskov said. "It is a sovereign state that decides for itself in which areas to cooperate with us. If certain types of trade in certain goods are considered profitable by the Turkish side, then it will continue to buy them."

A different strategy for Turkey

In fact, observers do not expect Turkey to stop buying Russian energy in the future. Instead the Turkish are quietly pursuing a different strategy: diversification.

During Erdogan's recent visit to the US, BOTAS, the state-owned company responsible for Turkey's oil and gas infrastructure and gas trade, announced two long-term contracts that would expand its sources of natural gas.

One was with US company Mercuria for a total of 70 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas, to run for 20 years, starting 2026. The other was with Australian firm Woodside Energy, for 5.8 billion cubic meters of LNG.

The Turkish government has been making significant efforts recently to diversify its energy sources in order to ensure energy security, notes Kadri Tastan, a senior non-resident fellow with the German Marshall Fund's Brussels office. At the same time it's also been promoting domestic energy sources and renewables.

A report by the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects indicated that in 2022, fossil fuels still made up around 84% of Turkey's energy market while renewable energies sit at around 16%.

BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) — Mysterious drone flights over the airspace of European Union member countries in recent weeks have alarmed the public and elected officials.

Intrusions into NATO’s airspace, some of them blamed on Russia, reached an unprecedented scale last month. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO’s response, which raised questions

[TITLE]Trump's economic plans called for more oil drilling and lower gas prices. He's only getting the latter.:
[TEXT]
As President Trump began his second term, he proclaimed in his inauguration speech that America would "drill, baby, drill," promising a boom in drilling and lower prices at the pump.

Nine months in, Trump may only be getting the "lower prices" part.

Production activity in the US oil and gas sector fell throughout the third quarter, according to data released late last month by the Federal Reserve of Dallas, marking the second quarter in a row of contraction in the sector. Oil prices have done much the same.

Oil and gas industry participants interviewed in the Dallas Fed's survey said conditions are getting worse.

Futures on Brent crude (BZ=F), the global benchmark for oil, are down more than 13.5% on the year, while futures on West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F), the US benchmark, are down more than 14.5%. The US's Energy Information Administration only expects that trend to continue, forecasting that US oil production will decline by

[TITLE]Power Beneath the Sands: The Investment Approaches of the US and China in Iraq:
[TEXT]
Within the context of the geopolitical competition between the US and China, Iraq serves as a vital battleground. Not only does its location connect Iranian, Turkish and Gulf States spheres of influence, but its vast oil reserves and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) — which altogether control nearly 80% of the world’s oil reserves — make the country an economic prize within the multipolar battleground.

While renewable energy is rapidly growing, Iraq’s energy market influence is not waning anytime soon. Iraq’s relative stability following its conflict against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) provides an opportunity for Chinese and American companies to invest in reconstruction and development efforts, with significant political influence likely to follow.

A tumultuous past

Since the Iraqi government’s declared victory over ISIS in December 2017, both the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Iraqi Federal Government in Baghdad have engaged in targeted, succinct efforts to attract investment. One such example is the Localization Fund, which Baghdad formed in October 2024 as a part of an agreement with Egypt-based Elsewedy Electric to attract foreign investment in strategic projects in nonpetroleum industries to diversify its portfolio.

The relatively recent return to stability in Iraq has, until recently, kept most major investments at bay, with fears circulating of new violence. Nevertheless, instability in Iraq has continued, particularly from Iran-backed Shi’a militant groups, a possible resurgence from ISIS and regime change in Syria, in addition to wider regional instability since October 2023.

Confluence of investment models

The American and Chinese models of investment differ significantly; yet, Iraq has shown potential to benefit from both models, thereby maximizing its development and reconstruction potential. From a governance perspective, US investment emphasizes transparency, regulatory reform and civil society engagement, whereas China prioritizes expediency and delivers large-scale infrastructure projects through state-directed capital with minimal political conditions, a point often mentioned in Chinese government publications.

Economically, American approaches often involve public-private partnerships and market liberalization, while Chinese investment is typically channeled through state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and concessional loans, seen especially in Iraqi flagship oil-for-infrastructure agreements (despite speculation that some agreements have been practically abandoned).

The American playbook: security and reform, then investment

Since the 2003 invasion, the US has had a multi-pronged approach to involvement in Iraq. Firstly, it established military bases to support the new transition government and to provide support to its counterterrorism mission. Secondly, the US has heavily relied on both development institutions and US government organizations, such as the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which provided reconstruction support and aid via the Iraq Rapid Assistance Program (IRAP) to provide rapid relief operations to areas of need. The American playbook also included support for International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans that funded reconstruction while encouraging monetary reforms.

By the time of the victory over ISIS, American firms began stepping up investment projects in the country, which further encouraged business transparency, regulatory reform and civil society engagement. American firms such as Baker Hughes and GE Power began significantly investing in Iraq’s energy grid.

In December 2020, GE Energy completed the overhaul of the Al Qudus Power Plant, delivering up to 125 megawatts of power to Iraq’s national power grid. GE also completed the upgrade of several power plants through an agreement with the Ministry of Electricity to enhance the performance and output of 46 gas turbines across 12 power plants. The support to Iraq’s power grid comes at a significant time. According to a Director at RASEP, a Baghdad-based energy company, Iraq is enduring a power supply shortage of 12 hours per day during the summer.

American firms have also been involved in reconstruction efforts, especially in the petroleum sector. For example, a plethora of American firms are currently working with RASEP to develop the Nahr Bin Umar field in Southern Iraq, which Forbes stated could become “one of the world’s largest oil and gas fields.”

Upon completion, the oilfield is expected to yield 300,000 barrels per day and 700 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. Unlike previously, American firms — through their coordination with RASEP — have empowered local Iraqi firms to benefit from this reconstruction too.

Overall, the US development strategy in Iraq has relied on establishing business-friendly environments through security and fiscal reform to facilitate private investment. Private investment’s role in modernizing Iraq only kicked into high gear once security returned to the country, and not sooner. China’s strategy, on the other hand, has been far more flexible.

The Chinese strategy: infrastructure without interference

China, which has not hesitated to invest in unstable countries, has seen Iraq as a golden opportunity for access to petroleum and strategic infrastructure in the Middle East. So far, Iraq has received over $10 billion in investments from Chinese companies through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since 2015, ranking it as the fourth-largest recipient among countries. China, being Iraq’s top export destination every year from 2019 to 2023 — 99.3% of which was crude petroleum — further highlights the countries’ economic relationship.

Unlike US private investment, Chinese investment in Iraq was not hindered by the country’s security situation. For example, the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) bought some of the first oil licenses issued to foreign companies after the 2003 invasion.

In November 2008, CNPC also won a $3.5 billion contract to develop the Al-Ahdab field. By 2014, CNPC was the largest foreign investor in Iraq. China has also invested in roads, telecommunications and education.

Huawei, China’s largest telecommunications SOE, has also actively invested in Iraq, with projects like telecommunications infrastructure modernization and solar power project proposals underway. Huawei has even invested in the Iraqi workforce through investments in education at universities in both the Iraqi Federal Government and the Kurdistan Regional Government.

Investment has only increased since then. In 2019, Baghdad signed a 20-year, $10 billion infrastructure-for-oil deal, which stipulated that Iraq would export 100,000 barrels a day to China in exchange for infrastructure investments. These deals have continued, with Baghdad signing another contract in 2021 with China to finance 1,000 schools in exchange for petroleum. S&P Global estimates that Chinese companies operate 7.27% of Iraq’s oil and gas development projects, the largest slice of any country besides Iraq; American companies own less than 2%.

Finally, China has positioned its approach as distinct from the US, emphasizing its noninterference in Iraq’s internal affairs. Chinese officials consistently highlight their commitment to “safeguarding national sovereignty” and “territorial integrity,” a core message frequently reiterated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This stance is framed as a strategic advantage, potentially giving China an edge over the US in securing investment opportunities in Iraq.

Looking forward: decisions to be made

While the models differ, Iraq still has the potential to benefit from both simultaneously by leveraging China’s rapid infrastructure delivery for critical needs — such as roads, energy and housing — while using American partnerships to strengthen institutional capacity, promote entrepreneurship and improve transparency.

To do so, the government must develop a clear national investment strategy that aligns short-term projects with long-term development goals, strengthens regulatory oversight and diversifies financing sources. Iraq should also legally require knowledge transfer for every project and create a commission specifically designed for corruption in foreign-funded projects under the Commission of Integrity.

Establishing a sovereign wealth fund would also promote economic stability and transparency, create better social services for Iraqi civilians and increase national wealth from oil revenue for future generations of Iraqi citizens.

If successful, Iraq’s strategy may serve as a model to other nations on how to navigate the US–China power competition in a “win-win” manner. Still, China’s lack of a contentious military history in the country, a contrast to the US, is a big advantage. This perception will ultimately affect how the Iraqi government navigates the US–China power competition and decides which investment model delivers sustainable reconstruction and development that the Iraqis can trust.

Despite significant investment, some Wall Street analysts are concerned

[TITLE]Wall Street Warns of Nuclear Tech Bubble:
[TEXT]
Billions of dollars are flowing into cutting-edge nuclear technologies, from nuclear fusion experiments to small modular reactors and microreactors that backers say will catalyze a global nuclear power renaissance. But after years of buzz and successful funding rounds, these Wall Street darlings have yet to send any of their promised carbon-free energy to the grid.

In 2024, investments in advanced nuclear companies from both private equity and venture capital hit an all time high. According to S&P Global, last year's investments “surpassed the total deal value of the past 15 years combined.” The push for next-gen nuclear energy has accelerated on the back of growing energy demand projections driven by the proliferation of AI integration.

“The single biggest driver in the paradigm shift we're seeing right now in the power sector comes down to data centers,” Jackson Morris, director of state power sector policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, was recently quoted by Marketplace. “Load growth for electricity that we had already forecasted is now coming 10 years sooner and five times as fast because of data centers and these facilities largely being built by the big hyper scalers like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.”

In addition to the AI boost, nuclear energy startups have benefitted enormously from the political upheaval currently ensnaring renewable energy technologies. For now, nuclear power remains one of very few carbon-free energy sources with broad bipartisan support, both in the United States and abroad. In the past few months, nuclear holdouts in Europe have started to loosen nuclear restrictions and publicly adopt a more pro-nuclear stance, and the United States and the United Kingdom unveiled a new nuclear partnership. An, just this week, United States Energy Secretary Chris Wright “cast a renewed vote of confidence in cutting-edge nuclear power technology this week” according to reporting from Semafor.

However, this confidence is being undercut by some Wall Street analysts, who smell a bubble in the making. Semafor reports that “in general, the hysteria around power demand is pushing the valuations of many newly public energy startups beyond what they will realistically be able to deliver.” Dimple Gosai, head of U.S. clean tech equity research at Bank of America, told the news outlet that “the disconnect between fundamentals and valuation is too wide to ignore.”

Oklo, a small modular reactor (SMR) startup backed by AI bigwig Sam Altman, may prove to be such a cautionary tale. While the company’s share values have fared well since its 2024 IPO, the Bank of America downgraded its rating from “buy” to “neutral” just this week. It also downgraded NuScale, another SMR startup, NuScale, from “neutral” to “underperform.”
