[TITLE]Here's the inflation breakdown for September 2025 — in one chart:
[TEXT]

Inflation edged higher in September amid a jump in gasoline prices and other essentials such as electricity, while President Donald Trump's tariffs put pressure on prices for physical goods such as clothing and furniture, economists said. The consumer price index, a key inflation barometer, rose 3% in September from a year earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. That's an increase from 2.9% in August but below economists' expectations. "Core" commodities — which exclude volatile food and energy prices — also rose 3% in September from a year earlier. "Inflation is uncomfortably high and is set to accelerate further in the coming months," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's. The CPI tracks how quickly prices rise or fall for a basket of consumer goods and services, from coffee and bananas to club memberships and concert tickets. The ongoing government shutdown delayed the release of CPI data to Friday from Oct. 15. Without any other economic data, the report provides a look at the state of the U.S. economy ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting. The CPI release also enabled the Social Security Administration to announce the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment, which affects

[TITLE]US firms grapple with economic divide as lower income struggles mount:
[TEXT]
By Juveria Tabassum and Niket Nishant

(Reuters) -U.S. companies across industries are feeling the squeeze from the deepening split between lower-income and affluent consumers as tariffs pile on more uncertainty.

Executives at bellwethers such as Coca-Cola, along with toymakers, hoteliers and financial-service providers have noted how lower-income households are canceling or delaying purchases, exposing a hidden belt-tightening even as affluent consumers keep U.S. spending afloat.

"There is bifurcation in the consumer behavior," Andre Schulten, CFO at consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, said Friday, adding that while financially secure consumers are buying larger pack sizes, those living paycheck to paycheck are seeking out deals as inflation remains above the U.S. Federal Reserve's preferred 2% target.

While some estimates have shown steady headline spending, consumer sentiment surveys show pessimism over future conditions and inflation, which is currently rising at a 3% rate, according to federal data.

Nearly two-thirds of customers, up from 59% last year, plan to wait until Thanksgiving weekend for most of their holiday shopping to take advantage of discounts, according to a National Retail Federation survey.

Brad Beckham, CEO of O'Reilly Automotive, said some customers were delaying major repairs even as the replacement auto-parts retailer raised its annual revenue target.

Some companies, like Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola, are experimenting with smaller-sized products aimed at lower-income consumers. Coca-Cola introduced mini single-serve cans of some of its sodas in U.S. convenience stores earlier this month.

"Our system in the U.S. is adapting to both the higher and the lower end, and both offer opportunities and challenges. At the lower end, affordability and value are really important," Coca-Cola's CFO John Murphy told Reuters.

Meanwhile, Target, which predominantly stocks non-essential products that lower-income consumers have steered clear of, is cutting

Over 1 million people in Massachusetts will probably be left without food because of the government shutdown in the United States, according to Gov. Maura Healey. If things do not get better before November 1, 2025, and federal money for food stamps remains frozen, more than a million people in the US state will end up bearing the brunt of the funding lapse.Besides Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland, New York, and Texas are also on the verge of losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Massachusetts is one of the states across America that could lose the benefits starting next Saturday (November 1, 2025).SNAP provides benefits to low-income families so they can buy groceries. It includes benefits for adults who might otherwise face hunger and malnutrition. These benefits were earlier known as food stamps. SNAP benefits include monthly funds on an EBT card to buy food. More fruits and vegetables when you use your EBT card at participating HIP farms, SNAP Path to Work free education and training opportunities, Free nutrition education classes and resources, Connections to other kinds of help, like utility discounts, free school meals, and discounted admissions to many Commonwealth museums and cultural institutions via EBT Card to CultureThe US Department of Agriculture oversees the federal food stamps program. The department stated that the lapse in appropriations because of the shutdown will leave them with "insufficient funds" to pay full benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in November, according to CBS News.Both the USDA and the White House have refused to comment on the looming issue. According to the Greater Boston Food Bank, one in three residents in Massachusetts faced food insecurity in 2024.On normal days, SNAP beneficiaries receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use to buy produce, meat, dairy, and other household food staples, according to CBS News. Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP.While speaking on the prevailing situation, Governor Healey stated that Massachusetts doesn't have the ability to backfill those benefits. She said that it is because state funding can't match the amount of federal funding the state gets for SNAP."Two hundred forty million dollars a month is what the state receives, its residents receive from the federal government for these benefits, so you can't begin to make this up," said Healey, as quoted by CBS News.While speaking at a news conference on Friday (October 24, 2025) in Roxbury, Healey said her administration is partnering with local food banks and organizations, including Project Bread and the United Way, to help families. They announced the creation of the United Response Fund, hoping to generate donations."Those who have the means, this is the time to step up," Healey said. She further stated that she is planning to make a donation herself. The Massachusetts governor is also calling on President Trump to release contingency funds to keep SNAP going while the government is shut down. She asserted that children, the elderly, and the disabled will be impacted the greatest.

[TITLE]Outdoor Voices founder Ty Haney accused of defrauding investors in $3M energy drink deal:
[TEXT]
Ty Haney, the Boulder businesswoman behind the athletic apparel startup Outdoor Voices, is being accused of defrauding local investors in her energy drink brand after they injected $3 million into the fledgling company and reportedly saved it from insolvency.

Haney, 37, launched Outdoor Voices in 2013. A startup darling, it raised $57 million and was valued at $110 million in 2018. Then it imploded, forcing Haney out in 2020 and closing all 16 of its stores. A venture capital firm bought it last year and brought Haney back.

Meanwhile, the entrepreneur has launched other companies: Try Your Best, a rewards program for consumers who engage with brands, and Joggy energy drinks. The latter was valued at $8 million and had an 850-store deal with Target by late 2024, according to a lawsuit.

“Haney then approached and met with Dustin Simantob of Sinco Inc. to help raise the additional capital needed to complete the Target order and to keep Joggy afloat,” the Oct. 14 lawsuit states. “Haney communicated that Joggy needed $100,000 to fulfill the Target order.”

Sinco, a Boulder-based investment firm, is best known for buying an abandoned elementary school in the 1970s and turning it into the Highland City Club, an exclusive business and social club. Sinco’s CEO is Sina Simantob, an outspoken entrepreneur and Dustin’s father.

Sina Simantob says he met with Haney in January and agreed to make “an emergency investment in the fledgling company to help save it,” including by adding product lines. In exchange, Sinco was to receive a 20% stake in the company. Haney would keep 50% of Joggy, other investors would receive 20%, and 10% would be set aside for employees.

Their agreement was verbal at first and then, in late February, reduced to a term sheet that was nonbinding, Simantob acknowledges in the lawsuit that he and others filed last week.

The businessman says he effectively ran Joggy in the first half of this year, raising $3 million in funding; fulfilling the Target order; hiring a chief operating officer and, when Haney objected to that person, hiring a second; collecting $400,000 in accounts payable; and settling disputes.

“Sinco invested heavily based upon Haney’s false representations and false promises that Sinco would share in Joggy’s future success,” according to the lawsuit, which recalls Simantob telling a business associate on April 24 that his goal was to see Joggy turn into a billion-dollar company within the next five years and that he was “living and breathing Joggy.”

On June 4, Simantob texted Haney a proposal for turning the nonbinding term sheet into a formal, written agreement. Haney texted back, “Beautiful,” according to the lawsuit.

However, “the next day, Haney emailed a lengthy document proposing to restructure Joggy’s agreement with Sinco and increase her percentage of ownership while significantly reducing Sinco’s … equity from 20% to 3%,” Sinco and Simantob allege in their complaint.

When Simantob suggested that he and others at least be allowed to recoup their investments, Haney allegedly rejected that idea as well. So the investors are suing her and Joggy for securities fraud, misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, breach of contract and more.

“Haney and Joggy intentionally or recklessly engaged in this fraudulent conduct in connection with the offer, sale or purchase of a security,” according to their lawsuit, filed in Boulder.

Haney did not answer BusinessDen’s emails requesting a response to those allegations.

The other investors are David Chamberlin of Boulder, who reportedly gave $200,000; Susan Routt of Boulder ($75,000); and a California company that contributed $50,000. Their lawyers are Rohn Robbins, Doug Stevens and Justin Miller at Caplan & Earnest in Boulder.

[TITLE]Trump puts China on notice with 155% tariff threat - is a November market crash coming?:
[TEXT]
Live Events

Consumer Goods and Retailers: These companies face direct price increases on imported products such as electronics, apparel, footwear, and household items. Importers often have slimmer margins and pass cost increases to consumers, driving retail price hikes. Apparel, footwear, and textiles are especially vulnerable, with price increases in the range of 20-40% historically observed under high tariffs.

Technology and Electronics: Many tech products and components are sourced from China, including semiconductors and rare earth minerals. Tariffs raise costs for manufacturers and suppliers, squeezing margins and raising prices of devices and electronics.

Automotive and Aerospace: These industries rely on complex global supply chains with many parts sourced from China. High tariffs lead to increased production costs, delayed supply chains, and disrupt manufacturing schedules. Components and raw materials will see price hikes, impacting finished vehicles and aircraft prices.

Metals and Machinery: Steel, aluminum, copper, and machinery sectors face high tariffs, affecting costs for construction, manufacturing, and defense industries. Pricing pressures escalate as imports become more expensive.

Agriculture and Food Processing: Some agricultural inputs, processing equipment, and packaging materials come from China. Tariffs translate into higher costs for farmers and food producers, with potential consumer price increases.

Why is Trump threatening 155% tariffs on China?

How are US markets reacting to the tariff threat?

What is China doing in response to Trump’s tariffs?

What could be the economic impact of the tariffs?

Could these tariffs trigger a market crash in November?

President Donald Trump has once again sent shockwaves through global markets by threatening to impose astarting. The announcement has sparked intense debate across Wall Street, Beijing, and beyond, raising fears of ajust weeks before the year’s end.In a fiery statement from the White House,, declaring that unless a new trade deal is reached, the US will respond with its “toughest economic measures yet.” This latest move underscores Trump’s long-standing belief that thewith China — a message that resonates with his voter base but rattles investors.The, which could impact hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of goods, immediately triggered a. Thetumbled nearly, while theandalso slumped as traders weighed the risk of escalating tensions between the world’s two largest economies.Analysts say awould be one of the harshest trade penalties ever imposed on a major trading partner. It could drive up costs for American businesses, increase consumer prices, and disruptthat are already strained from years of geopolitical uncertainty.China, for its part, has begun preparing countermeasures. Beijing officials hinted aton, a critical component in electric vehicles and defense technologies — signaling that they won’t back down easily.Meanwhile,are caught in the crossfire. Companies such ascould face higher production costs and supply delays, further adding pressure to an already fragile market.A 155% tariff on Chinese imports would significantly increase the cost of goods coming into the U.S. from China, which would likely lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. Importers and retailers facing much higher input costs would pass on part or all of these costs as price increases on everything from electronics and clothing to components used in manufacturing and tech products. This steep tariff level far exceeds typical duties and could drastically raise consumer prices on Chinese-made goods and products incorporating Chinese parts.Historical and recent data from previous tariff rounds show that tariffs cause upward pressure on consumer prices. Studies indicate that U.S. companies often absorb some tariff costs initially, but price increases for consumers still follow, especially for goods with few domestic substitutes. For example, previous tariff increases pushed import prices notably higher, contributing to inflation pressures estimated at around 0.75 percentage points added to core inflation and potentially up to 1 percentage point annually in some forecasts. This leads to broader inflationary ripple effects in the economy.The 155% tariff threat is also likely to disrupt supply chains, forcing companies to reengineer or relocate production, which usually adds to costs and eventually consumer prices. Since China is a major source of critical minerals, components, and consumer products, tariffs at this scale could cause sharp price spikes and shortages for some goods.Historically, markets have reacted very negatively immediately following big tariff announcements, often with sharp sell-offs and periods of high volatility. For example, after President Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs in April 2025, the S&P 500 dropped by more than 12% over seven days, marking one of the steepest declines outside of major crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008 subprime mortgage crash.This initial market shock was accompanied by rising bond yields and a loss of confidence among investors globally, leading to widespread sell-offs in stocks and other assets.However, markets have also shown resilience after the initial shock. When Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs shortly after the sharp decline, the S&P 500 experienced one of its best single-day gains in nearly 17 years, surging by 9.5%. This rally reflected investor optimism that tensions might ease and trade negotiations could proceed.The sectors that would be hardest hit by a steep tariff like the proposed 155% on Chinese imports are those heavily reliant on imports from China and with low margins or limited ability to shift supply chains quickly. Key sectors include:History shows that sectors exporting consumer goods and labor-intensive products to tariff-imposing countries (like the U.S.) face the blunt of tariff impacts, with export volume declines and revenue setbacks as companies face a competitive disadvantage.Over the following weeks and months, markets gradually recovered as further tariff exemptions were granted and dialogue between the US and China increased, although uncertainty and volatility remained.Investors are now anxiously watching the, which many fear could mark the beginning of a. Whether this standoff leads to a negotiated deal or a financial shock, one thing is certain — the stakes have never been higher for the US economy and global markets.President Donald Trump has escalated trade tensions, threatening astarting November 1, 2025. This move comes after China expanded export controls on rare earths, vital for U.S. tech and defense industries. Trump also signaled a, calling China’s trade tactics “extraordinarily aggressive.”Despite the alarm, Trump hinted at possible negotiations and a planned visit to China in early 2026. Some analysts are cautiously optimistic, coining the termto suggest he may ease the tariff threat to avoid further market turmoil.Investors are now watching closely. While thehas intensified volatility, whether it triggers aremains uncertain.The move targets a wide range of goods, from electronics to machinery, and could significantly affect supply chains between the US and China. Trump emphasizes that unless China agrees to the terms, these tariffs will take effect immediately, escalating trade pressure.Experts say such a high tariff rate is unprecedented and could have far-reaching consequences. It is designed to push China to act, but it also introduces uncertainty for US businesses that rely on Chinese imports. Investors and market watchers are paying close attention to see how China responds and whether negotiations can prevent further escalation.Markets reacted sharply. On October 10, 2025, the, the, and the, erasing a month’s gains and sparking fears of an economic slowdown. Major tech stocks, including, were among the hardest hit.Following President Trump’s announcement, US stock markets have shown signs of volatility. Major indices like the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq experienced sharp declines in anticipation of the economic fallout from the tariffs. Technology stocks, in particular, have been hit hard.For example, companies that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing and components, such as Tesla, Amazon, and Nvidia, are seeing increased pressure on their stock prices. The uncertainty surrounding supply chains and potential price hikes for consumers has triggered cautious investor behavior.Market analysts warn that continued escalation could affect market confidence even more. If Trump moves forward with the tariffs, US companies may face higher costs, and investors could respond by reducing their exposure to stocks with strong China ties. While a full-scale market crash is not guaranteed, the risk of short-term turbulence is significant.China has responded by tightening export controls on critical materials, particularly rare earth elements used in electric vehicles, aircraft engines, and advanced technologies. These materials are essential for global manufacturing, and China controls more than 90% of the global supply.By restricting exports, China is signaling that it will not easily yield to the US pressure. This move could further complicate supply chains and raise costs for US companies relying on Chinese components.China’s response highlights the high stakes of the trade dispute. If either side escalates further, it could affect not just trade but global economic stability. Analysts warn that continued tensions may lead to delays in production, higher consumer prices, and increased uncertainty for investors.The proposed 155% tariffs could disrupt the global supply chain, particularly for industries dependent on Chinese imports. Sectors such as technology, automotive, and electronics may face higher costs for materials and components.Consumers could also feel the impact. Higher import costs could lead to price increases on products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. This could, in turn, affect household budgets and overall consumer spending, which drives a significant portion of the US economy.Moreover, uncertainty in the markets may reduce investor confidence. Companies may delay expansions or investments, leading to slower economic growth. Even if the tariffs are not fully implemented, the fear of potential escalation can cause short-term market instability.While a market crash is not certain, the combination of escalating tariffs, supply chain disruptions, and investor anxiety increases the risk of a sharp downturn. Historical trends suggest that sudden trade policy announcements can trigger rapid market reactions.Investors are particularly wary of November 1, 2025, the deadline for the tariffs. If China does not agree to terms and Trump enforces the tariffs, markets could see rapid sell-offs. On the other hand, successful negotiations could ease fears and stabilize markets.The uncertainty itself is a major factor. Traders and financial analysts are closely watching developments. Many recommend caution and diversification, as portfolios heavily exposed to technology or China-related trade could face volatility.Businesses should review supply chains and consider alternative sourcing strategies. Companies relying on Chinese imports may need contingency plans to mitigate potential cost increases. Keeping an eye on trade developments and maintaining flexible contracts can help manage risk.Consumers may see price fluctuations in goods that depend on Chinese imports. Planning purchases and staying informed about product price trends could help manage household expenses during this period of uncertainty.Staying informed is key for both investors and businesses. Regularly monitoring news, market updates, and trade negotiations can help individuals and companies make better decisions.President Trump’s 155% tariff threat has added a new layer of uncertainty to global markets. While negotiations could resolve the dispute, the risks are real. The coming weeks leading up to November 1, 2025, will be critical in determining whether markets stabilize or experience further volatility.Investors, businesses, and consumers alike should prepare for potential market fluctuations. Staying informed, considering alternative strategies, and monitoring developments can help navigate this uncertain period.
