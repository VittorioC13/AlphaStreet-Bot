Start of production at the Clifton Solar plant in the United Kingdom

Voltalia (Euronext Paris, ISIN code: FR0011995588), an international player in renewable energies, announces the start of production at its Clifton Solar power plant, with a capacity in operation of 45 megawatts, located in Dorset, near Yeovil

Clifton Solar power plant is now operational. With an installed capacity of 45 megawatts, it will produce the equivalent of the annual electricity consumption of over 10,600 households and is expected to offset 11,600 tonnes of CO 2 emissions annually.

This project, along with the Higher Stockbridge project currently under construction, was awarded a Contract for Difference as part of the fourth round of auctions (CfD AR4), securing a fixed tariff for 20 years.

With these new projects, Voltalia strengthens its presence in the United Kingdom, where it now operates four solar and storage plants, representing a total capacity in operation of 134 megawatts. An additional 79 megawatts are currently under construction. In addition, Voltalia has previously supported third-party clients in the development and operation of more than 23 additional projects, totaling 195 megawatts.

In a context of accelerated energy transition and high energy price volatility, Voltalia actively contributes to the UK’s carbon neutrality and energy security goals by delivering green energy at a competitive cost.

“We are very proud to have commissioned the Clifton Solar power plant. This project reflects our commitment to the UK market and our contribution to the national Clean Power goal of generating 95% low-carbon electricity by 2030”, said Robert Klein, CEO of Voltalia.

Next on the agenda: Q3 Turnover 2025, on October 22nd, 2025 (post-closing)

[TITLE]Europe Pledges $600 Billion for Clean Energy Projects in Africa:
[TEXT]
Africa needs energy. Nearly 600 million Africans—half the continent’s population—are without electricity, largely because of the continent’s limited distribution network, and Africans make up the vast majority of those worldwide without electricity access. But the European Union wants to change this.

At the end of September, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced a €545 million ($636 million) investment package to support renewable energy and electrification in Africa. New EU-funded projects will include a high-voltage transmission line in Côte d’Ivoire, the electrification of hundreds of rural communities in Cameroon, the exploitation of wind and hydro energy in Lesotho, and the installation of mini-grids in remote areas of Madagascar. The aim is both to increase access to electricity and move Africa off fossil fuels.

“A clean energy transition on the continent will create jobs, stability, growth, and the delivery of our global climate goals,” said Von der Leyen when making the announcement. “The European Union, with the Global Gateway investment plan, is fully committed to supporting Africa on its clean energy path.” The investment program could create 38 million green jobs in Africa by 2030, the EU estimates.

Global Gateway is a European initiative to build infrastructure around the world, with Africa its top priority. It has humanitarian and environmental intentions, but behind these sits a strong geopolitical objective: to provide an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

Launched in 2013, this Chinese funding program has invested over $1.3 trillion in building and operating roads, ports, energy, and telecommunications networks in more than a hundred countries around the world, from Asia to Africa to Latin America. Constructing, connecting, and controlling crucial facilities worldwide is a way of projecting power, and the Belt and Road Initiative has provided China with political influence around the world. At the same time, it has tied countries to the Chinese economy and provided a market for Chinese industrial services.

The Global Gateway, launched in 2021, is the EU’s own attempt to use funding to build influence in regions relevant to its interests—which includes Africa. The continent has significant deposits of critical minerals vital for tech and the green transition, such as cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, lithium in Zimbabwe, copper in Zambia, and manganese in Gabon. China, with its mining companies, is already very active in these countries.

[TITLE]How Energy Scarcity Fuels Political Upheaval:
[TEXT]
We are at a time when there seems to be far more conflict than in the past. At least part of the problem is that slowing growth in the world economy is making it more difficult to repay debt with interest, especially for governments. A related issue is that government promises for pensions and healthcare costs are becoming more difficult to pay. Donald Trump is trying to make numerous changes that are distasteful both to other countries and to many people living within the US. What is going wrong with the economy?

In my view, major cracks are developing in the economy because we are heading toward a collapse scenario of the type that Dr. Joseph Tainter talks

Poland’s PM Praises Man Accused of Destroying Nord Stream Pipeline

Armstrong Economics ^ | 9 Oct 25 | Martin Armstrong

Posted on by delta7

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk believes the man who allegedly destroyed the Nord Stream pipeline did his country a great service. Tusk is considering breaking international law by harboring the fugitive who is wanted by the German government. The man, of course, will be the scapegoat for the incident. More telling is Warsaw’s response, rooted in old geopolitical tensions and willful ignorance of how drastically the explosion hurt their own economy.

“The problem of Europe, Ukraine, Lithuania, and Poland is not that Nord Stream 2 was blown up, but that it was built,” Tusk said. “It is certainly not in the interest of Poland to hand over this citizen to a foreign country.” Poland will hold the man in its custody for an additional 40 days, during which it will consider Germany’s demand that he be extradited for prosecution.

“Russia, with money from some European states and German and (Anglo-) Dutch companies, built Nord Stream 2 against the vital interests not only of our states, but of all of Europe, and there can be no ambiguity

The cost:

On Sept 28, a russian drone killed nurse Oksana Katerusha from the Kyiv cardiology institute. Following protocols, all patients and staff moved to the shelter when the air raid began. But one man’s condition deteriorated there. Oksana took the risk & went upstairs to help & there both were killed.

Russian strikes have destroyed more than half of Ukraine’s natural gas production capacity ahead of winter, Bloomberg reported; Ukrainian forces struck a Russian gas plant and an oil pipeline station in Russia’s Volgograd Oblast; and more.

From The Kyiv Independent:

Russian strikes have destroyed more than half of Ukraine’s natural gas production capacity ahead of winter, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 9, citing its undisclosed sources. Ukraine’s gas network, which met the country’s needs before the full-scale war, has been repeatedly hit by missiles and drones, endangering millions of households that depend on gas for heating in winter. Russian forces launched one of the largest barrages yet on Oct. 3, firing 35 missiles and 60 drones at gas facilities in Kharkiv and Poltava oblasts, according to state-owned energy company Naftogaz. The strikes destroyed around 60% of Ukraine’s gas production, Bloomberg’s sources said. Naftogaz called the attack “the most massive” assault on gas infrastructure since the war began. Ukraine’s largest private energy firm, DTEK, said it was forced to halt operations at its Poltava facilities following the strikes. Two days later, Russia launched another attack targeting infrastructure critical for residential heating, causing further destruction, Naftogaz said. The strikes show Moscow’s strategy of targeting energy infrastructure to weaken civilian morale. Since 2022, Russia has repeatedly aimed to disrupt Ukraine’s heating and power systems with attacks. According to Bloomberg, Kyiv appealed to its G7 partners for urgent equipment to repair damaged facilities and reiterated its requests for additional air defense systems to protect energy infrastructure.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will provide Ukraine’s state-run oil and gas giant Naftogaz with fresh financing for emergency gas imports amid devastating Russian strikes on its gas production facilities, the bank’s vice president said on Oct. 9. [image or embed] — The Kyiv Independent (@kyivindependent.com) October 9, 2025 at 4:02 PM

The Kyiv Independent has the details:

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will provide Ukraine’s state-run oil and gas giant Naftogaz with fresh financing for emergency gas imports amid devastating Russian strikes on its gas production facilities, the bank’s vice president told the Kyiv Independent in an interview on Oct. 9. Nearly 60% of the country’s gas production was damaged in recent strikes, which targeted Ukraine’s Poltava and Kharkiv oblasts, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 9, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. Naftogaz and Ukraine’s Energy Ministry did not confirm the damage to the Kyiv Independent. Naftogaz did say, however, that the recent strikes were as bad as attacks in February and March. Those attacks led to a loss of nearly 50% of its gas production, the company said then. The EBRD program, which is currently in the works, needs to be up and running in the next two months for Ukraine to be able to import enough gas for the winter, Matteo Patrone, the bank’s VP, said. Patrone declined to publicly comment on how much funding would be provided, as the bank is still running the numbers. The bank recently provided the oil and gas giant with a 500-million-euro package in August — its largest project ever in Ukraine — after reserves dropped to an 11-year low in May. Ukraine needs at least 13.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to heat homes, schools, hospitals, and businesses this heating season. Before the latest attacks upturned its winter strategy, Naftogaz had planned to import 5.8 bcm by the end of the year, with nearly 4.6 bcm purchased already, the company’s press service told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian state-owned bank Oschadbank signed a 3 billion hryvnia ($72 million) loan with Naftogaz for gas imports on Oct. 9. The European Investment Bank allotted 300 million euros ($347 million) to shore up reserves on Oct. 1. “We stand ready to lead this effort, but it has to be a collective effort. International partners and the Ukrainian banking system have to step up. We all need to contribute,” Patrone said. With the right support from the domestic financial sector and international partners, there will be enough gas in the system to get through the winter, he said.

Putin spent years controlling Ukraine’s natural gas industry through the Ukrainian oligarch and organized crime leader Dmytro Firtash. Firtash has spent years under house arrest in Austria as his extradition appeal slowly grinds through the Austrian court system. Firtash was also an important bridging node between Putin and Russian organized crime and Trump via Rudy Giuliani and Victoria Toensing.

Putin ultimately failed to take control of Ukraine’s natural gas industry, so he’s decided to destroy it to both further his attempt to terrorize the Ukrainians into submission and to remove Ukrainian natural gas from the European and world markets. His intention in achieving the latter is that it will both raise the price of natural gas and make the European states have to start buying Russian natural gas again. An additional effect is to burden Ukraine with more debt that will make it harder to secure the post war peace.

Here is President Zelenskyy’s address from earlier today. Video below, English transcript after the jump.

The Task Now Is to Be Significantly More Active in Everything Related to the Preparation and Execution of Long-Range Sanctions Against Russia – Address by the President I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! The main points for today. Military issues. We discussed in great detail with the military leadership the employment of our long-range weapons – the use of our missiles, the use of our drones. Some issues concerning production, delivery to the armed forces, and crew training. The task now is to be significantly more active in everything related to the preparation and execution of long-range sanctions against Russia. The more effective Ukraine is in long-range capabilities, the sooner we will be able to achieve peace. The quality of Ukrainian long-range weapons is becoming substantially higher – we are working on this constantly, and we have already provided many different opportunities specifically for production, the necessary funding, and all the support required. We must also substantially scale up their employment. We have clear plans for this in the coming months. Everything must be implemented. Ukrainian precision is already evident, it needs to increase further. This is absolutely fair that Ukraine strikes back with precise, targeted attacks, and unlike Russia, we know exactly what we aim to achieve. Peace, of course. We are not waging war for the sake of war, as Russia does. Even Hamas shows deal-making acumen, but not Putin. For now. Together with our partners, we are creating the conditions to compel Russia to peace. And it will happen. We support all global diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving peace in the Middle East, and we strongly expect that just pressure on Russia will bring peace to Ukraine and to our entire region as well. It is important that the leadership of the United States continue to be effective. Today, I held a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and the diplomatic team of the Office to discuss the drafts of our resolutions and documents in international organizations that are to be adopted later this year. I instructed them to engage partners to the fullest extent possible, our key partners, to ensure continued global support for our initiatives. This concerns, in particular, such sensitive issues as the return of Ukrainian prisoners, all those held in Russia. And we know of people who have been in captivity since 2014. This also concerns the children abducted by Russia – time is passing far too quickly, and it is not just every year but every month that matters for each child separated from their family and from their native environment – from Ukraine. We know a lot

[TITLE]Unlocking the Longevity Dividend for Growth and Resilience:
[TEXT]
For much of the post-war era, economic analysis of population aging has focused overwhelmingly on its downsides. The dominant framing, especially in aging advanced economies like Japan, Italy and Germany, has been one of demographic doom. Many people frequently cast falling fertility rates, rising life expectancy and inverted population pyramids as existential threats to economic growth, fiscal solvency and societal dynamism. This deterministic narrative posits a future of too few workers supporting too many retirees, with escalating burdens on public pension systems, healthcare and intergenerational equity. Governments receive warnings of collapsing labor markets, declining productivity and irreversible economic stagnation.

However, this framing, while not wholly without basis, is ultimately incomplete and outdated. It ignores both the changing nature of aging and the vast adaptive capacity of institutions, individuals and markets. As empirical evidence accumulates, a more optimistic counter-narrative emerges — one in which longer lives, better health at older ages and rising educational attainment among older cohorts unlock new economic potential. This is the essence of the longevity dividend: a window of opportunity where demographic change becomes a driver of renewal, rather than decline.

For example, in the European Union, more than 90% of net employment growth in the past decade was generated by workers aged 50 and above. In Japan, where the median age exceeds 48, older cohorts are now a primary driver of GDP growth. These trends underscore a critical point: Aging populations are not necessarily shrinking productive populations. With the right investments, institutional redesign and regulatory flexibility, the economic contributions of older individuals can be extended, diversified and even deepened.

Rethinking dependency: from burden to adaptation strategy

Most public policy responses to demographic aging today remain anchored in a framework of dependency. Policymakers scramble to shore up old-age support systems through three conventional levers: raising retirement ages, incentivizing childbirth and expanding immigration. Each faces steep political, economic or social resistance. Raising the retirement age provokes popular backlash, particularly when unaccompanied by workplace reform. Fertility incentives have failed in many countries — South Korea, for instance, spends over 2% of GDP on family subsidies with little reversal in birth trends. Immigration, while economically effective in some settings, is politically fraught and socially complex.

What unites these strategies is their reactive posture. They seek to preserve 20th-century social models built for younger, growing populations in a 21st-century world of demographic maturity. They treat aging as a problem to be reversed or slowed, not as a condition to which society should strategically adapt.

This is a missed opportunity. Rather than simply adjusting age ratios, forward-thinking societies should invest in capabilities across the life course. That includes designing systems that maintain health, skills, productivity and social engagement well into the eighth and ninth decades of life.

This adaptation framework necessitates new thinking
