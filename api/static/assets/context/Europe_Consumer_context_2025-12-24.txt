[TITLE]A Bipartisan Push to Revive a 1930s Law Could Make Grocery Prices Even Higher:
[TEXT]
Groceries, like almost everything these days, are seeing prices rise. Millions of Americans have tempered some of these hikes by purchasing bulk goods at wholesale prices at warehouse club retail stores such as Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's Wholesale Club. But these savings could soon cease. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers is looking to crack down on wholesale prices by reviving a nearly 90-year-old antitrust statute.

In the weeks leading up to Congress' winter recess, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R–Iowa) solicited the signatures of fellow Senate Republicans on a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Andrew Ferguson asking them to investigate supply practices that hurt small businesses, particularly grocers. Reason has acquired a copy of the letter, which calls on Bondi and Ferguson "to utilize all federal laws…to bring enforcement actions against any discriminatory conduct that you may discover in violation of…the Robinson-Patman Act."

The Robinson-Patman Act (RPA) is a 1936 antitrust law that bans discrimination "in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality…where the effect of such discrimination may…tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce." After a period of strong enforcement in the mid-20th century, recent decades have witnessed a marked decline in federal RPA cases: Before the FTC, under the leadership of Chairwoman Lina Kahn, sued Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits for selling alcohol to larger retailers at lower per-unit prices in December 2024, it had been more than 20 years since the federal government filed an RPA suit. Then–FTC Commissioner Melissa Holyoak dissented from Khan's complaint, which she characterized as "elevating the interests of competitors over competition" in a way that was "at odds with the plain text" of the RPA.

Grassley argues that the statute recognizes certain forms of price discrimination as harming competition, but he doesn't acknowledge that the RPA allows price differentials that reflect "differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered."

Grassley claims that a lack of competition is forcing independent grocers "to accept increasingly discriminatory terms and conditions for their products, including less favorable…price terms"—even as he rightly describes the grocery business as "experienc[ing] high turnover and low margins." Such phenomena are textbook indicators of a competitive industry, not a monopolized one.

Grassley also claims that "independent businesses are often the only source of groceries, consumer goods, or pharmaceuticals in many small towns and urban centers." If this were true, such small businesses needn't worry about larger firms receiving bulk price discounts; they wouldn't be competing with them at all.

Of course, the opposite is true. Local businesses face intense competition from Amazon, Walmart, Target, FreshDirect, CVS, Walgreens, and the myriad other firms that ship groceries, goods, and drugs directly to consumers. These large firms enjoy bulk discounts and attract customers by passing on part of their savings to them in the form of lower prices.

Unfortunately, Grassley is not the only official looking to leverage the RPA to punish productive firms and consumers. On Thursday, December 18, Sen. Cory Booker (D–N.J.) introduced the Fair Competition for Small Business Act of 2025, which would amend the RPA to "allow state attorneys general to pursue monetary damages against distributors and retailers that engage in unlawful price discrimination." Rep. Maxine Waters (D–Calif.) has introduced companion legislation in the House.

Grocery prices are high. Cracking down on wholesale pricing won't fix this problem, it will exacerbate it.

[TITLE]Instacart ends AI-driven pricing tests that pushed up costs for some shoppers:
[TEXT]
The Instacart website on a laptop computer arranged in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, U.S., on Monday, Jan. 4, 2021.

Instacart said Monday it will cease the use of artificial intelligence-driven pricing tests on its grocery delivery platform after the practice was scrutinized in a wide-ranging study and rebuked by lawmakers.

The company said in a blog post that retailers will no longer be able to use its Eversight technology to run pricing experiments on its platform, effective immediately.

"We understand that the tests we ran with a small number of retail partners that resulted in different prices for the same item at the same store missed the mark for some customers," the company wrote. "At a time when families are working exceptionally hard to stretch every grocery dollar, those tests raised concerns, leaving some people questioning the prices they see on Instacart. That's not okay – especially for a company built on trust, transparency, and affordability."

Instacart acquired Eversight for $59 million in 2022. Eversight's software allows retailers to carry out pricing tests to gauge shoppers' reactions to higher or lower prices on certain items.

Instacart said at the time that the technology would help retailers improve sales and growth, while "also surfacing the best deals for customers."

[TITLE]Wing Yip Food Holdings Group Limited Receives Nasdaq Notification Regarding Minimum Bid Price Deficiency:
[TEXT]
Guangdong, China, Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wing Yip Food Holdings Group Limited (the “Company” or “Wing Yip”) (Nasdaq: WYHG), a meat product processing company in mainland China, today announced that the Company received a written notification (the “Notification Letter”) from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on December 22, 2025, notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules for continued listing on the Nasdaq.

Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of US$1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) for the 30 consecutive business days from November 7, 2025 to December 19, 2025, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement.

The Notification Letter does not impact the Company’s listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market at this time. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until June 22, 2026, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company’s ADSs must have a closing bid price of at least US$1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by June 22, 2026, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or may face delisting.

The Company’s business operations are not affected by the receipt of the Notification Letter. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its ADSs and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options, including, but not limited to, implementing a reverse share split of its outstanding ADSs, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.

[TITLE]California’s minimum wage is increasing in 2026 as Los Angeles debates $30 an hour:
[TEXT]
Californians will see the minimum wage increase to $16.90 per hour starting Jan. 1. The adjustment — a boost of 40 cents per hour — was calculated in August by the Department of Finance as part of its minimum wage annual review required by state law.

California has been raising its minimum wage over the past decade. Former Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016 signed a watershed law to increase minimum wage from $10.50 per hour to $15 per hour, plus annual adjustments for inflation.

The current rate of $16.50 per hour suggests that a minimum wage worker needs to work 98 hours per week to afford a one-bedroom rental at fair market rent in California, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

California is one of 19 states to raise minimum wages in 2026, according to payroll company ADP. Cities and counties can also set their own minimum wages. This year, over two dozen local jurisdictions have increased local minimum wages. West Hollywood will have a $20.25 minimum wage starting in January — the highest of any California city, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center.

Voters last November narrowly rejected a ballot measure that would have increased the minimum wage to $18 per hour. But some low-wage workers this year have successfully lobbied for bumps in pay in specific industries.

Under laws Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2023, fast food workers earn a minimum wage wage of $20 an hour and health care workers are on track to make $25 an hour.

That momentum extended to Los Angeles hotel and airport employees. Labor organizers in May secured a city minimum wage increase to $30 per hour for those workers by the 2028 Olympics. Large businesses fought back, arguing that wage hikes will only increase challenges for the tourism industry, which is still struggling to find its footing after the pandemic.

After failing to gather enough signatures for a ballot measure to repeal the new minimum wage, business groups later filed a different measure that could gut millions of dollars of revenue from the city’s general fund.

Following the move, Los Angeles City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson this month introduced a motion to delay the full wage increase from taking effect until 2030, according to reporting from the Los Angeles Times.

Labor leaders rebuked the motion, calling it “repulsive.”

“You can’t threaten to blow a hole in our budget and then the only way to stop it is on the backs of workers,” said Kurt Petersen, co-president of the union that represents many hotel workers, UNITE HERE Local 11. “That kind of raw extortion and shakedown has no place in our city.”

According to Peterson, a coalition of community organizations and unions are beginning to collect signatures for a ballot measure that would raise the minimum wage to $30 per hour for all workers in Los Angeles.

“The power is everyone together,” said Peterson. “Working people need help and raising wages is the easiest, most straightforward thing to do. Going up 40 cents per hour in 2026 doesn’t move the needle at all.”

[TITLE]Digital Brands Group Advances Suite of AI-Powered Tools for Global Brand Protection and Growth:
[TEXT]
Austin, Texas, Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digital Brands Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBGI) (the “Company,” “Digital Brands Group” or “DBG”) today announces continued progress in its strategy to build a comprehensive suite of technology-driven tools designed to protect, support, and grow modern consumer brands operating in global eCommerce markets.

Brand misuse and counterfeiting have become a critical global issue, with the counterfeit economy estimated at over US$1.7 trillion annually, eroding consumer trust, damaging brand equity, and diverting billions in legitimate revenue. As commerce and content increasingly move online, Digital Brands Group is assembling an ecosystem of specialized, AI-driven technology solutions to address these challenges at scale, beginning with the onboarding of tools focused on intellectual property protection, counterfeiting, data integrity, and digital trust. SECUR3D Inc. is among the first technology providers integrated into this expanding ecosystem, delivering AI-powered brand and IP protection capabilities across global digital marketplaces and platforms.

SECUR3D’s flagship platform, AssetSafe™, uses advanced AI to identify, monitor, and address unauthorized use of brand assets, including counterfeit products, copied designs, and misuse of trademarks across eCommerce and social channels. SECUR3D’s technology has been deployed across high-profile entertainment, consumer, and digital properties, with experience supporting IP associated with globally recognized franchises such as Godzilla, Star Trek, Jurassic World, Back to the Future, and other major brands.

“Digital brands today face a rapidly evolving threat landscape as commerce, content, and IP move online,” said Hil Davis, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Brands Group. “Our goal is to build a scalable suite of tools that helps brands protect their identity, maintain consumer trust, and operate more securely in digital environments. SECUR3D represents one of the first foundational technologies in that strategy, and we expect to continue onboarding additional tools that expand the capabilities of this platform over time.”

Digital Brands Group plans to introduce further AI-driven and data-centric solutions into its technology stack, creating an integrated offering that can be deployed across its own portfolio and with select external brand partners. The Company believes this approach positions Digital Brands Group as more than a brand operator, but as a technology-enabled platform supporting the next generation of commerce.

[TITLE]Fashion Warms Up Cortina d’Ampezzo Ahead of Winter Olympics:
[TEXT]
MILAN – With the ski season having officially begun earlier this month in the Alps, luxury and fashion brands and retailers are embracing the winter spirit and flocking to the mountains to court wealthy customers during their getaways.

As the Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo are fast approaching, the latter, dubbed the “Queen of the Dolomites,” is emerging as the go-to destination.

Prada has just opened its first boutique in town on the shopping street Corso Italia, a 2,152-square-foot, three-story space complete with a small terrace on the second floor overlooking the Dolomites. The store, featuring natural stone flooring and decked in larch wood, carries the men’s and women’s collections.

Down the same street, Cortina’s storied luxury multibrand boutique Franz Kraler has undergone a major revamp with help from Italian architecture firm Raumwerk. It created an immersive experience defined by multiple spaces with distinctive aesthetics, with the frosty landscape-inspired entrance segueing into the main retail area decked in metallic walls with an industrial bent.

In celebration of the Winter Olympics, kicking off on Feb. 6, the windows are filled with miniature winter wonderlands with slopes, cable cars and icy tunnels.

As reported, the Kraler family has also been at the forefront of hospitality and has opened the state-of-the-art Chalet Franz Kraler-Club Moritzino at the Socrepes location, where the Ria De Saco ski-slope lodge once stood. The latter was an earlier Franz Kraler hospitality project that opened in 2022.

Unveiled earlier this month, the chalet is managed in partnership with Club Moritzino, a popular après-ski spot in Piz La Ila, Italy, a ski resort in the Dolomites’ Alta Badia region.

Developed by the BlueArch design studio, the new chalet spans three floors, two of which are underground to minimize the environmental impact and decked in dark larch wood and glass panels mirroring the sky and snow-dotted slopes.

The ground floor houses a restaurant, which boasts a terrace overlooking the slopes, equipped with a bar counter. A 430-square-foot wine cellar suspended over the main hall will be dedicated to wine tastings and private events.

A hairpin turn away, Harmont & Blaine is back in Cortina d’Ampezzo with its sophomore takeover of the Chalet Tofane ski lodge.

The Italian brand has customized furniture and decor with its signature dachshund logo scattered throughout in the form of wooden sculptures and graphic upholstery and wallpapers.

Marking the second iteration of the three-year partnership with Chalet Tofane and the opening of a Harmont & Blaine pop-up at the local shopping center “La Cooperativa di Cortina,” the brand has debuted the dedicated mountain-inspired capsule collection “Cortina a Colori,” or “Cortina in Colors” in English. It’s filled with casual and leisure apparel and accessories such as Fair Isle sweaters, checkered overshirts and corduroy pants.

The Winter Olympics are shining an even bright spotlight on the tony Italian winter resort destination.

Anticipating a stronger influx of international tourists, a new luxury concierge service has been launched by ski instructor and restaurant entrepreneur Lorenzo Pignata along with Carolina Pignata, an event entrepreneur, and wellness expert Manfredi Reale. Called The Cortina Club, it will offer services ranging from ski and snowboard lessons, visits to private art collections, chalet rental and Michelin-starred dinners on the slopes to helicopter rides and private parties at exclusive locations.

This month luxury publishing house Assouline has released a new coffee-table book as part of its destination series, titled “Cortina d’Ampezzo.” Curated by Milan-based journalist Massimo Nava, it highlights the mountaintop city’s natural landscape, architecture, glamorous present, and history.

Cortina d’Ampezzo has been home to the Winter Olympics once before, in 1956, and in celebration of the milestone, Lacoste, the official licensee of the International Olympic Committee, has dropped a capsule collection called “Lacoste x Olympic Heritage Cortina d’Ampezzo 1956.” The collection reprises the 1956 Games’ original blue logo appearing on a range of urban and après-ski gear, such as merino wool sweaters and vintage-inspired puffer jackets as well tracksuits and soft accessories.

Although the Italian destination is taking the lion’s share of brand attention this year, some companies are looking at other European winter resorts.

For example, Pierre-Louis Mascia has traveled to Gstaad, Switzerland, opening its first boutique in the town, a 753-square-foot unit decked in maple wood and filled with vintage finds and objects nodding to the mountain destination, such as bronze horns, armchairs upholstered in cashmere and Baroque dressers.

Meanwhile, Courmayeur — an Italian destination beloved by the Milanese in search of winter getaways at the feet of Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in the Alps and Western Europe, whose tunnel has been recently reopened — is gearing up for the 2026 edition of “Design Weekend,” running Feb. 12 to 15 as the Winter Games are unfurling on the opposite side of the Italian Alps. The event will draw archistar Marcel Wanders for a talk organized at the “Skyway Mont Blanc” venue.

There are no shortage of deals available to shop at Nordstrom as we speak, but our editors managed to narrow in on only the best of the best. This means there are no fake markdowns in sight here, and the brands featured are what we like to refer to as “cream of the crop” — meaning the Chloés, Fendis, Tory Burches, and Coaches of the world. We also curated this roundup with an eye towards what is guaranteed to be trending in the new year, from the perennially popular suede boots to the kinds of versatile outerwear picks that will take you from the work meeting to the dinner date without having to rush back home and change.

Still looking for a gift to pamper the woman in your life who’s hardest to shop for? Most of these selections arrive after Christmas, but you can skirt around the shipping deadlines and still get the pieces wrapped and ready for the big day. How this is possible? By ordering from Nordstrom online and then choosing its “Free Pickup” option at your nearest brick-and-mortar store location. This opens up the possibility of acquiring your presents in as little as a few hours, depending on inventory (we won’t judge you for that last-minute scramble, by the way).

“I was pleasantly surprised by how effective these lifting masks are! The material is soft, comfortable, and easy to wear, and it stays in place without slipping. After just a few uses, I noticed my jawline looked more defined and my skin felt firmer and smoother. The ingredients are a huge plus—collagen, hyaluronic acid, retinol, and aloe vera leave my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated, not tight or dry. I also love that it’s 98% natural, which gives me peace of mind when using it regularly. It’s like a little spa treatment at home, and it definitely gives a temporary lift and tightening effect before events or special occasions. For anyone looking to improve skin firmness and reduce puffiness around the chin and neck area, this is a must-try!” — Jordan
