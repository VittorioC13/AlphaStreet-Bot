[TITLE]‘Our Value Was Never Disrespected’: Hollywood Career Producers Are Battling Actors, Greedy Managers, Penny-Pinching Execs and Stolen Credits to Survive:
[TEXT]
The struggle of the modern Hollywood producer was crystallized in a bit from this year’s Emmy awards.

Host Nate Bargatze opened the broadcast with an old-timey sketch spoofing the creation of the television set, in which he played an exaggerated version of real-life inventor Philo Farnsworth.

On a Frankenstein-esque laboratory set, Bargatze, flanked by “Saturday Night Live” players Bowen Yang and Mikey Day, predicted how a crude little box would come to captivate billions of viewers around the world. One of the “SNL” boys asked who would make the programming. Bargatze responded: “Actors, writers, directors and, most importantly, producers.” Day followed up, “And what does the producer do, sir?”

Bargatze stared into the camera and deadpanned, “Nobody knows!”

The punchline got a big laugh, as it has for decades when Hollywood feigns ignorance

[TITLE]GENFIT Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Information and Provides a Corporate Update:
[TEXT]
Cash and cash equivalents totaled €119.0 million as of September 30, 2025

€39.2 million in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, including the €26.5 million milestone payment following pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European markets

Lille (France), Cambridge (Massachusetts, United States), Zurich (Switzerland), November 20, 2025 - GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases, today announced its third quarter 2025 financial results1 and provided a corporate update.

Cash Position

As of September 30, 2025, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to €119.0 million compared with €107.5 million as of June 30, 2025, and €81.8 million as of December 31, 2024.

We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements beyond the end of 2028, enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes (i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds and (ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing agreement with HCRx.

In the first nine months of 2025, cash utilization is mainly the result of our research and development efforts in our pipeline focused on ACLF (notably VS-01, G1090N2, SRT-015, CLM-022, and VS-02 HE), as well as GNS561 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Cash utilization was notably offset by a €26.5 million milestone payment received in July 2025 under the Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen, following pricing and reimbursement approvals for Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European markets3.

Revenue

Revenue4 for the first nine months of 2025 amounted to €39.2 million compared to €59.7 million for the same period in 2024.

Revenue for the first nine months of 2025 was primarily driven by the Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen, including (i) royalty revenue from worldwide sales (excluding Greater China) of Ipsen's Iqirvo® (elafibranor) totaling €12.6 million and (ii) milestone revenue from pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European countries3 totaling €26.5 million.

Program highlights

ACLF pipeline

G1090N2 – A Phase 1 First-in-Human study in healthy volunteers is currently underway with safety data expected at the end of this year. Early signals of efficacy from ex-vivo functional assays are also expected at the same time.

SRT-015 – Current work on an improved formulation aims at increasing exposure. Pending positive development, the launch of a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.

CLM-022 – Current experiments aim at confirming therapeutic efficacy using different disease models relevant for AD and ACLF as well as starting formulation development and first toxicological studies in 2025. Pending further positive developments, a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the first half of 2027.

VS-02-HE – We intend to develop VS-02-HE as a unique oral formulation designed to act in the gut where ammonia is primarily produced, minimizing systemic absorption of ammonia while reducing glutamine levels in the brain. Completion of Investigational New Drug-enabling nonclinical studies and formulation development are expected by the end of 2025. A first-in-human trial could be initiated in the second half of 2027.

Other life-threatening diseases

GNS561 in CCA – Data readout from the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial are expected by the end of 2025.

VS-01-HAC in Urea Cycle Disorders & Organic Acidemias (pediatric indication) – Data from the pivotal juvenile toxicology study in Göttingen Minipigs are expected before the end of 2025. Following discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF, additional preclinical work will be conducted before moving into the clinic. Update on the ongoing preclinical work and potential clinical development is expected before the end of 2025.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)

As reported in Ipsen’s third quarter financial results5, Iqirvo® (elafibranor) continues to show solid growth across both the U.S. and European markets in PBC.

In a market of dupes and downshifts, luxury has to earn its price tag all over again.

“Luxury has gotten so outrageously expensive.” That’s Alex Angelchik’s blunt diagnosis of the current moment, a time when a blazer that once cost $3,000 can now run to $7,000 at the very top of the European houses.

Angelchik is ready to put his money where his mouth is as he tries his hand at re-creating a legacy fashion brand for modern times. His Newtimes Group has purchased the 75-year-old Robert Talbott brand and opened a flagship store in Manhattan, right on Madison Avenue.

The concept is intentionally experiential, carrying the full range, from the signature neckwear that once defined the brand and tailored apparel, to expanded lifestyle pieces, with the space designed to blend California ease and New York polish.

For Angelchik, the location is symbolic as much as strategic. He says the address is the very same storefront the brand exited in 2018. It’s a “karma” return chosen because it makes a statement, reintroduces the label to New York and leverages data from a store he knows could perform.

“We wanted to launch the first store in New York because it’s Madison Avenue. It’s making a statement,” Angelchik said. “It reintroduces the brand, which is quite different now than it was five, six years ago.”

Angelchik didn’t buy the Robert Talbott name to put it behind glass. He acquired the IP in 2021, relaunched in 2023, and then spent time rebuilding the product architecture around a clear value promise: Quality American luxury fashion for men at the entry to high‑luxury pricing.

The reboot started with uncomfortable truths. Men weren’t wearing ties in 2021–22; Robert Talbot’s 1960’s and 70’s oversized dress shirt silhouettes not longer fit, figurately and literally. So Angelchik and his team at Newtimes went back to first principles.

“There was something special

[TITLE]Italy Embedded Finance Business Report 2025-2030: Scalapay, Fabrick, Telepass, Satispay, Yolo Group, and Opyn Drive Italy's Expanding Embedded Finance Ecosystem:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Italy Embedded Finance Market Size & Forecast by Value and Volume Across 100+ KPIs by Business Models, Distribution Models, End-Use Sectors, and Key Verticals (Payments, Lending, Insurance, Banking, Wealth) - Databook Q4 2025 Update" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The embedded finance market in Italy is expected to grow by 7.1% on an annual basis to reach US$11.96 billion by 2025. The embedded finance market in the country has experienced robust growth during 2021-2025, achieving a CAGR of 10.3%. This upward trajectory is expected to continue, with the market forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% from 2026 to 2030. By the end of 2030, the embedded finance market is projected to expand from its 2024 value of US$11.17 billion to approximately US$14.51 billion.

Across lending, insurance, payments, and mobility, embedded finance in Italy is evolving through sector-specific use cases rather than horizontal platforms. Fintech adoption remains moderate compared to peers like Germany or France, but Italy's regulatory alignment with EU digital finance reforms, coupled with growing digital consumption patterns, is driving steady momentum. Over the next 2-4 years, expect Italy's embedded finance landscape to intensify in vertical depth especially in SME lending, lifestyle insurance, and urban mobility while broader integration across banking and retail ecosystems continues to develop.

B2B Embedded Lending Is Expanding Among Italian SMEs

Embedded lending solutions are increasingly being adopted in Italy's B2B segment, particularly by small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) seeking faster access to credit within the platforms they already use for procurement or invoicing. For instance, Credimi a digital lender focused on SMEs has been collaborating with ecosystem platforms to offer credit products directly at the point of need. Italian marketplaces and procurement platforms are also embedding credit solutions into supplier portals to ease working capital friction.

The key driver is the longstanding credit gap faced by SMEs in Italy, often due to traditional underwriting delays by banks. The digitization of B2B workflows through platforms like TeamSystem and Fatture in Cloud creates a natural entry point for embedded lending providers. The 2023 EIB Investment Survey showed persistent financing obstacles among Italian SMEs, reinforcing demand for more integrated and responsive credit access.

This trend is likely to intensify, with embedded B2B lending expected to expand across vertical SaaS platforms and digital invoicing ecosystems. The growth of e-invoicing, coupled with EU-backed digital finance reforms, will accelerate API-based integration of lending products into ERP and supplier systems.

Embedded Insurance Solutions Are Targeting Mobility and Lifestyle Use Cases

Embedded insurance is gaining traction across mobility, travel, and electronics retail in Italy. Companies such as Telepass are embedding micro-insurance offerings (e.g., accident or breakdown protection) within subscription and tolling services. Similarly, e-commerce platforms like Unieuro and MediaWorld embed extended warranty products within checkout flows for consumer electronics.

The rise of on-demand consumption in Italy, particularly in urban centers, is increasing demand for low-ticket, bundled coverage options. Italian consumers are also showing growing willingness to adopt usage-based or pay-per-use models, which aligns well with embedded insurance tied to specific products or experiences. Regulatory flexibility introduced by IVASS (Italy's insurance regulator) around digital insurance distribution is another enabler.

The embedded insurance market is expected to stabilize but diversify in terms of use cases. With further regulatory clarity from IVASS and deeper partnerships between insurers and digital platforms, the next growth wave will likely involve lifestyle insurance embedded into fintech apps, ticketing platforms, or subscription services.

BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) Embedded Into Retail and E-Commerce Ecosystems

BNPL adoption is growing steadily in Italy through integration with both online and in-store retail platforms. Scalapay remains a dominant player, offering pay-in-three options at checkout across major fashion and lifestyle brands such as Calzedonia and Liu Jo. Klarna and PayPal also maintain strong merchant partnerships across Italian e-commerce, embedding BNPL within payments flows.

The key driver is demand from younger consumers for flexible, short-term credit options without traditional bank friction. Italian e-commerce continues to grow post-pandemic, and embedded BNPL offers a frictionless upsell tool for merchants. Payment service providers are incentivized to include BNPL options as a value-added feature in merchant integration packages.

The embedded BNPL market is expected to intensify, with new models (e.g., B2B BNPL or invoice factoring) emerging alongside consumer use cases. Tighter scrutiny by the Bank of Italy on consumer protection may reshape disclosure requirements, but the underlying demand for embedded checkout financing is unlikely to taper.

Fintech-Bank Collaborations Are Accelerating Embedded Finance Integration

Banks in Italy are increasingly partnering with fintechs and technology providers to integrate embedded finance use cases especially in areas such as digital payments, personal finance tools, and card-linked services. For example, Fabrick (a Banca Sella initiative) continues to expand its API marketplace for third-party integration, supporting embedded finance across multiple touchpoints.

Italian banks face competitive pressure from both domestic fintechs and European neobanks. Collaborating through API layers allows banks to remain relevant in the value chain while outsourcing innovation. Regulatory encouragement of open finance under PSD2 and the upcoming PSD3 has further accelerated interest in embedded models that rely on bank-fintech partnerships.

This trend will intensify as Italy prepares for PSD3 and digital identity frameworks under the EU Digital Finance Strategy. More banks are expected to adopt platform-based models, enabling embedded offerings such as personalized savings nudges, loyalty-linked payments, or embedded credit scoring within third-party apps.

Mobility and Smart City Platforms Are Testing Embedded Payments and Tolling

Embedded finance is being piloted in Italy's urban mobility sector, especially in the integration of toll payments, fuel cards, and transport services. Telepass has expanded its embedded tolling and micro-payment features across public and private transport networks. Similarly, startups like Satispay are embedding payments within mobility platforms, including parking and charging stations.

The development of smart cities, increasing adoption of mobility-as-a-service (MaaS), and Italy's decarbonization commitments are pushing cities and operators to unify payments across modes of transport. Consumer preference for seamless mobility experiences especially in cities like Milan and Rome further supports this evolution.

The embedded payments trend in mobility will likely accelerate, supported by EU-level smart mobility funding and digital infrastructure upgrades. Multi-service embedded wallets and single-click checkout for tolls, parking, and transit could become more mainstream, especially as municipal-level partnerships mature.

Embedded Finance Activity Is Increasing but Remains Concentrated in Specific Verticals

Embedded finance in Italy is still in a growth phase, with activity largely concentrated in retail payments, SME lending, and digital insurance. While the ecosystem is less saturated than in Northern Europe, competition is intensifying in areas like Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) and embedded B2B credit. The maturity of Italy's digital infrastructure and moderate fintech adoption rates have resulted in a market led by a few dominant platforms often tied to banks or telcos rather than a broad set of digital-native disruptors.

Unlike markets with high fintech proliferation, Italy's embedded finance landscape is being shaped by hybrid entities such as Fabrick that operate both as enablers and service providers. This structure has kept competitive intensity moderate, but concentrated, with increased collaboration between incumbent banks and API-centric fintechs.

The market is expected to diversify, particularly as embedded models extend into mobility, utilities, and enterprise software platforms. However, a few dominant infrastructure enablers are likely to maintain control over core payment and lending rails unless major new entrants disrupt the stack.

Key Players Span Fintechs, Banks, Telcos, and Sector-Focused Platforms

Scalapay remains a prominent player in the embedded BNPL segment, operating with merchant integrations across e-commerce and fashion verticals.

Fabrick, owned by Banca Sella, functions both as a fintech and a middleware API platform, powering embedded finance offerings across partners such as Nexi and Enel X.

Telepass, traditionally a toll operator, has broadened into embedded finance with micro-insurance, payments, and mobility-linked financial products.

Satispay, a mobile payments startup, has expanded its in-app payment capabilities across everyday merchant categories, embedding finance into retail and transport flows.

Newer startups and sector-specific SaaS platforms are entering the embedded lending and insurance markets, including players like Yolo Group (embedded digital insurance) and Opyn (digital SME lending). These firms are building API-first products that integrate directly into retail, travel, and e-invoicing platforms.

A handful of infrastructure-layer players especially Fabrick are expected to anchor the growth of embedded finance in Italy, while use-case-specific players in insurance, lending, and payments expand across sector platforms.

[TITLE]Flipkart fintech super.money preps buy-now-pay-later play:
[TEXT]
Flipkart-backed UPI app super.money is preparing a fresh push into buy now, pay later (BNPL) by partnering regulated banks and lenders, as it hunts for its next leg of growth beyond credit on UPI, according to two people aware of the plans.

The company is looking to compete with existing checkout-finance players such as Axio and Snapmint in the tightly contested intersection of e-commerce and lending, said the first person, asking not to be named as the product is still under development.

“Once it is fully built, the launch will have two parts," this person added. “One is to offer super.money as a checkout option on e-commerce sites, and the other is to bring an e-commerce layer inside the app itself with BNPL-style financing at checkout."

The second person said the broader idea is to position super.money as a one-stop destination for e-commerce journeys supported by credit, so that users can move from discovery to payment in a single, smooth flow on its interface.

Mint could not independently ascertain a firm timeline for the launch. However, the two people cited above said the BNPL product is currently in development and testing, and is expected to go live only after the company completes tighter KYC and other regulatory checks that apply to this category.

This emerging category, where BNPL is offered as a checkout option across commerce sites, is not new. Companies such as Snapmint, which raised

[TITLE]Mews and YouLend deliver €2 million in Flexible Financing to hotels across Europe and the US:
[TEXT]
Amsterdam – Mews, the operating system for hospitality and shared spaces, has announced that its embedded financing partnership with YouLend has provided nearly €2 million in funding to hotels across Europe and the US. With the partnership now live across multiple eligible markets, hotels can access flexible funding directly through the Mews platform. The latest addition of France completes the rollout, extending Flexible Financing to one of Europe’s most dynamic hospitality markets.

Unlike traditional bank loans, Flexible Financing – offered by YouLend – adapts to the rhythms of hospitality. Hotels operate in cycles: peak season fuels growth, while quieter months demand resilience. Yet traditional financing rarely adjusts to that reality: it’s often slow to access, heavy on paperwork, and built around rigid repayment terms that don’t reflect how hospitality works.

Funding from YouLend gives hotels an upfront cash boost that’s repaid automatically through a share of daily card sales, making it easy to align repayments with business performance. Repayments are automatically deducted as a fixed percentage of daily revenue, flexing naturally with a hotel’s performance.

Hospitality runs on momentum, but too often, funding doesn’t. Thanks to our partnership with YouLend, we’re giving hotels a financial safety net in quiet periods and a springboard when opportunity knocks. With €2 million already funded across nine countries, this partnership is helping hoteliers everywhere access the capital they need, just when they need it. Susanne Sandler, SVP and General Manager of Fintech at Mews

Our partnership with Mews is a great example of a truly global, multi-geo collaboration. We’re proud to deliver a best-in-class funding experience to hoteliers across the United States and Europe, a segment of SMBs that continues to express strong demand for working capital to invest and expand their business. Max Shave, Head of Brokers & Intermediaries at YouLend

Eligible Mews Payments customers can apply online in minutes, without the paperwork, collateral, or credit checks associated with traditional loans. Funding decisions are typically made within 24–72 hours, with amounts ranging from €3,000 to €1,000,000 depending on card payment volumes.

Mews’ partnership with YouLend was incredibly valuable to our business. The application process was fast and simple, and in just a few days we received the financing we needed to fuel the growth of our business. All in all, faster than other options, which meant we had more time to dedicate to our guests. Patrick Fidder, owner of Hotel Fidder & Patrick's Whisky Bar in Zwolle, The Netherlands

Whether it’s upgrading rooms, investing in energy-efficient systems, or bridging a seasonal gap, Flexible Financing helps hoteliers act decisively while keeping cash flow predictable. Repayments automatically align with daily revenue, ensuring that hotels pay less during slower periods and more when business is strong.

[TITLE]Australia $2.25 Bn Athletic Footwear Market Trends, Competitive Landscape, Forecasts & Opportunities, 2020-2024 & 2025-2030F:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Australia Athletic Footwear Market by Region, Competition, Forecast & Opportunities, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Australia Athletic Footwear Market was valued at USD 1.61 Billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 2.25 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 5.80%.

The Australian athletic footwear market is experiencing robust growth, driven by increasing health consciousness, rising participation in sports and fitness activities, and the growing influence of athleisure trends. Consumers are prioritizing comfort, performance, and sustainability, with eco-friendly footwear gaining significant traction as brands like Adidas (Primegreen) and Nike (Space Hippie) introduce shoes made from recycled materials.

The market is also witnessing a surge in demand for specialized footwear, such as maximalist running shoes (e.g., Hoka One One) and versatile cross-trainers, catering to diverse fitness routines. E-commerce expansion and direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales channels are reshaping purchasing behaviors, with brands leveraging digital platforms for personalized shopping experiences.

Additionally, collaborations between athletic brands and celebrities or designers (e.g., Puma x Rihanna) are fueling fashion-driven demand. The children's segment is growing due to heightened focus on youth sports, while women's athletic footwear is benefiting from inclusive designs and style innovations. Technological advancements, including 3D printing and smart footwear with embedded sensors, are emerging as key differentiators.

Despite the dominance of global players like Nike and Adidas, local brands such as Frankie4 are carving niches in comfort and orthopedic segments. Inflation and supply chain disruptions pose challenges, but the market remains resilient, supported by Australia's strong fitness culture and the rising popularity of outdoor activities like hiking and trail running. Overall, the industry is poised for sustained growth, blending performance, sustainability, and lifestyle appeal to meet evolving consumer preferences.

Key Market Drivers

Rising Health and Fitness Awareness

The growing emphasis on health and wellness is a major driver of the Australian athletic footwear market. 70% of Australians aged 15+ participate in sports or physical activity at least once a week (Australian Sports Commission, 2024). With increasing obesity rates and government initiatives promoting active lifestyles, more Australians are engaging in sports, gym workouts, and outdoor activities.

Running, in particular, has seen a surge in popularity, supported by events like the Sydney Marathon and parkrun communities. The demand for performance-oriented footwear - such as cushioned running shoes (e.g., ASICS Gel-Kayano), cross-training shoes (e.g., Nike Metcon), and hiking boots - has risen significantly. Additionally, the post-pandemic shift toward home fitness has boosted sales of versatile athletic shoes suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Brands are capitalizing on this trend by offering technologically advanced footwear with features like enhanced shock absorption, breathability, and lightweight designs, catering to both amateur and professional athletes.

Key Market Challenges

Intense Competition and Market Saturation

The Australian athletic footwear market is highly competitive, dominated by global giants like Nike, Adidas, and Puma, alongside emerging local brands. This saturation makes it difficult for smaller players to gain market share, as consumers often favor established brands with strong marketing budgets and celebrity endorsements. Price wars and frequent discounting further squeeze profit margins, particularly for mid-tier and niche brands. Additionally, the rise of direct-to-consumer (DTC) models and e-commerce platforms has lowered barriers to entry, flooding the market with options and making brand differentiation increasingly challenging. Companies must continuously innovate in design, technology, and sustainability to stand out, which raises R&D costs and operational pressures.

Key Market Trends

Personalization and Customization

The demand for personalized athletic footwear is surging in Australia, driven by consumers seeking unique products tailored to their preferences. Brands like Nike and Adidas now offer customization platforms (e.g., Nike By You) that allow buyers to select colors, materials, and even performance features like cushioning levels. This trend extends beyond aesthetics - 3D foot scanning technology in retail stores enables precise fitting, reducing discomfort and injury risks.

Local startups are also entering the space, offering bespoke orthotic-friendly designs for niche segments like runners with specific gait needs. The rise of digital design tools and on-demand manufacturing further supports this shift, enabling brands to deliver one-of-a-kind products while minimizing overproduction waste. As consumers increasingly value individuality and performance optimization, personalization is becoming a key differentiator in the competitive athletic footwear market.
