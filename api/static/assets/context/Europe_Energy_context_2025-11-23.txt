European Energy has entered into a solar park operations agreement with Heartland, assuming responsibility for Gedmose solar park near Holstebro, Denmark, from January 2026.

This move marks the first time European Energy will operate a solar park it has not developed or owned, expanding its portfolio of operational activities within renewable energy.

The Gedmose solar park, owned by Heartland, was connected to the grid in 2021 and was Northern Europe’s largest at the time, with a capacity of 207MW.

Situated just outside Holstebro, the facility generates enough electricity to supply more than 50,000 households annually.

Under the new agreement, European Energy will further diversify its operational services.

The company currently is engaged in operational and asset management for 4GW of renewable energy capacity.

Electricity produced by the Gedmose solar park is sold to BESTSELLER, Normal, Nemlig.com, and Faerch under a power purchase agreement.

Heartland communications head Kasper Reggelsen said: “Gedmose solar park was established as part of our ambition to invest responsibly and with a long-term perspective in the green transition.

“In recent years, we have been reminded of the importance of a robust energy infrastructure that benefits everyone. We are pleased to gain a skilled partner to handle the day-to-day operations and ensure that the park continues to contribute efficiently to Denmark’s energy supply.”

European Energy plans to further expand its asset management and operations activities both in Denmark and across international markets.

European Energy asset management and operations EVP Jacob Saust Jacobsen said: “A key part of our strategic shift in asset management has been to offer our services to third-party owners – not only to the parks we develop ourselves.

“In recent years, we have also developed new technological solutions that enable us to optimise electricity production at a lower cost. Our ambition is for asset management to become a significant revenue driver for the company, and this agreement marks an important step forward in that direction.

“We therefore look forward to taking over the operations of Gedmose solar park and providing the owners with a stable and efficient partner.”

Last month, European Energy agreed to sell a 50% stake in its Saldus project in Latvia to Sampension, a Danish pension fund.

BRICS‑backed payments network now spans 185 countries.

Cryptopolitan ^ | 21 Nov 25 | Jai Hamid

Posted on by delta7

China’s CIPS payment system now operates in 185 countries, enabling yuan-based trade outside the dollar.

52 trillion yuan in transactions were settled through CIPS in 2023, covering 58% of China’s cross-border flows.

BRICS launched a yuan-pegged stablecoin and plans rupee bonds to expand use of local currencies.

The BRICS-linked Cross-Border Interbank Payments System (CIPS) has expanded across 185 countries, allowing international payments in Chinese yuan without using the U.S. dollar, according to data from the New Development Bank (NDB).

CIPS was launched by China and managed by its central bank as “a real alternative for global trade settlements.”

At the Shanghai Oil and Gas Exchange, liquefied natural gas contracts are now priced for and paid in yuan. Same thing with soybeans from the Shenzhen Qianhai Joint Trading Center.

China has allegedly already signed 40 settlement agreements with other countries, with total settlements through CIPS hitting 52 trillion yuan earlier this year, equal to 58% of China’s total cross-border transactions, a figure that tops the dollar in some measures.

Trade between China and Russia has been settled in local currencies for three straight years, covering 95% of their total trade volume. Still, not every country has joined the yuan system.

Europe, North America, and Australia have kept their distance, while developing economies in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe are using CIPS more frequently, especially for Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) loan repayments.

This is mainly for sanctioned countries like Russia, Iran and Venezuela. The problem with a currency like the yuan is capital controls. An international currency with these controls is a contradiction in terms. Mark Mobius, a legend in emerging markets mutual funds, had trouble getting his money out of China. People large sums in yuan want to switch out of the currency immediately.

As rates rise, bonds fall in price. So many sold, waiting for prices to improve. Now that the Fed is cutting rates, buyers are coming back in, offset by China selling hand over fist in preparation for Taiwan, and maybe more. As rates rise, bonds fall in price.

Note that no one expected either Pearl Harbor, or a Japanese lunge for Australia. Japan had a very thin record of expansion, established less than 50 years prior, with the addition of Korea and Formosa (aka Taiwan). Whereas China has a long record of empire-building, interrupted only by 2 centuries of weakness, from its start millennia earlier as a village on the Yellow River. But just prior to its 19th century weakness, the ruling house had doubled the size of the Ming empire it defeated.

Jackasses will blame BRICS, but the dollar isn’t a safe haven anymore. It once was “almighty,” until we weaponized and devalued it with outrageous spending on warmaking and socialism. Even doctors and PLUMBERS don’t want dollars, unless it’s lots and lots of them. Who can blame foreign investors for running away from it? I don’t want dollars, and get them out of the bank into something real as soon as possible. Instead of getting mad at BRICS, dummies should start turning dollars into hard assets, becoming self sufficient and getting ready for MUCH less buying power, or even possible systemic failure. Lowering tariffs on bananas won’t help much.

Sure it is. The dollar is unmatched for liquidity and market depth, courtesy of the US economy being the largest by 50%, and the most open, by far, of the big ones. People use the dollar not because it’s a protection racket or because they like Americans, but because it carries the least risk and the lowest transaction costs. Sure it is.

Asset freezes are normal in special circumstances. The US literally stole German assets in WW1 and WW2 for war financing. Not just money and real property. Patents, trademarks*, licenses - all were stolen. Germany, of course, did the same to US assets there. * The Bayer trademark reverted to its German parent 70 years after being seized, in the US, by the government. It had to be bought back from its US owner.

Trump is now saying there is 20 trillion dollars worth of new investments coming into the USA.(byo of comparison a total of 1 trillion dollars worth of new capital investments were made during the biden years.) So I’m not so sure that it matters. The aim is to return home much of the USA manufacturing base that has migrated overseas in the last 50 years. As well, the object is to first bring the trade deficit back into balance and then when the US masters the tools of the next industrial revolution—run up export surpluses. What we’re seeing rather is a rebalancing. We’re also going to see GDP gtowth o 5% plus for years to come. Restraining federal spending is what they are doing now. The growth and the explosion in the stock market AND new tarriff revenue is going to bring trillions into the federal coffers and balance the federal budget by late 2027. Pretty much the same thing happened in the late 1990’s. The feds under newt gingrich restrained spending while the economic growth and stock market expansion poured money into the federal government and balanced the budget. When the stock market boom abated in 2021—the federal budget went back into deficit again. This time the boom will have more legs because there is an industrial revolution behind it.

The Swiss franc is a rock solid currency. It has appreciated against the dollar for decades. Why don’t foreign countries use the franc? Because it’s a small economy, and the franc foreign exchange volume is low. That means transaction costs are high as a % of the value transacted. The kicker is that the Swiss central bank, instead of paying interest on large foreign-owned holdings of francs, charges foreigners interest on those holdings. The Swiss do it to discourage foreign holdings, prevent the franc from appreciating further, making Swiss exports uncompetitive, whether it’s drugs, chemicals, machine tools or luxury watches.

Sure it is. Yeah, suuuuuuure it is. That's why it's devaluing so quickly and investors - entire nations - are looking for alternatives, and finding them as we speak. What you call normal "asset freezes," the investor/victims call "theft." Eastern nations or anyone imagining their nation getting on some rash-thinking POTUS' s**t-list won't want any part of it. They're walking away right NOW - while you're telling us it won't happen. And over an insignificant trash heap - Ukraine - nothing nearly as significant as WWII. Unlike WWII we lost. Also service people and retailers don't want dollars - why should global investors?

Tectonic activity beneath the landmass, which involves intense heat and pressure, is behind the formation of such large veins of gold.

Several organizations are now planning to fund an industrial complex to process all that gold, which could potentially push China’s gold industry past rivals Russia and Australia.

[TITLE]COP30’s biofuel gamble could cost the global food supply — and the planet:
[TEXT]
First the plant stalk is harvested, shredded, and crushed. The extracted juice is then combined with bacteria and yeast in large bioreactors, where the sugars are metabolized and converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. From there, the liquid is typically distilled to maximize ethanol concentration, before it is blended with gasoline.

You know the final products as biofuels — mostly made from food crops like sugarcane and corn, and endorsed by everyone from agricultural lobbyists to activists and billionaires. Biofuels were developed decades ago to be cheaper, greener alternatives to planet-polluting petrol. As adoption has expanded — now to the point of a pro-biofuel agenda being pushed this week at COP30 in Belém, Brazil — their environmental and food accessibility footprint has remained a source of fierce debate.

The governments of Brazil, Italy, Japan, and India are spearheading a new pledge calling for the rapid global expansion of biofuels as a commitment to decarbonizing transportation energy.

Though the text of the pledge itself is vague, as most COP pledges tend to be, the target embedded in an accompanying International Energy Agency report is clear: expand the global use of so-called sustainable fuels from 2024 levels by at least four times, so that by 2035, sustainable fuels cover 10 percent of all global road transport demand, 15 percent of aviation demand, and 35 percent of shipping fuel demand. By Friday, the last official day of COP30, at least 23 countries have joined the pledge — while Brazilian delegates have been working “hand in hand with industry groups” to get language backing biofuels into the final summit deal.

“Latin America, South East Asia, Africa — they need to improve their efficiency, their energy, and Brazil has a model for this [in its rollout of biofuels],” Roberto Rodrigues, Brazil’s special envoy for agriculture at the summit, said on a COP panel last weekend. As of the time of this story’s publication, the pro-biofuel language hadn’t made it into the latest draft text that outlines the main outcome of the summit released Friday — although it appears the summit could end without a deal.

Though scientists continue to experiment with utilizing other raw materials for biofuels — a list which includes agricultural and forestry waste, cooking oils, and algae — the bulk of feedstocks almost exclusively come from the fields. Different types of food crops are used for different types of biofuels; sugary and starchy crops, such as sugar cane, wheat, and corn, are often made into ethanol; while oily crops, like soybeans, rapeseed, and palm oil, are largely used for biodiesel.

The cycle goes a little like this: Farmers, desperate to replace cropland lost to biofuel production, raze more forests and plow up more grasslands, resulting in deforestation that tends to release far more carbon than burning biofuels saves. But as large-scale production continues to expand, there may be insufficient land, water, and energy available for another big biofuel boom — prompting many researchers and climate activists to question whether countries should be aiming to scale these markets at all. (Thomson Reuters reported that global biofuel production has increased ninefold since 2000.) Biofuels account for the vast majority of “sustainable fuels” currently used worldwide.

To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How

An analysis by a clean transport advocacy organization published last month found that, because of the indirect impacts to farming and land use, biofuels are responsible globally for 16 percent more CO2 emissions than the planet-polluting fossil fuels they replace. In fact, the report surmises that by 2030, biofuel crops could require land equivalent to the size of France. More than 40 million hectares of Earth’s cropland is already devoted to biofuel feedstocks, an area roughly the size of Paraguay. The EU Deforestation-Free Regulation, or EUDR, cites soybeans among the commodities driving deforestation worldwide.

“While countries are right to transition away from fossil fuels, they also need to ensure their plans don’t trigger unintended consequences, such as more deforestation either at home or abroad,” said Janet Ranganathan, managing director of strategy, learning, and results at the World Resources Institute in a statement responding to the Belém pledge. She added that rapidly expanding global biofuel production would have “significant implications for the world’s land, especially without guardrails to prevent large-scale expansion of land dedicated to biofuels, which drives ecosystem loss.”

Other environmental issues found to be associated with converting food crops into biofuels include water pollution from fertilizers and pesticides, air pollution, and soil erosion. One study, conducted a decade ago, showed that, when accounting for all the inputs needed to produce different varieties of ethanol or biodiesel — machinery, seeds, water, electricity, fertilizers, transportation, and more — producing fuel-grade ethanol or biodiesel requires significantly more energy input than it creates.

Nonetheless, it’s not a shock to see Brazil betting big on biofuels at COP30. In Brazil, biofuels make up roughly a quarter of transportation fuels — a remarkably high proportion compared to most other countries. And that share, dominated by sugarcane ethanol, is still on an upward climb, with the Belém pledge evidence of the country’s intended trajectory.

A spokesperson from Brazil’s foreign affairs ministry told The Guardian that the “proponents of the pledge (which include Japan, Italy, India, among others) are calling upon countries to support quadrupling production and use of sustainable fuels — a group of gaseous and liquid fuels that include e-fuels, biogases, biofuels, hydrogen and its derivatives.” They added that the goal is based on the new IEA report that underscores the production increase as necessary to aggressively reduce emissions. That report suggests that if current and proposed national and international policies are implemented and fully legislated, global biofuel use and production would double by 2035. “The word ‘sustainable’ is not used lightly, neither in the report nor in the pledge,” the spokesperson said.

The issue, of course, is in how emissions footprints of something like ethanol fuel production are even measured. Much like many other climate sources, scientists argue that tracking greenhouse gas emissions linked to ethanol fuel should account for emissions at every stage — production, processing, distribution, and vehicle use. Yet that isn’t often the case: in fact, a 2024 paper found that Brazil’s national biofuel policy does not account for all direct and indirect emissions in its calculation.

The exclusions are evident of a larger trend, according to University of Minnesota environmental scientist Jason Hill. “Overall, either those studies have not included [direct and indirect emissions], or they found ways to spread those impacts over anticipated production, decades, centuries, or so forth, that tend to dilute those effects. So the accounting methods aren’t really consistent with what the best science shows,” said Hill, who studies the environmental and economic consequences of food, energy, and biofuel production.

In short: More biofuels means either more intensive agriculture on a smaller share of available cropland, which has its own detrimental environmental effects, or expansion of cropland, and the land-use emissions and environmental impacts that can carry. “Biofuel production today is already a bad idea. And doubling [that] is doubling down on an existing problem,” said Hill.

Moreover, diverting crops like corn and soybeans from dinner plates to fuel tanks doesn’t just spark brutal competition for land and resources, it can also spike food prices and leave the world’s most vulnerable populations with less to eat.

A 2022 analysis of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, the world’s largest biofuel program, found that it has led to increased food prices for Americans, with corn prices rising by 30 percent and other crops such as soybean and wheat spiking by around 20 percent. This then set off a domino effect: Increasing annual nationwide fertilizer use by up to 8 percent and water quality degradants by up to 5 percent. The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the mandate has ended up at least equaling the planet-polluting effects of gasoline.

“Biofuel mandates essentially create a baseline demand that can leave food crops by the wayside,” says Ginni Braich, a data scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder who has worked as a senior advisor to government clean technology and emission reduction programs. That’s because of the issue with supply and demand of food crops — higher competition for feedstocks hikes up the prices of food, feed, and farming inputs.

When there are biofuel mandates, which the IEA report underlying the Belém pledge recommends, demand remains inelastic — no matter the changes in yields, growing and weather conditions, prices, or markets. Say there is a huge drought that decimates crop yields, as one example, the baseline demand of biofuels still needs to be met despite depleted food stocks. In terms of supply, increasing growing area for biofuels typically means less area available to grow food crops — which can cause prices to surge alongside supply shortages, and spike costs of seed, inputs, and land.

Nutritional implications should also be taken into account, according to Braich. Not only do people’s diets tend to shift when food gets more costly, but cropping patterns are already revealing adverse shifts in dietary diversity, which could be exacerbated by a further concentration on fewer crops. The Belém pledge, and Brazil’s intention to lead a global expansion of the biofuels market, does not bode well for people’s food accessibility nor for the future of the planet, warns Braich.

“It seems quite paradoxical for Brazil to promote the large-scale expansion of biofuels and also be seen as a protector of forests,” she said. “Is it better than decarbonization and fossil fuel divestment rhetoric without actual transition pathways? Yes, but in a lot of ways it is also greenwashing.”

[TITLE]BMW Warns Europe Is Losing the Hydrogen Race:
[TEXT]
BMW Group CEO Oliver Zipse is sharpening his warning that Europe—and Germany in particular—is falling behind in the global race to industrialize hydrogen technologies. Speaking at the Automobilwoche Kongress in November, he emphasized, according to Automotive News, that the biggest investments in next-generation drivetrains are now happening in Asia and the United States, not in Europe. In his view, hydrogen has moved from a niche experiment to a strategic technology that other regions are scaling far more aggressively.

Zipse noted that while Europe has directed the majority of its regulatory and political focus toward battery-electric vehicles, countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and the U.S. (especially California) are building long-term strategies that treat hydrogen as a serious pillar of future mobility.

BMW Remains One of Europe’s Last Hydrogen Holdouts

Among European automakers, BMW stands out almost alone in continuing to develop hydrogen fuel cell passenger vehicles. The company has decades of experience in the field, starting with hydrogen combustion experiments in the early 2000s and evolving into modern fuel cell systems that operate much like battery-electric vehicles, but with electricity generated onboard.

Unlike combustion prototypes of past decades, today’s fuel cell architecture is built around electric motors and shares much of its hardware with BMW’s BEVs. The difference is how energy is stored and generated. This is where BMW sees value: fast refueling, consistent performance in very cold or very hot climates, and lighter onboard energy storage for long-distance driving.

iX5 Hydrogen to Enter Production in 2028

The clearest example of BMW’s continued commitment is the iX5 Hydrogen. After several years of global testing and a dedicated pilot fleet, BMW will move the vehicle into series production in 2028. Volumes will remain relatively low, but this marks the first time BMW will build a hydrogen-powered model as part of its regular manufacturing roadmap, not just as a technology showcase.

The fuel cell stack is produced in Germany, the hydrogen tanks store gas at very high pressure, and a compact battery buffer supplies short bursts of power during hard acceleration. The entire system was engineered to integrate into the existing X5 platform with minimal structural changes. That compatibility is a key part of BMW’s belief that future platforms need to remain flexible rather than locked to a single propulsion type.

Public Funding Helps, but Not Enough to Catch Up

BMW’s fuel cell development is supported by €273 million in public funding from the German federal government and the state of Bavaria through the EU’s IPCEI Hydrogen initiative. The investment is intended to support industrialization of a scalable fuel cell powertrain for passenger vehicles.

Even with this support, Zipse argued that Germany is not advancing fast enough compared with regions that treat hydrogen as an industrial priority. He warned that if Europe continues to rely on a narrow interpretation of future mobility, the continent risks losing influence over an entire technology sector.

Skepticism Remains Strong

Many analysts remain unconvinced that hydrogen has a meaningful future in passenger cars. Critics argue that fuel cell vehicles are still expensive to produce, lack infrastructure, and trail far behind BEVs in maturity. Some also say the efficiency losses in hydrogen production and distribution make it difficult for the technology to compete on cost.

These views reflect the broader policy environment BMW finds itself in: Europe has largely aligned itself behind battery-electric mobility and expects BEVs to dominate new car sales from the mid-2030s onward.

Zipse Pushes Back on EU’s Regulatory Direction

Zipse has become one of the industry’s strongest voices criticizing the EU’s “tailpipe-only” regulatory framework. He argues that the current rules ignore the broader decarbonization work automakers are already doing, from low-carbon steel sourcing to renewable-powered factories and cleaner supply chains. In his view, regulations should account for a vehicle’s entire lifecycle emissions, not just what comes out of the exhaust.

BMW’s position is that relying on a single technology increases risk and reduces Europe’s industrial resilience. Zipse said the company’s flexible platform strategy—making it possible to build BEVs, hybrids, combustion engines, and hydrogen fuel cell models on the same basic structure—is essential to serving global markets with different infrastructure realities and energy constraints.

Where BMW Sees Hydrogen Playing a Role

Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are not intended to replace BEVs, but BMW sees them as a practical alternative in specific scenarios. These include markets without reliable fast-charging networks, regions with limited electrical grid capacity, and use cases where range consistency and quick refueling matter, such as long-distance driving or heavy loads. BMW believes hydrogen could also appeal to customers who cannot easily adopt a pure battery-electric lifestyle.

BMW’s hydrogen program is still low-volume, but the move to series production of the iX5 Hydrogen marks a major shift for the company. Zipse said interest from international partners continues to grow and expects hydrogen to play a larger role in BMW’s portfolio later in the decade, assuming Europe keeps pace on infrastructure, funding, and regulatory flexibility.

His message was direct: if Europe decides not to develop hydrogen, other regions will gladly take the lead.

[TITLE]Nuclear’s Costly Comeback Meets Harsh Market Reality:
[TEXT]
I’ve followed the promise of small modular reactors (SMRs) and next-generation nuclear in several of my earlier pieces on OilPrice. The argument is familiar: nuclear provides low-carbon baseload, ensures energy security, and will one day deliver affordable, clean power. It sounds persuasive, until you look at the numbers. New nuclear remains slow, expensive, and deeply reliant on state support. In today’s European power markets, where renewables are already driving prices to record lows or even negative territory, the idea that nuclear can deliver “cheap and secure” power no longer holds up.

Expensive power disguised as security

Let’s start with the UK. Hinkley Point C, the flagship of the country’s nuclear revival, was only made possible through a 35-year Contract for Difference guaranteeing a strike price of £92.50 per MWh (in 2012 money). That’s roughly double the current wholesale market price, indexed to inflation, and fully guaranteed by taxpayers. It isn’t market competitiveness, it’s a subsidy designed to get the project financed.

Sizewell C will take the same path under a Regulated Asset Base model, transferring part of the construction risk directly to consumers through levies on electricity bills long before a single watt is produced. When “cheap” energy requires that level of public underwriting, something is fundamentally off.

A track record written in red ink

This pattern isn’t unique to Britain. France’s Flamanville reactor, long touted as the EPR showpiece, is over a decade late and has quadrupled in cost to more than €13 billion. Finland’s Olkiluoto 3 only began commercial operations after 17 years of delays and legal disputes. In the United States, Vogtle 3 and 4 finally came online after 15 years and around $36 billion in total costs, double initial projections, with ratepayers footing much of the bill through regulated recovery.

Related: 5 Utility Stocks Outperforming The Market

The nuclear industry’s narrative of reliability is at odds with its delivery record. Projects start with optimism and end with budget blowouts, political fallout, and consumer bailouts.

The SMR Illusion

Advocates often pivot to SMRs as the saviour, the “Tesla moment” for nuclear. I explored that hype in an earlier OilPrice article, noting that SMRs were being promoted as modular, factory-built, and inherently cheaper. Yet so far, reality looks familiar.

The most advanced U.S. SMR project, NuScale’s Carbon Free Power Project in Idaho, was cancelled in 2023 after projected costs rose to $89 per MWh, far above renewables and storage. Other designs remain on paper, heavily dependent on public subsidies or guaranteed offtake. The promise of small reactors may eventually prove out, but at the moment, SMRs are an idea with a press office, not a business case.

The market reality has shifted

Europe’s electricity markets tell the other half of the story. In 2024, countries like Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands each recorded more than 450 hours of negative day-ahead prices. France saw nearly 360. Across the EU, negative or ultra-low price hours exceeded 9,000 in total.

For inflexible, capital-intensive baseload assets like nuclear, that’s disastrous. These plants can’t ramp down profitably when prices collapse. Their economics depend on constant, high utilization, and that world is disappearing. The more renewables come online, the more volatile the price pattern becomes, with long stretches of near-zero wholesale power. Nuclear simply doesn’t fit this market geometry.

Renewables and storage are doing what nuclear can’t

The contrast is striking. Renewables can be deployed modularly, financed privately, and built within 18–36 months. Utility-scale batteries, once dismissed as expensive, are now scaling at record speed. Europe installed nearly 22 GWh of new storage capacity in 2024, bringing total installed capacity above 60 GWh. Italy’s first grid-scale auction secured 10 GWh of storage at competitive prices, no decade-long delays, no multi-billion-euro risk exposure.

Each incremental gigawatt of storage turns volatile wind and solar into a more stable, dispatchable asset. In that environment, nuclear’s supposed advantage of “firm capacity” starts to look less like a virtue and more like an anchor.

Security means flexibility, not monoliths

Nuclear advocates still frame the argument in security terms, stable, domestic generation insulated from fossil-fuel geopolitics. But in modern energy systems, security no longer means “always-on baseload.” It means adaptability, diversification, and resilience.

A network built from distributed solar, wind, storage, and demand-side flexibility is inherently harder to disrupt. It can absorb shocks, balance local fluctuations, and restart quickly after failures. A multi-billion-euro single-site nuclear facility, by contrast, is a high-value target for cost escalation, technical failure, or even physical risk.

Energy security in the 2020s is about systems thinking, not megaproject symbolism.

The economics of opportunity cost

Every euro sunk into new nuclear is a euro not available for faster, cheaper solutions. A 10 billion-euro reactor might take 15 years to produce its first electrons. The same money could build tens of gigawatts of solar and wind, backed by large-scale storage, grid upgrades, and hydrogen electrolysers to absorb surplus power, all online before the nuclear project breaks ground.

The opportunity cost is immense. Renewable portfolios are now financeable at market rates; nuclear requires a bespoke government rescue package before it even begins.

A niche role, not a blueprint

To be clear, existing reactors that can be safely life-extended make sense. Extending France’s fleet, or upgrading proven units, delivers low-carbon energy at marginal cost. But that’s asset management, not a case for new construction.

Building a fresh wave of reactors on 20-year timelines, in a power market already defined by negative pricing and flexible storage, is a strategic mismatch. Nuclear can remain a niche contributor, but not the foundation of affordable or adaptable decarbonization.

Conclusion: The future has moved on

The myth of nuclear as “secure, clean, and cheap” collapses under scrutiny. It is clean once built, but rarely cheap, and often far from secure when you consider financing and policy risk. Meanwhile, renewables plus storage are delivering real, scalable, market-driven results right now.

We no longer live in a world where the problem is lack of technology. The challenge is choosing the right ones for the energy system we are actually building, a fast, flexible, decentralized grid where adaptability equals security.

Nuclear still has a role in some places. But pretending it will power a new era of cheap, secure energy is not realism, it’s nostalgia.

[TITLE]How to make the data center buildout in North Carolina cleaner, cheaper and more predictable:
[TEXT]
Data centers are popping up all across the nation, causing electric utilities to grapple with how to provide for these new power-hungry customers while managing costs — and North Carolina is no different.

A recent hearing at the North Carolina Utilities Commission focused on how to handle data centers, a.k.a. “Large Load” customers, who are driving up electricity demand and creating a “who pays for what” conundrum.

EDF put forward expert witnesses Jeff Bower and Karan Pol of Daymark Energy Advisors, who have experience working in states across the country grappling with the same problems. Our expert witnesses had two main recommendations in their written and oral testimony:

Improve forecasts of data center load to avoid unnecessary investments and emissions; and

Protect existing customers from bearing the brunt of cost impacts and reduce uncertainty around the data center buildout by using “large load tariffs.”

Achieving these objectives won’t be easy, but it’s critical that we develop sustainable solutions that insulate households while meeting the energy needs of this growing industry.

Large load tariffs

Across the country we are seeing many states attempting to limit the cost risks to their shareholders and customers by negotiating what are commonly called “large load tariffs” — custom rates and standardized contracts that utilities institute for large new projects above a certain threshold of annual electricity usage — which usually includes data centers. In other words, these are contracts that can protect households from footing the bill for the costs associated with data centers.

In North Carolina, this could take any number of forms. For example, stakeholders in Kansas came to agreement on the parameters of a structure and submitted it to their state commission for approval. In North Carolina, despite the announcement of a Clean Transition Tariff that Duke Energy worked on with a number of partners in May 2024, all such discussions have remained behind closed doors with no input from the public and no actual proposed tariff ever filed before the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

Fortunately, North Carolina has a good opportunity coming up to change that. Duke Energy recently filed notice that it will be initiating multi-year rate case proceedings before the end of 2025. These rate cases are exactly the kind of venue in which discussions

[TITLE]Private 5G for utilities: Benefits, use cases and deployment:
[TEXT]
5G hit a major milestone in early 2025, with industry association 5G Americas reporting more than 2.25 billion connections worldwide.

The United States and Canada, with 182 million 5G connections, had some of the highest adoption rates in the world, 5G Americas President Viet Nguyen wrote in the organization's "State of 5G" report.

Although 5G adoption is happening at a much faster clip than 4G, the previous generation of cellular technology, the report noted that enterprise adoption and positive business results are not equally distributed.

The utility sector, for example, is among the industries where ROI models are still evolving, according to Nguyen.

Still, utilities are using 5G to enable numerous use cases, from remote monitoring to predictive maintenance. And while utilities sometimes use public networks, many are implementing private 5G networks for the security, control and other benefits they bring.

"Utilities aren't buying the next G. They are buying control, coverage and cyber-resilience," wrote Titus M, a practice director at Everest Group who focuses on network services and 5G, in an email. "Private 5G is simply the tool that best delivers those outcomes at scale. For utilities, outcomes such as worker safety, faster restoration, better video and IoT performance, and fewer truck rolls come first. Private 5G happens to be the best fit in many sites because it combines managed spectrum and mobility and local control."

Why are utility companies adopting private 5G? Both the public and private versions of this fifth-generation mobile network offer ultra-fast speeds, low latency and massive device connectivity, said David Witkowski, senior member of IEEE, an association of electrical and computer engineers and other technologists. Public and private 5G both use similar technologies, such as spectrum bands and network slicing. And they both support advanced applications like IoT connectivity and automation. However, public 5G is operated by telecom providers and serves the general population -- consumers and enterprise users alike, Witkowski explained. In contrast, private organizations typically deploy and manage their own 5G infrastructure with tailored security and performance standards, making it the better choice for many organizations, including utilities, for mission-critical operations. "If Wi-Fi, wired or public 4G/5G met those outcomes just as well, they'd use those instead, but right now private 5G is the best-fit option," M said.

Benefits of private 5G for utilities Deploying private 5G offers advantages and benefits over public 5G, private LTE networks and Wi-Fi for all industries, according to several experts. They include the following: Connectivity where it's wanted and needed. There are still regions where 5G standalone (SA) networks -- which employ 5G technology exclusively -- aren't yet available and are instead covered by 5G with a 4G core, known as non-standalone (NSA). Some regions still have only 4G, and some have no cellular service at all. "If you're in the petroleum industry and working the patch in Texas, cell phone coverage is not that great," Witkowski said. Organizations that need connectivity in such areas could use Wi-Fi, but private 5G is a more reliable and powerful option that supports more use cases.

Organizations that need connectivity in such areas could use Wi-Fi, but private 5G is a more reliable and powerful option that supports more use cases. Management capabilities. Private 5G enables the owner to manage the network. For example, a utility could assign sensors that monitor critical infrastructure a higher priority than other devices for accessing the network, said Michele Polese, assistant research professor in electrical and computer engineering at Northeastern University.

Complete control. "You have complete control over your infrastructure, of the underlying bytes and the applications," Polese said. The control extends to end devices, such as handsets deployed in remote locations, which don't have to be upgraded just because the public network was upgraded to new standards. "You don't want those to become obsolete," he said. "You can maintain devices longer than if you were on a public infrastructure."

Private 5G allows the owner to tailor the network to their use cases, coverage needs and the quality of service for different components, Polese said. Moreover, owners can change and adjust that customization as their needs change. "It doesn't have to be static."

It's harder to hack private 5G because the equipment is harder to access, and hackers generally don't see the payoff for taking so much time and effort to get into it.

Witkowski said private 5G offers what he termed "privacy through obscurity."

Strong authentication mechanisms. This is another security and management benefit that private 5G offers, Witkowski said.

This is another security and management benefit that private 5G offers, Witkowski said. Higher power limits than Wi-Fi. "Wi-Fi operates under a license by right from the federal government, and that means Wi-Fi has a power limitation it has to adhere to," Witkowski said. But private 5G offers higher power limits, which makes it more powerful and enables owners of private 5G networks to put up bigger antennae and point signals farther out. "You can minimize the access points needed but still get to all the nodes you want to talk to, which reduces cost and complexity compared to Wi-Fi," he said.

Although organizations should expect significant capital expenditure to implement and deploy a private network, the long-term costs could be less than using public 5G, Polese said.

Use cases for private 5G in utilities Utilities, like companies in other sectors, are using 5G to drive modernization, support automation and enable process transformation. With private 5G enabling them to create connections wherever they need them on ultra-reliable, low-latency networks, organizations that produce, transmit and deliver electricity, water and gas are employing the technology for a variety of uses, including the following: Advanced and automated metering. According to M, 5G enables the two-way communication required for smart meters and automated readings -- a big efficiency gain for the sector. Automation. Private 5G supports real-time control and monitoring of facilities such as electric substations. Remote monitoring and inspection. This is one of the most prolific 5G-enabled use cases in the utility industry, Polese said. Examples are plentiful. IoT sensors along water or gas pipelines detect anomalies, such as pressure drops or vibrations, with private 5G assuring that alerts are instantly and reliably conveyed to central operations. Water utilities can monitor tank levels, water quality and pump performance in real time, even in remote areas. Gas companies watch for leaks along hundreds of miles of pipelines. Electric companies can have substation video surveillance and mobile inspection robots. Offshore generation facilities can transmit data on weather and sea conditions and send real-time video feeds to shore. Additionally, M said all kinds of utilities can use 5G to support mobile inspection robots and drone inspections, both of which need the high speed, low latency and bandwidth provided by 5G. Remote switching, grid control and grid load management. Utilities can remotely manage grid segments, reroute power and restore service during outages, improving operational agility, Kumar said. For example, private 5G enables dynamic load balancing during peak usage by transmitting real-time data from substations and consumers. The real-time data combined with AI also enables dynamic pricing. Predictive maintenance. Kumar said 5G supports the vast amount of data that must be transmitted from the decentralized locations that characterize utility operations to edge or centralized locations for analysis, thereby allowing utilities to predict maintenance needs and prevent failures across larger parts of their infrastructure. Field communications and tracking. Private 5G delivers connectivity wherever utilities want to deploy it, enabling communications among field crews and tracking capabilities so that utilities can more effectively manage crews, vehicles and equipment, Kumar said.

Deployment challenges and considerations Utilities encounter various challenges when deploying private 5G networks and using the technology to improve operations, service and safety -- just as organizations of all kinds typically do when implementing any tech-driven initiative. To start, utilities must acquire a license for their private 5G network, Witkowski said. The Federal Communications Commission is the license-granting authority in the United States. Licenses aren't automatic and can come with restrictions and limitations. Witkowski pointed specifically to licenses granted in coastal zones, where the U.S. Navy has priority to use certain spectrums. Utilities also must allocate sufficient funds to buy and implement the infrastructure, which can be a significant cost. "Private 5G is a costly affair," M said. Choosing and designing the right architecture is another challenge. M said utilities can choose between fully private standalone 5G, or hybrid architectures with public roaming, or parts that are complemented with Wi-Fi. Utilities must also match the infrastructure to the available spectrum. He said he advises utilities to pilot on two look-alike sites before scaling and to treat the infrastructure as operational technology -- not just an IT refresh. Integration with existing systems and coexistence with legacy technologies can present additional challenges. "Private 5G is good for critical operations needing control, coverage and security," M said, adding that utilities should have realistic goals. "Do not think of it as a replacement for good old wired connections. It's a solution to be considered when wired is not an option."

[TITLE]Can the ‘fog clear’ to deliver clean Irish offshore wind energy?:
[TEXT]
A turbine being installed at the Neart na Gaoithe offshore wind farm off the east coast of Scotland. Ireland has not built an offshore wind farm for 20 years.

The global offshore wind energy sector is in the doldrums due to hostility from Donald Trump; supply chain bottlenecks, planning uncertainties, and high costs.

The North Sea boasts of having the best wind speeds in the world – averaging 9 metres per second – and yet following the German government offer of two prime sites off its coastline recently, not one developer bid for a contract. Ireland has even better wind speeds from the Atlantic but it has not built an offshore wind farm in 20 years.

The world market for offshore renewable energy (ORE) has soured in less than 18 months. Trump’s scuppering of fully financed and permitted offshore wind farms has undermined mood music but higher interest rates, a row-back on net-zero ambitions, and energy companies weakening or abandoning decarbonisation commitments and doubling down on fossil fuels have all played a part.

Some 24 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity and offtake agreements were cancelled since 2023, according to energy analysts Wood Mackenzie. Just 1GW powers the equivalent of 1 million homes.

Last June, the Norwegian company Statkraft announced it is to stop further activities in new offshore wind projects, including floating wind, but will continue developing the 500MW North Irish Sea Array (NISA) in the Irish Sea.

Statkraft’s senior vice-president and managing director for Ireland and UK, Kevin O’Donovan, is well placed to outline why, despite the dismal global picture, Ireland is well placed to scale up its ORE. He provided that perspective at a recent National Economic and Social Council (Nesc) conference. It was a frank assessment layered with realistic optimism by prioritising ways forward.

Wind turbines in the Irish sea

Firstly, O’Donovan wants to underline progress made in Ireland over the past 25 years, with wind technology efficiency increasing by a factor of 20.

He recalls how, two decades ago, ESB National Grid (a forerunner to EirGrid) said that Ireland would never have more than 300-500MW of wind energy on our grid system. Any more and the system would break down.

“[Today] we have over 5,000 megawatts of wind on our system, and heading for two gigawatts of solar,” O’Donovan adds.

[ Fossil fuel dependence ‘is Ireland’s biggest block’ to achieving carbon emissions cutsOpens in new window ]

He was impressed by Minister for Energy Darragh O’Brien’s “positive vision for where we need to go”, with emphasis on delivery. The industry needs to “show people we can deliver on what needs to be achieved over the next decade and the technology is, for me, the way we will achieve that”.

Ireland stands out in Europe as a good market for renewables, with clear policy and plans backed by strong political consensus. We have had significant success but sometimes “get a little bit too focused on targets and the timing of those targets and on the net zero discussion”.

Statkraft is Europe’s largest producer and trader of renewables, yet even it would say “we can’t fully tell you right now how we’re going to get to net zero ... it would be far better focusing on we actually have the technologies right now to deliver 80 per cent of all our electricity [from renewables] by 2030 to 2031 or 2032, maybe”.

That amounts to huge electrification of Irish transport and heating sectors using wind and solar, the cheapest renewables – “and basically electrifying our economy”. This requires focus on delivery, recognising “every megawatt hour we get on the system, year-on-year for this next decade, is going to put us in a better position”.

Ireland stands out in Europe as a good market for renewables.

O’Donovan does not want to moan given significant progress but challenges needed to be overcome. Reforms to the Planning Act took too long and implementation could be another year. “We have very good aspirations and very good plans. It’s the implementation and the fast implementations where we fall down.”

Statkraft is one of the four projects with Offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (ORESS) contracts. It was in a position to easily complete it by 2030. It submitted its bid two years ago, assuming planning would be secured within 12 months. “Today, we are 16 months and counting since we submitted our planning application,” he says.

Statkraft had to print out 10,000 pages per application and submit up to 20 copies, which required hiring a van. “That alone shows where we need to start getting more efficient. For goodness sake, just digitise the thing. Every other country is doing that.”

More frustration followed, waiting nine months for An Bord Pleanála (now An Coimisiún Pleanála) to issue a “further information request”.

“What was issued is something that requires years of further surveys, millions of euros of further investment before we could even respond to all of the requests,” he says.

Statkraft then spent seven months waiting for the commission to have a meeting with it, to explain that it had provided much of the required information.

It will probably be mid-2027 before planning is granted. The Minister hoped turbines would be in the water by 2030 but “if we can’t have faster decision-making time, then that won’t happen”, O’Donovan says.
