[TITLE]Verb Technology Company (Nasdaq: VERB) Successfully Closes $558 Million Private Placement to Launch First Publicly Listed TON Treasury Strategy Company, in Partnership with Kingsway Capital:
[TEXT]
LAS VEGAS, Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verb Technology Company, Inc. (Nasdaq: VERB) (“the Company”), today announced the successful closing of its previously announced upsized and oversubscribed $558 million private placement (“PIPE transaction”), in partnership with Kingsway Capital (“Kingsway”). The completion of the PIPE transaction marks a critical milestone in the Company’s plans to become the first and largest publicly traded treasury reserve of Toncoin ($TON). $TON is the native cryptocurrency of TON blockchain, the blockchain integrated with Telegram, one of the world's most widely used messaging platforms.

The PIPE transaction, which priced approximately 58.7 million shares of common stock, included participation from over 110 institutional and crypto-native investors, led by Kingsway and anchored by Vy Capital, Blockchain.com, Ribbit Capital, and Graticule (GAMA). Additional investors include CMCC Global, Pantera, MEXC Ventures, ParaFi Capital, Luxor Capital, Arrington Capital, Animoca, Kraken, Primitive Ventures, BitGo, FalconX, Orbs Group, The Open Platform (TOP), TVM Ventures, Kenetic, Hivemind Capital, UNCAP, Pacific Coast Venture Partners, and several high-profile crypto founders like Guy Young, Founder of Ethena Labs.

“As the exclusive blockchain infrastructure powering Telegram’s Mini App ecosystem, we believe in the utility and potential growth in adoption of Toncoin,” said Manuel Stotz, incoming Executive Chairman. “With today’s completed placement and the backing of an exceptional list of investors, we are building a next-generation treasury platform to define a new category of digital asset reserves.”

Company Strategy

The Company plans to immediately begin using the majority of the net proceeds from the PIPE transaction to acquire $TON, which will serve as its primary treasury reserve asset. The strategy is expected to generate sustainable staking rewards to initiate, manage, and grow the Company’s $TON exposure in a cash flow positive manner. The Company intends to rebrand as TON Strategy Co. (“TSC”) to reflect its new direction. In addition, the Company will continue to operate its existing business units, each of which leverages its social commerce technology and video marketing expertise, which are expected to expand.

Company Leadership and Special Advisor

As previously announced, the Company will be led by a deeply experienced team driving its digital asset strategy:

Segment Insights & Market Share Analysis of the Semiconductor Vacuum Valve Market:

The global semiconductor vacuum valve market is segmented based on technology type, material type, process type, function type, valve type, and region.

Based on technology type –

The market is segmented into pneumatic, manual, and other technology types. Among these, pneumatic valves are expected to remain dominant and are likely to experience the fastest growth during the forecast period . They stand out due to their high resistance to temperature variations, dust, and most chemical solutions.

. They stand out due to their high resistance to temperature variations, dust, and most chemical solutions. Pneumatic valves can also withstand high pressure and vacuum—critical features in semiconductor production. With fewer components and simpler structures than other types, they require minimal maintenance, reducing offline time. While actuation can be pneumatic, electric, or based on other advanced technologies, pneumatic valves continue to lead the market due to their cost-effectiveness.

Based on the material type –

The market is segmented into stainless steel, aluminum, and other materials. Amongst this, Stainless Steel is currently the most dominant material type and is also likely to grow at the fastest pace during the forecast period. Stainless steel valves, stainless steel is a very sturdy material with excellent corrosion resistance, so it adapts well to the severe conditions of the semiconductor manufacturing processes that involve high temperatures and aggressive chemicals.

Stainless steel valves, stainless steel is a very sturdy material with excellent corrosion resistance, so it adapts well to the severe conditions of the semiconductor manufacturing processes that involve high temperatures and aggressive chemicals. Stainless steel has very low particle emissions, which is a very important factor in semiconductor production, where even a spatter of particles can disrupt production. They prefer using autoclaves to ensure they are extremely sterile and free from contamination. It has been learned that operations involving semiconductor manufacturing entail much time. Thus, stainless-steel valves do not rust and need not be replaced often; this eliminates time.

The region serves as a global base for the production of various commodities, such as consumer electronics, automobiles, and telecommunications equipment. The continued demand for these products contributes indirectly to the growth of semiconductors, which in turn promotes the use of valves.

Major capital expenditures in new fabs around the Asia Pacific region also help to maintain the region’s global leadership. Taiwan, South Korea, China, and Japan are among the largest semiconductor-producing nations globally.

Semiconductor Vacuum Valve Market Drivers:

Some of the key drivers listed in the report are given below.

The growth of the semiconductor vacuum valve market includes the organic growth of the semiconductor industry.

The increased requirement for high-purity components.

The enhanced demand for electronics and consumer products.

Increased investment in fabrication plants for semiconductors, enhanced cleanliness standards, and the need for accurate and reliable flow control.
