[TITLE]BluePine Energy to raise $500-750 million in 12-18 months:
[TEXT]
BluPine Energy plans to raise $500-750 million, or around ₹4,500-6,500 crore in the next 12-18 months, which will help the company fund part of its more than 3 gigawatt (GW) of contracted capacity under development.

The renewable power producer is advancing towards its 4 GW goal by end-2027, which is dominated by solar, followed by wind. Currently, it has over 1.1 GW of operational assets.

The company — backed by global sustainable infrastructure investor Actis — will utilise the proposed debt raise to support a significant portion of its under-construction portfolio, sources said.

It has access to a diversified lender base, which includes leading Indian banks, NBFCs, and select global green-finance institutions. The cost and scale of financing are in line with prevailing industry benchmarks.

To fund its under-construction pipeline, BluPine plans to raise between $500–750 million in debt over the next 12–18 months, with the total debt requirement for its 4 GW portfolio estimated at around $3 billion, informed one of the sources.

“While the company maintains a 25:75 equity-to-debt ratio, its approach to financing is guided by focus on minimising costs while building world-class assets that deliver maximised shareholder returns,” the source added.

Beyond the traditional banks and NBFC financing, the renewables producer is open to capital-market options, including Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) and rupee bonds, subject to market conditions.

An industry source said that the benefit of RBI’s rate cuts is yet to be fully transferred to public sector lenders. However, borrowing costs are expected to ease progressively between FY25 and FY26.

On the equity side, said one of the sources “BluPine continues to move forward in line with its business plan with Actis’ commitment, and is evaluating internal accruals for future capital requirements.”

The company is working on commissioning around 500 megawatt (MW) of renewable capacity in the current financial year, ending March 2026, making steady progress in execution, sources said.

BluPine has already secured financing for a large share of its current pipeline, reflecting strong confidence from financial partners.

The company’s contracted power purchase agreements (PPAs) of around 3 GW provide strong revenue visibility, while its ongoing financial strategy ensures disciplined growth, risk-mitigated balance sheet management, and resilience in a tightening global capital cycle.

Backed by Actis with a committed investment of $800 million, BluPine’s ambition is to execute responsibly, capitalise on India’s renewable energy growth story, and emerge as a benchmark in delivering high-quality, sustainable assets at scale.

[TITLE]Oil Stabilizes After Selloff Amid OPEC Reassessment and U.S. Funding Deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices steadied on Wednesday after a sharp 4% slide the day before, with Brent trading near $63.08 and WTI around $58.80 at 11:01 a.m. ET, as traders reassessed the latest OPEC shift toward a more balanced 2026 market outlook. The passage of the U.S. funding deal that ended the government shutdown removed one macro problem, but crude remained focused on supply signals rather than broader risk sentiment.

The modest rebound contrasted with the equity rally highlighted by Bloomberg, where U.S. indices advanced on softer inflation readings, renewed risk appetite and relief following the shutdown resolution. The move in equities had limited pull on crude, which stayed driven by evolving supply projections and near-term balance concerns.

The recovery follows Tuesday’s selloff linked to OPEC’s updated projections, which show the cartel moving away from its earlier deficit view and toward a neutral supply-demand balance next year. Traders reacted to signals that rising non-OPEC output and incremental OPEC+ barrels could offset moderate consumption growth. Those factors, combined with a softer demand trajectory outlined in the IEA’s latest assessment, left the market focused on potential surplus risk.

Diesel margins firmed during the session, while crude futures recovered more slowly. Murban traded near 65.43 on steady Asian buying and stable demand for middle distillates. Natural gas edged toward 4.62, supported by early-season heating needs and lower storage levels.

The Bloomberg update showed equities rising as Treasury yields fell, but that shift offered little lift to crude. Traders said oil remains tied to OPEC+ supply decisions and demand expectations through early 2026, not the broader market mood.

A softer dollar and lower Treasury yields added some support to commodities, though they did not shift the outlook for crude supplies. Asia continued to take regular cargoes, and early-winter demand for diesel and jet fuel stayed firm. Traders said many positions were still small following Tuesday’s selloff as the market waits for guidance on upcoming OPEC+ output levels and demand expectations for early 2026.

[TITLE]Norway’s Oil Industry Raises 2026 Investment Forecast:
[TEXT]
Energy operators offshore Norway expect to invest $24.8 billion (249 billion Norwegian crowns) in oil and gas activities next year, Statistics Norway’s latest quarterly survey showed on Thursday.

The estimate is $1.9 billion higher compared to the previous quarter’s forecast, mainly driven by higher forecasts of investments in field development and operating fields, the Norwegian statistics office said.

The increased estimate of investment in field development is chiefly pushed up by higher costs being reported for some development projects.

Since the autumn of 2024, the total costs of the ongoing projects have increased by

[TITLE]Oil Prices Climb as Senate Passes Deal to Reopen Government:
[TEXT]
In early Asian trade on Monday, crude oil prices were climbing after the United States Senate passed a funding agreement that could end the federal government shutdown. At the time of writing, WTI had climbed to $60.20 while Brent was trading at $64.05, both up by roughly 0.7%.

Senate negotiators had struck a deal ahead of a Sunday evening session to begin advancing a House-passed continuing resolution. After nearly two hours, the funding measure passed with the support of eight Democrats.

The package combines the continuing resolution with a “minibus” appropriations bundle (three long-term spending bills) and guarantees the Democrats a vote on extending health-insurance tax credits.

From a market perspective, the expectation that roughly 800,000 unpaid federal workers will soon see their salaries returned, benefit programs will restart, and key government services will resume is boosting sentiment. Speaking to Reuters, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore argued that the reopening prospect “should also help improve risk sentiment across markets”.

The optimism surrounding a deal can be seen on platforms such as Polymarket, which now has the odds of the shutdown ending before the 16th of November at 95%. Despite the rising confidence, a deal still faces some hurdles. After the Senate vote, approval by the United States House of Representatives needs to be secured, and the President will have to sign off before the longest government shutdown in history is brought to an end.

For oil markets, a government reopening should lead to improved domestic U.S. demand for goods and services (including energy) and the return of halted government spending, which can bolster crude demand. Additionally, improved risk appetite tends to reduce safe-haven premiums and can shift funds into commodities like oil.

[TITLE]RE sector financing doubles as outstanding loans surge 2x in Sep:
[TEXT]
Indian banks are bullish on India’s renewable energy (RE) sector with loans outstanding to the sector as of September, more than doubling year-on-year (y-o-y).

Data from RBI shows that the outstanding credit to the renewable energy sector stood at ₹14,842 crore as of September 2025 as against ₹6,778 crore in the same period last year.

The growth significantly outpaces the rate of growth in other priority sectors like agriculture, MSMEs and Housing and is also up compared to the 39 per cent y-o-y growth from the September 2023 to September 2024 period

Speaking to businessline, industry experts said the increase in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution with GST reductions and favourable policy landscape pushing projects that were previously on hold to the implementation stage.

Healthy growth

Sachin Sachdeva, Vice President, Sector Head - Financial Sector Ratings , ICRA Ltd, said the overall growth of renewable energy sector remains healthy with significant capacity additions taking place y-o-y. “Consequently, a large part of the funding goes towards the under-construction projects as the already developed project would primarily have refinancing requirements,” he added.

Sachdeva noted that large infrastructure non-banking finance companies (NBFC-IFCs), who have a big play in the RE space, have also seen their assets under management (AUM) grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 30 per cent over the last two years.

Ramneek Sehgal, Chairman & Managing Director of infrastructure firm Ceigall India Ltd, noted that the surge in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution rather than just pipeline build-up, especially in the solar energy sector.

“With the sharp reduction in solar module prices and the ramp-up of domestic manufacturing capacity, many projects that were previously on hold have now moved into the implementation stage,” he said. Sehgal added that the solar sector has opened up after a period of supply-side constraints and policy adjustments with 42 Giga Watt of solar capacity additions expected in FY26.

Overall installed RE capacity in India as of October 2025 stood at around 2 lakh Mega Watt (MW) (excluding Large Hydro Power) with 27,927 MW added in the April-Oct 2025 period.

Vivek Jain, Director, India Ratings and Research said, “When we look at the loans outstanding it is a combination of both under-construction and commissioned projects and hence we see a significant jump in loans outstanding,” he added. Jain mentions that this trend will persist if under-construction projects continue at the same pace but if their pace declines, the loan growth would appear slower than capacity growth.

Costs moderating

Experts added that the rise in financing is more reflective of expanding execution activity rather than cost inflation.

“Input and equipment costs have largely stabilised over the past year. In fact, the reduction in GST and improved domestic supply chains have helped offset earlier cost pressures. Across the industry, scale efficiencies and better value engineering are enabling developers to optimize overall project costs,” Sehgal said.

Sachdeva from ICRA says project costs have generally trended downward and the growth in funding to the sector seems to be primarily driven by capacity additions taking place at a faster pace.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies agrees renewable power deal with Google for Ohio data centres:
[TEXT]
Oil major TotalEnergies has agreed a 15-year power purchase deal to supply Alphabet's Google with 1.5 terawatt hours of renewable electricity from its Montpelier solar farm in Ohio, the French company said on Wednesday.

The solar facility, which is nearing completion, is connected to the PJM grid, the largest in the United States, and will help power Google’s data centre operations in the state, it said.

"This agreement illustrates TotalEnergies’s ability to meet the growing energy demands of major tech companies by leveraging its integrated portfolio of renewable and flexible assets," said Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables and Power at TotalEnergies.

The company's growing investment in electricity is helping the company secure a steadier revenue stream and avoid the boom-and-bust cycles typical of oil and gas, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said earlier this month at the ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi.

The Paris-listed firm is deploying a 10 gigawatt portfolio in the United States, with onshore solar, wind and battery storage projects.

[TITLE]Alectra Utilities submits 2027-2031 investment plan to Ontario Energy Board:
[TEXT]
MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alectra Utilities has submitted its 2027-2031 rate application to the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), proposing a detailed five-year plan to reinforce the electricity distribution system across its service territory. This application marks a significant step in advancing the renewal and resiliency of the grid and ensuring the delivery of safe and reliable electricity to over 1.3 million homes and businesses across the Greater Toronto, Hamilton, and Niagara regions.

“Our investment plan is designed with our customers at the forefront, prioritizing reliable service and sustainable growth,” said Brian Bentz, President and Chief Executive Officer, Alectra Inc. “By investing in our infrastructure and harmonizing rates, we aim to support the evolving needs of our communities while meeting organic population and economic growth.”

The proposed $3.1 billion plan was developed following extensive outreach to Alectra’s customers. Approximately 50,000 respondents provided input to the plan, and more than 80 per cent of them expressed support for Alectra’s capital investment priorities.

Subject to the approval of the OEB, customers can expect to see changes in their electricity distribution rates effective January 1, 2027. The application proposes harmonizing the rate structures from Alectra’s five legacy utilities to ensure consistency across all rate classes.

The Ontario Energy Board will review Alectra’s application through a public hearing process. Customers may participate by submitting comments or applying to become intervenors.
