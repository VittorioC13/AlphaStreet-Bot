[TITLE]Gogo makes a strategic investment in Farcast to support new cutting-edge user terminal technology to enhance inflight connectivity for business, military, and government aviation:
[TEXT]
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Farcast , a San Francisco-based startup building advanced satellite user terminals, announces that it has received strategic equity investment from Gogo (Nasdaq: GOGO), a leading in-flight communications provider for business, military, and government aviation, to evolve a new class of aviation user terminals for Gogo customers.

The investment will support the development of core technology needed for new antennas to support optimized cabin connectivity, expanding crew and passenger use cases. Farcast’s single-aperture, full-duplex flat panel antenna, FPA, will deliver reduced size, weight, power, and cost, SWaP-C, for operators while simultaneously increasing bandwidth. Installation of the compact terminal on existing aircraft real estate will also extend connectivity reach for more aircraft categories.

Farcast has already developed a unique technology that can simultaneously transmit and receive data from the same aperture in a flat panel antenna, FPA. The proprietary Active Electronically Scanned Antenna (AESA) technology uses electronic beam scanning to compensate for the movement of satellites from a single aperture, enabling the full-duplex FPA to lower SWaP-C.

The next-gen technology will complement the existing Gogo portfolio and support the company’s strategy of delivering a multi-band, multi-orbit connectivity experience from a compact terminal, enhancing the value proposition for Gogo customers.

“We recognized Farcast’s innovative approach to resolving some of the most complex challenges we have faced regarding the development and deployment of aviation user terminals. Farcast has developed a technology that will substantially reduce key SWaP-C constraints aviation faces, including scalability, while retaining and improving performance in a small form factor design,” says Chris Moore, CEO, Gogo. “We are confident this technology can be a real game changer for Gogo and our aviation customers.”

“We know that the aviation sector increasingly expects powerful in-flight connectivity and we’re excited to work with Gogo to demonstrate the value of integrating our reduced SwaP-C technology into its portfolio to elevate its offering to its diverse customer portfolio,” says Siamak Ebadi, CEO, Farcast. “We are extremely excited

[TITLE]Deus Ex Machina Capital announces two complementary research papers on AI-assisted software development and AI productivity.:
[TEXT]
San Francisco, CA, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Deus Ex Machina Capital announced the release of two research papers examining why AI-assisted productivity gains are diverging across organizations. The papers were authored by Francesco Bisardi, an independent researcher who leads the firm’s research program. The work argues that AI agents and modern developer tooling can create step-change execution speed when teams redesign workflows rather than layering AI on legacy processes.

Bisardi said:

“Over the next five years, the binding scarce asset will not be access to UI-based chat models, but the capability to redesign human workflows into agentic systems and apply them to mispriced surfaces still anchored to human labor or legacy R&D cost assumptions.”

The first paper, “An Approach to High-Velocity Development through Systematic Context Engineering: A Case Study,” introduces a context architecture designed for fast AI-native software development. The approach, based on a four-pillar framework, combines:

A declarative rule layer that encodes architectural, process, and quality invariants

A programmatic Repo Model Context Protocol (MCP) layer that exposes live project structure, data, and tools to AI assistants and agents

In roughly fifteen part-time weeks, two researchers built a production-grade research artifact (Bizie.app) that reproduces a representative set of features found in mature event-productivity software, illustrating the practical implications of the proposed context architecture. The paper serves as a case study and a practical guide for aspiring entrepreneurs, clearly defining the distinction between vibe-coded prototypes and production-grade applications.

The second paper, “The LLM Productivity Cliff: Threshold Productivity and AI-Native Inequality,” addresses a central tension in the AI narrative: widespread access to LLMs has not produced uniform productivity gains. Based on early empirical evidence, the researchers argue that:

There is a threshold productivity level below which additional AI assistance has limited impact and above which returns become sharply non-linear.

The decisive variable is AI architectural literacy: the steepest gains accrue to teams with the skills to re-engineer human and UI-based workflows into agentic systems, while organizations that simply add AI tools on top of legacy stacks and processes see only marginal improvements.

[TITLE]Private capital targets mission-critical software power and platforms in new space economy:
[TEXT]
Private capital targets mission-critical software power and platforms in new space economy

by Clarence Oxford

Los Angeles CA (SPX) Dec 09, 2025

Axle Point Capital and Balerion Space Ventures are directing new private capital into companies that build core infrastructure for the expanding U.S. space and defense economy, from mission software and guidance systems to deployable microreactors and high-temperature reactors. Axle Point's first transaction is a strategic equity investment in Odyssey Space Research LLC, a flight software and engineering firm that supports NASA and defense programs, while Balerion has taken stakes in Antares Industries, Samara Aerospace, and Valar Atomics, three companies focused on spacecraft platforms and nuclear energy systems for defense and industrial users.

Odyssey Space Research develops and sustains flight software and guidance, navigation and control (GN and C) systems for missions that range from small satellites to large human-rated spacecraft. Its work covers flight software development, simulation, mission analysis, avionics integration and test, spaceflight simulation and analysis, and human spaceflight operations, using software frameworks and tools that support configurable mission solutions. Odyssey's teams contribute to missions that include proximity operations such as rendezvous and docking, and support both uncrewed and crewed spacecraft operating in the vicinity of the International Space Station and in other complex orbital regimes.

A key growth driver for Odyssey is NASA's RPOC V contract, a five year award that extends the company's role in integrated GN and C assessments and trajectory and flight software integration. Under RPOC V, Odyssey supports commercial cargo and crew vehicles that approach and depart the ISS, as well as GN and C and trajectory work for Orion program missions. The contract continues a workload where Odyssey's analysis and software integration tasks must meet NASA human spaceflight certification and safety requirements, reinforcing its position as a supplier of mission-critical software and engineering to U.S. government customers.

Axle Point Capital, based in Newport Beach, completed the Odyssey transaction in partnership with the ONE Bow River National Defense Fund, which provided equity capital for the acquisition. The deal establishes Odyssey as a platform investment for Axle Point as it pursues additional aerospace, defense, and government services opportunities with institutional co investors. The firm's strategy centers on hard-to-access sectors such as space and defense, where programs often require long-term technical support, regulatory approval, and specialized engineering capabilities.

"Axle Point Capital was founded to identify and unlock value in hard-to-access sectors like space and defense," said Gerik Degner, CFA, Managing Partner. "We are thrilled to partner with ONE Bow River and the exceptional team at Odyssey and look forward to leveraging our sector expertise to help accelerate its growth and expand its impact on vital national space programs."

"Odyssey represents the very best of innovation in spaceflight software and guidance, navigation, and control systems for manned and unmanned spaceflight and robotics. The Odyssey team is stellar from top to bottom," added Kevin O'Neil, Chief Investment Officer of ONE Bow River. Steven Joanis, Senior Managing Director, added, "It is a privilege to partner with Axle Point, whose market understanding, strategic vision, and raw tenacity were pivotal in architecting this transaction and bode well for the valuation acceleration to come. This investment underscores our shared commitment to advancing technologies that are vital to our nation's capabilities in space."

Balerion Space Ventures is pursuing a parallel thesis across frontier technology, announcing investments in Antares Industries, Samara Aerospace, and Valar Atomics as part of a portfolio designed around systems that build, power, and operate critical space and industrial infrastructure. Antares is developing modular, transportable microreactors intended for rapid deployment in contested or remote environments to provide autonomous, resilient power for defense operations and critical infrastructure. These systems target growing demand for local, secure energy as defense spending increases and policymakers place more emphasis on energy security and grid resilience.

Samara Aerospace is building high precision spacecraft platforms that use advanced attitude control technologies to deliver agile on-orbit performance. Its satellite buses are aimed at missions that require fine pointing and maneuverability, including next-generation Earth observation and other constellations that depend on accurate pointing and rapid retasking. As government and commercial operators expand orbital infrastructure, platforms like those developed by Samara are positioned as enabling assets for imaging, data relay, and other services that rely on stable, responsive spacecraft.

Valar Atomics is focused on nuclear systems for heavy industrial power and hydrocarbon fuel production, and reports that it is the first U.S. nuclear startup to reach criticality at its Utah testing site. The company is advancing high-temperature reactors designed to provide industrial heat and support clean fuel production, and has achieved cold criticality under Project NOVA and been selected for U.S. Department of Energy efforts such as the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program and Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Program. Valar has begun construction of Ward 250, its first nuclear test reactor in Utah, after completing Ward Zero, a non nuclear prototype facility, and is working with partners including the Philippines Nuclear Research Institute as it develops TRISO-fueled, helium-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor technology for industrial users and AI infrastructure that require high reliability power.

"Launch costs are collapsing. Defense budgets are rising. Dual-use technologies are being adopted at a record pace," said Phil Scully, Co Founder and General Partner at Balerion Space Ventures. "The companies we're backing are building the foundational systems that will power the next trillion-dollar economy. Agile spacecraft, advanced nuclear systems, and deployable microreactors - these are the technologies that will determine who leads in space, defense, and domestic manufacturing over the next decade as we enter a new industrial era driven by mass access to space. Balerion is excited to back the companies developing the infrastructure that will power the space economy."

"These companies are building the enabling infrastructure that the broader space and defense ecosystem will rely upon for decades," said Daniel Wallman, Partner at Balerion. "As capital pours into the sector, our focus remains disciplined on backing mission-critical platforms with real technical depth and scalable economics. Antares, Samara, and Valar exemplify the kind of durable enterprise value being created at the frontier of this asset class."

Balerion states that the funding will support product development, facility build out, and progress toward commercial milestones at each of the three portfolio companies as they expand work with defense, civil, and commercial customers. The firm plans to discuss the investments and its view of the market at its annual general meeting in Bentonville, Arkansas.

[TITLE]3 Ways NVIDIA Is Powering the Industrial Revolution:
[TEXT]
NVIDIA accelerated computing platforms powered by the GPU have replaced CPUs as the engine of invention, serving the three scaling laws and what comes next in AI.

The NVIDIA accelerated computing platform is leading supercomputing benchmarks once dominated by CPUs, enabling AI, science, business and computing efficiency worldwide.

Moore’s Law has run its course, and parallel processing is the way forward. With this evolution, NVIDIA GPU platforms are now uniquely positioned to deliver on the three scaling laws — pretraining, post-training and test-time compute — for everything from next-generation recommender systems and large language models (LLMs) to AI agents and beyond.

The CPU-to-GPU Transition: A Historic Shift in Computing 🔗

At SC25, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the shifting landscape. Within the TOP100, a subset of the TOP500 list of supercomputers, over 85% of systems use GPUs. This flip represents a historic transition from the serial‑processing paradigm of CPUs to massively parallel accelerated architectures.

Before 2012, machine learning was based on programmed logic. Statistical models were used and ran efficiently on CPUs as a corpus of hard-coded rules. But this all changed when AlexNet running on gaming GPUs demonstrated image classification could be learned by examples. Its implications were enormous for the future of AI, with parallel processing on increasing sums of data on GPUs driving a new wave of computing.

This flip isn’t just about hardware. It’s about platforms unlocking new science. GPUs deliver far more operations per watt, making exascale practical without untenable energy demands.

Recent results from the Green500, a ranking of the world’s most energy-efficient supercomputers, underscore the contrast between GPUs versus CPUs. The top five performers in this industry standard benchmark were all NVIDIA GPUs, delivering an average of 70.1 gigaflops per watt. Meanwhile, the top CPU-only systems provided 15.5 flops per watt on average. This 4.5x differential between GPUs versus CPUs on energy efficiency highlights the massive TCO (total cost of ownership) advantage of moving these systems to GPUs.

Another measure of the CPU-versus-GPU energy-efficiency and performance differential arrived with NVIDIA’s results on the Graph500. NVIDIA delivered a record-breaking result of 410 trillion traversed edges per second, placing first on the Graph500 breadth-first search list.

The winning run more than doubled the next highest score and utilized 8,192 NVIDIA H100 GPUs to process a graph with 2.2 trillion vertices and 35 trillion edges. That compares with the next best result on the list, which required roughly 150,000 CPUs for this workload. Hardware footprint reductions of this scale save time, money and energy.

Yet NVIDIA showcased at SC25 that its AI supercomputing platform is far more than GPUs. Networking, CUDA libraries, memory, storage and orchestration are co-designed to deliver a full-stack platform.

Enabled by CUDA, NVIDIA is a full-stack platform. Open-source libraries and frameworks such as those in the CUDA-X ecosystem are where big speedups occur. Snowflake recently announced an integration of NVIDIA A10 GPUs to supercharge data science workflows. Snowflake ML now comes preinstalled with NVIDIA cuML and cuDF libraries to accelerate popular ML algorithms with these GPUs.

With this native integration, Snowflake’s users can easily accelerate model development cycles with no code changes required. NVIDIA’s benchmark runs show 5x less time required for Random Forest and up to 200x for HDBSCAN on NVIDIA A10 GPUs compared with CPUs.

The flip was the turning point. The scaling laws are the trajectory forward. And at every stage, GPUs are the engine driving AI into its next chapter.

But CUDA-X and many open-source software libraries and frameworks are where much of the magic happens. CUDA-X libraries accelerate workloads across every industry and application — engineering, finance, data analytics, genomics, biology, chemistry, telecommunications, robotics and much more.

“The world has a massive investment in non-AI software. From data processing to science and engineering simulations, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in compute cloud computing spend each year,” Huang said on NVIDIA’s recent earning call.

Many applications that once ran exclusively on CPUs are now rapidly shifting to CUDA GPUs. “Accelerated computing has reached a tipping point. AI has also reached a tipping point and is transforming existing applications while enabling entirely new ones,” he said.

What began as an energy‑efficiency imperative has matured into a scientific platform: simulation and AI fused at scale. The leadership of NVIDIA GPUs in the TOP100 is both proof of this trajectory and a signal of what comes next — breakthroughs across every discipline.

As a result, researchers can now train trillion‑parameter models, simulate fusion reactors and accelerate drug discovery at scales CPUs alone could never reach.

The Three Scaling Laws Driving AI’s Next Frontier 🔗

The change from CPUs to GPUs is not just a milestone in supercomputing. It’s the foundation for the three scaling laws that represent the roadmap for AI’s next workflow: pretraining, post‑training and test‑time scaling.

Pre‑training scaling was the first law to assist the industry. Researchers discovered that as datasets, parameter counts and compute grew, model performance improved predictably. Doubling the data or parameters meant leaps in accuracy and versatility.

On the latest MLPerf Training industry benchmarks, the NVIDIA platform delivered the highest performance on every test and was the only platform to submit on all tests. Without GPUs, the “bigger is better” era of AI research would have stalled under the weight of power budgets and time constraints.

Post‑training scaling extends the story. Once a foundation model is built, it must be refined — tuned for industries, languages or safety constraints. Techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback, pruning and distillation require enormous additional compute. In some cases, the demands rival pre‑training itself. This is like a student improving after basic education. GPUs again provide the horsepower, enabling continual fine‑tuning and adaptation across domains.

Test‑time scaling, the newest law, may prove the most transformative. Modern models powered by mixture-of-experts architectures can reason, plan and evaluate multiple solutions in real time. Chain‑of‑thought reasoning, generative search and agentic AI demand dynamic, recursive compute — often exceeding pretraining requirements. This stage will drive exponential demand for inference infrastructure — from data centers to edge devices.

Together, these three laws explain the demand for GPUs for new AI workloads. Pretraining scaling has made GPUs indispensable. Post‑training scaling has reinforced their role in refinement. Test‑time scaling is ensuring GPUs remain critical long after training ends. This is the next chapter in accelerated computing: a lifecycle where GPUs power every stage of AI — from learning to reasoning to deployment.

Generative, Agentic, Physical AI and Beyond 🔗

The world of AI is expanding far beyond basic recommenders, chatbots and text generation. VLMs, or vision language models, are AI systems combining computer vision and natural language processing for understanding and interpreting images and text. And recommender systems — the engines behind personalized shopping, streaming and social feeds — are but one of many examples of how the massive transition from CPUs to GPUs is reshaping AI.

Meanwhile, generative AI is transforming everything from robotics and autonomous vehicles to software-as-a-service companies and represents a massive investment in startups.

NVIDIA platforms are the only to run on all of the leading generative AI models and handle 1.4 million open-source models.

Once constrained by CPU architectures, recommender systems struggled to capture the complexity of user behavior at scale. With CUDA GPUs, pretraining scaling enables models to learn from massive datasets of clicks, purchases and preferences, uncovering richer patterns. Post‑training scaling fine‑tunes those models for specific domains, sharpening personalization for industries from retail to entertainment. On leading global online sites, even a 1% gain in relevance accuracy of recommendations can yield billions more in sales.

Electronic commerce sales are expected to reach $6.4 trillion worldwide for 2025, according to Emarketer.

The world’s hyperscalers, a trillion-dollar industry, are transforming search, recommendations and content understanding from classical machine learning to generative AI. NVIDIA CUDA excels at both and is the ideal platform for this transition driving infrastructure investment measured in hundreds of billions of dollars.

Now, test‑time scaling is transforming inference itself: recommender engines can reason dynamically, evaluating multiple options in real time to deliver context‑aware suggestions. The result is a leap in precision and relevance — recommendations that feel less like static lists and more like intelligent guidance. GPUs and scaling laws are turning recommendation from a background feature into a frontline capability of agentic AI, enabling billions of people to sort through trillions of things on the internet with an ease that would otherwise be unfeasible.

What began as conversational interfaces powered by LLMs is now evolving into intelligent, autonomous systems poised to reshape nearly every sector of the global economy.

We are experiencing a foundational shift — from AI as a virtual technology to AI entering the physical world. This transformation demands nothing less than explosive growth in computing infrastructure and new forms of collaboration between humans and machines.

Generative AI has proven capable of not just creating new text and images, but code, designs and even scientific hypotheses. Now, agentic AI is arriving — systems that perceive, reason, plan and act autonomously. These agents behave less like tools and more like digital colleagues, carrying out complex, multistep tasks across industries. From legal research to logistics, agentic AI promises to accelerate productivity by serving as autonomous digital workers.

Perhaps the most transformative leap is physical AI — the embodiment of intelligence in robots of every form. Three computers are required to build physical AI-embodied robots — NVIDIA DGX GB300 to train the reasoning vision-language action model, NVIDIA RTX PRO to simulate, test and validate the model in a virtual world built on Omniverse, and Jetson Thor to run the reasoning VLA at real-time speed.

What’s expected next is a breakthrough moment for robotics within years, with autonomous mobile robots, collaborative robots and humanoids disrupting manufacturing, logistics and healthcare. Morgan Stanley estimates there will be 1 billion humanoid robots with $5 trillion in revenue by 2050.

Signaling how deeply AI will embed into the physical economy, that’s just a sip of what’s on tap.

AI is no longer just a tool. It performs work and stands to transform every one of the world’s $100 trillion in markets. And a virtuous cycle of AI has arrived, fundamentally changing the entire computing stack, transitioning all computers into new supercomputing platforms for vastly larger opportunities.​

[TITLE]Chinese entities bypass export rules for Nvidia H200 chips:

Chinese entities bypass export rules for Nvidia H200 chips

Universities, military affiliates and data centers have obtained thousands of restricted processors through grey market channels and rental arrangements

Universities, military affiliates and data centers have obtained thousands of restricted processors through grey market channels and rental arrangements

President Donald Trump’s recent decision to permit exports of Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence chip to China promises to legitimize a trade that has flourished in the shadows for months. A comprehensive review of more than 100 procurement documents and academic papers reveals that Chinese buyers have already acquired substantial quantities of the powerful processors through grey market channels, despite existing export restrictions.

The evidence paints a detailed picture of which Chinese organizations will likely pursue legal bulk purchases once Beijing approves sales. The H200 represents Nvidia’s second most powerful AI chip and vastly outperforms any processor the company currently has authorization to sell in China.

Academic institutions lead the charge

China’s premier universities have emerged as major consumers of restricted Nvidia hardware, driven by intense competition for top talent and breakthrough research. The availability of advanced chips directly influences these institutions’ ability to recruit leading researchers and conduct cutting edge artificial intelligence development.

A professor at Beijing Jiaotong University openly advertises that his laboratory possesses eight H200 chips for AI model research. Researchers from the state backed Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory collaborated with colleagues from Sun Yat Sen, Tsinghua and Shanghai Jiao Tong universities to train an AI model using four Nvidia H200 processors. Their project, detailed in a paper published last month, focused on detecting AI generated images.

In June, a government run AI institute in Hefei issued a procurement request for a server equipped with eight Nvidia H200 chips to power a quantum AI model project. The Reuters analysis identified dozens of universities and research institutes nationwide that have either purchased or attempted to acquire H200 chips through various channels.

Military connections raise national security concerns

China hawks in Washington have strongly opposed Trump’s reversal of previous export controls, warning that the Chinese military would leverage Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips to dramatically enhance its capabilities. The procurement review suggests these concerns have merit, as H200 chips appear to be reaching the People’s Liberation Army and closely affiliated universities.

In August, the PLA Air Force Medical University in Xian issued a tender for eight Nvidia H200 chips intended to train a large language model platform supporting medical AI and biosurveillance research. More recently, the School of Cyberspace Security at Beihang University sought suppliers capable of renting H200 level computing power. Beihang belongs to China’s Seven Sons, a group of universities under U.S. sanctions due to their extensive defense related research activities.

Chinese entities have increasingly adopted rental arrangements as a strategy for accessing restricted hardware without directly importing it. This approach allows organizations to utilize servers fitted with banned Nvidia chips while maintaining plausible deniability

[TITLE]Will NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Hit $500 by 2030?:
[TEXT]
This post may contain links from our sponsors and affiliates, and Flywheel Publishing may receive compensation for actions taken through them.

It’s the darling of the financial markets and the undisputed heavyweight champion among U.S.-based processor producers. Truly, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is roundly revered and to many traders, NVIDIA seems unstoppable.

There are plenty of price predictions for NVDA stock, and some optimists can easily envision the share price hitting $500 by 2030. Is this too far-fetched, though?

The skeptics may doubt that the rally is sustainable and might see $500 as an impossible dream. Yet, as the data will reveal, NVIDIA is a chip-making powerhouse in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). So, keep an open mind as NVIDIA stock’s upside potential is considerable.

Is NVIDIA the Next Cisco?

Even if it is a darling of the market, NVIDIA has its doubters. One bearish-leaning commentator is hedge fund manager Michael Burry, the subject of the film The Big Short.

As Rich Duprey explained here and here, Burry compared NVIDIA to Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), the telecommunications hardware giant that fell from grace with the dot-com bust. In the late 1990s, it felt like Cisco and its shares would continue to gain value forever.

Burry apparently expects NVIDIA’s market capitalization to contract in the coming years, much as Cisco’s did after the late 1990s. His company, Scion Asset Management, has even gone so far as to take a massively bearish position against NVIDIA stock by owning put options.

If Burry’s comparison between NVIDIA and Cisco holds true, then NVDA stock is unlikely to reach $500 by 2030. In hindsight, the hype surrounding Cisco outpaced the actual demand for the company’s products. So, is there a demand shortfall for NVIDIA’s AI-enabled processors?

Income Jump Suggests High Demand

From a financial standpoint, it certainly looks like there’s enough AI chip demand to keep NVIDIA flush with cash. A quick glance at NVIDIA’s third-quarter 2025 results should drive this point home.

In Q3 2025, NVIDIA generated revenue totaling $57.006 billion, versus $35.082 billion in the year-earlier quarter. That’s a 62.5% improvement, and most of the third-quarter 2025 revenue ($51.215 billion) was from NVIDIA’s Data Center segment. Thus, the demand for NVIDIA’s AI-compatible products isn’t lacking.

Furthermore, NVIDIA’s net income grew 65.3% year over year, from $19.309 billion to $31.91 billion. In other words, the company is raking in a lot more capital than it’s spending.

Looking ahead, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang proclaimed that the company’s Blackwell chip sales are “off the charts” and that its cloud GPUs are sold out. Therefore, NVIDIA in 2025 doesn’t appear to be in the same precarious position that Cisco was in 1999.

Trade Agreement Favors NVIDIA

The skeptics might argue that NVIDIA can’t possibly expand its sales much more than it already has. However, a recent U.S.-China trade agreement indicates that NVIDIA may have new horizons to conquer.

As reported by The Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump is allowing NVIDIA to sell its H200 AI chips to China. Trump, according to the Journal, specified that Washington would collect 25% of NVIDIA’s sales from China.

If all goes according to plan, NVIDIA stands to gain on a grand scale. The company estimated, per the Journal that it “could ship up to $5 billion in orders to China” per quarter “without geopolitical constraints.”

The implications go beyond short-term revenue prospects. It’s now inarguable that the current administration values NVIDIA and seeks to protect the company’s interests.

It’s unknown whether the next presidential administration will be quite as business-friendly toward NVIDIA. Nonetheless, the current administration will presumably be in place until January of 2029, and this is probably good news for NVIDIA and its shareholders.

The Path to $500 Is Clear

Given the pace of NVIDIA’s sales and income growth, investors should expect the company’s market cap to expand during the next five years. Unless NVIDIA actually collapses like Cisco once did, the path of least resistance for NVDA stock is to the upside.

Sure, NVIDIA stock has already rallied 33% over the past year. But again, on a year-over-year basis, the company’s net sales and revenue rose 62.5% and 65.3%, respectively.

Besides, those growth figures reflect a time before the President green-lit the chip sales to China. Hence, there’s still room for NVIDIA to expand its sales scope and, ultimately, its economic moat.

All in all, Berry’s catastrophic AI chip market implosion scenario looks like a long shot. The financial data and the government’s apparent motivation to protect NVIDIA’s interests put the odds in the shareholders’ favor.

Consequently, NVIDIA’s growth trajectory should persist through 2030 and NVDA stock’s pathway to $500 is clear, albeit not guaranteed. That’s why it’s sensible to own a few, but not too many, NVIDIA shares for the long run.
