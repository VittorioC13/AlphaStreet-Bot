[TITLE]Guyana Is Using Its Oil Revenues to Spark a Renewable Energy Boom:
[TEXT]
Since the discovery of vast oil reserves in Guyana around a decade ago, the South American country’s oil industry has grown significantly following investment from several international oil majors and the beginning of offshore production. As Guyana begins to see the revenue from its black gold, the government is reinvesting some of the money in renewables to diversify the energy mix and strengthen the country’s energy security. Guyana’s government aims to achieve 80 percent renewable energy in the electricity grid by 2040.

In February, the United Nations (UN) in Guyana announced the launch of the Just Energy Transition (JET) Seed Funding Initiative with financing from the Joint Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Fund. The initiative will provide funding to help Guyana undergo a green transition by implementing its Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) 2030. Investments will be made in expanding Guyana’s renewable energy capacity and promoting sustainable mobility. The UN will also provide technical and policy support.

The initiative will support the development of three solar-powered EV charging stations in strategic locations and the delivery of a technical training programme to develop a Guyanese workforce in the renewable energy sector. The UN aims to use the initiative to empower youth, women, and marginalized groups and ensure equitable access to opportunities.

The UN Development Programme’s Officer-in-Charge, Nadira Balram, stated, “The anticipated impact of this initiative is far-reaching. This initiative will create jobs and new economic opportunities. By equipping a new generation of technicians with specialised skills, we are fostering a workforce that is prepared for the transition to a green economy.”

At the national level, the President of Guyana, Mohamed Irfaan Ali, said in a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine that Guyana is using its newfound oil revenues to drive a green transition.

“Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatonnes of carbon,” said Irfaan Ali. “We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, and wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.”

One of the renewable energy industries that Guyana is looking to advance is solar power. Several companies have shown interest in the country’s solar potential, with multiple new solar projects expected to launch in the coming years. The government has gradually been expanding its solar energy capacity, with around 4.8 MW of solar power having been installed under the Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Home Energy Systems. The off-grid solar power project launched in 2023 and aims to expand clean electricity access in the hinterland and riverine communities of the country that do not have access to the national grid. The government aims to supply and deliver 30,000 solar PV home energy units as part of the scheme.

In August, the Guyana Energy Agency commissioned a 0.6 MW grid-forming solar farm on the island of Leguan, at a cost of $1.4 million. The project will include a 1.2 MWh battery energy storage system. This follows the installation of a similar solar power system on Wakenaam Island in 2023 and is aimed at providing rural populations with greater energy security.

In November, the Indian green energy firm Oriana Power Limited announced it had been approved by the Guyana Energy Agency to develop a solar energy project in Guyana consisting of the design, supply, installation, and commissioning of a 3 MW grid-tied solar PV system at the Cheddi Jagan International Airport. The contract is valued at almost $2.5 million, and it is expected to be completed within three years.

In July, the government commissioned a 1.5 MW hydropower project, the Kumu plant, in Lethem. This follows the development of the 0.7 MW Moco Moco Hydropower Plant. While Guyana’s hydropower projects are relatively small-scale, the gradual development of the industry demonstrates the government’s commitment to diversifying Guyana’s energy mix.

Prime Minister Mark Phillips stated, “From 2020 to now, we’ve delivered 14.5 megawatts of renewable energy through solar and hydro projects. Today’s commissioning of the 1.5 MW Kumu Hydropower Station builds on that foundation, expanding our renewable energy portfolio while improving quality of life for residents in Region Nine.”

Guyana has transformed from a little-known South American country that was highly dependent on fossil fuel imports less than a decade ago to a growing global oil power. The exploitation of its oil resources is allowing the government to increase spending on green energy to diversify the country’s energy mix from the outset, a feat that has not been possible in most oil-rich countries. Meanwhile, additional technical and funding support from the UN is expected to help Guyana diversify its energy mix and enhance its energy security in the coming years.

[TITLE]Ontario, New York announce nuclear energy agreement:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by AI-based technology. Mispronunciations can occur. We are working with our partners to continually review and improve the results.

Ontario has signed a memorandum of understanding with New York to help the state develop nuclear technologies to meet growing energy demand and strengthen reliability and decarbonization in both jurisdictions.

The new memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishes a deal between New York Power Authority (NYPA) and Ontario Power Generation (OPG) to collaborate on advancing nuclear energy technologies, including small modular reactors (SMRs) — which Ontario is currently building — and large-scale nuclear facilities, the province said in a release.

Announcing the agreement with New York Governor Kathy Hochul at a news conference in Buffalo Friday, Ford said Ontario currently has enough nuclear electricity to power 16 million homes, and more will be coming online in the coming years.

“Ontario is building the first small modular reactors in the G7 and we're leading the way at [the] Darlington site,” he said. “We invite you to share the technology.”

WATCH | The hype behind Canada's investment in nuclear SMRs: Small nuclear reactors: Why Canada is investing billions | Duration 7:06 Small modular nuclear reactors are being touted as a key piece of the future of clean energy and construction is now underway in Ontario on the first of its kind in the G7. For The National, CBC’s Susan Ormiston breaks down what’s behind the hype and why some say Canada should proceed with caution.

Under the new MOU, NYPA and OPG will share expertise and resources on technological innovation, financing and developing facilities, and training a workforce to build and operate nuclear infrastructure on both sides of the border, according to the provincial release.

New York and Ontario will also look at trade opportunities for electricity to improve power reliability and reduce emissions.

Ford praised nuclear energy as a positive method of future electricity production for both neighbours.

“It's safe, number one, it's clean, it's green, it's reliable, and it's cost-affordable for especially the ratepayers here [in New York] and over in Ontario,” he said.

While nuclear-generated electricity doesn't emit carbon, environmental concerns persist around the storage of toxic, nuclear waste, and the potential radiological hazards that have come with past accidents at facilities around the world.

WATCH | Storing nuclear waste in northern Ontario: Why this Ontario town agreed to take Canada’s nuclear waste | Duration 10:03 The northern Ontario community of Ignace has agreed to be the future home of Canada’s nuclear waste. The National’s Nick Purdon went to the region to find out why the majority of people were in favour of the move and see how the toxic materials will be stored deep underground.

Ontario has been investing heavily in nuclear technology recently, refurbishing old facilities and developing new ones.

The province and the Canadian federal government committed earlier this year to spending a collective $3 billion to build Canada’s first SMRs next to Darlington power plant. Construction started this year and the reactors are scheduled to start coming online in 2030. When completed, the four SMRs will produce 1,200 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power 1.2 million homes, Prime Minister Mark Carney said in the fall.

The new cross-border agreement comes as Canada continues to face trade hostility from the United States, something both Hochul and Ford expressed concern over at Friday’s conference. Along with the MOU, the pair also signed a declaration of intent to pledge continued co-operation between Ontario and New York.

“As these threats out of Washington come, we're going to stand firm and let people know who our friends are,” Hochul said.

“Our partnership between New York and Ontario is rock solid, and as long as I'm governor, it's going to stay that way.”

[TITLE]Deal to Export Oil from Kurdish Region to Continue with No Issues, Kurdish Rudaw Reports:
[TEXT]
Greece Headed for ‘Record Year’ for Tourism, Says Minister

Tourists descent Propylaia, the ancient gate of the Acropolis archaeological site in Athens on June 21, 2023. (AFP)

Greece is on track for "another record year" for tourism in 2025, despite ongoing labor shortages in a key sector of its economy, Tourism Minister Olga Kefalogianni said on Sunday.

Between January and the end of September, the Mediterranean nation -- long beloved by tourists for its sunny islands and rich archaeological sites -- welcomed 31.6 million visitors, a four-percent increase compared with the same period in 2024, according to Bank of Greece data published in late November.

"Overall, we expect 2025 to be another record year for tourism in our country," Kefalogianni said in an interview with the Greek news agency ANA.

The conservative minister also expressed hope for another bumper year in 2026.

"The indicators for 2026 are already particularly encouraging and allow us to be optimistic," she said.

Since the Covid-19 pandemic, Greece has been breaking annual records in tourism revenues and the number of foreign visitors.

Across 2024, 40.7 million people visited Greece, up 12.8 percent from 2023.

But the uptick has sparked concern over the unchecked construction in several hotspots, while Athens locals have complained that the proliferation of short-term holiday lets has caused rents to skyrocket.

Climate change-fueled heatwaves and increasingly devastating wildfires also pose a threat to the sector, which Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has trumpeted since taking office in 2019 in a bid to revive the economy after the financial crisis.

According to the Institute of the Greek Tourism Confederation (INSETE), tourism directly contributed around 13 percent of GDP in 2024 and indirectly to more than 30 percent of GDP.

[TITLE]DNO Agrees Oil Offtakes with ExxonMobil, Shell in Fund Raise:
[TEXT]
DNO signed offtake agreements with ExxonMobil and Shell for the entirety of its North Sea oil production and secured up to $410 million in 'related offtake financing facilities'.

DNO ASA said Thursday it had signed offtake agreements with Exxon Mobil Corp and Shell PLC for the entirety of its North Sea oil production and secured up to $410 million in "related offtake financing facilities".

"The agreement with ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, covering around half of DNO's North Sea oil output, has a tenor of two years and a related revolving credit facility of up to $185 million", the Norwegian oil and gas explorer and producer said in an online statement.

"The agreement with Shell Trading and Shipping Co Ltd, covering the other half of the output, has an initial tenor of one year and a related prepayment facility with a European bank of up to $225 million".

DNO executive chair Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani said, "The offtake agreements with ExxonMobil and Shell unlock considerable financing at very attractive rates, creating opportunities for continued growth in nervous markets".

DNO said it has now "put into place financing facilities of up to $910 million tied to its North Sea oil and gas production".

It earlier secured up to $500 million in financing from a United States bank related to an offtake agreement with French power and gas utility ENGIE SA for 100 percent of its Norwegian production.

"These three-way transactions are made possible because buyers are eager to lock in secure supplies of Norwegian oil and gas and U.S. banks, in particular, have significantly stepped up fossil fuel lending", Mossavar-Rahmani said in a statement July 2.

DNO said of the ENGIE-tied financing, "Proceeds from the offtake financing facility will be used to replace Sval Energi’s similar existing facilities as well as for general corporate purposes".

In the second quarter, DNO completed its $450 million acquisition of Sval Energi Group AS from HitecVision.

"The acquired portfolio comprises 16 producing fields in Norway, quadrupling DNO's North Sea production to 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day", DNO said June 12. "The company's North Sea proven and probable reserves swell to 189 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), also a fourfold increase. Contingent resources total 316 MMboe.

"Following the acquisition, Norway and the United Kingdom represent nearly 60 percent of the company’s global production and about 45 percent of its global reserves, with the balance predominantly in the Kurdistan region of Iraq".

DNO added, "Supported by ongoing field development projects with multiple discoveries currently being matured for project sanction, DNO is well placed to grow North Sea production organically in the years ahead. The combined North Sea 2P reserves and 2C resources equal 15 years of production at the current run rate".

[TITLE]Crude oil prices fall on Russia-Ukraine peace hopes, Venezuela supply cues:
[TEXT]
Crude oil futures traded lower on Friday morning following reports that raised hopes of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

At 9.59 am on Friday, February Brent oil futures were at $59.71, down by 0.18 per cent, and February crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $55.89, down by 0.20 per cent. January crude oil futures were trading at ₹5074 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Friday against the previous close of ₹5114, down by 0.78 per cent, and February futures were trading at ₹5098 against the previous close of ₹5134, down by 0.70 per cent.

Quoting US President Donald Trump, a Reuters report said he believes talks toward ending the war in Ukraine are ‘getting close to something’.

Citing a White House official, the report said the US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are set to meet a Russian delegation in Miami this weekend. Referring to the recent Russian gains on the battlefield, Trump said, “I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there.”

A peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will ease concerns over global crude oil supply disruptions. Russia is one of the world’s major crude oil producers.

Meanwhile, reports said that Venezuela has authorised two unsanctioned very large crude carriers to set sail for China.

Trump had recently announced that the US would impose a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country. This had put at risk around 600,000 barrels of oil per day in exports. China is the major buyer of this crude.

January natural gas futures were trading at ₹329.20 on MCX during the first hour of trading on Friday, down 1.99 per cent from the previous close of ₹335.90.

On the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), January guargum contracts traded at ₹9910 in the first hour of trading on Friday, up 0.22 per cent from the previous close of ₹9888.

January jeera futures were trading at ₹21035 on NCDEX in the initial hour of trading on Friday, down 0.47 per cent from the previous close of ₹21135.

[TITLE]U.S. Weighs New Oil Sanctions on Russia if Putin Rejects Peace Deal:
[TEXT]
The United States is considering a fresh barrage of sanctions against Russia’s oil exports if Russian President Vladimir Putin rejects a peace agreement for Ukraine, anonymous sources with knowledge of the plans told Bloomberg on Wednesday.

Earlier this week, the U.S. and Ukraine both signaled progress in negotiations about a peace agreement during talks in German capital city of Berlin. Washington is now reportedly offering Ukraine security guarantees modeled on NATO’s Article 5 mutual defense pledge.

However, key issues about territory remain unresolved, and Putin has signaled he wants all occupied territory.

U.S. President Donald Trump is said to be pushing for a U.S.-brokered deal by Christmas.

On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a U.S.-brokered draft deal to end the war could be presented to Russia within days. It is not certain how Russia would react—it has rejected all drafts so far insisting on its own territorial claims and conditions.

Now the U.S. is already considering how to escalate the sanctions. The Treasury could target additional vessels of the Russian shadow fleet transporting oil, as well as traders found to have facilitated such transactions, according to Bloomberg’s sources.

The sanctions could be announced later this week, some of these sources told Bloomberg.

The previous round of U.S. sanctions – the Trump Administration’s first against Russia – are still reverberating through the global oil markets as they upended trade flows. The sanctions designated Russia’s top two producers and exporters, Rosneft and Lukoil, and sent Indian buyers scrambling for non-sanctioned crude and Lukoil’s international assets fighting for U.S. waivers to continue normal operations and negotiate asset sales.

Asked to comment on Bloomberg’s report that the U.S. readies additional sanctions, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said today that “Any sanctions harm the fostering of relations, that is obvious,” as carried by Russian news agency Interfax.

[TITLE]The Battery Boom Is Reshaping Power Markets:
[TEXT]
The uptake of utility-scale battery storage has grown significantly in recent years as more countries switch to renewables. Battery storage ensures that grids powered by less reliable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, can continue to deliver a stable supply of clean energy through the day and night.

The battery storage boom of recent years has been driven largely by the falling costs of lithium-ion batteries, which have made it possible for utilities worldwide to invest in more batteries. The cost of batteries has fallen by around 90 percent in the last 15 years, as commercial production has expanded. China is currently the world’s biggest battery producer, but several other regions are developing their manufacturing capacity, such as Europe, India, and the United States.

Energy storage additions worldwide are expected to break another record this year, driven by China and the U.S. Global annual energy storage deployment (excluding pumped hydropower plants) is expected to reach 92 GW in 2025, which is 23 percent higher than in 2024. China will contribute more than 50 percent of this capacity increase, while the U.S. will account for around 14 percent. The U.S. contribution of energy storage is impressive, given the difficult year faced by the wind and solar energy industries under the Trump administration. BloombergNEF expects cumulative energy storage capacity in 2035 to reach 2 terawatts, at eight times higher than the level in 2025.

In the United States, battery expansion has been met with mixed success. It is still difficult to convince utilities in certain areas of the country to invest in battery storage. Meanwhile, policymakers are often lukewarm

[TITLE]Analyst Trims Price Target on Eversource Energy (ES) Amid Model Updates in the Utilities Sector:

Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) is included among the 11 Best Utility Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds.

Analyst Trims Price Target on Eversource Energy (ES) Amid Model Updates in the Utilities Sector

Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) operates New England’s largest energy delivery system and serves customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.

On December 12, JPMorgan lowered its price target on Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) from $72 to $71, while maintaining an ‘Underweight’ rating on the shares. The revised target, still indicating an upside potential of almost 4% from the current share price, comes as the analyst firm updated models in the North American utilities group.

That said, BofA instead raised its price target on Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) from $72 to $75 on December 5, while keeping its ‘Buy’ rating on the shares. The update comes after the firm hosted an investor trip to Eversource’s Cambridge underground substation and then met with the company’s CFO, John Moreira, to discuss the utility’s regulatory roadmap. As a result, BofA increased its EPS forecasts for Eversource for the 2026-29 period.

It is worth noting that last month, Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) reaffirmed its 5-year capital plan of $24.2 billion through 2029. Moreover, the company continues to see additional capital investment opportunities of $1.5 billion to $2 billion within the forecast period.

Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.7525 per share on December 3 and currently boasts an impressive annual dividend yield of 4.43%, putting it among the 14 Best Utility Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.

While we acknowledge the potential of ES as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you’re looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
