[TITLE]Applegreen spent tens of thousands on lobbyists amid controversial travel plaza deal:
[TEXT]
Applegreen, an Irish company at the center of a now-defunct deal to redevelop travel plazas along state highways, shelled out tens of thousands of dollars between 2024 and 2025 to a powerful Beacon Hill lobbying shop, according to a state database last updated June 30.

Companies looking to do business in Massachusetts regularly employ local lobbyists to help facilitate connections with state officials. But text messages between a consultant working for Applegreen’s registered lobbyist and a Massachusetts Department of Transportation official key to the travel plaza contract have drawn scrutiny from a losing bidder.

In a lawsuit filed earlier this month, Waltham-based Global Partners said the contract’s procurement process that MassDOT kicked off in September 2024 “was fatally compromised” by improper communications and “undisclosed conflicts of interest.”

“At nearly every critical stage of the procurement process, when addenda were issued, when proposers were making their final submissions, when clarifications were sought on financial assumptions, and when committees and the MassDOT board were preparing to deliberate, (Scott) Bosworth, the chair of the Selection Committee, was in private contact with Applegreen’s owner and lobbyists and Suffolk (Construction) executives, including communications directly related to the solicitation process, evaluation, and result,” the lawsuit said.

Applegreen previously said the lawsuit from Global Partners “repeats a number of misrepresentations and inaccuracies that Global has issued, all of which have previously been debunked by both third parties and the Commonwealth.”

Companies looking to bid on the contract were barred during the procurement period from talking

[TITLE]Firehawk Aerospace secures $60 million investment from Presto Tech Horizons:
[TEXT]
Firehawk Aerospace has secured an oversubscribed $60 million investment round led by 1789 Capital. The venture capital firm’s partnership group includes Donald Trump Jr. Presto Tech Horizons (PTH), a defense and resilience tech fund created through a partnership between European venture capital firm Presto Ventures and Czechoslovak Group, also contributed to the round.

Firehawk is using 3D printing technology to produce propellant and solid rocket motors. The company aims to make the manufacture of advanced energetics faster, safer, and more flexible. Their approach can also be used for artillery charges, allowing ammunition production to be rapid, reliable, and scalable.

Firehawk’s method uses commercial-off-the-shelf equipment and new additive manufacturing processes to greatly reduce production times. This transforms the energetics supply chain. With this latest funding, Firehawk plans to improve Europe’s ability to locally source critical munitions supply chain elements.

Firehawk’s defense mission gains traction

This will boost resilience and ensure sustained defense readiness for NATO and allied forces. Will Edwards, CEO of Firehawk, said, “The conflict in Ukraine proves that while drones give warfighters a decisive edge, munitions like missiles and rockets are the core of combat power.

A supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and propellant and energetics production are currently the biggest constraints on missile, rocket, and artillery manufacturing. Enabling the European defense industry to produce these weapons quickly and at scale is the core of Firehawk’s mission. We’re proud to partner with Presto Tech Horizons and CSG to bolster the European energetics supply chain.”

Michal Strnad, Chairman of the Board and owner of Czechoslovak Group, stressed the importance of investing in innovative defense technologies given the current geopolitical climate.

“Firehawk can play a crucial role in the future of not only rocket propulsion but also ammunition production. This innovative project can strengthen cooperation between leaders of the American and European defense industries.”

The involved parties are already looking at opportunities for industrial application of Firehawk’s technologies. Matej Luhovy, newly appointed Partner at Presto Tech Horizons, said, “Since the early 2010s, scientists and engineers have explored 3D printing to unlock faster, safer, and more flexible solid propellant production.

Firehawk is the first to truly deliver on that promise. Their technology doesn’t just speed up propellant manufacture—it fundamentally reshapes the supply chain for missiles and rockets.”

This investment marks a major milestone for Firehawk Aerospace and its mission to revolutionize the energetics supply chain for defense industries.
