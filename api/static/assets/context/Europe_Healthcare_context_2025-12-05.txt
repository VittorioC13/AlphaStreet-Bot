Key Factors Driving the Growth of the SCD Market

Rising SCD Prevalence

According to DelveInsight’s assessment, in 2024, the total prevalent cases of sickle cell disease (SCD) in the 6MM were nearly 178.5K. These cases are anticipated to increase by 2034, with the majority occurring in individuals aged 18–44 years, followed by those aged 45–64 years, and fewer in younger (0–17 years) and older (65+ years) populations.

Current Standard of Care

The present treatment landscape for SCD includes NSAIDs, blood transfusions, chelating agents, nutritional supplements, and broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage complications. Established disease-modifying therapies include DROXIA (hydroxyurea), ENDARI (L-glutamine oral powder), and ADAKVEO (crizanlizumab-tmca). However, in September 2024, all lots of OXBRYTA were withdrawn across all markets, creating a treatment gap in the standard of care.

Launch of Emerging SCD Drugs

The SCD clinical trial landscape appears to be growing, with key players such as Novo Nordisk (etavopivat; NDec), Pfizer (osivelotor; inclacumab), Agios Pharmaceuticals (mitapivat), Fulcrum Therapeutics (pociredir), and others developing their assets in both early and late phases.

Sickle Cell Disease Market Analysis

Although sickle cell disease is widespread in the United States, many patients still receive inadequate care, particularly when treated by non-specialists. This highlights gaps within the healthcare system, leading to poor symptom control.

Management of SCD involves both drug-based and supportive therapies. Approved pharmacologic treatments include hydroxyurea, ENDARI (L-glutamine), ADAKVEO (crizanlizumab), CASGEVY (exagamglogene autotemcel), and LYFGENIA (lovotibeglogene autotemcel). Pain is commonly managed with opioids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and corticosteroids. Non-drug interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation methods, biofeedback, and acupuncture, also play a supportive role.

Hydroxyurea remains the standard first-line option, while newer agents are being used to enhance symptom control. Therapies like ADAKVEO show strong adherence due to favorable dosing schedules and their ability to reduce vaso-occlusive crises.

Multiple next-generation treatments are progressing through the pipeline. Notable developers include Pfizer (inclacumab, GBT-601), Novo Nordisk (etavopivat), Bluebird Bio (lovo-cel), and Agios Pharmaceuticals (mitapivat). These emerging options aim to fill critical gaps by offering curative potential, improved safety, and greater convenience. With increasing disease burden and expected regulatory approvals, the SCD landscape is set for expansion and remains an attractive area for future investment.

[TITLE]Crinetics Announces First Patient Dosed in Phase 1/2 Trial Evaluating CRN09682 for the Treatment of Neuroendocrine Tumors and Other Somatostatin Receptor 2-Expressing Tumors:
[TEXT]
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: CRNX) today announced the first patient has been dosed in the Phase 1/2 study evaluating CRN09682 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced somatostatin receptor type 2 (SST2)-positive neuroendocrine tumors and other SST2-expressing solid tumors. CRN09682 is the lead candidate from Crinetics’ proprietary nonpeptide drug conjugate (NDC) platform, which leverages the company’s expertise in GPCR drug discovery and small molecule design to develop a pipeline of modular targeted therapies for endocrine and endocrine-related tumors.

“We developed CRN09682 to address the need for a more efficacious, safer, and convenient targeted therapy for patients with SST2-expressing tumors,” said Stephen Betz, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer and Co-Founder of Crinetics. “Dosing the first patient in the Phase 1/2 study marks a major milestone for CRN09682 and our NDC platform as a whole. CRN09682 is the first clinical exploration of this new modality, which we believe has the potential to unlock a new generation of receptor-targeted therapies to treat tumors with precision.”

CRN09682 was designed to bind selectively and with high potency to SST2-expressing tumor cells, promoting rapid receptor internalization and linker cleavage to release a potent cytotoxic payload directly within the tumor. This targeted approach is intended to concentrate treatment at the tumor site, by optimizing tumor penetration and limiting systemic exposure and related toxicities. NDCs are manufactured by traditional chemical synthesis methods, eliminating manufacturing constraints and specialized handling required by most antibody drug conjugates and radiopharmaceuticals.

The Phase 1/2 BRAVESST 2 trial is a first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study with a dose expansion phase designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of CRN09682. The Phase 1 portion will enroll patients in escalating dose cohorts to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for the expansion phase. Phase 2 will further evaluate and characterize CRN09682 in selected SST2-expressing tumor types. Up to 150 participants are expected to be enrolled across both phases. Eligible patients must have metastatic or locally advanced disease progression following standard therapies and SST2-expressing tumors confirmed by somatostatin receptor imaging.

[TITLE]Eisai Presents New Data on the Continued and Expanding Benefit of LEQEMBI® (lecanemab-irmb) Maintenance Treatment in Early Alzheimer’s Disease at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conf:
[TEXT]
Long-term LEQEMBI treatment suggests potential to delay disease progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to moderate Alzheimer’s disease by up to 8.3 years in low-amyloid group who started treatment at an early stage

New safety and efficacy data presented at scientific symposium on subcutaneous formulation for LEQEMBI initiation treatment, which is under regulatory review in the United States

TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that the latest findings on time savings with continued treatment with humanized anti-soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody lecanemab (generic name, U.S. brand name LEQEMBI®) were presented at the 18th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) Conference. Additionally, a scientific symposium was held on the subcutaneous formulation (SC-AI), which was approved for maintenance treatment in the United States in August 2025, and the rolling supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for initiation treatment was completed in November 2025. The application for a subcutaneous injectable formulation in Japan was submitted in November 2025.

Alzheimer‘s disease (AD) is a progressive, relentless disease with Aβ and tau as hallmarks, that is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process driven by protofibrils* (PF) that begins before amyloid plaque removal and continues afterward.1,2,3 Only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both PF and amyloid plaque, which can impact tau downstream.

Estimating the 10-Year Time-Savings Benefits of Lecanemab Treatment (Presentation: December 3, 2:40 PM PT)

This analysis used data from the Clarity AD open-label extension (OLE) and 16 clinical studies of monoclonal antibodies for AD to estimate long-term AD progression over 10 years and the slowing effect of continued lecanemab treatment. The analysis evaluated estimated “time savings” (slowing of disease progression) compared to natural decline based on ADNI** (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) data (untreated group), using Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). These results suggest that early initiation and long-term lecanemab treatment may continue to slow AD progression and help maintain cognitive function over a longer period.

Findings from each group:

Time Savings from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Due to AD to Mild AD The time to progression from MCI due to AD to mild AD was 7.2 years in the untreated group, whereas with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, progression to mild AD took 9.7 years, indicating a time savings of 2.5 years. In the low-amyloid group (patients who started treatment at an early stage: amyloid PET <60 centiloids), the time to progression from MCI to mild AD was 13.2 years with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, suggesting a time savings of 6.0 years.

Time Savings from MCI due to AD to Moderate AD

The time to progression from MCI due to AD to moderate AD was 10.1 years in the untreated group, whereas with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, progression to moderate AD took 13.6 years, indicating a time savings of 3.5 years. In the low-amyloid group, the time to progression with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD was 18.4 years, suggesting a time savings of 8.3 years.

These findings indicate that earlier initiation of LEQEMBI treatment may provide a greater delay in disease progression. Furthermore, each additional year on LEQEMBI could further delay disease progression compared to stopping treatment, even long after plaque is expected to have been cleared.

Lecanemab Subcutaneous Formulation for Treatment Initiation in Early Alzheimer’s Disease: Optimizing Patient Care with a Potential New Option (Symposium Presentation: December 3, 3:10 PM PT)

In this symposium, the latest data from the lecanemab subcutaneous clinical development program were presented focusing on treatment initiation, including results from the subcutaneous (SC) formulation subcohort (n=273) in the Clarity AD trial OLE. It was shown that weekly administration of lecanemab SC-AI at 500 mg (two 250 mg injections) demonstrated bioequivalence in drug exposure compared to intravenous (IV) dosing of 10 mg/kg every two weeks (exposure ratio: 104%, 90% CI: 99.1%–109%).

Based on clinical data and modeling analysis, the effect on amyloid removal in the brain and safety (ARIA-E incidence) was shown to be independent of the route of administration and explained by exposure, suggesting that weekly 500 mg SC dosing provides similar efficacy and safety to biweekly 10 mg/kg IV dosing. Additionally, ARIA-E incidence was also predicted to be comparable between SC and IV administration (12.4% overall, 30.9% in ApoE4 homozygotes).

In this sub-cohort which had prior exposure to lecanemab, safety evaluation showed systemic infusion reactions occurred in 0% of patients receiving 500 mg SC, all of whom had previously received IV lecanemab, and 1.4% of patients who initiated on 720 mg SC by vial, which is favorable compared to systemic infusion reactions in the IV group (26.4%). Immunogenicity assessment indicated a low incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at 1.4%.

These results indicate that the subcutaneous formulations of lecanemab, designed with consideration for the convenience of patients and their care partners, maintains efficacy with a low incidence of systemic infusion reactions, and is otherwise equivalent to conventional IV administration.

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

* Protofibrils are thought to be the most toxic Aβ species that contribute to brain damage in AD and play a major role in the cognitive decline of this progressive and devastating disease. Protofibrils can cause neuronal and synaptic damage in the brain, which can subsequently adversely affect cognitive function through multiple mechanisms.3 The mechanism by which this occurs has been reported not only by increasing the formation of insoluble Aβ plaques, but also by directly damaging signaling between neurons and other cells. It is believed that reducing protofibrils may reduce neuronal damage and cognitive impairment, potentially preventing the progression of AD.4

** ADNI is a clinical research project launched in 2005 to develop methods to predict the onset and progression of AD and to confirm the effectiveness of treatments. The project involves a multi-year longitudinal observation targeting healthy elderly individuals as well as patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early stages of AD.

INDICATION

LEQEMBI® is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Treatment with LEQEMBI should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: AMYLOID-RELATED IMAGING ABNORMALITIES (ARIA) Monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA, characterized as ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). Incidence and timing of ARIA vary among treatments. ARIA usually occurs early in treatment and is usually asymptomatic, although serious and life-threatening events, including seizure and status epilepticus, can occur. ARIA can be fatal. Serious intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) >1 cm, some of which have been fatal, have been observed with this class of medications. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy to a patient being treated with LEQEMBI. Apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4) Homozygotes : Patients who are ApoE ε4 homozygotes (~15% of patients with AD) treated with this class of medications have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic, serious, and severe radiographic ARIA, compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers. Testing for ApoE ε4 status should be performed prior to initiation of treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. Prior to testing, prescribers should discuss with patients the risk of ARIA across genotypes and the implications of genetic testing results. Prescribers should inform patients that if genotype testing is not performed, they can still be treated with LEQEMBI; however, it cannot be determined if they are ApoE ε4 homozygotes and at higher risk for ARIA.

Consider the benefit of LEQEMBI for the treatment of AD and the potential risk of serious ARIA events when deciding to initiate treatment with LEQEMBI.

CONTRAINDICATION

Contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to lecanemab-irmb or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities

Medications in this class, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA-E, which can be observed on MRI as brain edema or sulcal effusions, and ARIA-H, which includes microhemorrhage and superficial siderosis. ARIA can occur spontaneously in patients with AD, particularly in patients with MRI findings suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), such as pretreatment microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis. ARIA-H generally occurs with ARIA-E. Reported ARIA symptoms may include headache, confusion, visual changes, dizziness, nausea, and gait difficulty. Focal neurologic deficits may also occur. Symptoms usually resolve over time.

Incidence of ARIA

Symptomatic ARIA occurred in 3% and serious ARIA symptoms in 0.7% with LEQEMBI. Clinical ARIA symptoms resolved in 79% of patients during the period of observation. ARIA, including asymptomatic radiographic events, was observed: LEQEMBI, 21%; placebo, 9%. ARIA-E was observed: LEQEMBI, 13%; placebo, 2%. ARIA-H was observed: LEQEMBI, 17%; placebo, 9%. No increase in isolated ARIA-H was observed for LEQEMBI vs placebo.

Incidence of ICH

ICH >1 cm in diameter was reported in 0.7% with LEQEMBI vs 0.1% with placebo. Fatal events of ICH in patients taking LEQEMBI have been observed.

Risk Factors of ARIA and ICH

ApoE ε4 Carrier Status

Of the patients taking LEQEMBI, 16% were ApoE ε4 homozygotes, 53% were heterozygotes, and 31% were noncarriers. With LEQEMBI, ARIA was higher in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (LEQEMBI: 45%; placebo: 22%) than in heterozygotes (LEQEMBI: 19%; placebo: 9%) and noncarriers (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 4%). Symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 9% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes vs 2% of heterozygotes and 1% of noncarriers. Serious ARIA events occurred in 3% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes and in ~1% of heterozygotes and noncarriers. The recommendations on management of ARIA do not differ between ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers.

Radiographic Findings of CAA

Neuroimaging findings that may indicate CAA include evidence of prior ICH, cerebral microhemorrhage, and cortical superficial siderosis. CAA has an increased risk for ICH. The presence of an ApoE ε4 allele is also associated with CAA.

The baseline presence of at least 2 microhemorrhages or the presence of at least 1 area of superficial siderosis on MRI, which may be suggestive of CAA, have been identified as risk factors for ARIA. Patients were excluded from Clarity AD for the presence of >4 microhemorrhages and additional findings suggestive of CAA (prior cerebral hemorrhage >1 cm in greatest diameter, superficial siderosis, vasogenic edema) or other lesions (aneurysm, vascular malformation) that could potentially increase the risk of ICH.

Concomitant Antithrombotic or Thrombolytic Medication

In Clarity AD, baseline use of antithrombotic medication (aspirin, other antiplatelets, or anticoagulants) was allowed if the patient was on a stable dose. Most exposures were to aspirin. Antithrombotic medications did not increase the risk of ARIA with LEQEMBI. The incidence of ICH: 0.9% in patients taking LEQEMBI with a concomitant antithrombotic medication vs 0.6% with no antithrombotic and 2.5% in patients taking LEQEMBI with an anticoagulant alone or with antiplatelet medication such as aspirin vs none in patients receiving placebo.

Fatal cerebral hemorrhage has occurred in 1 patient taking an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in the setting of focal neurologic symptoms of ARIA and the use of a thrombolytic agent.

Additional caution should be exercised when considering the administration of antithrombotics or a thrombolytic agent (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) to a patient already being treated with LEQEMBI. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, treating clinicians should consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy in a patient being treated with LEQEMBI.

Caution should be exercised when considering the use of LEQEMBI in patients with factors that indicate an increased risk for ICH and, in particular, patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy or patients with findings on MRI that are suggestive of CAA.

Radiographic Severity With LEQEMBI

Most ARIA-E radiographic events occurred within the first 7 doses, although ARIA can occur at any time, and patients can have >1 episode. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-E with LEQEMBI was mild in 4%, moderate in 7%, and severe in 1% of patients. Resolution on MRI occurred in 52% of ARIA-E patients by 12 weeks, 81% by 17 weeks, and 100% overall after detection. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-H microhemorrhage with LEQEMBI was mild in 9%, moderate in 2%, and severe in 3% of patients; superficial siderosis was mild in 4%, moderate in 1%, and severe in 0.4% of patients. With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-E was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (5%) vs heterozygotes (0.4%) or noncarriers (0%). With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-H was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (13.5%) vs heterozygotes (2.1%) or noncarriers (1.1%).

Monitoring and Dose Management Guidelines

Baseline brain MRI and periodic monitoring with MRI are recommended. Enhanced clinical vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 14 weeks of treatment. Depending on ARIA-E and ARIA-H clinical symptoms and radiographic severity, use clinical judgment when considering whether to continue dosing or to temporarily or permanently discontinue LEQEMBI. If a patient experiences ARIA symptoms, clinical evaluation should be performed, including MRI if indicated. If ARIA is observed on MRI, careful clinical evaluation should be performed prior to continuing treatment.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis, have occurred with LEQEMBI. Promptly discontinue the infusion upon the first observation of any signs or symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction and initiate appropriate therapy.

Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)

IRRs were observed—LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%—and most cases with LEQEMBI (75%) occurred with the first infusion. IRRs were mostly mild (69%) or moderate (28%). Symptoms included fever and flu-like symptoms (chills, generalized aches, feeling shaky, and joint pain), nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, and oxygen desaturation.

IRRs can occur during or after the completion of infusion. In the event of an IRR during the infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced or discontinued, and appropriate therapy initiated as clinically indicated. Consider prophylactic treatment prior to future infusions with antihistamines, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥5% with LEQEMBI infusion every 2 weeks and ≥2% higher than placebo were IRRs (LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%), ARIA-H (LEQEMBI: 14%; placebo: 8%), ARIA-E (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 2%), headache (LEQEMBI: 11%; placebo: 8%), superficial siderosis of central nervous system (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 3%), rash (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%), and nausea/vomiting (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%)

Safety profile of LEQEMBI IQLIK for maintenance treatment was similar to LEQEMBI infusion. Patients who received LEQEMBI IQLIK experienced localized and systemic (less frequent) injection-related reactions (mild to moderate in severity)

LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) is available :

Intravenous infusion: 100 mg/mL

Subcutaneous injection: 200 mg/mL

Key Factors Driving the Growth of the SCD Market

Rising SCD Prevalence

According to DelveInsight’s assessment, in 2024, the total prevalent cases of sickle cell disease (SCD) in the 6MM were nearly 178.5K. These cases are anticipated to increase by 2034, with the majority occurring in individuals aged 18–44 years, followed by those aged 45–64 years, and fewer in younger (0–17 years) and older (65+ years) populations.

Current Standard of Care

The present treatment landscape for SCD includes NSAIDs, blood transfusions, chelating agents, nutritional supplements, and broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage complications. Established disease-modifying therapies include DROXIA (hydroxyurea), ENDARI (L-glutamine oral powder), and ADAKVEO (crizanlizumab-tmca). However, in September 2024, all lots of OXBRYTA were withdrawn across all markets, creating a treatment gap in the standard of care.

Launch of Emerging SCD Drugs

The SCD clinical trial landscape appears to be growing, with key players such as Novo Nordisk (etavopivat; NDec), Pfizer (osivelotor; inclacumab), Agios Pharmaceuticals (mitapivat), Fulcrum Therapeutics (pociredir), and others developing their assets in both early and late phases.

Sickle Cell Disease Market Analysis

Although sickle cell disease is widespread in the United States, many patients still receive inadequate care, particularly when treated by non-specialists. This highlights gaps within the healthcare system, leading to poor symptom control.

Management of SCD involves both drug-based and supportive therapies. Approved pharmacologic treatments include hydroxyurea, ENDARI (L-glutamine), ADAKVEO (crizanlizumab), CASGEVY (exagamglogene autotemcel), and LYFGENIA (lovotibeglogene autotemcel). Pain is commonly managed with opioids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and corticosteroids. Non-drug interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation methods, biofeedback, and acupuncture, also play a supportive role.

Hydroxyurea remains the standard first-line option, while newer agents are being used to enhance symptom control. Therapies like ADAKVEO show strong adherence due to favorable dosing schedules and their ability to reduce vaso-occlusive crises.

Multiple next-generation treatments are progressing through the pipeline. Notable developers include Pfizer (inclacumab, GBT-601), Novo Nordisk (etavopivat), Bluebird Bio (lovo-cel), and Agios Pharmaceuticals (mitapivat). These emerging options aim to fill critical gaps by offering curative potential, improved safety, and greater convenience. With increasing disease burden and expected regulatory approvals, the SCD landscape is set for expansion and remains an attractive area for future investment.

Data from Iolyx’s Phase 2 clinical trial of ILYX-002 in patients with autoimmune associated DED reported at ARVO in May 2025 demonstrate a statistically significant clinical improvement in corneal staining starting at day 15 in these patients with challenging autoimmune conditions, and clinically relevant trends in the primary endpoint of total conjunctival staining and exploratory symptomatic endpoints. ILYX-002 demonstrated early positive and sustained impacts at day 15 and week 8.1

“These Phase 2 results are highly encouraging for patients with autoimmune-associated dry eye disease, a condition that has long lacked safe and effective options. They confirm ILYX-002’s potential to address one of ophthalmology’s most challenging conditions. At Théa, we remain committed to advancing therapies that demonstrate clinical efficacy while maintaining a strong safety profile,” said Jean-Frédéric Chibret, President of the Théa group. “Drawing on decades of acknowledged expertise in dry eye management across Europe, we are advancing this program into Phase 3 with the benefit of extensive clinical and therapeutic insight. This partnership allows us to extend that expertise to new geographies and represents a key step toward our ambition to develop a meaningful and lasting presence in the U.S. dry eye market.”

The strategic partnership covers treatment of DED associated with systemic autoimmune disorders and potentially other indications in eye care across all global geographies, excluding China, Japan, and certain other countries in Asia. Iolyx is primarily responsible for the design of the Phase 3 clinical trials, manufacturing, and non-clinical activities whereas Théa will assume primary responsibility both for the conduct of the Phase 3 clinical trials as well as for securing regional marketing authorizations within the designated territory under the agreement. Upon approval in respective regions, Théa will be responsible for all commercial activities including sales, marketing and market access.

“Our additional investment reflects continued conviction in Iolyx’s team, science, and strategy,” said Dan Estes, Partner Frazier Life Sciences. “The Phase 2 data in immune-driven dry eye provide a strong foundation for late-stage development, and this Series B financing and partnership will support Phase 3 readiness for ILYX-002 while enabling Iolyx to expand its pipeline into autoimmune-associated retinal diseases. We’re proud to back a company pairing rigorous clinical execution with a clear path to impact for patients who have long lacked targeted therapies.”

Leerink Partners served as exclusive financial advisor to Iolyx Therapeutics.

About ILYX-002-201

ILYX-002-201 is a first-in-human Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ILYX-002 in patients with moderate-to-severe dry eye disease (DED) associated with systemic autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. Conducted across multiple sites in Australia, this randomized, double-masked, and vehicle-controlled study commenced with a closely monitored sentinel cohort (n=2) overseen by an independent Safety Review Committee.
