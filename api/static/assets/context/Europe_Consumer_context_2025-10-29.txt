[TITLE]AIG to acquire the majority of renewal rights to Everest Group’s global retail insurance portfolio in $2 billion deal:
[TEXT]
Insurance giant AIG is set to acquire the renewal rights for the majority of Everest Group’s global retail insurance portfolio worth $2 billion in premiums, sources with intimate knowledge of the deal told Fortune.

The agreement with Everest, one of the world’s largest reinsurance and insurance solutions firms, is part of AIG CEO Peter Zaffino’s transformation effort at the century-old insurance company. It will also ease Everest’s loss reserve management issues after it underestimated claim costs in its U.S. casualty insurance business, leaving the firm in need of capital.

Insiders say that AIG expects to begin writing policies for existing North America Everest clients by the start of 2026. As for clients in the European Union, AIG is positioned to begin working on that portfolio during Q1 of 2026, depending on regulatory approvals.

AIG, a $44 billion insurance company, already serves more than 88 million commercial and personal customers worldwide​, operating in more than 200 countries and jurisdictions​. Everest also serves millions of policy holders, but is substantially smaller, valued at approximately $14.5 billion.

Meanwhile, Everest has hired multiple senior executives from AIG in recent years including the company’s former legal chief Anthony Vidovich, who was named executive vice president and general counsel of Everest on Oct. 16.

The Everest deal, insiders say, did not require AIG to seek out external capital or take on debt. And while AIG will obtain the portfolio and client relationships within the deal, all existing liabilities and prior exposures will remain with Everest. This specification will allow AIG to gain access to customers and future business without inheriting responsibility for claims and obligations from policies written before the transaction closed.

The move will significantly advance AIG’s portfolio growth in general insurance, a facet which, under Zaffino’s leadership, has demonstrated consistent growth. In 2024, the company wrote $23.9 billion in insurance premiums, up 6% year over year on a comparable basis. New business in 2024 reached $4.5 billion, a 9% increase. The company’s Q1 and Q2 earnings show potential further promise. New premiums written in Q1 were up 8% on a comparable basis, bringing in $4.5 billion, with Q2 premiums generating $6.9 billion.

Growth potential and avoidance of additional financial risk are particularly important to Zaffino’s vision and turnaround of AIG. The company has faced an uphill battle following its involvement in the 2008 global financial crisis. Leading up to 2008, AIG entered into enormous volumes of largely unhedged credit default swaps, insuring more than $440 billion in assets, including $57.8 billion backed by risky subprime mortgages.

When the subprime mortgage market collapsed, AIG faced huge losses and had to pay out on the credit default contracts. As investors and counterparties demanded collateral, the company’s liquidity evaporated, requiring a $182 billion government bailout, in exchange for an equity stake.

In the decade that followed, the insurer lost more than $30 billion in underwriting—a sign of excess capital, poor risk controls, and a lack of accountability for underwriting outcomes—and endured several CEO changes.

When Zaffino became CEO in 2021, AIG had undergone massive downsizing, asset sales, and management churn, but lingering operational inefficiencies and poor profitability, especially in underwriting, remained.

Since taking over, Zaffino has led an aggressive transformation strategy focused on disciplined underwriting, operational streamlining, and technological modernization. AIG has divested non-core units, reduced its risk exposure by over $1 trillion, and invested in AI capabilities. Those include partnerships with Anthropic and Palantir to build AI-driven risk assessment and operational tools aimed at improving underwriting precision and claims efficiency.

AIG’s financial performance has markedly improved, with analysts describing it as a “different company” compared to past years. In Q2 2025, the firm reported a $1.1 billion profit, reversing a $4 billion loss a year earlier which mainly reflected the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial, a life insurance and retirement solutions provider, and other portfolio changes. Adjusted after-tax income rose 56% year over year, and AIG’s earnings per share of $1.81 beat the forecast of $1.60, while revenue of $6.88 billion surpassed the expected $6.78 billion.

Fans can shop the assortment on NFLShop.com, Fanatics.com, team retail locations and at stadium stores. It will be available internationally through local NFL Shop sites.

Developed in partnership with Fanatics, the drop reimagines signature Lululemon styles like the men’s Steady State franchise and women’s Define, Scuba and Align collections through the lens of team pride. The result is a hybrid of fan gear and lifestyle fashion in an era when game-day apparel doubles as everyday wear.

“Together with Fanatics, we are introducing an elevated collection that redefines modern fan apparel and is uniquely designed for everyday comfort,” Renie Anderson, executive vice president and chief revenue officer at the NFL, said in a statement. Celeste Burgoyne, president of the Americas and global guest innovation at Lululemon, added, “True NFL fans wear their pride. For them, fan gear is more than apparel — it’s a badge of loyalty and a way to instantly connect with a community that is like a family.”

To celebrate the launch, the brands rolled out a “Welcome to the Fam Club” campaign featuring NFL legends Joe Montana, Nick Foles, Ryan Clark and Emmanuel Acho alongside their families.

The deal arrives as the company seeks to diversify its consumer base and tap into the lucrative fan-merch market. For the NFL, it’s a chance to elevate its merchandise offerings and connect with younger, style-conscious audiences. Lululemon, long known for its yoga roots and premium athleisure, last patnered with the NHL on its first-ever licensed merch collection.

[TITLE]Reebok Taps Adidas Veteran Marc Le Roux as European CEO as it Opens London HQ:
[TEXT]
Reebok has opened the doors to its new European headquarters in London and has tapped a familiar footwear face to lead the region.

On Monday, the Authentic Brands Group-owned athletic brand officially revealed its new European HQ located at 40–50 Tottenham Street inside Arthur Stanley House. Reebok noted that the new space will serve as both a commercial engine and a creative hub and will work closely with the Boston-based Reebok Design Hub.

Reebok added that the new regional HQ is designed to accelerate retail expansion, strengthen performance and women’s categories, and deepen the brand’s cultural footprint while supporting its longstanding network of regional partners, retailers, and consumers.

With the opening of its new headquarters, the brand has tapped Marc Le Roux as the new chief executive officer of Reebok Europe.

Le Roux joins Reebok from French footwear manufacturer Groupe Royer where he served as CEO since Sep. 2024. The executive has also spent over 15 years at Adidas, with his most recent role of senior vice president and general manager in the Asia Pacific region. Other roles he held while at the German athletic company include vice president of Greater China, brand director, and head of sport marketing.

In a statement on Monday, Le Roux said that he is joining the company at an “incredibly exciting moment” for Reebok.

“The brand’s legacy, combined with the strong foundation established by Authentic, has created an environment for success,” Le Roux noted. “The opening of our new London headquarters marks a powerful symbol of Reebok’s future in Europe, and I’m thrilled to help write the next chapter of its story.”

Le Roux takes the helm over from interim CEO Steve Robaire who will “remain very close” to the Reebok Europe business by assuming an advisory role to the GB Brands board, the brand’s European operating partner.

“Europe has always been at the heart of Reebok’s story, and this new office represents both a homecoming and a forward-looking investment,” added Robaire, executive vice president of Reebok at Authentic. “We’re building a team and a space to reignite Reebok’s legacy in sport while connecting authentically with today’s culture and consumers. Alongside our new home, we’re proud to welcome Marc Le Roux as the new CEO of Reebok Europe, whose leadership will be instrumental in expanding the brand’s regional footprint.”

This news comes after Authentic Brands Group confirmed to FN in February that it signed a new joint venture between Galaxy Universal and Batra Group, dubbed GB Brands Europe Limited, to oversee Reebok’s operations across Europe and the U.K. This new venture took over for New Guards Group (NGG), a division of Farfetch, which previously distributed Reebok footwear and apparel in Europe.

[TITLE]Tariffs Are Threatening a Christmas Tree and Holiday Decor Shortage This Year — Here’s What Our Editors Recommend Shopping Early:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

If you’ve always scoffed at people who have their Christmas tree up by Halloween, it’s time to be a bit more open-minded this year. Based on tariffs affecting imports from China to the U.S. (and the fact that “roughly 90 percent of all artificial Christmas trees are made in China,” per CNBC, with similar stats affecting Christmas decor as a whole), limited inventory is expected across multiple categories of seasonal decorative goods as companies cut back on imports or halt them entirely. What this means in layman’s terms? Should you choose to shop for your faux pine wreath during the first week of December, you might be met with a dreaded “out of stock” notification.

It’s common industry knowledge that the holiday decor shopping boom happens around Black Friday each year, so we’re urging you to take matters into your own hands by setting aside time to score everything on your Christmas interior design Pinterest board now. Yes, you’ll encounter steeper prices than in 2024 — also as a result of geopolitical-slash-economic tensions — but at least they’ll be accompanied by the peace of mind that comes from knowing everything you want is still in stock and at your fingertips.

We’re just as shocked as you are that something as wholesome as Christmas trees has met the fate of designer handbags and footwear manufactured in China. But because you’re reading

In the near future, consumers across Europe may begin scanning QR codes on everyday items—from sneakers to consumer electronics—to access detailed digital records of where products were made, what they are composed of, and how they can be repaired, reused, or recycled.

This is not a marketing gimmick but part of a broader regulatory movement embedding transparency and sustainability into the fabric of retail. Enter the Digital Product Passport (DPP).

Summary Results

Three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to three months ended June 30, 2025

The Company’s net income was $16.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $14.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025. Net interest income increased by $2.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by loan growth and an improvement in the average yield on loans, partially offset by an increase in interest expense driven by deposit growth. The provision for credit losses remained at $2.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025. Non-interest income increased by $0.2 million, primarily due to an increase in swap referral fees during the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2025. Non-interest expense increased by $0.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to salaries and employee benefits due to increased headcount.

Net uninsured and uncollateralized deposits were approximately $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2025, increasing from $1.3 billion at June 30, 2025.

Non-interest-bearing deposit growth was driven by new accounts opened during the quarter, adding $28.8 million in new balances.

Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2025 were $580.4 million, representing 14.15% of total deposits at September 30, 2025, as compared to 12.42% as of June 30, 2025.

The increase in total assets from December 31, 2024 to September 30, 2025 was primarily comprised of a $354.6 million increase in total loans held for investment and a $228.1 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. The $354.6 million increase in total loans held for investment between December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025 was a result of $931.8 million in loan originations and advances, partially offset by $219.8 million and $357.5 million in loan payoffs and paydowns, respectively. The $354.6 million increase in total loans held for investment included $70.7 million in purchases of loans within the consumer concentration of the loan portfolio. The $228.1 million increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily resulted from a $217.8 million increase in interest-bearing deposits in banks.

The increase in total liabilities from December 31, 2024 to September 30, 2025 was primarily due to an increase in deposits of $545.4 million. The increase in deposits was largely due to increases in money market and non-interest-bearing deposits of $446.9 million and $136.5 million, respectively.

The increase in total shareholders’ equity from December 31, 2024 to September 30, 2025 was primarily a result of net income recognized of $44.0 million and a $2.5 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by $12.8 million in cash dividends paid during the period.

Net interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased $2.8 million, or 7.76%, to $39.3 million compared to $36.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2025. Net interest margin totaled 3.56% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of three basis points compared to the prior quarter. The increase in net interest income is primarily attributable to an additional $4.3 million in interest income, mainly due to a $140.2 million, or 3.80%, increase in the average balance of loans and a five basis point improvement in the average yield on loans during the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior quarter. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an additional $1.4 million in interest expense, which was mainly driven by a $225.7 million, or 6.04%, increase in the average balance of deposits at an average rate of two basis points lower than the prior quarter. In addition, the average balance of non-interest bearing deposits increased by $59.5 million, or 6.22%, compared to the prior quarter.

As compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased by $9.0 million, or 29.49%, to $39.3 million from $30.4 million. Net interest margin totaled 3.56% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of 19 basis points compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in net interest income is primarily attributable to an additional $12.2 million in interest income, mainly due to a $477.8 million, or 14.25%, increase in the average balance of loans and a 16 basis point improvement in the average yield on loans during the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an additional $3.2 million in interest expense compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in interest expense is mainly attributable to a $776.9 million, or 24.39%, increase in the average balance of deposits at an average rate of 19 basis points lower during the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same quarter of the prior year. In addition, the average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits increased by $163.7 million, or 19.19%, compared to the same period of the prior year.

Asset Quality

Allowance for Credit Losses

At September 30, 2025, the Company’s allowance for credit losses was $42.1 million, as compared to $37.8 million at December 31, 2024. The $4.3 million increase in the allowance is due to a $7.1 million provision for credit losses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, partially offset by net charge-offs of $2.8 million, primarily attributable to commercial and industrial loans, during the same period.

The Company’s ratio of nonperforming loans to loans held for investment remained at 0.05% at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Loans designated as watch decreased from $123.4 million to $92.7 million between December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025. As a result, loans designated as substandard increased from $2.6 million to $18.6 million between December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, primarily attributable to the downgrade of one special purpose commercial real estate loan whose borrower was experiencing financial difficulty. There were no loans with doubtful risk grades at September 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024.

A summary of the allowance for credit losses by loan class is as follows:

September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 (in thousands) Amount % of Total Amount % of Total Real estate: Commercial $ 23,473 55.81 % $ 25,864 68.44 % Commercial land and development 30 0.07 % 78 0.21 % Commercial construction 4,355 10.35 % 2,268 6.00 % Residential construction 108 0.26 % 64 0.17 % Residential 351 0.83 % 270 0.71 % Farmland 425 1.01 % 607 1.61 % 28,742 68.33 % 29,151 77.14 % Commercial: Secured 10,400 24.73 % 5,866 15.52 % Unsecured 438 1.04 % 278 0.74 % 10,838 25.77 % 6,144 16.26 % Consumer and other 2,481 5.90 % 2,496 6.60 % Total allowance for credit losses $ 42,061 100.00 % $ 37,791 100.00 %

This increase was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in deferred loan origination costs due to a greater number of loan originations, net of purchased consumer loans, period-over-period.

Data processing and software. The increase was primarily due to: (i) increased usage of our digital banking platform; (ii) higher transaction volumes related to the increased number of loan and deposit accounts; and (iii) an increased number of licenses required for new users on our loan origination and documentation system.

Professional services. The increase was primarily due to a $0.1 million increase in fees paid for business development consulting services.

Advertising and promotional. The increase related primarily to additional expenses incurred to support the expansion of the Bank’s business development teams, including a $0.1 million increase in expenses related to sponsored events and partnerships and a $0.1 million increase related to client and prospective client development expenses.

Other operating expenses. The increase was primarily due to: (i) a $0.1 million increase in administrative charges, including subscription services and bank charges; (ii) a $0.1 million increase in IntraFi Network fees resulting from an overall increase in balances carried in the network; and (iii) a $0.1 million increase in armored car and courier expenses.

Provision for Income Taxes

On July 4, 2025, the President signed H.R. 1, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” into law. The legislation includes several changes to federal tax law that generally allow for more favorable deductibility of certain business expenses beginning in 2025, including the restoration of immediate expensing of domestic R&D expenditures, reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation, and more favorable rules for determining the limitation on business interest expense. The Act also made certain changes to the deductibility of the cost of meals and charitable contributions that are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025. These changes were not reflected in the income tax provision for the period ended September 30, 2025. The Company evaluated the impact on future periods and the legislation is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to three months ended June 30, 2025

Provision for income taxes increased to $5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $5.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025, which was primarily due to an increase in taxable income recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2025. The effective tax rates were 26.49% and 27.82% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025, respectively.

Three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to three months ended September 30, 2024

Provision for income taxes increased by $1.6 million, or 36.98%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in taxable income. The effective tax rates were 26.49% and 28.21% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively.

[TITLE]Gaming and Leisure Properties to Acquire Land and Fund Hard Costs of Live! Casino & Hotel Virginia:
[TEXT]
WYOMISSING, Pa., Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (NASDAQ: GLPI) (“GLPI”) announced today that it agreed to acquire the real estate in Petersburg, Virginia, the future site for Live! Casino and Hotel Virginia (“Live! Virginia”), a joint venture of affiliates of The Cordish Companies and Bruce Smith Enterprise (“Live! Virginia Group”). In addition, GLPI committed to fund the hard costs associated with the development of the destination casino and hotel project. The cap rate on both the $27 million land purchase and the $440 million hard cost funding is 8.0% and will be accretive to GLPI’s operating results. Closing of the transaction is subject to usual and customary closing conditions, including receipt of licenses and any approvals by the Virginia Lottery Commission.

The transaction represents an expansion of GLPI’s relationship with The Cordish Companies (“Cordish”), as the development will mark the fourth Cordish property for which GLPI will own the real estate assets. GLPI intends to fund the $27 million land purchase in the first quarter of 2026, with the remaining $440 million of committed financing anticipated to be drawn beginning in the second half of 2026 and continuing through the first quarter of 2028, post the Live! Virginia Group’s equity funding. During the construction phase, Cordish will pay rent on the GLPI funding, as drawn. After the first anniversary of the opening of the permanent casino project, rent will escalate at a rate of 1.75% per annum.

Live! Virginia is located just off I-95, less than 25 miles south of Richmond, VA. The approximately $600 million project will sit within a large 98-acre site and serve as the centerpiece of a broader $1.4 billion planned development, expected to include additional hotels, retail, dining, entertainment, and residential features.

The permanent facility is expected to open in late 2027 and will feature an 80,000 sq. ft. casino with 1,440 slots and 84 tables, over 10 food and beverage outlets, 200 hotel rooms, a 70,000 sq. ft. conference and event center, a 3,200-seat concert venue, and an array of other amenities. A temporary casino facility at the site is scheduled for a late January 2026 opening, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals.

Peter Carlino, GLPI’s Chairman and CEO, commented, “Our partnership with The Cordish Companies continues to expand, with this unique opportunity to further diversify our portfolio, both on a geographic basis and through an expansion with an existing tenant. This accretive transaction plants a Gaming and Leisure Properties flag in Virginia, which will represent the 21st state for our portfolio, and allows us to partner again with a strong, proven tenant on this exciting development project in Petersburg, Virginia. Additionally, this announcement marks our third transaction in the last two months, as the pipeline continues to build, setting the stage for accelerating growth in the coming years.”

David Cordish, Cordish’s Chairman, added, “As a multi-generational, family-owned and operated business, GLPI is an ideal partner for us to continue growing our Gaming Division. GLPI supports what we have done successfully for decades and will continue to do: develop, own, and operate best-in-class entertainment destinations under our Live! brand. We look forward to opening this best-in-class gaming facility.”

Greenhill, a Mizuho Affiliate, acted as financial advisor to Gaming and Leisure Properties.

For further information, GLPI has posted a transaction presentation to its website, which can be accessed at https://investors.glpropinc.com/events-and-presentations.

[TITLE]The Trump Trade Tracker:
[TEXT]
That deadline has been extended both formally and informally, and the trade deals have been few and far between since that initial announcement.

It’s not quite the “ 90 deals in 90 days ” that Trump administration officials claimed were possible back in April, when U.S. President Donald Trump put a 90-day pause on the steep tariffs that he had announced on nearly all U.S. trading partners on April 2. The 90-day pause was intended to allow time for those trading partners to negotiate bilateral deals with Washington to avoid the worst of the tariffs.

That deadline has been extended both formally and informally, and the trade deals have been few and far between since that initial announcement.

But several countries have signed trade agreements with Trump with varying degrees of permanence and formality, often locking in lower tariff rates than the ones he previously threatened in exchange for lowering their own trade barriers to U.S. goods.

New Tariff Rates Based on Preliminary White House Deals

Many of these agreements have been made public by unilateral announcements, either from the White House or by Trump directly on his social media platform Truth Social (though in all cases the countries or governments in question have acknowledged the deal on their side).

These also don’t appear to be formal, binding agreements, unlike, say, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which was ratified by all three countries. The European Union described its deal as a “political agreement,” and multiple countries including the Philippines and the United Kingdom indicated in their statements that further negotiations on specific products and sectors will continue—leaving room for additional disagreements or disputes.

The vast majority of countries still face the sweeping tariffs that Trump sought to impose on April 2, and for the sake of clarity, we have used those tariff rates as a comparison—even though in some cases Trump has threatened higher tariffs in the interim. The other caveat is that these numbers aren’t always definitive or all-encompassing. The administration has said U.S. tariffs on steel, for example, will be negotiated separately, and the tariff rates below have some additional exemptions that we will explain further.

That said, here is everything we know

[TITLE]Lululemon Breaks Into NFL Sports Merchandising With Apparel Collection With Fanatics:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.

Lululemon has teamed up with the NFL for its first-ever officially licensed NFL merch collection.

The collection, which officially launches Oct. 28, spans all 32 NFL teams and includes men’s and women’s apparel and accessories featuring signature team marks. Fans can shop the assortment on NFLShop.com, Fanatics.com, team retail locations and at stadium stores. It will be available internationally through local NFL Shop sites.

Developed in partnership with Fanatics, the drop reimagines signature Lululemon styles like the men’s Steady State franchise and women’s Define, Scuba and Align collections through the lens of team pride. The result is a hybrid of fan gear and lifestyle fashion in an era when game-day apparel doubles as everyday wear.

“Together with Fanatics, we are introducing an elevated collection that redefines modern fan apparel and is uniquely designed for everyday comfort,” Renie Anderson, executive vice president and chief revenue officer at the NFL, said in a statement. Celeste Burgoyne, president of the Americas and global guest innovation at Lululemon, added, “True NFL fans wear their pride. For them, fan gear is more than apparel — it’s a badge of loyalty and a way to instantly connect with a community that is like a family.”

To celebrate the launch, the brands rolled out a “Welcome to the Fam Club” campaign featuring NFL legends Joe Montana, Nick Foles, Ryan Clark and Emmanuel Acho alongside their families.

The deal arrives as the company seeks to diversify its consumer base and tap into the lucrative fan-merch market. For the NFL, it’s a chance to elevate its merchandise offerings and connect with younger, style-conscious audiences. Lululemon, long known for its yoga roots and premium athleisure, last patnered with the NHL on its first-ever licensed merch collection.

[TITLE]Reebok Taps Adidas Veteran Marc Le Roux as European CEO as it Opens London HQ:
[TEXT]
Reebok has opened the doors to its new European headquarters in London and has tapped a familiar footwear face to lead the region.

On Monday, the Authentic Brands Group-owned athletic brand officially revealed its new European HQ located at 40–50 Tottenham Street inside Arthur Stanley House. Reebok noted that the new space will serve as both a commercial engine and a creative hub and will work closely with the Boston-based Reebok Design Hub.

Reebok added that the new regional HQ is designed to accelerate retail expansion, strengthen performance and women’s categories, and deepen the brand’s cultural footprint while supporting its longstanding network of regional partners, retailers, and consumers.

With the opening of its new headquarters, the brand has tapped Marc Le Roux as the new chief executive officer of Reebok Europe.

Le Roux joins Reebok from French footwear manufacturer Groupe Royer where he served as CEO since Sep. 2024. The executive has also spent over 15 years at Adidas, with his most recent role of senior vice president and general manager in the Asia Pacific region. Other roles he held while at the German athletic company include vice president of Greater China, brand director, and head of sport marketing.

In a statement on Monday, Le Roux said that he is joining the company at an “incredibly exciting moment” for Reebok.

“The brand’s legacy, combined with the strong foundation established by Authentic, has created an environment for success,” Le Roux noted. “The opening of our new London headquarters marks a powerful symbol of Reebok’s future in Europe, and I’m thrilled to help write the next chapter of its story.”

Le Roux takes the helm over from interim CEO Steve Robaire who will “remain very close” to the Reebok Europe business by assuming an advisory role to the GB Brands board, the brand’s European operating partner.

“Europe has always been at the heart of Reebok’s story, and this new office represents both a homecoming and a forward-looking investment,” added Robaire, executive vice president of Reebok at Authentic. “We’re building a team and a space to reignite Reebok’s legacy in sport while connecting authentically with today’s culture and consumers. Alongside our new home, we’re proud to welcome Marc Le Roux as the new CEO of Reebok Europe, whose leadership will be instrumental in expanding the brand’s regional footprint.”

This news comes after Authentic Brands Group confirmed to FN in February that it signed a new joint venture between Galaxy Universal and Batra Group, dubbed GB Brands Europe Limited, to oversee Reebok’s operations across Europe and the U.K. This new venture took over for New Guards Group (NGG), a division of Farfetch, which previously distributed Reebok footwear and apparel in Europe.

[TITLE]Is Sustainability Still Worth It? Fashion Industry, Supply Chain Say Resounding Yes:
[TEXT]
VENICE, Italy — As sustainability faces disruption and political backlash globally, fashion finds itself questioning how to move the needle forward after a decade of quantum leap efforts.

Against a dampened economy and geopolitical turmoil, the stakes are higher than ever.

Global supply chains, including Italy’s, are under pressure — and increasingly under scrutiny. Policymakers are navigating the complexity of dealing with a different world — and business views. The performance of the fashion sector is still iffy and the outlook hard to predict.

“The issue at hand concerns the models we want to champion for the future, the vision of the world we want to embrace,” said Vittorio Emanuele Parsi, international relations professor at Milan’s Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, at the fourth two-day edition of the Venice Sustainable Fashion Forum held here at the Fondazione Cini.

“This is the time to have the courage to face our era head-on,” echoed Carlo Cottarelli, director of the program for education in economic and social sciences and of the observatory on Italian public accounts at the same university.

Industry players at the forum recognized the importance of scaling up, rather than back, their efforts and of doing so collaboratively.

“Not only Made in Italy fashion is under attack. The reality is that it’s part of a much broader ecosystem, one we share with our European partners. This is a multifaceted attack,” said Luca Sburlati, president of Confindustria Moda, in reference to the many pressing issues faced by the sector.

“We are working within a model where ethics, economy and innovation are all evolving rapidly, so it’s crucial that we take center stage in this discussion and make decisions to bring to the attention of the policymakers,” he said.

The Italian association was among the organizers of the event alongside Confindustria Veneto Est and consultancy The European House Ambrosetti, or TEHA Group.

A study by the latter titled “Just Fashion Transition 2025,” provided a candid picture of where the fashion sector stands in its eco-journey.

Drawing from data by the European Environment Agency, the research said that the EU fashion sector has cut 37 percent of its carbon emissions since 1990.

An additional 18 percent is still required to comply with the EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles for 2030, which the consultancy estimates would require at least 4.4 billion euros.

“The cost of waiting is higher than the cost of taking action,” said Carlo Cici, partner and head of sustainability practices at TEHA Group. “When it comes to sustainability, waiting is not a viable strategy for growth,” he added, sparking applause from the audience.

Making his point, Cici said that biodiversity and the health of natural ecosystems are crucial enablers of growth as

Key Highlights of the Liquid Dietary Supplements Market

By distribution channel, the pharmacies and drugstores segment held the largest market share of 37% in 2024, while the online/e-commerce segment is expected to grow at a significant CAGR of 26% from 2025 to 2034.

By packaging, the bottles (glass/PET) segment dominated with 63% of the market in 2024, while the single-serve ampoules/sachets segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21% over the projected period.

Rising Health Consciousness is helping the Growth of Liquid Dietary Supplements

The liquid dietary supplements market is expected to grow due to factors such as a growing health-conscious population, rising prevalence of different types of diseases, and an increasing population of aged people. Liquid dietary supplements allow health-conscious consumers to consume essential nutrients for the body in liquid form. It makes it easy for consumers and is also palatable to them. The liquid dietary supplements are available in different forms such as ready-to-drink bottles, concentrates, shots, syrups, and droppers, according to the convenience of consumers.

According to the International Food Information Council (IFIC), over 70% of global consumers in 2024 sought functional supplements or beverages for immunity and digestion. Liquid formats are increasingly preferred due to faster absorption and palatable taste, especially among adults and seniors adopting preventive health routines.

Impact of AI in the Liquid Dietary Supplements Market

Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a transformative impact on the liquid dietary supplements market, reshaping everything from product development and personalization to manufacturing, marketing, and regulatory compliance. Traditionally, liquid supplements were differentiated by faster nutrient absorption and convenience; now, AI is amplifying these advantages through data-driven innovation and precision formulation.

In research and development, AI algorithms are accelerating the discovery of new bioactive ingredients and optimizing formulations for stability, bioavailability, and taste. Machine learning models can simulate ingredient interactions and predict shelf-life performance, allowing manufacturers to fine-tune liquid supplement blends (e.g., vitamins, probiotics, herbal extracts) more efficiently. This shortens time-to-market and reduces R&D costs, which is particularly valuable in a sector where formulation stability is a challenge due to the nature of liquid matrices.

AI is also driving personalization, one of the fastest-growing trends in the supplement industry. By integrating data from genetic tests, microbiome profiles, wearable devices, and diet-tracking apps, AI systems can recommend individualized supplement blends or dosing schedules. For liquid products, such as daily nutrient shots or custom-mixed elixirs, AI enables brands to tailor ingredients and concentrations to consumers’ unique metabolic and lifestyle needs. This shift toward “precision supplementation” blurs the line between nutraceuticals and functional beverages, enhancing perceived value and consumer loyalty.

New Trends in the Liquid Dietary Supplements Market

Increasing health awareness is one of the major factors in the growth of the market, leading to higher demand for liquid dietary supplements.

Rising awareness of gut health leading to higher demand for probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics is another major factor for the growth of the market.

[TITLE]The Invisible Economic Crisis:
[TEXT]
Unlike the 2008 crash, this crisis isn’t unfolding in a way that makes the nightly news or regularly features on the front page of The New York Times. Indeed, it has rarely gotten any sustained media attention at all. There’s no single domino to point to, no sudden breakdown that can be explained in a neat narrative. Corporations aren’t going under—they’re doing quite fine, in fact. This is a crisis, rather, that is made up of thousands of cuts, millions of small financial emergencies that have accumulated to become something structural: a system where debt is the default condition of American life.

The transformation didn’t happen overnight. In the last half-century, real wages have stagnated while the costs of housing, health care, and higher education have soared. Where steady, unionized jobs once offered a path to stability, today’s economy leans on low wages, gig work, and eroded benefits. Borrowing has become the safety net—one that comes with interest rates and late fees.

Credit card debt quietly crossed the $1 trillion mark in the second quarter of 2023, a milestone that was covered by dozens of outlets before all but disappearing from public notice. The average balance per cardholder with debt stood at $7,321 at the start of 2025, and the United States leads other developed nations in credit card debt burdens. In recent years, the Debt Collective, which describes itself as a union for debtors, has highlighted growing debt in new forms: abortion-related debt, driven by higher procedure costs and the added travel expenses faced by those who, post-Roe, no longer live near a provider; rising utility debt as electricity prices spike; and back-rent debt from pandemic-era eviction moratoriums, which left tenants owing thousands to corporate landlords.
