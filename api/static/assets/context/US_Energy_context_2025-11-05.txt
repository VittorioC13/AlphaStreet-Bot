[TITLE]SM Energy acquiring Civitas in $13 billion oil and gas merger of near equals in the Permian Basin:
[TEXT]
Oil and gas producers SM Energy and Civitas Resources will combine in a $12.8 billion merger of near equals that will expand SM as a major producer in the booming Permian Basin.

The two Denver-based energy players said Nov. 3 they are combining forces as the oil and gas industry continues to consolidate, and the most prized assets are the needed inventory and scale to continue drilling wells for decades to come. The merger is the biggest U.S. oil and gas acquisition since crude oil prices plunged in the beginning of April following the onset of tariffs and increased production from OPEC.

The deal also will create one of the biggest oil and gas companies led by a woman: The combined entity will be led by SM president and COO Beth McDonald, with SM CEO Herb Vogel set to retire in March.

Neal Dingmann, an energy analyst at William Blair, said in a note: “While we think the Permian position has the ability to drive synergies and that there should be material debt refinancing gains, a merger like this with a lack of overlap across the remaining assets signals a continued need in the E&P (exploration and production) space for inventory anywhere it can be obtained.”

SM Energy focuses primarily on West Texas’s Permian Basin, South Texas’s Eagle Ford Shale, and Utah’s emerging Uinta Basin. Civitas is concentrated in the Permian and Colorado’s DJ Basin.

SM Energy has maintained a steady growth mode of late after expanding into Utah by acquiring XCL Resources last year, while Civitas has struggled, cutting ties with CEO Chris Doyle in August.

While SM is acquiring Civitas, Civitas shareholders actually will own 52% of the combined company after the all-stock deal. At the close of business on Oct. 31, SM held a $2.4 billion market cap compared with Civitas’s $2.67 billion value. The deal holds a $12.8 billion enterprise value, including debt. However, SM board members will hold six board seats in the combined company while Civitas will have five seats. SM chairman Julio Quintana will continue as chair after the merger, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

“This merger combines two premier operators and establishes a company with transformative scale in the highest-return U.S. shale basins,” McDonald said in the announcement. “By combining two complementary portfolios, we expect to unlock significant free cash flow to strengthen our balance sheet, accelerate stockholder returns, and position us for sustainable growth through every cycle.”

Activist investor Kimmeridge was Civitas’s founding backer when it was created in 2021 through a series of mergers. Kimmeridge remains a major shareholder and has pushed for more industry consolidation in oil and gas.

“The step change in scale coupled with identified operational synergies should enhance long-term value to all shareholders for years to come,” said Kimmeridge cofounder and managing partner Ben Dell in a statement.

SM, founded more than 115 years ago as the St. Mary Parish Land Co. in southern Louisiana, also is the only oil company named after the mother of Jesus.

[TITLE]Chevron earnings beat Wall Street estimates as oil production hits record boosted by Hess acquisition:
[TEXT]
Signage outside the Chevron Corp. headquarters in Houston, Texas, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025.

Chevron on Friday reported third-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street estimates, as the company achieved record production due in part to its acquisition of Hess Corp.

The oil major's net income declined 21% to $3.54 billion, or $1.82 per share, compared with $4.49 billion, or $2.48 per share, in the same period last year. Its earnings decreased year over year due to falling oil prices and a $235 million loss on transaction costs associated with the Hess acquisition.

Excluding costs associated with Hess and foreign currency impacts, Chevron earned $1.85 per share, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.68 per share. It reported revenue of $49.73 billion in the quarter, down

"We're also proud of our 100 per cent zero-emission EV deliveries in key cities and are committed to expanding this across all future markets. With EV charging stations in our stores and energy-saving solutions for our customers, and now also an investment in a solar project, we're inspiring positive change and contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable future for India," Antoni added.

As a global business operating in 31 countries, Ingka Group is committed to the Paris Agreement and to contribute to limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. In November 2023, the company strengthened its climate targets in alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Corporate Net-Zero Standard.

The targets were approved by SBTi in April 2024 and include a commitment to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions from the value chain by at least 50 per cent by FY30 (compared to FY16 baseline) and reach net zero emissions by 2050, without relying on carbon offsets to meet these absolute reduction targets.

[TITLE]AltaGas to Retain MVP as Long-Term Investment; Announces $400 Million Bought Deal Financing:
[TEXT]
MVP Pipeline Set to Deliver Strong Growth Over Next Three Years

NOT FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE U.S. OR THROUGH U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES

BASE SHELF PROSPECTUS IS ACCESSIBLE, AND THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE WITHIN TWO BUSINESS DAYS, ON SEDAR+

CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

AltaGas Ltd. ("AltaGas" or the "Company") (TSX: ALA) today announced its decision to retain ownership in the Mountain Valley Pipeline (“MVP”) as a long-term investment. Concurrently, AltaGas has entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters, led by CIBC Capital Markets, TD Securities Inc., RBC Capital Markets and Scotiabank for a bought deal equity financing to issue $400 million of common equity. While not material on a consolidated level, these actions are expected to maximize value for AltaGas’ shareholders—driving modestly higher near- and medium-term normalized EPS accretion relative to a monetization of MVP. The equity issuance will be leverage neutral in the near-term, when compared to a monetization of MVP; and longer-term, post the two expansion projects coming online, will enhance AltaGas’ credit metrics and increase investment capacity to fund growth projects.

Bought Deal Financing

AltaGas has entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by CIBC Capital Markets, TD Securities Inc., RBC Capital Markets and Scotiabank (collectively, the "Underwriters") under which the Underwriters have agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 10,100,000 common shares of the Company ("Common Shares") for aggregate gross proceeds of $400 million at an offering price of $39.65 per Common Share (the "Offering").

AltaGas has granted the Underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase, on the same terms and exercisable not more than 30 days after the closing of the offering, up to an additional 1,515,000 common shares for additional gross proceeds of up to approximately $60 million. Closing of the offering is expected to occur on or
