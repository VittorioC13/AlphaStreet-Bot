[TITLE]The $50 billion burgeoning sector betting on your nostalgia for classic American brands:
[TEXT]
Also under the ABG umbrella are investments in the name, image, and likeness rights of various boldface names, including soccer superstar David Beckham and basketball great Shaquille O’Neal. ABG also owns the names and likenesses of long-deceased icons including Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, and Muhammad Ali.

The cherished American retail names now owned by these companies make a long list: WHP owns Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us, Anne Klein, Express, Bonobos, and Rag & Bone. Marquee owns the revamped Martha Stewart brand, BCBG, Laura Ashley, and Isotoner. ABG, the largest player in this space, owns a vast empire of more than 50 brands, including Eddie Bauer, Champion, and Reebok.

Dockers followed a well-trodden path, and one that many iconic brands have taken in recent years. Brand management companies including ABG, WHP Global, and Marquee Brands have assembled portfolios that include dozens of household-name brands. These companies have emerged as the new power brokers in fashion and retail, raking in some $50 billion in sales globally each year.

The Dockers pocket predicament—which some dismiss as an imagined problem—predates ABG’s ownership. But it shows the peril of a 1.5-inch difference—that razor’s edge between a loyal customer and one who abandons a product or company. Even the most beloved brands can become vulnerable following perceived changes or quality erosion that upset passionate consumers—and when heritage brands are purchased by holding companies like ABG, which seek to optimize and grow the brands globally, that passion can be a double-edged sword.

Levi Strauss is actually no longer the parent company of Dockers; in May it sold the label to brand ownership giant Authentic Brands Group (ABG) for an initial value of $311 million, with the potential to reach $391 million based on performance under Authentic’s ownership. (ABG declined to comment on the Dockers brand or its pocket measurements.)

By IwearPants’ measurement, the pockets on his new Dockers are 1.5 inches less deep than his old pair. And he made a plea: “If Dockers (or parent Levi Strauss) needs to raise the price by a couple of bucks per pair, so be it. Just give me back deep pants pockets on my Dockers.”

“My change and keys fall out sitting,” posted Robert C.

NEW DELHI : India’s ambitious plan to build large-scale manufacturing capacity for advanced chemistry cells (ACCs) used in industrial batteries under its flagship production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme is headed for a significant course correction.

According to two people aware of the matter, the Union heavy industries ministry is weighing extensions and easier localization norms for the beneficiaries of the ₹18,100-crore PLI-ACC scheme that was announced in 2021.

This comes in the backdrop of the scheme’s limited success. The plan was to have 50 gigawatt-hour (GWh) of output capacity ready by December 2024, but as of this June, just

In brief A Bonk ETP has begun trading on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange, issued by Bitcoin Capital.

The product lets retail and institutional investors access Solana-based meme coin BONK through standard brokerage platforms.

BONK is currently the seventh-largest meme coin by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.

Solana-based meme coin Bonk (BONK) has begun trading on Switzerland's third-largest stock exchange, through a newly launched exchange traded product, adding another regulated crypto offering to Europe's expanding digital asset market.

Swiss-based crypto ETP issuer Bitcoin Capital issued the BONK ETP on SIX Swiss Exchange, allowing investors to gain exposure to the token through traditional brokerage accounts, according to an announcement shared with Decrypt.

As a subsidiary of Swiss asset-management boutique FiCAS AG, Bitcoin Capital launched the world's first actively managed Bitcoin ETP in 2020.

Switzerland's regulatory framework and market infrastructure for admitting crypto ETPs made it the “preferred venue for the launching a BONK ETP,” Marcel Niederberger, Chief Executive Officer at Bitcoin Capital & FiCAS told Decrypt.

"Europe, and specifically the SIX Swiss Exchange offers a highly developed regulatory environment with consistent supervisory practices," he said.

“The product will reach both institutional and retail investors through established broker platforms,” Niederberger said, noting that regulated ETP access tends to boost investor confidence and liquidity, with most inflows across Bitcoin Capital’s existing products still coming from institutional desks.

He anticipates “continued expansion of regulated products referencing BONK” next year, as maturing European infrastructure and rising appetite for thematic digital assets open the door to “additional ETPs and structured notes.”

BONK sits near $0.0599, up 3.5% on the day, ranking as the seventh-largest meme coin by market value per CoinGecko data.

﻿

Dogecoin leads activity

The Bonk listing follows a surge of meme coin products entering regulated markets mainly in the United States, dominated by Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin by market cap.

In September, the Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF became the first U.S. fund to hold DOGE, while asset manager Grayscale launched its spot GDOG product last week, generating approximately $1.4 million in first-day trading volume.

REX Shares also filed for a BONK ETF in January, alongside other meme coin products.

Meanwhile, 21Shares unveiled a 2x leveraged Dogecoin ETF on the Nasdaq last week, while Bitwise's Dogecoin ETF, BWOW, received approval from NYSE Arca on Tuesday for listing and registration.

Strategic asset allocation

With the upcoming World Disability Day on 3 December, conversations tend to centre on accessibility, workplace inclusion and infrastructure gaps. But a critical piece of the puzzle often gets overlooked: financial security.For many people with disabilities, the stakes of financial planning are far higher than they are for most households. Medical inflation consistently outpaces headline inflation, assistive equipment is costly, and unforeseen emergencies can upend daily life with little warning.While the fundamental principles of investing don’t change, the underlying numbers do. The three accounts that follow, from a visually impaired mutual fund distributor, a financial planner living with muscular atrophy, and a banker overseeing digital accessibility projects, illustrate how, for many people with disabilities, financial planning is shaped by distinct day-to-day constraints.For Piyush Rakhecha, founder of Rakhecha Finserv, visually impaired since birth, planning is not a skill, it is survival. A mutual fund distributor and wealth manager, who manages over Rs.140 crore across investment products, Rakhecha applies the same meticulous discipline to his finances that he applies to travel, meetings, or daily routines. “If something isn’t planned, it becomes very difficult to manage,” he says.Growing up, he learned investing early when his father opened a demat account for him and asked him to research and buy stocks responsibly. The experience shaped how he thinks: goal-based, structured and long-term. Later at IIM Raipur, he realised many peers invested randomly without strategy, which pushed him to start advising them, and to eventually become a full-time distributor and adviser.Rakhecha says disability inevitably shapes financial behaviour. Unlike an ablebodied individual, his recurring needs, house help, specialised travel arrangements, a driver, and accessibility-friendly tools, increase monthly expenses significantly. “The strategy isn’t drastically different from others,” he explains, “but the amount I invest every month is higher because my cost of living and future expenses will be higher.”He does not pursue outsized risk to compensate. Instead, he invests early, stays consistent, and uses asset allocation like any other disciplined investor. But he urges differently-abled investors to start early and, if needed, take slightly more exposure to mid- and small-cap funds when the horizon is long and the ability to invest more is constrained. Long-term compounding, he believes, remains the most powerful leveller.If Rakhecha approaches planning with discipline, Prasad Shetty, Founder, S9 Fintech (known as MoneyAnna), a Mumbai-based financial planning and advisory firm, approaches it with cold arithmetic. Living with muscular atrophy, Shetty’s monthly expenses can be twice that of an average person. The list is long: a hoist to lift him from wheelchair to bed, specialised bedding, wheelchair batteries and joysticks, transportation modifications, daily and night-time helpers, each item carries a cost, and each item can fail without notice. “That’s why a disabled person needs not just a contingency fund, but a backup fund to that contingency fund,” he stresses. While conventional financial advice suggests three to six months of emergency reserves, Shetty insists on nine to 12 months, plus an additional depreciation fund set aside for equipment breakdowns.Shetty has been in the equity

A high-level expert committee set up by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has called for sweeping structural reforms to create a free, competitive natural gas market in India, arguing that market-driven pricing and open access are essential for the country's clean energy transition.In its report, Vision 2040 - Natural Gas Infrastructure in India, the panel led by former PNGRB chairperson D K Sarraf said a liberalised gas market would enhance transparency, spur investment, improve resource allocation and deepen liquidity.A competitive system, it said, would remove current market distortions and attract new players across exploration, pipelines, LNG terminals and city gas distribution.Natural gas, extracted from underground and offshore reservoirs, is used to generate power, produce fertiliser, turned into CNG to power vehicles, piped to household kitchens for cooking and serve as feedstock across several industries. Seen as a key transition fuel as India shifts from fossil fuels to renewables, its role in the energy mix is set to expand.The government aims to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030, up from the current 6.2 per cent.India's present pricing framework - an assortment of government-regulated gas, market-linked domestic production and LNG imports - creates inefficiencies, the committee noted. It flagged resale restrictions in regasified LNG (RLNG) contracts, lack of an Independent System Operator (ISO), limited open access to infrastructure, and the absence of contract-path transmission tariffs and location-based taxation as major hurdles.Although India is among the world's fastest-growing gas markets, it still lacks a liquid trading hub for price discovery. A robust market would bring the country closer to global hubs such as Henry Hub, NBP and TTF, enable flexible contracting and support better hedging mechanisms, the panel said.The panel suggested the creation of a neutral, not-for-profit ISO to manage pipeline capacity, system balancing, scheduling and settlements. The proposed ISO would ensure transparent, non-discriminatory access to the transmission network and curb monopolistic practices.It also proposed a unified online platform for real-time pipeline capacity booking under PNGRB oversight, along with a real-time bulletin board integrating SCADA data to publish capacity, flows, maintenance schedules and outages.To boost liquidity, the committee urged a ban on resale restrictions and destination clauses in RLNG contracts, allowing buyers to freely resell gas in response to market conditions - bringing India in line with mature markets in Europe and the US.For liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals, it recommended a transparent third-party access framework, including clear tariffs, rule-based operating procedures, 'use-it-or-lose-it' provisions and secondary capacity trading on authorised exchanges.The panel backed a shift from route-based to entry-exit gas transportation tariffs. This structure - common in advanced markets - would allow shippers to book entry and exit capacities independently, simplify flows across the grid and pave the way for a virtual national gas hub and an eventual Indian gas benchmark.To strengthen market liquidity, the report called for greater participation of large consumers such as fertiliser, power, CGD, refinery and petrochemical companies on gas exchanges. It also sought the removal of caps on high-pressure, high-temperature (HP-HT) gas trading, phased inclusion of administered price mechanism (APM) gas, and the launch of Gas Release Programmes mandating a portion of domestic or LNG supplies be sold through exchanges.The panel further recommended aligning gas and power markets by synchronising gas and power days and introducing a day-ahead gas market with four six-hour trading blocks to facilitate flexible bidding.Highlighting ongoing decarbonisation efforts, the committee proposed a Renewable Gas Certificate (RGC) mechanism for compressed biogas. A regulated, market-based trading system would allow obligated and voluntary entities to meet renewable gas blending targets through tradable certificates.

Global airlines scrambled to fix a software glitch on Airbus A320 jets on Saturday as a partial recall by the European planemaker halted hundreds of flights in Asia and Europe and threatened U.S. travel over the busiest weekend of the year.Airlines worked through the night after global regulators told them to remedy the problem before resuming flights.Airlines that said they had completed or nearly finished all their software updates on Saturday included American Airlines , United Airlines, Air India, Delta Air Lines , Hungary's Wizz Air, Mexico's Volaris , Air Arabia, Saudi Arabia's Flyadeal, and Taiwan's carriers. Many reported no impact on operations.The overnight effort by airlines appeared to help head off the worst-case scenario and capped the number of flight delays in Asia and Europe. In the United States, which will face high demand after the Thanksgiving holiday period, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that impacted U.S. carriers "have reported great progress, and are on track to meet the deadline of this Sunday at midnight to complete the work."He posted on X that travellers "SHOULD NOT expect any major disruptions," although one U.S. airline, JetBlue, later said it cancelled dozens of flights that had been scheduled for Sunday.Asia-based aviation analyst Brendan Sobie said the update was "not as chaotic as some people might think," although "it does create some short-term headaches for operations."Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised to airlines and passengers after the surprise recall of 6,000 planes, or more than half of the global A320-family fleet, which recently overtook the Boeing 737 as the industry's most-delivered model."I want to sincerely apologise to our airline customers and passengers who are impacted now," Faury posted on LinkedIn.Friday's alert followed an unintended loss of altitude on an October 30 JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, which injured 10 passengers, according to France's BEA accident agency, which is probing the incident.The alert landed at a time of day when many European airlines and Asian airlines are winding down their schedules, leaving time for repairs.

[TITLE]Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap:
[TEXT]
KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries.

Nepal’s economy is exhibiting a mix of short-term optimism and deep structural strain: the equity market rallied 4.52% on renewed political confidence, supported by surging hydropower profits and rising commodity prices such as gold and eggs, yet the financial system remains burdened by excess liquidity, low investment appetite, and risky practices like widespread loan write-offs that mask bad debts.

As the Nepal Rastra Bank prepares its quarterly monetary policy review, it faces pressure to address liquidity distortions, revive credit demand, and expand financial access amid fallout from recent protests and ongoing political uncertainty. Meanwhile, regulatory and governance challenges persist—from telecom procurement controversies and underutilized port assets to stalled infrastructure projects such as the Kankai Bridge—highlighting institutional inefficiencies that constrain economic resilience.

At the sectoral level, mixed dynamics emerge: insurance lapses are rising despite fewer policy surrenders, farmers and local producers—from sugarcane growers to chhurpi suppliers and traditional crop farmers—are pushing for better market conditions, and new projects like the Pokhara aviation fuel depot signal gradual infrastructure modernization.

Collectively, the developments underscore a fragile but active economy where market gains coexist with systemic vulnerabilities and governance gaps.

NEPSE climbs 4.52% as election optimism boosts investor sentiment

The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) rose by 115.74 points (4.52%) last week, fueled by stronger investor confidence driven by expectations that scheduled elections will proceed without delay. The benchmark index opened at 2,560.29 and closed at 2,676.03, posting gains throughout all five trading sessions. All 13 sectoral indices ended higher, with manufacturing and processing leading at +7.24%, followed by the banking sector at +5.24%. Life insurance companies saw the biggest point increase. Total turnover surged 59.22% to Rs 32.50 billion, while market capitalization expanded by Rs 195 billion to reach Rs 4.493 trillion. Although NRN Infrastructure recorded the highest turnover, its shares dropped 21.21%. Meanwhile, Sagar Distillery and Jhapa Energy each soared by 61.01%.

Nepal Rastra Bank readies first quarterly monetary policy review amid liquidity issues

The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) is preparing its first quarterly monetary policy review for the current fiscal year, scheduled for release by December 1. The banking sector remains strained by surplus liquidity, weakened investment sentiment, and the economic fallout of recent Gen-Z protests, which have hindered loan repayments and reduced interest income. The central bank is assessing potential adjustments to interest rates and the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), both key factors in shaping liquidity and credit flow. Governor Dr. Bishwanath Paudel is also considering simplified investment programs for businesses, support measures for blacklisted borrowers, and initiatives to expand financial access for marginalized groups. These proposals are expected to feature prominently in the upcoming review.

Excess liquidity continues in Nepal’s banking sector amid blacklisted firms and political uncertainty

Nepal’s banking institutions are still grappling with surplus liquidity, as more than 150,000 blacklisted enterprises remain inactive following recent Gen-Z demonstrations. Reduced trade and business activity have led to elevated idle funds across banks, insurance companies, citizen investment funds, and deposit and credit protection agencies. The Deposit and Credit Guarantee Fund aims to invest Rs 415 million, but institutional deposits are currently earning only up to 2.75% interest. With falling interest rates and lingering political instability, viable investment avenues remain scarce. To manage the liquidity glut, the central bank plans to withdraw Rs 3 billion for 42 days through routine absorption measures, with rates to be set through competitive bidding.

Nepal’s banks use loan write-offs to conceal bad assets, costing the state billions

Commercial banks in Nepal have increasingly relied on loan write-offs to sweep bad loans off their books, creating an appearance of stronger financial health while minimizing tax obligations. In FY 2080/81, 20 banks collectively wrote off Rs 18.5 billion, including major lenders such as NIMB, Nabil, and NIC Asia. Despite persistent non-performing loans, the practice inflates reported profits through “provision write-backs.” Though regulations require banks to continue recovery efforts, many reduce follow-up once loans are written off. This approach eases pressure on the Capital Adequacy Ratio, helps avoid dividend restrictions, and lowers tax liabilities—raising concerns

[TITLE]India's exports in sectors facing global regulations exposed to higher risk due to climate inaction: BCG:
[TEXT]
India's export-driven businesses in sectors such as aluminium, iron and steel that face international regulatory shocks are increasingly exposed to risk due to climate inaction threatening their profits, operations, and long-term viability, according to global consulting firm BCG.

India is among the top 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events, as the 'Climate Risk Index 2026' launched at COP30 reveals, and the cost of inaction for India is too big to ignore, BCG Managing Director and Senior Partner, Asia Pacific Leader, Climate & Sustainability, Sumit Gupta, told PTI in an emailed interview.

Citing data from RBI and WEF 2024, he said 4.5 per cent of India's GDP by 2030 is at massive risk of erosion due to climate-induced extreme events, and by the end of the century, climate-related challenges could cost India between 6.4 per cent and over 10 per cent of its national income.

"Businesses face the direct brunt of these risks," he said, adding that due to climate-induced extreme events, physical infrastructure assets are wiped off, labour hours are lost, and productivity impacted, while there can also be indefinite delay in project completion and declining investment efficiency in high climate risk regions.

[TITLE]Rare earth magnet sops to lift India’s EV, chip plans: Industry:
[TEXT]
The Union Cabinet’s approval of a Rs 7,280 crore scheme to promote manufacturing of sintered rare earth permanent magnets ( REPM ) will help address a crucial missing link in India’s electric vehicle (EV) and chip supply chains, electronics and semiconductor industry executives said.The programme aims to create 6,000 metric tonnes per annum of integrated REPM capacity through five globally bid projects, backed by sales-linked incentives and capital subsidy over a seven-year period.Under the scheme, India will, for the first time, support end-to-end REPM manufacturing, from rare earth oxides to metals, alloys and finished magnets, in order to cut import dependence and serve fast-growing demand from EVs, renewables, industrial electronics and defence.The government has earmarked Rs 6,450 crore for sales-linked incentives over five years and Rs 750 crore as capital support to set up the targeted 6,000 metric tonnes per annum capacity, with each of the five selected players expected to get up to 1,200 metric tonnes per annum.Officials expect India’s REPM consumption to roughly double between 2025 and 2030, driven primarily by EVs and clean energy, making domestic capacity critical to supply chain security and the country’s Net Zero 2070 roadmap.The scheme’s seven-year timeline includes a two-year gestation period for plants to come up, followed by five years of incentive disbursal linked to magnet sales.The REPM scheme complements ongoing semiconductor and electronics initiatives by addressing a core upstream vulnerability in India’s EV and chip ecosystem, said industry executives.Mayank Shrivastava, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru and cofounder of AGNIT Semiconductors that specialises in gallium nitride semiconductor technology, said the programme is “as critical as building fabs”. This is because advanced electronics depends on magnetic materials as much as on silicon, and the initiative shores up a key weak link in the country’s electronics supply chain.Rajoo Goel, secretary-general of the Electronic Industries Association of India , called the government scheme a first of its kind initiative focused on the core of the supply chain for electronics. Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnet available, making them critical for emerging technology applications like electric motors for vehicles, defence and aerospace, renewable energy, computer hard drives and smaller electronics such as smartphones, he said.These magnets are efficient, long-lasting, and have higher resistance to corrosion and high temperatures, he explained. With rapidly growing demand for electronic products and technology, magnets and inputs made of rare earth materials have become critical, he added.The electronics industry is becoming increasingly dependent on the same and the countries which control their supply chain and technology have a geopolitical advantage and can dictate terms to the rest of the world, Goel said. Vivek Tyagi , executive council member at the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association, said the scheme could quickly reduce import dependence for two- and three-wheeler manufacturers while also benefiting four-wheeler players over time.Several executives view the move as a logical follow-on to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology's India Semiconductor Mission, aligning magnet manufacturing incentives with policies to attract chip fabs and advanced packaging units.The policy push comes as Andhra Pradesh emerges as a hub for downstream electronics and semiconductor manufacturing linked to EVs and industrial applications.Advanced System in Package (ASIP) Technologies is setting up an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facility in the state in partnership with South Korea’s APACT, with an initial investment of Rs 468 crore.Chennai-based Syrma SGS, through its unit Syrma Strategic Electronics, is also building a Rs 765 crore multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) plant in Andhra Pradesh under the Centre’s electronic component manufacturing scheme, strengthening local PCB availability for automotive and industrial original equipment manufacturers.ASIP Technologies chief executive Venkata Simhadri said the rapid transition to EV two-wheelers and four-wheelers makes it “very important for India to create the local ecosystem and supply chain”, pointing to both semiconductors and REPMs as key components in the new mobility stack.He highlighted that the REPM scheme, along with ISM incentives for fabs and advanced packaging, addresses crucial elements of the EV supply chain, from permanent magnet motors on the mechanical side to compound semiconductor-based motor control and battery charging systems on the electronics side.While many electronics manufacturing services (EMS) players do not directly process rare earth materials, they expect second-order benefits from improved magnet availability.Syrma SGS managing director Jasbir Singh Gujral said REPMs are critical inputs for EV and semiconductor industries, and a domestic magnet ecosystem will indirectly help EMS companies by making the supply of magnet-based components more predictable and reducing the risk of supply chain disruptions.Syrma’s own operations rely on components made using REPMs, rather than raw magnets themselves, so greater upstream resilience should translate into smoother sourcing for finished parts, he said."It's a very well curated scheme that is coming at the apt time. It's going to take some time for these capacities to get created but the reactions I'm getting from my peers are quite positive," an EMS company executive said on the condition of anonymity."There is a belief that the investments are going to come in. And this is again de-risking from the borderland country which is absolutely prudent," he said.For fabless firms such as BigEndian Semiconductors, which designs custom system-on-chip (SoC) solutions from its Bengaluru base while partnering with a foundry in Taiwan, the scheme stresses India’s intent to build deeper hardware value chains.Cofounder and chief executive Sunil Kumar cautioned that gestation-heavy incentive schemes tend to favour already established large organisations. However, innovation often comes from smaller challengers, making it important for policy to be calibrated to company size, he argued.Academia and skill-development experts expect the REPM scheme to catalyse new electronics manufacturing clusters, particularly for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and startups in advanced materials and magnet-based components.T Senthil Siva Subramanian, who heads the Institute Industry Interface programme at Hindustan College of Science and Technology in Mathura, said the scheme can help create MSME-focused electronics clusters that bridge lab-to-market gaps, generate new job roles through skilling, and encourage startups in REPM and related applications.He added that such clusters can feed into broader initiatives like “Vocal for Local” and “One District One Product” by nurturing “swadeshi” proof-of-concepts, while also advancing UN Sustainable Development Goals related to industry, innovation, infrastructure and climate action.Experts argue that domestic REPM capacity carries strategic weight beyond EVs, given its applications in defence, medical devices, nuclear research reactors and precision agriculture equipment.Subramanian pointed out that magnets such as samarium-cobalt and neodymium-iron-boron are critical across defence security systems, electronic traction motors, therapeutic medical equipment, nuclear research reactors and electronic farm machinery, and that local design and production capabilities can enhance India’s strategic autonomy and global ranking in high-tech manufacturing.He also expects the scheme to spur intangible investments in design tools, miniaturised products, software and intellectual property around rare earth magnets, boosting India’s standing in global innovation indices and helping domestic products progress across technology, customer, manufacturing and investment readiness levels.For policymakers and industry, the REPM push is increasingly seen as a foundational layer that strengthens everything from chip packaging and compound semiconductors to EVs, robotics and flexible electronics.(With inputs from Dia Rekhi in Chennai)

[TITLE]The Rare Earth Metal Driving Tensions Between the US and China:
[TEXT]
The alarm hasn't yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have promised a truce over rare earth minerals, the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow.

Although a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the Chinese export restrictions introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains.

A Crucial Element in a Market Under Pressure

But other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down.

Yttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency. The same is true for industrial chip manufacturing, where yttrium-based coatings protect machinery from chemical wear and ensure precision in plasma etching. Its indispensable nature has made it a key element of modern technology and the military.

China's Role

The problem is that, as with several other resources, China controls almost the entire global yttrium supply chain. Not only does it produce most of it, but it also has the know-how and infrastructure to refine and separate it from other rare earth minerals, a complex and technologically advanced process. According to US data, the United States imports 100 percent of its yttrium needs, 93 percent of which comes directly from China. Such stark dependence creates enormous geopolitical vulnerability.

When Beijing decided to introduce export restrictions as a response to US tariffs, the entire international supply structure began to falter. Companies reported delays, difficulties in obtaining licenses, and uncertainty

Aerospace companies set to get more capital market support as reusable rockets make headway

Global Times

By Chu Daye Published: Nov 28, 2025 10:46 PM

Six Chinese commercial aerospace companies had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus from June 18 to November 27, the Securities Daily reported on Friday, amid faster growth in China's commercial aerospace sector and launches being scheduled for several reusable carrier rockets in the coming months.

Chinese industry insiders and financial experts said more commercial aerospace companies are set to receive further support from the capital market as China's commercial aerospace industry moves from the technological exploration phase to commercialization.

The Securities Daily reported on Friday that six commercial space companies, including Chinese private space firms LandSpace, Galactic Energy, CAS Space, Space Pioneer, Yee Space and Mino Space, have had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus.

The IPO progress has come amid China's increasing policy support for the sector. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced in June a new sci-tech growth tier on the country's Nasdaq-style Science and Technology Innovation Board, also known as the STAR Market.

The regulator also called for more support for companies in cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence and commercial aerospace, such as more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market, in light of industrial development and market demand.

Beijing-based LandSpace said in a statement sent to the Global Times that it is set to launch its ZQ-3 reusable rocket at the end of November. Industry analysts said this will be a key step in the mastering of heavy duty, low cost and reusable rockets by Chinese private space firms.

Space Pioneer, another Beijing-based aerospace company, is also preparing for a launch for its Tianlong-3 reusable rocket, according to the South China Morning Post. The rocket is expected to be used to build China's massive internet satellite constellations, the report said.

A Beijing-based venture capital investor surnamed Liu told the Global Times on Friday that there has been a marked rise in market attention toward the commercial aerospace sector, given the policy support and recent progress made in the industry. "The new policies are also a boon for earlier-stage investors looking for an exit strategy," Liu said.

Tian Lihui, professor of finance at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Friday that listing can not only address the financing challenges faced by enterprises and secure funding for continuous research and development input, but also guide capital toward companies with genuine technical strengths and commercial potential. It will also promote the healthy development of the industry, Tian noted.

The CSRC's call for more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market precisely addresses the chokepoint for commercial aerospace - high R&D investment and long profitability cycles - by opening up more capital market channels for the industry, Tian said.

Further policy support came on Tuesday, when China's space agency released an action plan to back commercial space firms and encourage them to pursue international cooperation over the next two years.

The document released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said the country's commercial space enterprises should "go global" and help developing countries to build satellite-application industries.

Among the supportive measures, the CNSA will establish a national commercial space development fund and local governments will be urged to establish technology-innovation centers focused on reusable rockets and smart satellites, and to build open platforms for advanced manufacturing, final assembly and testing.

The plan aims to achieve high-quality commercial space development by 2027. The recommendations for the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) list the aerospace sector among China's strategic emerging industries.
