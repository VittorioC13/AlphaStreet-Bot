[TITLE]Workday Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Pipedream:
[TEXT]
Acquisition will Strengthen Workday's Platform by Connecting its Trusted HR and Finance Data to More than 3,000 Business Applications, Helping Organizations Move From Insight to Action

BARCELONA, Spain, Nov. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Workday Rising EMEA – Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ: WDAY), the enterprise AI platform for managing people , money , and agents , today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pipedream, a leading integration platform for AI agents with more than 3,000 pre-built connectors to the most widely used business applications. Pipedream will give AI agents the ability to initiate workflows, pull data, and execute tasks wherever work happens—across Workday and critical third-party systems.

Trusted Data + Enterprise Connectivity: The Foundation for Actionable AI

For more than 20 years, Workday has been the trusted system of record for people and money, giving it a deep understanding of how organizations work—from team structures and approval chains to financial rules, spend policies, and security permissions that help govern a company's people and money data. This context is what sets Workday's approach to AI apart: agents built on Workday can assist the right person, at the right time, within the right security and compliance frameworks.

With Pipedream, that intelligence will extend to the thousands of applications where work happens every day, including Asana, Hubspot, Jira, Recurly, and Slack. Customers will be able to bring information and workflows from across their business directly into Workday—and take action in the external apps their teams rely on—giving AI agents the connectivity they need to move beyond insights and complete work.

For example, an agent could accelerate performance reviews using Workday's deep understanding of a company's organizational structure, pull project details from Jira or Asana, request peer feedback through Slack, and then update performance records directly in Workday. All of this happens securely and automatically, helping ensure reviews are timely, consistent, and grounded in real work.

"The ultimate promise of enterprise AI is not just insights, but action," said Gabe Monroy, senior vice president, Platform, Products and Technology, Workday. "With Pipedream, AI agents will securely connect to major enterprise systems, enabling them to retrieve data and execute tasks. Workday will be the connected system for customers to plan, orchestrate, and execute work— marking a significant advancement for actionable AI."

"We founded Pipedream to help people work faster and with far less complexity with AI, and we're proud of the more than 5,000 customers and tens of thousands of users of Pipedream," said Tod Sacerdoti, founder and CEO, Pipedream. "Joining Workday allows us to bring that simplicity to more than 11,000 organizations around the world, unlocking AI-powered workflows that make work dramatically easier."

An End-to-End Platform for Building AI Agents for Work

Workday is developing an end-to-end platform for building AI agents that deliver real business value—agents that can understand a company's full business context and take action across workflows to drive meaningful results. Recent acquisitions of Sana and Flowise , along with the planned acquisition of Pipedream, strengthen this vision by bringing together the intelligence, orchestration, and connectivity required to turn insight into action.

By unifying these capabilities within Workday's trusted environment, the company will enable customers to design custom agents, equip them with the context they need to make smart decisions, and connect them to the systems where work actually happens — so these agents can truly get work done.

Accelerating Innovation Through an Open Community

Pipedream's active builder community will accelerate the creation of new connectors, helping customers quickly extend what AI agents can do. Together with Flowise's open-source community, Pipedream will expand Workday's support for open development and fuel a steady pace of innovation across the Workday platform.

Details Regarding Proposed Acquisition of Pipedream

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of Workday's fiscal year 2026, ending January 31, 2026, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions. Orrick is serving as legal advisor to Workday. Gunderson is serving as a legal advisor to Pipedream and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is serving as its financial advisor.

[TITLE]NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for Third Quarter Fiscal 2026:
[TEXT]
Record revenue of $57.0 billion, up 22% from Q2 and up 62% from a year ago

Record Data Center revenue of $51.2 billion, up 25% from Q2 and up 66% from a year ago

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported record revenue for the third quarter ended October 26, 2025, of $57.0 billion, up 22% from the previous quarter and up 62% from a year ago.

For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 73.4% and 73.6%, respectively.

For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were both $1.30.

“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We’ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.”

During the first nine months of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA returned $37.0 billion to shareholders in the form of shares repurchased and cash dividends. As of the end of the third quarter, the company had $62.2 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization.

NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on December 26, 2025, to all shareholders of record on December 4, 2025.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2026 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2026.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

[TITLE]China, Netherlands move to resolve Nexperia chip row:
[TEXT]
The dispute erupted in September when the Dutch government effectively took control of Nexperia - Copyright POOL/AFP Sina Schuldt

Charlotte VAN OUWERKERK

The Netherlands said Wednesday it had suspended its proposed takeover of Chinese-owned chip maker Nexperia in a sign of “good will”, a move China welcomed as a positive “first step”.

The two sides are moving to resolve a dispute that erupted in September when the Dutch government effectively took control of Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but whose parent company is China’s Wingtech.

China responded by banning re-exports of the firm’s chips, triggering warnings from carmakers that their factories could grind to a halt without the components Nexperia supplies, which are critical to onboard electronics.

The Netherlands stepped back from its position after Beijing announced over the weekend it would exempt some chips from the export ban — reportedly part of a trade deal agreed by President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump.

Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans said Wednesday that “in light of recent developments” he considered it “the right moment to take a constructive step by suspending my order under the Goods Availability Law regarding Nexperia”.

It was the first time the Dutch had invoked the Goods Availability Law — a Cold War-era law designed to keep vital supplies flowing during wartime.

“China welcomes the Dutch side’s initiative to suspend the administrative order, considering it the first step in the right direction towards properly resolving the issue,” a commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement.

The takeover has been suspended rather than cancelled, and the minister can reinstate the measure later.

– National security –

The dispute between China and the Netherlands is part of a wider global battle for control of the supply of semiconductors, the tiny components used across many industries and electronic products.

Karremans said the Netherlands was “positive”

[TITLE]Dutch government is relinquishing control of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia:
[TEXT]
The Dutch government said it's relinquishing control of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia , easing a standoff between China and the Netherlands that threatened supplies of semiconductors vital for global auto manufacturing.Economics Affairs Minister Vincent Karremans said Wednesday that he was suspending an earlier order to take control of Nexperia under a rarely invoked law.The Dutch government cited national security concerns and "serious governance shortcomings" when it took effective control of Nexperia, which is headquartered in the city of Nijmegen but owned by China's Wingtech Technology . Officials said they were trying to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe's economic security.Nexperia chips are widely used by carmakers in North America, Japan and South Korea. Automakers warned in recent weeks that they were running low on the chips, and Honda was forced to shut down a factory in Mexico producing its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets.Karremans said he was suspending his order issued in late September as a "show of goodwill" in a decision that came after "constructive meetings" with Chinese authorities over the past few days."In light of recent developments, The Netherlands has considered it the right moment to take a constructive step by suspending my order under the Goods Availability Act," he said in a statement."We are positive

[TITLE]Don’t Let America Lose the AI Race the Way It Lost 5G:
[TEXT]
In the last decade, the United States learned a painful lesson. Despite inventing the underlying technologies, America lost the global equipment race for 5G. Huawei’s equipment, alongside equipment from Ericsson and Nokia, serves as the backbone of much of the world’s 5G telecommunications infrastructure. China’s dominance didn’t happen because its technology was inherently superior. It happened because America underestimated the strategic nature of the race. We cannot afford to repeat this mistake for 6G.

At the recent APEC Summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s proposed creating a World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization, a new governing body, based in Shanghai, to regulate AI development. Beijing’s proposal is an unmistakable bid to influence the global AI framework in line with its political and economic priorities. The United States cannot allow that to happen.

AI is not simply another technology. It is the foundation of a new computing platform as consequential as the internet or electricity. Nations are building what many are now calling “AI factories,” supercomputing data centers that convert raw data into digital intelligence. These factories are quickly becoming critical infrastructure, akin to power plants or telecom networks. The country whose technology stack is deployed across these factories will set the rules, shape the standards, and capture the value of the next industrial revolution.

When 5G standards were being set, the U.S. government and industry treated them as technical debates, not geopolitical ones. Policymakers assumed market forces alone would secure American leadership. Meanwhile, Huawei, heavily backed by Beijing, offered turnkey networks at subsidized prices.

Europe and much of the developing world adopted Huawei equipment not because it was better, but because it was affordable, available, and packaged as a complete system. The U.S. response, in the form of late restrictions and export controls, arrived only after Huawei had already entrenched itself globally. By then, America’s warnings about security risks sounded like sour grapes. Huawei now has a major role in shaping the world’s telecom standards, reaping enormous licensing revenues, and enjoys global influence over a technology critical to national security. As the world transitions to 6G, Huawei is aggressively pushing for a revolutionary, AI-native approach to 6G, while others, like Nokia and Ericsson, are taking a more evolutionary path.

As 6G infrastructure begins to develop, U.S. companies are showing they’ve learned from past mistakes. The recent NVIDIA–Nokia partnership to integrate AI computing with next-generation networks exemplifies how U.S. technology leaders can pair advanced chips with telecommunications infrastructure to compete more effectively against China’s state-subsidized model. This collaboration demonstrates how a U.S.-led 6G ecosystem can scale globally, keeping America and its allies at the forefront of AI innovation.

Already, countries from Saudi Arabia to Singapore are building sovereign AI clouds using American technology. But China is not standing still. Huawei has announced AI-powered supercomputers and is explicitly fusing AI with its telecom dominance. The parallel to the 5G era should alarm policymakers: if U.S. allies and emerging markets turn to Chinese AI systems because they are cheaper and bundled, America could lose the global platform battle once again.

Winning the AI race requires a clear and focused strategy. America must ensure that the U.S. technology stack is deployed globally. This is not simply a question of innovation but of strategic influence. To lead in AI, the United States must extend its technological footprint beyond domestic borders and strengthen the foundations of its AI ecosystem at home.

In order to do so, Washington must support U.S. AI exports. Rather than restricting diffusion, policymakers should encourage allies and partners to adopt American AI infrastructure. Doing so will both expand the market for American companies and align global AI development with democratic values and governance norms. Many countries are seeking to develop AI systems trained on their own data and languages, reflecting their national priorities. The United States should make it easy for them to build these sovereign AI clouds using American technology as the foundation.

It would be a mistake to restrict American firms’ ability to export to fast-growing markets. As NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has warned, overbroad export controls have already cost U.S. companies share in China, without slowing Chinese progress. Limiting American AI diffusion risks repeating the 5G playbook, where allies turned to Huawei not out of preference, but because it was the only option on the table.

America must also continue to invest in scale at home. Sustaining AI leadership depends on maintaining the world’s largest and most advanced AI factories. To continue innovating, government investment and policy support are essential, particularly in areas like energy infrastructure, environmental permitting, and supply chain resilience for advanced components.

History will not be kind if America invents AI only to let others control its deployment. Policymakers must act now to ensure the American technology stack becomes the world’s default. If we fail, the world’s AI factories, the power plants of intelligence, will run on Chinese technology. The U.S. will once again be resigned to warning about security risks, while our competitors set the standards and reap the rewards. This is a race America cannot afford to lose again.

[TITLE]Here’s the Trump executive order that would ban state AI laws:
[TEXT]
is a Senior Reporter for The Verge and author of Regulator , covering the second Trump administration, political influencers, tech lobbying and Big Tech vs. Big Government.

President Donald Trump is considering signing an executive order as soon as Friday that would give the federal government unilateral power over regulating artificial intelligence, including the creation of an “AI Litigation Task Force” overseen by the attorney general, “whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws.”

According to a draft of the order obtained by The Verge, the Task Force would be able to sue states whose laws are deemed to obstruct the growth of the AI industry, citing California’s recent laws on AI safety and “catastrophic risk” and a Colorado law that prevents “algorithmic discrimination.” The task force will occasionally consult with a group of White House special advisers, including David Sacks, billionaire venture capitalist and the special adviser for AI and crypto.

In recent days, Trump has repeatedly posted his desire to have a state AI law moratorium, and reiterated it on Wednesday during his appearance at the US-Saudi Investment Forum, couching it as a way to fight “woke” ideology. “You can’t go through 50 states. You have to get one approval. Fifty is a disaster. Because you’ll have one woke state and you’ll have to do all woke. You’ll be back in the woke business. We don’t have woke anymore in this country. It’s virtually illegal. You’ll have a couple of wokesters.”

As part of the AI Action Plan released earlier this year, Trump had directed several federal agencies, including the FCC, to explore ways that they could circumvent “onerous” state and local regulations in order to promote the industry’s growth and innovation. The full executive order lays out a 90-day roadmap for several key agencies to implement that plan along with the Department of Justice: the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce, and the Federal Communications Commission.

Within 90 days of the order being signed, the secretary of commerce will be directed to publish a report identifying which states are in violation of Trump’s AI policy directives, as well as research which states may become ineligible for the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program, which funds rural broadband access for several states. The FTC, meanwhile, will be directed to issue a statement on whether states that require AI companies to change their algorithms would be in violation of laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive practices.

During an appearance at Politico’s AI & Tech Summit in September, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr floated one potential interpretation of the Communications Act that would allow them to override state law. “Effectively, if a state or local law is effectively prohibiting the deployment of this ‘modern infrastructure,’ then the FCC has authorities to step in there,” he told Politico’s Alex Burns.

Carr also brought up the possibility that the FCC’s regulatory powers could override a potential new law in California that would have required AI companies to disclose their safety testing models, saying that it would fulfill Trump’s goal of blocking “woke AI” that contained ideological biases.

He cited the European Union’s Digital Services Act and raised his concern “their AI models are not going to be truth-seeking AI models, but they’re going to be woke AI models, going to be AI models that are promoting DEI. And so again, President Trump has, as part of his action plan, steps to make sure that we don’t have that type of woke DEI embedded AI models developing here. When it comes to California, again, not familiar exactly with all the intricacy of that, but to the extent that they’re moving in that direction and away from truth seeking, it could be a problem.”

The notion that the FCC should have veto power over state AI laws — as well as other parts of Trump’s order — could easily be challenged in court. But moves like the litigation task force could still throw up roadblocks to states regulating AI.

Punchbowl News reported on Wednesday that the executive order is the White House’s backup plan should Congress fail to pass a state AI law moratorium, this time via the upcoming reauthorization of the National Defense Authorization Act — a bill that absolutely must pass in order for the government to fund its national security apparatus.

Earlier this year, Congress attempted to slip a moratorium into a draft of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” that laid out the spending for his second-term agenda, but it failed after a bipartisan group of senators voiced opposition to the act. Earlier this week, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told Punchbowl News that Congress was considering a second run at a moratorium by attaching it to the NDAA.

But just like the Big Beautiful Bill fight, a moratorium buried inside the NDAA’s passage might run into opposition particularly if the punishment is the same: the withholding of rural broadband funding. “The real question is, how big of a grant does it take to put pressure on state lawmakers to change their AI regulations?” Adam Thierer, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute who had initiated the concept of an AI moratorium, told The Verge. “This came up in the previous moratorium fight and some people worried that California would just ignore BEAD-related budget threats, for example. It might take multiple budget revocations or limitations to really put pressure on a state as big as California.”

Correction, November 20: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the European Union’s internet regulatory laws. It is the Digital Services Act, not the Digital Safety Act. It also misstated the title of Brendan Carr. He is the chairman, not the commissioner, of the Federal Communications Commission.

[TITLE]Elon Musk, Nvidia unveil deal with Saudi state-backed firm to build massive AI data center:
[TEXT]
Elon Musk’s xAI and Jensen Huang-led Nvidia announced Wednesday they are partnering with Saudi Arabia’s state-backed artificial intelligence firm to build a massive AI data center in the Persian Gulf kingdom.

The center is expected to consume as much as 500 megawatts of electricity – making it xAI’s largest site outside the US, according to reports.

As part of the deal, Musk’s xAI chatbot, Grok, will be deployed throughout Saudi Arabia, according to an xAI
