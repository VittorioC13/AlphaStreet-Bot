[TEXT]
In an interview Friday with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Apple CEO Tim Cook discussed the Phone maker's plans to follow through with its enormous investment in domestic manufacturing, emphasizing semiconductor production in the U.S.

"You can add a lot by making it global and then stitching together the end-to-end supply chain in semiconductors," Cook said. "I can't stress how important this is and how much that will add to what we're doing."

In total, Apple has said it will spend $600 billion on manufacturing in the U.S. over the next four years, including a $2.5 billion expansion of its partnership with Corning , which makes glass for iPhones and Apple Watches at its factory in Kentucky. Apple also said it would work with a number of different companies to grow domestic semiconductor production, including Taiwan Semiconductor , Texas Instruments and Applied Materials .

According to Cook, Apple already does "business with 9,000 different partners across the U.S." and "is in all 50 states with these suppliers," adding that this work has created 450,000 jobs. Cook said the tech giant is "very proud to be expanding that further this year to the $600 billion level."

Apple is taking steps to train more manufacturing workers, Cook said, mentioning that the company opened its own "Manufacturing Academy" in Detroit last month. According to a

[TITLE]Rithm Capital bets on office space recovery with $1.6 billion Paramount Group deal:
[TEXT]
By Abhinav Parmar

(Reuters) - Global asset manager Rithm Capital on Wednesday said it had agreed to acquire office portfolio owner Paramount Group for $1.6 billion in cash, betting on a rebound in office real estate.

The deal comes as investors gauge whether the U.S. office market, hit hard by rising interest rates, remote work and declining property values, may be reaching a bottom.

The offer values New York City-based Paramount Group at $6.60 per share, repenting a 10.7% discount to the stock's last closing price.

Shares of Paramount fell 11.6% in morning trade, while Rithm rose 3.4%.

"With office and commercial real estate fundamentals improving, impending rate cuts and an increase in the return to office narrative, we view this transaction as well-timed with an attractive asset profile," said Jason Weaver, analyst at JonesTrading.

Rithm said it plans to fund the deal with a mix of cash, existing balance sheet liquidity and possible contributions from co-investors.

"(The deal) will serve as a springboard to build out our commercial real estate and asset management platform and expands our owner-operator model," Rithm CEO Michael Nierenberg said in a statement.

Paramount Group owns, operates and redevelops office properties in central business district submarkets of New York City and San Francisco. Its portfolio includes 13 owned and four managed office properties.

The REIT's portfolio spans more than 13.1 million square feet, with 85.4% leased as of June 30, the company said.

"The Paramount portfolio is situated in cities where we have a strong conviction in the recovery of office market fundamentals, including improving rent rolls, a more favorable interest rate environment, and increasing demand," Rithm's Nierenberg added.

The deal, which still needs to be approved by Paramount shareholders, is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter.

[TITLE]Construction Spending Strategic Business Report 2025: Market to Reach $5 Trillion by 2030 - Growth in Public-Private Partnerships Spurs Investment in Large-Scale Projects:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Construction Spending - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Construction Spending was estimated at US$4.0 Trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$5.0 Trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.5% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Construction spending refers to the total expenditure on construction projects over a specific period. It encompasses a broad range of activities, from residential and commercial building to infrastructure development such as roads, bridges, and utilities. This measure is an important economic indicator, reflecting both public and private sector investment in building and infrastructure works. The figures are closely monitored by economists, investors, and policymakers because they provide insights into the health of the construction industry, which is a significant component of gross domestic product (GDP) and directly correlates with the overall economic health of a country.

In recent years, the landscape of construction spending has been shaped by a variety of trends and shifts in both residential and commercial sectors. Residential construction has seen a notable upswing driven by low interest rates, increasing demand for housing, and an evolving preference for suburban and rural homes - a trend accelerated by the global shift towards remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the commercial front, there has been a significant transformation with increased investments in industrial facilities, especially those related to e-commerce and logistics. Conversely, the office and retail construction sectors have faced declines, as businesses reevaluate their space needs in response to increasing online shopping and ongoing adjustments to where and how people work.

The growth in the construction spending market is driven by several factors, including technological advancements in building materials and construction methods. The adoption of green building practices, aimed at reducing carbon footprints and enhancing energy efficiency, has spurred new projects that adhere to stricter environmental regulations. Furthermore, government fiscal policies, particularly public spending on infrastructure projects, significantly influence construction spending.

Economic recovery packages, often including substantial allocations for infrastructure, can lead to surges in sector activity. Consumer behavior, particularly the increased demand for customized and luxury residential properties, also plays a critical role in driving construction spending. These multifaceted growth drivers ensure that the construction industry remains robust and capable of adapting to evolving economic and environmental landscapes.

[TITLE]UAW workers reach tentative deal with GE Aerospace at Ohio, Kentucky plants:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) - Members of the United Auto Workers union at GE Aerospace's Evendale, Ohio, and Erlanger, Kentucky, facilities have reached a tentative agreement with the company, the union said on Friday.

Workers secured victories on all fronts - job security, health care costs, and time off, the UAW said in a statement on Saturday. It said GE will cover nearly all health care premium increases over the term of the contract and workers will receive additional vacation time.

The tentative agreement covers a five-year term and secures strong job security protections for both Erlanger and Evendale locations, including minimum headcount and new work, the statement said.

On Friday, the UAW said in an X post that members will vote on ratification on September 19. Until then, all picket lines will continue.

"We are pleased to have reached a tentative agreement with the UAW covering employees at our Evendale and Erlanger facilities and we look forward to continuing to work side-by-side to serve our customers," a GE Aerospace spokesperson said in response to a Reuters query.

In late August, over 600 workers from the union went on strike after failing to reach a new contract agreement with the company.

The strike marked the latest flashpoint in a broader wave of labor actions across the aerospace and aviation industries, where unions have sought to leverage demand for skilled workers into better contracts.

Pilots, flight attendants, machinists and engineers have all pushed for higher pay and tougher job protections in recent years.

GE's Evendale plant builds marine and industrial engines for the U.S. Navy, while the Erlanger facility supplies parts to some of the company's engine plants.
