[TITLE]Regional Investment Summit delivers almost £800m boost to West Midlands, creating hundreds of jobs:
[TEXT]
£635 million of private investment for West Midlands announced at Regional Investment Summit, with huge boost to sectors including AI, pharma, dairy and real estate.

New £125m skills and housing package from Combined Authority, to train 12,000 construction workers and to deliver 1,000 social homes.

Birmingham Sports Quarter investment to deliver transformational 14,000 new jobs and £700 million boost to the region’s economy, updated data shows.

Hundreds of jobs in the West Midlands are set to be created after almost £800m of investment was announced at today’s Regional Investment Summit, cementing the West Midlands as a powerhouse for investment and turbocharging growth into the region.

The huge announcement follows the Regional Investment Summit held in Birmingham today where over 350 business leaders, investors and local mayors met to announce £10 billion of new investment for key growth sectors around the UK, delivering on the Plan for Change to create new jobs and opportunities for people in every region.

Investments in the West Midlands include Hines and Woodbourne Group announcing a £400 million investment to support the £4 billion Birmingham Knowledge Quarter, a centrepiece of the West Midlands Investment Zone, driving innovation, regeneration, and economic growth in the region. Blackstone will invest £200m to ensure the NEC remains the UK’s leading live events business with world class venues across exhibitions, conventions and arenas.

Building on the UK-India free trade agreement, Indian parent company of Freshway Dairy will also invest £25 million in building a new processing facility in West Bromwich, creating at least 200 new jobs and allowing them to process 25% more milk.

In a boost to the Industrial Strategy, the Government is also announcing that Sterling Pharmaceuticals will receive a share of £30m of Life Sciences funding, which will help them build a 60,000 sq ft centre in Birmingham, creating 48 jobs and boosting UK production of medicines for the NHS and sales overseas. To boost the digital sector, Atos is announcing £10m for AI centres, cementing the Midlands role as a key hub and creating 50 jobs.

In further good news for the region, the West Midlands Combined Authority has confirmed a £75m skills package to train over 12,000 people in construction trades and technical roles over three years. Backed by WMCA and government funding, the initiative supports a regional construction boom driven by major housing, transport, retrofit, and regeneration projects.

£40 million will also be made available by the WMCA to accelerate delivery of 1,000 new social rent homes across the region. The funding unlocks properties ready or under construction, building on 750 affordable homes already secured.

Earlier success for the region this year includes Knighthead announcing plans to invest at least £3 billion in a new Sports Quarter in Birmingham, which will feature a new 62,000-capacity stadium, new sporting facilities as well as entertainment and residential spaces and create 14,000 jobs – up from initial projections of 10,000. New data shows the Quarter will transform the region’s economy, with a £700 million boost to growth. Birmingham Airpor t will invest £300 million over four years to upgrade baggage, immigration, retail, and airfield infrastructure, boosting growth.

This latest vote of confidence follows Britain becoming the most attractive place to invest in the world according to a survey from Deloitte.

Peter Kyle, Business and Trade Secretary said:

The West Midlands is a thriving business hub, and these funding announcements are a major vote of confidence in our economy and demonstrate how our modern Industrial Strategy is helping to secure the investment we need to deliver growth in the West Midlands. This huge boost to the region shows our Plan for Change is working in encouraging more companies to invest here, creating new jobs and exciting opportunities for local communities in the West Midlands.

Jason Stockwood, Minister for Investment said:

The West Midlands is a powerhouse for foreign direct investment, and today’s announcements at the Summit cements the region’s position as a top destination to do business. Our modern Industrial Strategy is giving investors the confidence they need to plan not just for the next year, but for the next 10 years and beyond - helping to create economic growth as part of our Plan for Change.

Richard Parker, Mayor of the West Midlands said:

The first-ever Regional Investment Summit in the West Midlands has been a huge success. It’s given us the platform to showcase our innovation, talent, and can-do approach - and it’s already paying off, with world-class businesses like Knighthead Capital, Freshways and Atos choosing to invest, drive growth and create jobs. The Government is backing us with new funding and new powers to go further and faster. I’m determined to make sure everyone shares in the opportunities this brings - building prosperity that reaches every community. The time to invest in the West Midlands is now.

Today’s announcements at the Regional Investment Summit builds on recent landmark trade deals struck with the US and India and the launch of the modern Industrial Strategy in the summer, helping to hardwire stability for investors looking to invest in the UK.

Securing investment is central to the government’s mission to deliver economic growth which will create jobs, improve living standards, and make communities and families across the country better off as part of our Plan for Change.

Bali Nijjar, Freshways Managing Director said:

Our £25m investment in West Bromwich will deliver 200 new jobs, from engineers to food safety technicians, and deliver one of the most efficient dairy processing plants in Europe, capable of processing 500 million litres of fresh British milk a year. The West Midlands is a key strategic location for Freshways, providing access to national transport networks and skilled job seekers. It’s also good news for our British dairy farmers and our customers as we’ll be able to process 25% more fresh milk from the new site, helping us keep up with growing demand. We’re working around the clock to get things ready and hope to have the site fully operational by the end of the year.

Michael Herron, Head of Atos UK&I, said:

Atos is delighted to invest in the Midlands, establishing new technology centres that will help drive digital innovation and create opportunities for local talent. Our commitment reflects the region’s growing reputation as a national hub for AI and digital transformation, and we look forward to supporting businesses and communities as they embrace the benefits of new technology.

[TITLE]Trump Administration Cancels $700 Million in Biden-Era Energy Contracts for Red States:
[TEXT]
Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced that it would slash $7.5 billion worth of Joe Biden–era green energy projects in blue states. The cancellation of federal energy spending has now extended to Republican states, too.

On Monday, E&E News reported that the Energy Department had "canceled more than $700 million in battery and manufacturing awards" in the second week of October. This swath includes grants for "Ascend Elements, American Battery Technology Co., Anovion and ICL Specialty Products," and "glass manufacturer LuxWall," per E&E. All of these companies had plans to break ground on projects in states that voted for President Donald Trump in the last presidential election.

Ascend, the largest grant recipient of the group, specializes in creating cathodes—the positive electrode in lithium-ion batteries—out of used batteries. In 2022, the company was awarded over $316 million by the Energy Department to build a facility in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, to scale up Ascend's cathode production. Of this total, $206 million has already been spent, meaning that the Energy Department's announcement only affects a little over $110 million.

The other grantees were awarded money for similar projects. Anovion was given $117 million to build a facility in Alabama to produce synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries, and ICL was awarded $197 million to construct a facility in Missouri to make phosphate powder for these batteries.

American Battery Technologies, meanwhile, was awarded a $57.7 million federal grant in 2022 to develop a commercial-grade cathode material facility in Nevada. The company was then awarded $123 million in 2024 to build another facility, but this grant wasn't affected by the recent cancellation. LuxWall, the only company on the list that doesn't specialize in battery materials, lost federal funding for a vacuum-insulated window facility in Detroit, which was expected to improve energy efficiency in buildings.

The termination of these grants is a win for taxpayers. All of these projects "had missed milestones, and it was determined they did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars," an Energy Department spokesman told E&E. The announcement builds on other spending cuts at the agency, including $5 billion worth of green energy loan cancellations in May.

While these efforts might signal fiscal restraint, federal spending has increased under Trump, and the Energy Department has traded much of Biden's green energy spending for its own wasteful initiatives. Since Trump's return to office, the federal government has taken stakes in several mineral firms, approved millions of dollars' worth of coal bailouts, continued subsidizing nuclear power, and finalized a loan for a multistate transmission line project.

Still, the administration deserves credit for the little spending it has cut. With global demand for lithium-ion batteries to power energy storage and electric vehicles expected to grow through 2030, these projects never needed the backing of the federal government to survive, a fact that is supported by American Batteries' recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing. As E&E reports, the firm said that "regardless" of whether the funding rescission is reversed, "the Company intends to move forward with the project without impact to timeline or scope."

The $700 million cut could be the tip of the iceberg. The Energy Department has reportedly outlined $20 billion worth of energy projects (including the $700 million announced) that could get the ax, but it's unclear if it'll move forward with canceling this funding. Doing so might upset the politicians who are fighting the agency on these cuts, but it would be a welcome step in reversing the government's yearslong intervention in America's energy sector.

TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Kosovo war veterans and thousands of their supporters gathered Friday in the Albanian capital, Tirana, in a protest against a European Union-backed court prosecuting their former fighters who waged the 1998-1999 war for independence from Serbia, claiming the tribunal is biased and unjust.

Demonstrators from Kosovo and other European countries filled Tirana’s main Skanderbeg Square in support of arrested former leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA — a former Kosovo Albanian guerrilla group that led the fight for independence.

Many held national Albanian and KLA flags, while a group of former fighters and some youngsters were in KLA uniform. Some sang songs

[TITLE]National Fuel to Acquire CenterPoint’s Ohio Natural Gas Utility Business:
[TEXT]
WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y., Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National Fuel Gas Company ("National Fuel" or the "Company") (NYSE: NFG) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement with CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (“CERC”), a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) (“CenterPoint”) to acquire CenterPoint’s Ohio natural gas utility business (“CNP Ohio”).

National Fuel is acquiring the equity interests in CNP Ohio for total consideration of $2.62 billion on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to customary closing adjustments, representing an acquisition multiple of approximately 1.6x estimated 2026 rate base of $1.6 billion. Upon closing, National Fuel will also acquire a dedicated team of employees that operate approximately 5,900 miles of distribution and transmission pipeline and serve approximately 335,000 residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers that consume approximately 60 Bcf of natural gas per year. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of calendar 2026, pending completion of a notice filing and review with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, Hart-Scott-Rodino review, and other customary closing conditions.

This acquisition will add significant regulated scale for National Fuel, doubling the size of the Company’s gas utility rate base, while expanding its operations into the neighboring state of Ohio, a jurisdiction that is both highly supportive of natural gas and maintains a constructive regulatory framework. This significant increase in regulated cash flows, alongside National Fuel’s unique ability to fund future growth capital with free cash flow from its integrated upstream and gathering operations, will further support the Company’s investment grade balance sheet.

“Our acquisition of CNP Ohio aligns with National Fuel’s strategic objective to increase the scale of our regulated operations through the addition of high-quality assets in a favorable regulatory and political jurisdiction. Gaining a strong presence in a neighboring service territory, with a similar workforce culture, and operations that mirror our existing gas utilities in New York and Pennsylvania is an added benefit for our Company as well as our customers, employees, and shareholders,” said David P. Bauer, President and Chief Executive Officer of National Fuel.

“Acquiring a natural gas utility of this quality, with a long runway of capital investment pathways, is a great opportunity to reinvest free cash flow from our integrated upstream and gathering operations, further enhancing the long-term outlook for regulated growth,” Bauer continued. “In addition, our prudent approach to financing this acquisition, combined with our increased scale and larger proportion of regulated cash flows, will further strengthen our investment grade credit profile which, in the long-term, should support further avenues for growth on both the regulated and non-regulated sides of our business.”

Compelling Strategic and Financial Benefits

Increased Scale of Gas Utility Business Balances Portfolio: Pro forma for CNP Ohio, National Fuel’s gas utility business will now serve approximately 1.1 million customers across three contiguous cold-weather states – New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Given the relative size of this acquisition, National Fuel’s gas utility rate base is expected to double to approximately $3.2 billion. As a result, the Company’s business mix will significantly rebalance, with an increasing share of earnings and growth from its stable and predictable regulated businesses.

Leveraging a Talented Workforce: Through the integration of CNP Ohio’s talented workforce and strong operational performance into National Fuel’s organization, the Company expects to build on its track record of delivering safe, trusted, and resilient service.

Financing

In connection with the acquisition, National Fuel has obtained a fully committed bridge facility for the entire purchase price supported by The Toronto-Dominion Bank, New York Branch and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.

At closing, National Fuel will issue a promissory note in the amount of $1.2 billion to CERC. The remainder of the purchase price will be paid in cash. The promissory note, which was part of CenterPoint’s transaction structure and was incorporated into National Fuel’s business valuation, will have a maturity date of 364 days post-closing and will carry an interest rate of 6.5%.

National Fuel intends to execute permanent financing, inclusive of the amount to repay the $1.2 billion promissory note, using approximately $300 to $400 million of common equity, along with the issuance of long-term debt and expected future free cash flow from the Company’s integrated upstream and gathering businesses to fund the transaction. The Company expects that its ultimate financing mix will maintain a strong credit profile that supports its investment grade credit rating.

[TITLE]ZenaTech to Expand Drone as a Service (DaaS) for Public Works and Wildfire Management by Signing Offer to Acquire Southern California-Based Land Survey and Engineering Firm:
[TEXT]
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ZenaTech, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZENA) (FSE: 49Q) (BMV: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a business technology solution provider specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drones, Drone as a Service (DaaS), Enterprise SaaS, and Quantum Computing solutions, today announces it has signed an offer to acquire a Southern California land survey engineering firm with a considerable list of long-term government and commercial builder customers and significant expertise in public works projects. The acquisition would expand ZenaTech’s DaaS presence in Southern California, providing opportunities to modernize and improve a range of surveying, inspection, and monitoring applications for government and commercial customers using drones.

“Southern California is one of the largest and most dynamic public works and infrastructure-driven regions in the country — from transportation expansion and utility modernization to environmental land planning,” said Shaun Passley, Ph.D., ZenaTech CEO. “This acquisition would establish our Drone as a Service presence in a region where advanced surveying and rapid data delivery is essential. We see tremendous opportunity to expand the public works portfolio, as well as grow drone-based services such as wildfire detection, terrain monitoring, and environmental recovery mapping — all critical to building safer, more resilient communities across the West.”

The acquisition would help accelerate ZenaTech’s continued expansion into the US public works and infrastructure market — one of the largest consumers of engineering and surveying services — and provide a platform to integrate drone-based aerial data, analytics, and automation across the acquired firm’s existing government projects. The proposed acquisition also presents opportunities to leverage ZenaTech’s drone technologies for wildfire surveillance, post-disaster assessments, and regional planning initiatives — critical needs in one of the nation’s most wildfire-prone regions.

Currently, ZenaTech has completed 11 acquisitions toward its goal of acquiring and establishing 25 Drone as a Service locations by mid-2026. The company’s DaaS model provides businesses and government customers with a flexible and convenient on-demand pay-per-use or subscription access to drone services for surveying, inspections, precision farming, or power washing services, while benefiting from the automation of old tech or manual processes. The model eliminates the need to invest in capital costs, pilots, maintenance, and compliance to benefit from drone innovation. The company is acquiring profitable land survey engineering and other businesses ripe for drone innovation, to advance its national vision for a scalable, tech-enabled multiservice drone business anchored by existing customers and recurring revenue.

[TITLE]Spiro raises massive $100M to supercharge Africa’s battery-swapping electric motorcycle revolution:
[TEXT]
Spiro, the fast-growing electric mobility company based in Africa, has just secured a historic US $100 million funding round – marking the continent’s largest-ever investment in two-wheel electric transport. And if you haven’t been paying attention to the battery-swapping boom across Africa, now might be a good time to start.

We’ve seen battery-swapping take off around the world, with leaders like Gogoro in Asia, Swobbee in Europe, and Vammo in South America, all demonstrating the effectiveness of swappable battery networks for major two-wheeler markets. But don’t count Africa out, either. Spiro has spent the last few years building up its own homegrown battery swapping network for its locally-built electric motorcycles, and is now set to jump-start that impressive growth with a mega funding round.

The impressive fundraising round was led by The Fund for Export Development in Africa (FEDA), the impact investment arm of Afreximbank, which contributed US $75 million. The funding will allow Spiro to dramatically scale its fleet of electric motorcycles and expand its already impressive network of battery-swapping stations across the continent.

Swapping gas for watts

Spiro’s model is simple but powerful: affordable electric motorcycles backed by a vast battery-swapping network that eliminates the wait time and charging infrastructure hurdles that typically slow down EV adoption. With over 60,000 electric motorcycles already on the road, more than 1,200 battery swap stations, and 800 million kilometers of low-carbon travel already under its belt, Spiro is building what it claims is Africa’s largest clean two-wheeler ecosystem – and it’s growing fast.

Advertisement - scroll for more content

In fact, the company expects to deploy over 100,000 vehicles by the end of 2025, representing a 400% increase year over year. It’s a lofty goal, but Spiro’s rapid growth over the last few years demonstrates that it’s still attainable.

“Africa is at an inflection point in personal mobility. Riders are rapidly shifting from internal combustion motorcycles to Spiro’s more affordable and accessible battery-swapping ecosystem and motorcycles. For the first time, riders are embracing sustainable transportation because it performs better, costs less to operate, and offers greater profitability than traditional gas-powered vehicles,” said Kaushik Burman, Spiro’s CEO. “This is just the beginning – we’re just getting started.”

I had the chance to speak with Kaushik last month, where he explained to me how a big part of Spiro’s success is helping motorcycle taxi riders – the majority of its customers – achieve a higher standard of living by becoming more profitable with electric motorcycles over gasoline-powered motorcycles. The bikes aren’t just cheaper to purchase, but significantly cheaper to operate, meaning riders can as much as double their daily take-home pay. With that kind of economics, it makes sense why Spiro is seeing such high demand for its motorcycles and battery-swapping network.

More than motorcycles

While Spiro’s bikes are the vehicle – literally – for this transition, the real secret sauce is the swapping network. Riders don’t need to charge at home or wait around for a plug. They just pull into a station, swap out a depleted battery for a fresh one, and get back on the road. It’s a system that’s already proven effective in other regions around the world, and Spiro is now proving it can work at scale in Africa too.

The investment here is also about more than just clean transportation. According to Professor Benedict Oramah, president of Afreximbank, it’s part of a broader push to boost intra-African trade, create local manufacturing jobs, and reduce dependence on imported, second-hand gas-powered vehicles.

“We are delighted to partner with Spiro on this transformative initiative,” said Oramah. “Together, we are laying the groundwork for a new era of intra-African trade and industrialization by stimulating local vehicle manufacturing, strengthening regional integration, and enhancing trade flows.”

Made in Africa, for Africa

Founded in 2022, Spiro is leaning into local production as part of its growth strategy. The company has assembly facilities operating in Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda, with new pilot programs now underway in Tanzania and Cameroon.

This latest funding builds on more than $180 million already raised from backers like Equitane and Société Générale, further underscoring investors’ confidence in Spiro’s model.

“Spiro’s rapid expansion into new markets demonstrates the immense appetite for clean, affordable, and efficient transport across the continent,” said Gagan Gupta, Chairman of Equitane. “With FEDA’s support, Spiro is exceptionally well positioned to scale even faster.”

Electrek’s Take

While most electric motorcycle battery swapping headlines are dominated by Europe, the US, or China, this is a powerful reminder that Africa is carving out its own lane – and it’s doing it with a smarter, scalable approach that solves local problems in local ways. Battery swapping may not be the answer everywhere, but it’s proving to be a perfect solution in dense urban areas where fuel is expensive and charging access is limited.

And if Spiro hits that 100,000-vehicle goal next year? Well, don’t be surprised if Africa ends up leading the world in practical, everyday e-mobility adoption. After all, doesn’t a 100 kg electric vehicle make a lot more sense for a quick taxi trip than a 2,500 kg one?

[TITLE]Maritime Silk Road lends fresh impetus to trade, global connectivity amid uncertainty:
[TEXT]
Beijing, China, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- From smart ports and intelligent manufacturing to the integration of shipping and trade services, these efforts demonstrate how technology and collaboration are redefining global supply chains - making them faster, greener and more resilient, said Andrzej Juchniewicz, chief of the China Representative Office of the Polish Investment and Trade Agency.

He emphasized the sustainable and market-oriented approach of China's maritime connectivity strategy within the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). He also told the Global Times that this platform is not a one-way export channel but aims to create an international cooperation network that benefits all participants.

"For Poland, a gateway to the European Union, China's initiative presents significant opportunities," Juchniewicz said, noting plans to leverage the Silk Road Maritime platform to strengthen connections between Poland's logistics hubs and jointly explore the Central and Eastern European market.

His vision was echoed at the 7th Silk Road Maritime International Cooperation Forum held on September 8-9 in Xiamen in East China's Fujian Province, where participants were focusing on strengthening win-win cooperation and fostering innovation among partners along the Maritime Silk Road, amid global trade challenges.

The forum drew more than 1,500 participants from more than 30 countries and regions, including government officials, international organization representatives, experts, and executives from ports, shipping lines, trade and logistics.

Under the theme "Seamless Port and Shipping, Boundless Silk Road Trade," the forum aimed to strengthen Maritime Silk Road transport links, boost exchanges within the port and shipping industries, and advance investment and trade liberalization and facilitation.

Expanding network

As the second "golden decade" of the BRI unfolds, the construction of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road is accelerating, with the participating countries seeing growing cooperation in shipping, economic development, technological innovation, and cultural exchanges.

During the forum, representatives from ports, shipping, logistics, trade, finance, and technology highlighted the importance of China's port development, which is bolstered by innovations in finance, technology, security, and the integration of shipping and trade. This development is seen as a vital contributor to maritime connectivity under the BRI framework, offering much-needed certainty to the global shipping industry amid ongoing uncertainties, the Global Times learned.

Maldivian Minister of Fisheries and Ocean Resources Ahmed Shiyam warned of the rising uncertainties posed by trade protectionism, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. He underscored the importance of collaboration with China to enhance connectivity and economic resilience, expressing hopes for further cooperation under the BRI framework.

Africa, a key BRI partner, recognizes the importance of smart port development for the smooth functioning of global supply chains. Njabulo Nzimande, director of the African Maritime Council, stressed the continent's commitment to building its maritime economy and modernizing its ports. He acknowledged that China's technology and expertise provide excellent opportunities for investment in port construction, maritime logistics, and shipbuilding technology.

The Silk Road Maritime, China's first shipping-centered international logistics platform under the BRI, now operates 148 named sea routes, connecting 150 sea ports across 48 countries and regions, with 367 members across industries including shipping, energy, manufacturing and Internet, event organizers said.

Since its launch seven years ago, the Silk Road Maritime has handled over 24 million TEUs on container services, operated more than 20,000 container sailings, moved 27 million tons of general cargo, and recorded trade worth over 26 billion yuan ($3.6 billion), according to the event organizers.

Calling for unity, collaboration

Since its inception in 2018, the Silk Road Maritime has promoted solidarity and development in global trade cooperation. At this year's forum, forging certainty amid volatility emerged as a central theme.

Over the past seven years, the Silk Road Maritime has become a key link in global shipping. Despite challenges, it is committed to driving trade recovery and building a community with a shared future for mankind, said Chen Zhiping, chairman of Fujian Provincial Port Group, the forum organizer. It also offers a web of routes linking the world's major economies and is actively building a multimodal logistics grid that seamlessly blends sea, rail, road and air transport, he noted.

He Jianzhong, president of the China Institute of Navigation, said in his speech that the international shipping industry is feeling the shockwaves of geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts: Growth in port-handled foreign-trade cargo is likely to slow, key sea routes face higher disruption risks, and the transport of strategic commodities is more vulnerable than ever. In particular, US tariff policies have intensified regulatory uncertainty for global businesses and undermined the feasibility of investing in international supply chains, posing severe risks and challenges to the port and shipping sector.

Amid global trade uncertainty, the forum has bolstered confidence in shipping and helped to solidify long-term connectivity and resilience, said Zhang Ruosi, counselor in the WTO's Trade in Services and Investment Division, in a keynote speech.

Samir Abdelhafidh, minister of Economy and Planning of the Republic of Tunisia, said in his speech that in today's uncertain global landscape, the Silk Road Maritime serves as a beacon of confidence and trust. The 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, he stressed, is an important driver of global economic growth, encouraging dialogue and connectivity, boosting trade in goods and services, and advancing inclusive and sustainable development.

Despite external challenges, China's maritime cooperation with BRI partner countries has continued to strengthen. Shipping collaboration among participating ports is expanding, and the efficiency of cargo transport efficiency has notably improved, Li Yubo, a maritime transport expert, told the Global Times during the forum.

In the first half of 2025, China's trade with BRI partner countries reached 11.29 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 4.7 percent, accounting for 51.8 percent of the country's total foreign trade volume, according to customs data.

[TITLE]Regional Investment Summit delivers almost £800m boost to West Midlands, creating hundreds of jobs:
[TEXT]
£635 million of private investment for West Midlands announced at Regional Investment Summit, with huge boost to sectors including AI, pharma, dairy and real estate.

New £125m skills and housing package from Combined Authority, to train 12,000 construction workers and to deliver 1,000 social homes.

Birmingham Sports Quarter investment to deliver transformational 14,000 new jobs and £700 million boost to the region’s economy, updated data shows.

Hundreds of jobs in the West Midlands are set to be created after almost £800m of investment was announced at today’s Regional Investment Summit, cementing the West Midlands as a powerhouse for investment and turbocharging growth into the region.

The huge announcement follows the Regional Investment Summit held in Birmingham today where over 350 business leaders, investors and local mayors met to announce £10 billion of new investment for key growth sectors around the UK, delivering on the Plan for Change to create new jobs and opportunities for people in every region.

Investments in the West Midlands include Hines and Woodbourne Group announcing a £400 million investment to support the £4 billion Birmingham Knowledge Quarter, a centrepiece of the West Midlands Investment Zone, driving innovation, regeneration, and economic growth in the region. Blackstone will invest £200m to ensure the NEC remains the UK’s leading live events business with world class venues across exhibitions, conventions and arenas.

Building on the UK-India free trade agreement, Indian parent company of Freshway Dairy will also invest £25 million in building a new processing facility in West Bromwich, creating at least 200 new jobs and allowing them to process 25% more milk.

In a boost to the Industrial Strategy, the Government is also announcing that Sterling Pharmaceuticals will receive a share of £30m of Life Sciences funding, which will help them build a 60,000 sq ft centre in Birmingham, creating 48 jobs and boosting UK production of medicines for the NHS and sales overseas. To boost the digital sector, Atos is announcing £10m for AI centres, cementing the Midlands role as a key hub and creating 50 jobs.

In further good news for the region, the West Midlands Combined Authority has confirmed a £75m skills package to train over 12,000 people in construction trades and technical roles over three years. Backed by WMCA and government funding, the initiative supports a regional construction boom driven by major housing, transport, retrofit, and regeneration projects.

£40 million will also be made available by the WMCA to accelerate delivery of 1,000 new social rent homes across the region. The funding unlocks properties ready or under construction, building on 750 affordable homes already secured.

Earlier success for the region this year includes Knighthead announcing plans to invest at least £3 billion in a new Sports Quarter in Birmingham, which will feature a new 62,000-capacity stadium, new sporting facilities as well as entertainment and residential spaces and create 14,000 jobs – up from initial projections of 10,000. New data shows the Quarter will transform the region’s economy, with a £700 million boost to growth. Birmingham Airpor t will invest £300 million over four years to upgrade baggage, immigration, retail, and airfield infrastructure, boosting growth.

This latest vote of confidence follows Britain becoming the most attractive place to invest in the world according to a survey from Deloitte.

Peter Kyle, Business and Trade Secretary said:

The West Midlands is a thriving business hub, and these funding announcements are a major vote of confidence in our economy and demonstrate how our modern Industrial Strategy is helping to secure the investment we need to deliver growth in the West Midlands. This huge boost to the region shows our Plan for Change is working in encouraging more companies to invest here, creating new jobs and exciting opportunities for local communities in the West Midlands.

Jason Stockwood, Minister for Investment said:

The West Midlands is a powerhouse for foreign direct investment, and today’s announcements at the Summit cements the region’s position as a top destination to do business. Our modern Industrial Strategy is giving investors the confidence they need to plan not just for the next year, but for the next 10 years and beyond - helping to create economic growth as part of our Plan for Change.

Richard Parker, Mayor of the West Midlands said:

The first-ever Regional Investment Summit in the West Midlands has been a huge success. It’s given us the platform to showcase our innovation, talent, and can-do approach - and it’s already paying off, with world-class businesses like Knighthead Capital, Freshways and Atos choosing to invest, drive growth and create jobs. The Government is backing us with new funding and new powers to go further and faster. I’m determined to make sure everyone shares in the opportunities this brings - building prosperity that reaches every community. The time to invest in the West Midlands is now.

Today’s announcements at the Regional Investment Summit builds on recent landmark trade deals struck with the US and India and the launch of the modern Industrial Strategy in the summer, helping to hardwire stability for investors looking to invest in the UK.

Securing investment is central to the government’s mission to deliver economic growth which will create jobs, improve living standards, and make communities and families across the country better off as part of our Plan for Change.

Bali Nijjar, Freshways Managing Director said:

Our £25m investment in West Bromwich will deliver 200 new jobs, from engineers to food safety technicians, and deliver one of the most efficient dairy processing plants in Europe, capable of processing 500 million litres of fresh British milk a year. The West Midlands is a key strategic location for Freshways, providing access to national transport networks and skilled job seekers. It’s also good news for our British dairy farmers and our customers as we’ll be able to process 25% more fresh milk from the new site, helping us keep up with growing demand. We’re working around the clock to get things ready and hope to have the site fully operational by the end of the year.

Michael Herron, Head of Atos UK&I, said:

Atos is delighted to invest in the Midlands, establishing new technology centres that will help drive digital innovation and create opportunities for local talent. Our commitment reflects the region’s growing reputation as a national hub for AI and digital transformation, and we look forward to supporting businesses and communities as they embrace the benefits of new technology.

[TITLE]European aerospace groups reach framework deal on satellite merger, sources say:
[TEXT]
ROME/PARIS :European aerospace groups Leonardo, Airbus and Thales have reached a framework deal on a proposed merger of their satellite businesses, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Leonardo is scheduled to hold an extraordinary board meeting on Tuesday to discuss details of the deal, which is subject to board and regulatory approvals, one of the sources said.

Leonardo, Thales and Airbus declined to comment.

PROPOSED VENTURE AIMS TO COMPETE WITH ELON MUSK

Europe's largest satellite makers have been in talks for more than a year to create a new satellite manufacturing company to compete on a larger scale with rivals led by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which owns the highly successful Starlink service.

Reuters reported last month that the three groups had redoubled efforts to combine their satellite businesses into a roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.66 billion) joint venture modelled on the pan-European MBDA missiles business.

Code-named "Project Bromo," talks had hit a roadblock over the summer when the parties could not agree on governance and valuation, insiders said.

One of the sources said the talks, which involve dividing politically sensitive technology and jobs between France and Italy, had not been helped by the government crisis in Paris.

Problems have also included disputes over the politically sensitive share of work, according to French daily La Tribune.

ANTI-TRUST REVIEW

The key remaining hurdle, analysts say, will be getting past a competition review by the European Commission.

Previous attempts to merge satellite activities in the past decade foundered on anti-trust concerns and national rivalries.

But the dramatic rise of Musk's Starlink network and a shift in the market towards cheaper satellites have increased pressure on Europe to combine assets or be pushed out of the market.

The deal could take up to two years to implement and the initial umbrella deal is the first step, sources familiar with the matter said. Last week, Thales denied a report that a sought-after provisional deal had been reached at that time.

Europe's top satellite makers have long competed to build complex spacecraft in geostationary orbit but have been hit by the arrival of cheap tiny satellites in low Earth orbit.

The deal will combine loss-making satellite activities of Airbus with those of Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio - two ventures currently controlled by France's Thales and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.

Paris-based consultancy Novaspace says more than 43,000 satellites will launch over the next decade, representing a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services.
