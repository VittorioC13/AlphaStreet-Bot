[TITLE]‘It felt so wrong’: Colin Angle on iRobot, the FTC, and the Amazon deal that never was:
[TEXT]
When iRobot filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last Sunday, it marked the end of an era for one of America’s most beloved robotics companies. The Roomba maker, which had sold over 50 million robots since its 2002 launch, had survived 35 years of near-death experiences and technical challenges only to be undone by what founder Colin Angle calls “avoidable” regulatory opposition.

The collapse followed Amazon’s January 2024 decision to scuttle its $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot after 18 months of investigation by the FTC and European regulators. In this candid conversation, Angle reflects on what he describes as a profoundly frustrating process, the chilling message it sends to entrepreneurs, and his determination to move forward with a new venture in consumer robotics.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

TC: You called the bankruptcy “avoidable” and a “tragedy for consumers.” Walk me through what you think regulators got wrong in blocking the Amazon acquisition.

CA: I think there’s a real lesson around the role of the FTC and the European Commission. The goal, of course, is to avoid the abuses that can happen in monopolies and with the goal of protecting consumer choice and protecting innovation.

What happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot’s trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier. In the EU, we had a 12% market share [but it was] declining where the number one competitor was only three years old in the market, which is nearly the definition of a vibrant and dynamic marketplace. And in the United States, iRobot’s market share was higher, but it was declining and there were multiple growing competitors bringing outside innovation into the marketplace.

This should have been a no-brainer. This should have been three, four weeks of investigation. What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked.

What was that 18-month process actually like? What were you being asked to do?

The amount of money and time spent was indescribable. I would not be surprised if over 100,000 documents were created and delivered. iRobot invested a significant part of our discretionary earnings against fulfilling the requirements that went along with doing the transaction. Amazon was forced to invest many, many, many times that. There was a whole team, both internal and external employees and lawyers and economists working to try to, in as many different ways as possible — because it seemed like our message was falling on deaf ears — demonstrate that this acquisition was not going to create a monopolistic situation.

There was daily activity for 18 months associated with this. Perhaps most telling, when I was testifying as part of being deposed, I had a chance to walk the halls of the FTC. The examiners on their office doors had printouts of deals blocked, like trophies.

Trophies?

To me, it felt so wrong as an entrepreneur who started this thing literally in my living room and lived six and a half years never having enough money in the bank to make payroll, finally making it through succeeding. Here’s an agency whose stated mission is protecting consumer interests and helping the United States economy, celebrating as victories every time they shut down M&A, which in a very real way is the primary driver of value creation for the innovation economy.

I went into this deposition looking for a friend. It’s like, “Here we are, we’re obviously not in a stronger place, and here’s a great opportunity for us. Are you excited for us?” Maybe this is just my naïve take coming out, but that’s not the reception I got. It was, “Why should we ever let them do this?” It’s like: because it’s good for the consumer — because it’s going to catalyze innovation.

How do you think what happened here changes the calculus for startup founders who see acquisition as their exit strategy? Do you think we’re in a world where American tech companies can’t scale through M&A?

Risk has a chilling effect. If you’re an entrepreneur, your only option is to hope that it doesn’t happen again. The reason you and I are talking is I hope by my words I can make it less likely that it will happen again.

I founded a new company and my outlook on exit strategy and even commercialization strategy is impacted by the experiences I had at iRobot. How can it not be? That precedent creates risk of it happening again, and only through positive experiences do we start to dial down the anxiety that the exits I’m depending on — or as a venture capitalist, the exits I’m investing in assuming will happen — will actually come through. That risk is factored into the willingness to invest, the valuation of deals, and the rate of new company formation.

It’s hard to say there’s X percent fewer entrepreneurial starts or exits as a result of the chilling message, but it certainly didn’t help. Entrepreneurs can use every leg up that we as a nation can provide. It is a rugged journey. When it actually works out, it should be a celebration. The FTC is there as a safeguard against very real examples of things gone too far. I’m a big believer in checks and balances. But when things get out of whack, the country suffers.

[TITLE]Maximizing fleet efficiency and ROI with telematics integration [update]:
[TEXT]
Photos: Daimler Truck North America

Even without clean fleet tax credits and cash-on-the-hood incentives, fleet managers are working hard to maximize their ROI on vehicle assets and reduce their total cost of ownership – and they’re increasingly turning to data‑driven telematics solutions to help.

Telematics use data gathered from sensors embedded in a vehicle to monitor its operations. When collected and interpreted correctly, that data can be used to improve fleet safety, boost operational efficiency, and enable predictive maintenance that reduces (if not eliminates) unexpected downtime. Those are real benefits, with some analysts showing up to 30% savings in repair costs even before you factor in the fuel savings from EVs that, according to MAN CEO Alexander Vlaskamp, will cover the added cost of a BEV in less than three years.

As you can imagine, that’s a big business – and the global market for vehicle telematic platforms is projected to reach an impressive $127 billion in the next decade, and the rush is on to get OEMs like Ford (through Ford Pro) and Volvo (who has a deal with Geotab) to integrate digital solutions into their vehicles.

We originally covered these topics back in February, ahead of the ACT Expo. You can read that original article, below, and let us know what you think of the OEMs’ telematics’

Last month, Geotab signed a deal with Volvo Group to integrate the manufacturer’s vehicle data API into Geotab’s telematics platform. It’s the latest in a recent onslaught of such deals between telematics providers and OEMs that begs the question: what’s in it for the OEMs?

Almost all modern cars and trucks are “connected” in some way. Ford, for example, began fitting the FordPass Connect modem on all its vehicles in the 2020 model year, and the vehicle (and driver) data gathered powers the Ford Pro fleet management platform and enables offerings like the company’s E-Switch Assist, which enables Ford fleet managers to identify which of its ICE-powered F-150 and Transit assets are ready to make the switch to EV.

“Smart tools informed by data like E-Switch Assist are opening up many new conversations with our commercial customers large and small

[TITLE]The Complete Guide to TikTok Affiliate Marketing in 2026:
[TEXT]
Most paid marketing strategies require businesses to pay upfront for an advertising plan they hope will generate a return. Even cost-per-click advertising isn’t a sure thing; you might end up paying handsomely for clicks that don’t ultimately result in sales.

Affiliate marketing is a rare exception. Because payouts are tied to sales, well-run affiliate programs rarely lose money, and programs that don’t generate any sales end up being free (or close to it).

Affiliate programs allow brands to access the relationship-building and niche targeting power of influencer marketing strategies with minimal financial risk. They also allow creators to monetize their followings and add a relatively passive revenue stream.

Here’s how TikTok affiliate marketing works and how both brands and creators can leverage this strategy.

What is affiliate marketing?

Affiliate marketing is a model of partnership between a brand and a creator with the potential to benefit both parties. An affiliate marketing program is an agreement in which a creator promotes a brand’s products or services to their own following via social media, blogging, email, etc. Each time someone completes a purchase through that creator’s promotional links, that brand pays the creator a predetermined commission.

[TITLE]Wall Street banked on a flurry of deals under Trump in 2025. It wasn't that simple:
[TEXT]

Deal value, however, was up, boosted by high-dollar-figure agreements: The 2025 deals tracked by Pitchbook totaled roughly $2.4 trillion in value, compared with roughly $1.83 trillion in 2024. The data represents both corporate M&A and private equity buyout activity and considers both announced and closed transactions. In particular, middle-market deal volume was low this year with those large M&A transactions padding the stats, according to a S&P Global analysis of deal-making as of November. "This has been a decade-high level of megadeals, double the number of deals from last year. When you look at the importance of scale, it's been an all-time record in terms of the premium that the market has given to scale," said Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan 's global head of advisory and M&A, on a recent JPMorgan podcast episode. Over the last 10 years, 2021 remains the biggest year on record for U.S. deal activity, a reflection of low interest rates at the time. By this point in the year in 2021, there were 19,666 deals recorded with a total valuation of roughly $5.55 trillion, according to Pitchbook. Executives, lawyers and bankers like Aiyengar note that the sluggishness in deal-making this year took place primarily in the first half of the year as Trump's rolling tariff announcements roiled the financial markets and industry leaders tried to make sense of the effects.

Uncertain times

Early in the year, consultants and bankers across sectors agreed that the Trump administration would make for smoother deal-making and a friendlier regulatory environment after a number of big consumer deals were squashed by President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission. Then came Trump's trade war and his so-called liberation day tariffs. Trump's April announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" on more than 180 countries left executives with an unclear path forward. "Macroeconomic uncertainty" became an often-used phrase in company updates and on investor calls as executives were hesitant to make plans or offer guidance without a clear understanding of how the future with tariffs would play out. "We knew there was going to be some disruption with tariffs, but probably not to the extent that sort of slowed things down," KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC of deal-making in that sector. "With all that uncertainty around where things were going to land, I think it just put a big pause on M&A in general." In addition to automakers, retail and consumer companies bore the brunt of the uncertainty as they navigated whether and how to pass on undetermined higher costs to already-burdened shoppers. Overall deal value in the consumer space was 17% lower during the first three quarters of 2025 than the same period a year prior, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group. Meanwhile transactions by deal value grew in the industrials, energy and health-care sectors, the study found. Through mid-December, there were 227 U.S. deals in the retail space, compared with 296 in the prior year period, according to Pitchbook. The combined valuation of deals, however, was more than $40 billion year to date, compared with roughly $28.4 billion at the same point in 2024, Pitchbook found. Add in the rise of artificial intelligence, which has commanded major spending by companies across the board, and still-high Federal Reserve interest rates that make borrowing more expensive, and the deal-making equation was even trickier for much of the year. "That has felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride," said Kevin Foley, JPMorgan's global head of capital markets, on its recent podcast. "We went through that six-week pause post-liberation day ... and then after that, the level of uncertainty, at least the perception of it, started to fade. "The sentiment became more positive, benefiting from the fact that you've got the secular tail winds of what's happening with AI investments, the anticipation of the Fed being more supportive, along with a pro-business fiscal policy out of this administration," Foley said. "All of that had a very positive impact on sentiment in both the equity and debt markets." Last week the Fed approved its third rate cut this year, but the central bank committee's vote signaled a tougher road ahead for more reductions. While Trump continues to pressure the Fed to bring rates down further, he's also exerting his influence in other arenas and keeping industries guessing.

Policy playbook

Ahead of Trump taking office for his second term, automotive industry insiders and onlookers believed the auto supplier industry was ripe for consolidation. The sector was coming off years of turmoil due to parts shortages and an industrywide move toward electrification. But the end of federal tax credit programs for all-electric vehicles caused many companies to reverse course on EVs and redesign their lineups yet again. Ford Motor on Monday said it would take a $19.5 billion write-down tied to changing plans on electric vehicles. That policy shift and need for automakers to adjust to tariffs and higher costs slowed transactions in the sector. There were more than 8,800 deals globally last year involving industrial manufacturing, which includes automotive, totaling $303.7 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG. The number of deals increased 3.1% from the prior year but notably fell during the fourth quarter of last year – a trend that continued into 2025. Through the third quarter of this year, deals in the automotive industry represented the largest decline by volume of KPMG's industrial manufacturing sectors, off 19.9% year over year compared with a 3.6% decline in the broader category, which also includes aerospace, transportation and logistics and other manufacturing sectors. LaRocca said he believes the broad pullback in EVs, as well as slowing industry sales and a need for diversification, will drive an uptick in deals in the coming year following this year's lull. "If volumes aren't growing, you can't sit still, you've got to think

Indonesia urged to join global chip supply chain to boost AI ambitions

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesia should position itself within the global semiconductor supply chain to strengthen its competitiveness in the artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, Deputy Minister for Communication and Digital Affairs Nezar Patria said on Thursday.Speaking at a discussion in Central Jakarta, Nezar said Indonesia’s vast mineral resources could become a strategic advantage as global competition intensifies in AI-related industries.“To strengthen our bargaining position amid competition in the artificial intelligence industry, Indonesia, with its mineral wealth, must be able to enter the global supply chain of the AI industry,” he said.Nezar noted that Indonesia has an estimated 340 million tons of silica sand reserves, a key raw material used to produce silicon wafers, which form the foundation of chips and semiconductors.“This is our main capital. Silica sand is the primary raw material for making silicon wafers, which are the basis of chips. Today, this has become a strategic industry being aggressively pursued by advanced economies,” he said.Despite this potential, Indonesia has yet to become part of the global semiconductor supply chain. Domestic semiconductor manufacturing facilities, Nezar added, still rely heavily on imported components.To change that, he stressed the importance of downstream processing, warning that Indonesia should no longer remain merely an exporter of raw materials.“At the moment, we can only export raw silica sand to China, European countries, and Japan, where it is processed. This has to stop. We must pursue downstream processing so we can truly enter the global supply chain,” he said.Nezar said the government is now working to identify opportunities and map the natural resources needed by the semiconductor industry as part of a broader strategy to build domestic capacity.In parallel, Indonesia is actively exploring cooperation with countries that play strategic roles in the global semiconductor industry.“We are opening doors for cooperation with strategic countries that we can partner with to build a semiconductor industry, especially to strengthen artificial intelligence infrastructure,” he said.Nezar expressed optimism that Indonesia could achieve sovereignty in its AI ecosystem if it effectively harnesses its resources and industrial opportunities.“There are many opportunities we have overlooked. Only now are we realizing that all this capital exists in Indonesia and can be developed to achieve sovereignty in our artificial intelligence ecosystem,” he said.

The workforce reached 1.37 million workers in FY24, up from 1.08 million in FY22, according to a joint report by Prosus and the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER).

That translates to a 12.3% CAGR, significantly ahead of India’s overall employment growth of 7.9% over the same period.

The approach is unmistakably long-term: absorb costs now, build scale, and chase profitability later.Tata Electronics has rapidly become one of the largest iPhone manufacturers in India, exporting most of its output to the US and Europe. Estimates from Counterpoint Research suggest that over 70% of iPhones sold in the US are now produced in India, though Foxconn remains the single largest producer.Beyond Apple, Tata is committing $14 billion in semiconductor manufacturing projects in Gujarat and Assam , and has signed an MoU with Intel to explore chip manufacturing, packaging and AI PC solutions in India, pushing decisively up the value chain.Anjali Sardana, founder, ProntoHome services startup Pronto is stepping up its fundraise as India’s 10-minute house-help race gathers pace.People familiar with the matter said Pronto is in late-stage talks to raise around $25 million at a valuation of close to $100 million.Pronto last raised $11 million in August, in a round co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital, valuing the company at roughly $45 million.The talks come amid intensifying competition in the fast-growing 10-minute house-help category, with Urban Company, Snabbit and Pronto racing to scale in urban markets.(From left) EtherealX cofounders Shubhayu Sardar, Manu Nair and Prashanth SharmaEtherealX, a spacetech startup that develops reusable launch vehicles for satellites, is in talks to raise approximately $20-25 million in a funding round led by TDK Ventures, the venture capital arm of Japanese electronics maker TDK Corporation, people aware of the matter told us.Early-stage investment firm Accel, Dutch investor Prosus, BlueHill Capital and BIG Global Investments are also participating, one of the persons said.

Chief executive Andy Jassy said Prasad is leaving by choice.The changes reflect a broader effort to unify Amazon’s work on Nova models, silicon programmes such as Graviton and Trainium, and early quantum initiatives under a single command structure.The reorganisation comes as Amazon looks to close ground on rivals including Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. It has already committed about $8 billion to Anthropic and is reportedly weighing a much larger investment of up to $10 billion in OpenAI.A spectacular rally in a little-known Indian stock is reigniting fears of an AI-fuelled bubble spilling into domestic markets.Shares of RRP Semiconductor have jumped more than 55,000% in 20 months through December 17, making it the world’s best performing stock among companies valued over $1 billion. The run has transformed the once-obscure firm into a social media favourite, with day traders piling in on hopes of an AI and chip boom.The story on paper looks far less compelling. Exchange filings show the company has no operating revenue, just two full-time employees, and has yet to start any semiconductor manufacturing. Its newfound AI-and-chips narrative largely dates back to a strategic pivot away from real estate in early 2024.India’s market regulator Sebi is examining the surge for possible irregularities. The stock, now valued at about Rs 14,000 crore, has been shifted to once-a-week trading and has slipped roughly 6% from its peak, a reminder of gravity eventually visiting even the hottest of AI trades.Food delivery is no longer just a convenience layer for urban India. It is fast emerging as a serious employment engine in the platform economy.The sector accounted for roughly 0.2% of India’s workforce in FY22 and generated Rs 1.2 lakh crore in gross output in FY24, expanding faster than the broader economy.Food delivery remains a Zomato-Swiggy duopoly, though Rapido is testing the waters through its food delivery app Ownly The report flags policy as the next inflection point. As participation scales, portable social security benefits could prove critical to improving worker security without diluting the flexibility that supports the sector’s growth.

[TITLE]These 3 Beaten-Down Software Stocks Could Be Setting Up for a Rebound, Says BTIG:
[TEXT]
OneStream, the Michigan-based enterprise software firm, with a focus on the financial services sector, is the first software stock we’ll look at here. The company bills itself as ‘the operating system for modern finance,’ and offers its customers a cloud-based AI platform that lets its users reconcile data and manage workarounds, freeing up time and energy for their more vital business functions.

Putting this view into concrete terms, Altmann has recommended three beaten-down software stocks as Buys for the coming months. They are headed for a rebound, he says; and we can take a look at the TipRanks data , and his comments, to decide if these software names are right for today’s market.

“While software stocks have been pressured, our analysis suggests the fundamentals tell a different story. Measuring the ‘true’ underlying & forward-looking growth across our coverage (TTM sub. Billings, ARR, etc.) shows relatively stable growth over the last ~2 years while FCF margins have continued to improve. And other metrics (i.e. NRR) are actually showing reacceleration across a number of names in our coverage… With valuations attractive and a number of companies already having blessed CY26E estimates, we believe software stocks can have a rebound year in CY26,” Altmann opined.

BTIG analyst Nick Altmann has been tracking this evolution closely – and in select corners of the software space, he sees reasons to be constructive.

For software companies, the question now is whether they can successfully pivot their products and business models toward an AI-first future. The sector has faced a similar crossroads before during the shift to cloud computing, and history shows that not everyone makes it through the transition.

But the gains have not been evenly spread, and not every tech company has been reaping the rewards. Post-COVID, the software sector, especially the SaaS segment, saw a slump, and hit bottom in late 2022 – just as AI was gearing up. Investors since then have focused on AI, with the obvious result: software hasn’t quite recovered, and the segment has underperformed in 2025.

Stay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis so your portfolio is always positioned for maximum potential

Since late 2022, the big story in tech has been artificial intelligence . Generative and agentic AI didn’t just capture headlines – they have been the main driver of market gains and the booster rocket for the tech sector more broadly.

Story Continues

OneStream boasts that its finance platform is unique in the industry. It features embedded AI, as an automation tool, and unifies financial and operational data. The system is adaptable, capable of evolving to meet the changing needs of each customer’s business. The company states that its platform brings quantifiable advantages, including a 54% time reduction in closing books, a 72% reduction in data management cycles, and a 75% improvement in reporting cycles.

Those capabilities – to adapt, and to bring measurable gains – are a major selling point for OneStream, and the company currently has over 1,700 customers on its books, served by over 1,600 employees. The company has operations in more than 45 countries – it has a presence in the Americas, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.

We should note here that OneStream’s stock has been falling this year. The shares are down approximately 36% for the year-to-date, even as revenues and earnings have been trending upwards.

A look at the last earnings report, which covered 3Q25, brings more detail to the earnings and revenues. The company reported revenue of $154.3 million, up 19% year-over-year and almost $6 million better than had been expected. The bottom line, the non-GAAP EPS, came to 8 cents, beating the forecast by 6 cents per share. And, also of interest, the company’s free cash flow jumped year-over-year, from $1.3 million to $4.8 million.

Watching OneStream from BTIG, Nick Altmann sees plenty of potential for growth here, writing of the company, “Despite shares underperforming YTD, OS is set to grow >20% in FY25E, and a large, under-digitized TAM (~$50B) provides OS with significant runway to drive continued growth durability over the MT. We believe investors remain concerned over potential disruption to application software from GenAI, though we see the Office of the CFO as more insulated vs. other areas of apps and see OS’ platform as well-positioned to drive further digitization in the office of the CFO given its data-centricity (increasingly important), extensible architecture, and broadening AI solution set.”

The analyst goes on to explain why this stock should make a good portfolio addition, adding to the above, “Moreover, we remain upbeat on OS’ opportunity to capture market share within the Commercial segment, and our checks suggest its new CPM Express product solves down-market pain-points, and we see an opportunity for greater Commercial bookings activity to help not only formulate a more durable growth profile but also provide better bookings uniformity as Enterprise transformation remains lumpy. Lastly, while we remain encouraged on OS’ opportunity to drive continued top-class growth, a rapidly improving FCF profile should provide valuation support. As such, we see a compelling risk vs. reward profile in both the near term and the medium term…”

These comments back up Altmann’s Buy rating on the shares, while his $25 price target implies a one-year gain of 37.5%. (To watch Altmann’s track record, click here)

OneStream’s shares are selling for $18.18, and the $28.27 average target price indicates a 55.5% gain for the coming year. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 14 reviews, including 13 Buys and 1 Hold. (See OS stock forecast)

GitLab (GTLB)

GitLab, the next software company we’re looking at here, has built a reputation in the fields of software development, security, and operations. The company first released its open-source DevSecOps platform in 2011, and since then it has built itself up on the freemium model. The open-source architecture of the software platform means that anyone can write improvements to the base code, whether as an offering to the company or just to tweak his own download – but more advanced upgrades and tools are available for paying subscription users.

The GitLab software platform is designed from the keel up to let users unify their DevSecOps tools. It’s an approach that inherently smooths out workflows; the addition of AI technology and tools brings added advantages. These include in-platform software assistants, automation tools, troubleshooting, and even code analysis. The company’s AI is offered through the free packages, but more advanced subscriptions include greater functionality.

Looking at GitLab by the numbers, it’s clear that the product is popular. GitLab has more than 50 million registered users, and more than 5,000 code contributors. There have been 170 consecutive monthly releases of platform and code updates. GitLab is trusted by some of the biggest names in business, including Nvidia, Goldman Sachs, and T-Mobile. We should note, however, that shares in GTLB are down by 32% this year.

On the financial side, GitLab reported $244.4 million in revenue for its last fiscal quarter, 3Q26. That figure was up 25% year-over-year and beat the forecast by just over $5 million. The company’s non-GAAP EPS, 25 cents, was 2 cents better than the prior year and beat expectations by a nickel per share. GitLab reported an adjusted free cash flow of $27.2 million for the quarter.

In his coverage of this stock, analyst Altmann points out several factors that should provide support going forward, writing, “GenAI is resulting in an explosion in software development, and we ultimately see GenAI as a net-positive for GTLB as developer tooling can gain add’l budget authority. And while GTLB has been behind its peers in terms of AI monetization, its cohesive approach remains encouraging, differentiated, and its new Duo Agent Platform offering is set to become generally available very shortly. 3Q26 results were mixed as SMB and Public Sector weighed on upside to estimates, though GTLB continues to positively surprise on the margin side of the equation (we est. 22% FCF margins in FY26E) and we see expanding margins providing a valuation backstop for shares.”

For Altmann, this all adds up to a Buy rating, and his $52 price target implies a one-year upside potential of 37%.

There are 25 recent analyst reviews on record for GTLB shares, and the 16 to 9 split, favoring Buy over Hold, gives them a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $38.07 trading price and $54.57 average target price together suggest a 12-month share appreciation of 43%. (See GTLB stock forecast)

monday.com (MNDY)

Last on our list here is monday.com. This company, founded in 2012, offers its customers a line of cloud-based work management software. This is a field that modern digital offices are finding increasingly popular – the software and platforms allow users to track workflows, organize projects and collaboration, handle CRM, marketing, sales ops, system optimizations – pretty much everything that an office needs in today’s environment. monday.com’s platforms are fully customizable and are cloud-based.

For the modern office, one of the better features monday.com offers is its use of AI. By incorporating AI into the platform, the company allows its users to smooth out the time-consuming aspects of workflow management. Tasks like data analysis, categorization, and sorting can be automated, as well as communications such as emails. In addition, the AI can automate schedules and translations. It’s a sound application that speeds up systems by making the easy-but-time-consuming tasks go faster.

monday.com boasts that its platform is highly popular with the ‘Fortune 500’ names and that it is trusted by some 60% of those companies. These include such big names as Coca-Cola, Carrefour, and Lionsgate. In all, more than a quarter-million enterprise customers – of all scales – are using monday.com. And more than 3,993 of those customers bring with them over $50,000 in annual recurring revenue.

monday.com shares have been falling this year, facing hits from factors as guides that did not measure up to expectations. For example, for the fourth quarter of this year, the company’s revenue outlook, set between $328 million and $330 million, came in lower than the consensus view of $333.79 million. Shares in this company now show a 38% year-to-date decline.

Nevertheless, the results have been strong. In the third quarter of this year, monday.com saw revenue of $316.9 million. This marked a 26% year-over-year increase and was $4.59 million better than had been anticipated. At the bottom line, the non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $1.16 beat the forecast by 28 cents per share. monday.com reports strong growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and, importantly, reports that 10% of the total ARR is now derived from new products.

The BTIG view of monday.com, laid out by Allan Verkhovski, indicates solid growth metrics ahead for this stock; the analyst says, “Shares are now trading at 4.6x EV/Sales and 16x EV/FCF on CY26E… We believe this presents a highly attractive entry point as concerns around weaker than expected financial results from MNDY shifting AI-impacted Google SEO spend are, in our opinion, overblown (drives just ~10% of NNARR). MNDY is showing it is not just a Work Management company as we estimate ARR from new products of ~ $133M (10% of total) is growing +84% y/y. Meanwhile, MNDY is accelerating its GTM strategy through multi-product growth (enterprise product bundles), moving upmarket (solution selling and outbound), and customer retention (adjustments to variable comp plans). This collectively drives management’s confidence (and ours) that MNDY can reach $1.8B of revenue in FY27 (2-year CAGR of 21%).”

Quantifying his stance, Verkhovski rates MNDY shares as a Buy, with a $210 price target that indicates room for an upside of 44% by the end of 2026. (To watch Verkhovski’s track record, click here)

The 20 analyst ratings on this stock break down to 18 Buys and 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. monday.com shares are selling for $145.52, and their $239.05 average price target implies a gain of 64% on the one-year horizon. (See MNDY stock forecast)

[TITLE]How India proposes to deal with legal challenges posed by AI to copyright law:
[TEXT]
Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday (December 16) asked in Lok Sabha a question that has been vexing lawyers, creators and technology companies across India: is the government reviewing the Copyright Act, 1957 to address the legal challenges arising from artificial intelligence (AI)?

In response, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Jitin Prasada confirmed that an eight-member committee, constituted by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), has finalised the first part of a working paper addressing the use of copyrighted content in AI training.

This development comes at a time when the intersection of generative AI (GenAI) and copyright law has sparked legal battles across the world, pitting the economic incentives of human creators against the innovation needs of AI developers.

Core conflict: input vs output

Generative AI models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, are “trained” on vast amounts of data scraped from the internet — books, news articles, images and music. Much of this data is protected by copyright.

The central legal question is whether using this data to train a machine constitutes copyright infringement or if it falls under exceptions like “fair dealing” in India or “fair use” in the US.

The fair dealing exception permits limited use of copyrighted material without the owner’s consent for specific purposes, such as research, criticism, review, reporting or teaching. The objective of this exception is to ensure a balance between protecting creators’ rights and promoting public access to information and ideas.

“There are only two issues when copyright is implicated with the AI business,” Prashant Reddy T, an intellectual property lawyer, told The Indian Express. “One is when companies make copies of copyrighted works to create a dataset and train the AI program. The second is when a GenAI prepares an answer for a reader that contains copyright-infringing material.”

Story continues below this ad

While the output stage — where an AI platform might spit out a replica of a copyrighted work — is easier to adjudicate as copyright infringement, the input stage is legally murkier. AI companies argue that reading data to learn patterns is akin to human learning; creators argue it is industrial scale-theft.

This friction has already reached Indian courts. Last year, the news agency ANI sued OpenAI in the Delhi High Court for using its content to train ChatGPT. (The Digital News Publishers Association, which The Indian Express is a part of, has filed an intervention application in the HC in order to be impleaded and heard in the matter). The matter is pending in court.

“The court’s interpretation of the terms ‘adaptation’ and ‘reproduction’ in the Copyright Act is key in this case,” says Shehnaz Ahmed, who leads research in applied law and technology at the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy. She notes that unlike the US, where “fair use” is broad, “the fair dealing framework under the Indian Copyright Act is purpose-specific and does not address the use of copyrighted works for commercial AI model training.”

That said, there is another school of thought according to which copyright law should not necessarily penalise the act of “learning”, whether by human or machine.

Story continues below this ad

Nikhil Narendran, a partner at Trilegal, argues that training AI is similar to human learning – even though the scale is different. “Mere learning should not impact anybody’s copyright and that should not be used to prevent a new mode of communication unless the output violates someone’s copyright,” he says.

Narendran suggests the focus should be on market harm caused by the output, rather than the input. “If at all there is a direct market dilution: that is when creators should get paid,” he says, citing examples where an AI tool might generate news summaries that stop users from visiting the original news website.

Government’s proposal: A ‘hybrid model’

To resolve this, the DPIIT Committee’s working paper, titled ‘One Nation One License One Payment’, proposes a departure from traditional copyright management.

Rejecting both a blanket exception for AI, which tech companies wanted, and a pure voluntary licensing model, as was demanded by content owners, the committee has recommended what it calls “hybrid model.”

Story continues below this ad

Under this proposed framework, copyright holders will not have the option to withhold their works from AI training, and instead, a mandatory blanket license will be imposed. In exchange, AI developers must pay a “statutory remuneration” — likely a percentage of their global revenue — to a centralised collecting society, the Copyright Royalties Collective for AI Training .

The report states: “The Committee recognized that access to large volumes of data… is crucial for AI development. Long negotiations and high transaction costs can hold back innovation.”

By removing the right to say “no”, the government aims to ensure AI developers have access to data while ensuring creators get paid.

While the model attempts to strike a middle ground, legal experts are skeptical
