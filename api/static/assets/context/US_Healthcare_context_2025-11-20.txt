[TITLE]Distalmotion Raises $150 Million to Accelerate US Expansion of the DEXTER® Robotic Surgery System and Names Chas McKhann as Executive Chairman:
[TEXT]
Lausanne, Switzerland, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Distalmotion, the global MedTech company empowering access to the benefits of robotic surgery in outpatient sites of care, today announced the successful closing of its Series G financing round. The $150M USD financing was led by Revival Healthcare Capital and included inside investor participation.

This new funding will be used primarily to accelerate US commercial adoption of DEXTER, its soft tissue robotic surgery system, as well as to support ongoing clinical and product development initiatives. A major focus of the US expansion continues to be the Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) market—one of the fastest-growing segments in surgical care, driven by the ongoing shift toward efficient, outpatient surgery.

“This funding marks another important milestone on our journey,” said Greg Roche, CEO of Distalmotion. “The continued commitment of our investors validates our vision to break down barriers to robotic access through simplified operations. As we enter our next phase of US market acceleration, ASCs represent a tremendous opportunity for DEXTER. The ongoing support from our investors reaffirms our roadmap, our mission, and the value DEXTER brings to minimally invasive surgery.”

In conjunction with the financing, Distalmotion has named Chas McKhann as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. With more than 25 years in the MedTech and life sciences industries, Mr. McKhann brings a wealth of experience in scaling medical device companies, commercial acceleration, and guiding organizations through strategic growth. Mr. McKhann previously served as CEO of Apollo Endosurgery and then Silk Road Medical, two publicly traded medical device companies, where his leadership drove significant sales growth and ultimately resulted in successful exits. His appointment underscores Distalmotion’s commitment to establish a DEXTER leadership position in ASCs.

“I am thrilled to join the Distalmotion team,” said Mr. McKhann. “Distalmotion has reimagined how robotic surgery can be adopted across care settings because DEXTER delivers all the benefits of robotic surgery – dexterity, precision, and ergonomics – while also offering flexibility, efficiency, and value. With the recent FDA clearance in gynecology and release of DEXTER product enhancements, the company is poised to accelerate adoption in the US and globally at this pivotal stage in its growth trajectory.”

DEXTER has been successfully integrated into clinical practice across Europe and the US, with almost 3,000 patients treated. With strong clinical traction and continued investment, Distalmotion is positioned to empower more surgeons across sites of care to deliver the benefits of robotic surgery to their patients.

[TITLE]Harrow Announces Closing of Acquisition of Melt Pharmaceuticals:
[TEXT]
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Harrow (Nasdaq: HROW), a leading provider of ophthalmic disease management solutions in North America, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Melt Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Melt), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company pioneering non-opioid, non-IV therapies for sedation for medical procedures in the hospital, outpatient, and in-office settings. Melt’s product candidates, MELT-210, MELT-300, and MELT-400, are based on the proprietary Zydis® ODT (oral dissolving tablet) drug delivery platform. The closing of the Melt acquisition marks a strategic expansion of Harrow’s portfolio and reinforces its commitment to delivering innovative therapies that improve patient outcomes.

With global patent coverage and potential applications in ophthalmology, gastroenterology, dental care, and a wide range of outpatient procedures where sedation or anxiety management is needed, from diagnostic imaging to endoscopy procedures to pre-anesthesia, Melt’s drug candidates, including MELT-300, position Harrow to enter the multi-billion-dollar annual U.S. and global procedural sedation and anxiety market.

MELT-300 represents a transformative opportunity, building on more than a decade of real-world experience with MKO Melt® — a compounded sublingual sedation product sold by Harrow’s ImprimisRx subsidiary and currently administered by over 800 U.S. ophthalmic institutions, primarily for cataract surgery. As a potential FDA-approved successor, MELT-300 is a patented, sublingually delivered formulation of a fixed dose of midazolam (3mg) and ketamine (50mg) designed to provide rapid, predictable sedation without the need for intravenous administration. The MELT-300 Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical programs previously demonstrated statistical superiority to midazolam alone. The innovative approach to sedation MELT-300 offers has the potential to transform patient experiences across a wide range of office-based and outpatient procedures, addressing the healthcare system’s growing demand to reduce exposure to opioids, including fentanyl.

“The development of MELT-300 marks a defining milestone for Harrow — our first product taken from ideation to the brink of commercialization. I still remember the first call we received

[TEXT]
Strategic transaction supports the advancement of Decoy’s rapid computational design and manufacturing of innovative peptide conjugate therapeutics through its IMP3ACT™ platform

Combined company has pro forma cash of $14 million following merger and closing of recent public offering

HOUSTON and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Salarius Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: SLRX) (“Salarius” or the “Company”) and Decoy Therapeutics (“Decoy”) announce the completion of their strategic merger with the combined company now focused on advancing Decoy’s pipeline of peptide conjugate therapeutics engineered through its IMP3ACT platform that reduces the complexity of drug development and manufacturing.

“I’d like to thank both the Salarius and Decoy teams for their hard work and dedication in completing this transaction, which supports the advancement of next-generation therapeutics through our proprietary IMP3ACT Platform,” said Frederick “Rick” Pierce, Chief Executive Officer of Salarius and former Chief Executive Officer of Decoy. “By combining artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and high-speed synthesis techniques, we rapidly design, engineer and manufacture peptide conjugate drug candidates that target serious unmet medical needs. Our technology and innovations in manufacturing allow for advancing new therapies from lab to clinic to commercialization with unprecedented speed. We anticipate multiple value-creating inflection points in the coming year, initially targeting unmet needs in respiratory infectious diseases and gastroenterology (GI) oncology indications.”

Prior to this merger, Decoy attracted financing from institutional investors as well as significant non-dilutive capital from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Seed Fund, the Google AI startup program and the NVIDIA Inception program, among other sources. Decoy also received QuickFire Challenge award funding provided by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) through BLUE KNIGHT™, a legacy collaboration between Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JLABS and BARDA within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.

During the next 12 months, Decoy expects to advance its lead asset, a pan-coronavirus antiviral, to the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to make progress on other programs including a novel broad-acting antiviral to treat flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and a peptide drug conjugate targeting GI cancers.

Then new company will be renamed Decoy Therapeutics. In addition to Decoy’s Co-founder Mr. Pierce serving as Chief Executive Officer, the new company is led by Decoy’s Co-founder Chief Scientific Officer Barbara Hibner, by Decoy’s Chief Business Officer Peter Marschel, by Decoy’s Chief Technology Officer Mike Lipp and by Decoy’s acting Chief Medical Officer and Scientific Advisory Board Chair Shahin Gharakhanian, M.D. Salarius’ current Chief Financial Officer and former acting Chief Executive Officer Mark Rosenblum will continue to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the combined company.

[TITLE]Eledon Reports Preliminary Data from First Six Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Treated with Tegoprubart as the Core Immunosuppressant Following Islet Transplantation in Investigator-Initiated Trial at U:
[TEXT]
IRVINE, Calif., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Eledon”) (NASDAQ: ELDN) today announced preliminary results from an investigator-initiated trial conducted at the University of Chicago Medicine’s Transplant Institute and presented at the Rachmiel Levine-Arthur Riggs Diabetes Research Symposium, held November 14-17, 2025 at City of Hope in Los Angeles, California.

The ongoing trial, which has been extended to include a total of 12 subjects, is evaluating tegoprubart, Eledon’s investigational anti-CD40 Ligand (anti-CD40L) antibody, as the core of a tacrolimus-free immunosuppression drug regimen for the prevention of islet transplant rejection in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The results, presented by Piotr Witkowski, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Pancreas and Islet Transplant Program at UChicago Medicine, provide updated preliminary data on the first six subjects in the trial, demonstrating the ability of tegoprubart to prevent the rejection of transplanted islet cells in the absence of calcineurin inhibition resulting in sustained insulin-free management of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) in patients with T1D.

All six transplanted subjects demonstrated marked improvements in glycemic control, achieving and maintaining insulin independence after one or two islet transplants, primarily depending on the subjects’ body mass and baseline daily insulin requirements. The first three participants were transplanted over a year ago and have remained insulin-free, including a patient who has maintained stable blood glucose control reflected by an HbA1c as low as 4.7%, for over 15 months without the use of exogenous insulin. Two subsequent subjects transplanted in July 2025 achieved insulin independence within approximately four weeks following a single islet transplantation and have maintained an HbA1c below 6% for over 3 months. A sixth subject, who was transplanted in early August 2025, recently underwent a second islet infusion and is now insulin free with an HbA1c of 5.3%. All six patients have been free of severe hypoglycemic episodes since their transplants. Tegoprubart was generally well tolerated, with no reported serious infections, no thromboembolic or rejection events, and no signs of the kidney or neurological toxicity often observed with traditional calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression.

“For years, clinicians have been working to find a new medication that can prevent rejection of islet cells while offering a better safety profile than calcineurin inhibitors including tacrolimus, which remain the current standard of care but are often associated with debilitating metabolic, neurologic, and cardiovascular toxicities,” said Dr. Witkowski. “These preliminary data in the first six subjects with T1D as part of our UChicago Medicine clinical trial are very encouraging, with all six subjects achieving insulin independence, and suggest that tegoprubart may be the innovative immunosuppression therapy we need to transform islet transplantation in the years ahead.”

“Breakthrough T1D continues to be encouraged by the data from the investigational use of tegoprubart as a novel immunosuppression alternative to advance islet transplantation,” said Esther Latres, Ph.D., Breakthrough T1D Senior Vice President, Research. “We look forward to continuing to support this promising research and to more data on tegoprubart in islet transplants in the future.”

This clinical trial is funded by Breakthrough T1D (formerly JDRF), with initial support from The Cure Alliance. Breakthrough T1D has also committed to fund a second study evaluating tegoprubart as part of a calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppression drug regimen to prevent islet transplant rejection in individuals with T1D and chronic kidney disease.

The global liver fibrosis market is highly competitive, with several leading companies driving innovation and market growth, such as Akero Therapeutics, Sagimet Biosciences, Inventiva Pharma, Novo Nordisk, Viking Therapeutics, Boston Pharmaceuticals, Aligos Therapeutics, Boehringer Ingelheim, and 89bio.

These companies are at the forefront of developing novel therapies that are significantly improving patient outcomes. Through strategic investments in research and development (R&D), expanding product portfolios, and increasing global access to cutting-edge treatments, these industry leaders are shaping the future of liver fibrosis care and contributing to the dynamic growth of the market. Additionally, expanding into emerging markets and increasing their presence through regional distribution networks are key strategies to tap into underserved patient populations. These strategies are enabling companies to strengthen their market position and accelerate growth in the competitive liver fibrosis treatment landscape.

The global liver fibrosis market is undergoing significant transformation, fueled by emerging trends that are reshaping treatment paradigms and driving liver fibrosis market growth. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into liver fibrosis treatment holds immense potential to revolutionize both diagnosis and treatment. AI can significantly enhance the ability to diagnose liver fibrosis early and accurately by analyzing vast amounts of patient data, including imaging, biomarkers, and genetic information. Machine learning algorithms are already being developed to interpret non-invasive tests like elastography and CT scans, offering faster and more reliable assessments of liver damage, which can improve the speed of diagnosis and allow for earlier intervention.

The prevalence of various liver diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease, chronic hepatitis B and C, and liver fibrosis, is steadily increasing. As these conditions progress, they often lead to liver fibrosis, which is becoming more common globally. The growing incidence of liver fibrosis is expected to drive the market for its treatment. Key risk factors such as chronic hepatitis B or C, co-infection with HIV/AIDS, and the use of immunosuppressive drugs following liver transplantation are contributing to the rising demand for liver fibrosis treatments. According to a study by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, liver disease is projected to become a major global health issue in 2023, contributing to an estimated 4% of global mortality. Thus, the worldwide surge in liver fibrosis cases is further propelling market growth.

Additionally, the growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in liver fibrosis is fuelling the development of targeted therapies. Research into specific fibrosis pathways, such as TGF-? signaling and the role of immune cells in fibrosis progression, has led to the discovery of promising therapeutic agents. Non-invasive diagnostic tools, such as liver elastography and blood biomarkers, are also making it easier to detect liver fibrosis early, enabling more timely intervention and better management of the disease.

Despite these advances, the liver fibrosis market faces several challenges. One significant hurdle is the lack of approved, effective antifibrotic therapies. While several drug candidates are in clinical trials, there are few approved therapies available to treat liver fibrosis, especially for advanced stages. This has led to a gap in treatment options for patients with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. Moreover, the complexity of the disease and its progression, along with the difficulty of accurately staging liver fibrosis without invasive procedures, complicates both diagnosis and treatment.

Another challenge is the high cost of treatment, particularly for advanced therapies such as liver transplantation and novel biologics targeting fibrosis. These treatments often come with high costs, placing financial strain on healthcare systems and patients, especially in developing regions where access to care may be limited.

The expansion of the liver fibrosis market into emerging regions presents a significant growth opportunity due to several factors. As healthcare infrastructure improves in regions such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and parts of Africa, the demand for liver fibrosis treatments is expected to rise. These regions are witnessing an increasing prevalence of liver diseases, particularly as risk factors such as obesity, alcohol consumption, and hepatitis become more widespread. Furthermore, the aging population in these regions is leading to a higher incidence of chronic liver diseases and fibrosis.
