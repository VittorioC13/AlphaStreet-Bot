[TEXT]
This week’s edition of Finovate Global reviews recent fintech news from the Netherlands.

Dutch insurtech RISK acquires Amsterdam-based fintech Dyme

Dutch insurtech RISK has acquired Amsterdam-based savings app Dyme. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The deal will enable Dyme to boost its presence in the Netherlands as well as enter the German market. Courtesy of the agreement, both Dyme’s brand and management team will remain intact.

“From being featured on Dragon’s Den to becoming one of the largest finance apps in Europe and reaching profitability, our mission has always been the same: helping people take control of their money,” Dyme noted on its LinkedIn Page. “This step opens up some great opportunities for Dyme and its customers: expand the product, especially with great insurance packages and service, reach millions more people through the RISK ecosystem, and take Dyme international, beginning with Germany.”

Dyme currently has more than 600,000 consumers who have linked their bank accounts to the Dyme platform. The company’s app serves as a personal financial assistant to help users lower costs, and uses smart algorithms to automate subscription cancellations and provide financial guidance. Dyme announced its first profitable quarter in 2024, and has said that it has helped users save more than €40 million since inception. The acquisition will combine RISK’s market expertise and technological platforms with Dyme’s user-friendly financial solutions that enable users to easily manage their expenses, budgets, and more.

RISK offers an advanced IT platform, SureBase, that assists financial advisors, online labels, and insurers in product comparison and distribution. SureBase, according to RISK CEO Harm Vollmuller, will serve a key base for the new synergy between RISK and Dyme. “By combining that with our platforms and market knowledge, we can reach people at a time when financial breaking space is more important than ever,” Vollmuller said.

Factris raises €100m to power SME financing

A new funding partnership with Brand New Day Bank will enable Factris to expand its ability to provide financial support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Dutch fintech has secured a €100 million facility to support financing SME factoring across Europe. This will enable Factris to finance sellers in nine countries and manage receivables from debtors in 27 countries.

“This new facility is a testament to the trust and confidence Brand New Day Bank has placed in Factris and our vision for SME financing,” Factris CEO Brian Reaves said. “As we continue to scale across Europe, this partnership ensures we can meet the increasing demand for alternative financing and provide SMEs with the liquidity they need to thrive.”

Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Amsterdam, North Holland, Factris specializes in invoice factoring for small and medium-sized enterprises. The company offers selective factoring to enable companies to decide which specific invoices to factor, fund availability within 24 hours of invoice submission, credit insurance to protect against customer non-payment or bankruptcy, and debtor management for collections and account receivables.

Brand New Day Bank is a Netherlands-based digital-first, challenger bank and fintech that began operating in 2010. The financial institution serves both individuals and small-to-medium sized businesses with savings accounts, investment and pension products, tax-advantaged savings and investment solutions, and annuity payment services. Brand New Day Bank has more than €8 billion in assets.

Dutch fintech Plumery unveils Canada-based solutions

Digital banking experience platform Plumery announced a suite of new features and integrations designed especially for credit unions in Canada. These new capabilities will give these institutions the ability to provide personalized, compliant, and modern digital banking experiences for their members.

The Amsterdam-based fintech leveraged a collaboration with Aequilibrium, a digital services and technology consultancy headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, to make sure its Canadian-ready platform is built based on the way that Canadian credit union members prefer to bank. This includes not just hyper-personalized, mobile-first, and intuitive digital journeys, but also support for everyday payments and transfers including billpay and Interact e-Transfers, and Canadian savings and lending products like GICs.

Plumery’s move comes as Canadian banks and credit unions face a range of challenges including evolving customer expectations, fintech competition, and the pressure to modernize their legacy systems. More immediately, Canadian credit unions are scrambling in the wake of Central 1 Credit Union’s announcement that it will wind down its digital banking platform Forge (formerly MemberDirect). More than 170 credit unions across Canada had been relying on the technology.

“With Forge winding down, Canadian institutions have a rare opportunity to modernize on their own terms, rather than being tied to outdated systems,” Plumery CEO and Founder Ben Goldin said. “Our platform provides an immediate, future-ready option that puts control back in the hands of credit unions. By working with Aequilibrium, we are combining global banking innovation with local expertise to deliver experiences that meet the unique needs of Canadian credit unions’ members.”

Founded in 2016, Plumery enables financial institutions to offer unique mobile and online experiences on top of either their modern or legacy core banking platforms up to 80% faster. Plumery’s technology features foundations that are pre-integrated into its digital banking journeys that accelerate app development and shorten time-to-market while maintaining complete control over both design and functionality.

Check out my interview with Plumery’s Goldin from earlier this year.

[TITLE]‘Cardano Will Break The Internet’: Hoskinson Explains Why:
[TEXT]
Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure

In an interview with Bloomberg’s Haslinda Amin on the sidelines of Token2025, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson sketched an unabashedly expansionary roadmap for both crypto markets and the Cardano ecosystem, arguing that the next phase of adoption will be institutional, privacy-aware, and integrated with legacy finance—and that Cardano is positioned to be a core settlement layer in that world. The X quip that Cardano will “break the internet,” he said, was less a meme than a signal of the scope of partnerships and primitives he believes are nearing product readiness.

Bitcoin And Crypto Enter The Bull Run: Hoskinson

Hoskinson dismissed the latest market drawdown as a transient pause. “Quick pit stop at the gas station,” he said when asked if the recent sell-off suggested fading momentum. He described crypto’s underlying strength as “incredibly strong,” tying the next leg to policy catalysts. “The Clarity Act is likely to get passed and bring institutional players in,” he argued, placing regulation—not retail cycles—at the heart of the coming expansion.

On macro linkages, Hoskinson urged investors to decide what they believe crypto is—a high-beta tech proxy or a counter-cyclical hedge—because the answer shapes expectations through rate and dollar regimes. “When the dollar is weak, it wakes up,” he noted, adding that crypto has recently tracked tech, then gold, with the goal that the asset class becomes “large enough to be in its own asset class.”

He remains explicitly constructive on Bitcoin, placing a marker on timing and magnitude while cautioning his trading acumen: “I think by the middle of next year, $250,000 Bitcoin… depends on the macroeconomics… I’m the worst trader in the world.” The message was less a price call than a framing device: if institutions drive the next cycle, flows and correlations will not look like prior, retail-led four-year rhythms. “Those cycles were retail driven… this [one is] institutional and [about the] Clarity Act… a billion users,” he said, adding that banks are stirring “because the Genius Act,” which he cast as a bridge for mainstream capital.

Pressed on whether enthusiasm could be derailed by tariffs, geopolitics, or slower-than-expected easing, Hoskinson acknowledged the sector is “not immune to the macro,” reminding that heightened uncertainty makes allocators “more conservative and wait to deploy capital.” Yet he returned to a secular bull thesis: “I think we are headed towards the bull market,” with crypto continuing to “follow tech stocks” even as it matures toward standalone status.

Why Cardano Could ‘Break The Internet’

The interview’s pivot—and the line that lit up social media—was Amin’s reference to his recent post that “Cardano is going to break the internet.” Hoskinson tied the rhetoric to concrete pillars: an energized community, expanding collaborations, and privacy-preserving infrastructure designed for regulated finance.

“We’re having a lot of fun… a lot of wonderful partnerships and collaborations like Google Cloud,” he said, adding that the ecosystem “has been running and [has] never been hacked,” which in his view underpins why “a lot of institutional [capital sees Cardano as] one of the blue chips of the industry.”

For Hoskinson, the last mile between blockchains and capital markets is privacy and programmability that fit compliance envelopes. “Tokens are financial brain cells… Having 24/7 global settlement is a really powerful thing. Only thing missing is privacy,” he said. The remedy, he argued, is contract design that separates public and private data paths so that broker-dealers and custodians can meet obligations without forfeiting blockchain’s composability. “You need contracts to sort out the public side and private side… solving that last mile problem,” he said. Once such rails exist, “there is no reason to run on the legacy system.”

He located the time horizon in a regulatory cadence rather than a product roadmap alone. “Next three to five years,” he said when asked when this flips. “The regulation is getting done and [then] two to three years of rulemaking… every jurisdiction in Europe [will] be operable and [we’ll] not talk about tokens in securities law [terms]. We can adapt our software accordingly. Everything else is sky is the limit.”

Cardano’s privacy-focused Midnight stack is the bet he described as tailored to Wall Street workflows, according to Hoskinson. “We have Midnight coming out… a big bet because we wanted something for Wall Street and something for the custodians and exchanges [to] tokenize what they have and bring it into the crypto space,” he said.

The project, he added, is “coming towards the end of the year,” framed as a bridge for legacy financial institutions to issue and settle assets with policy-compliant confidentiality on public rails. That emphasis on privacy and compatibility also informed his comments about reconciling blockchains with supervisors. “We’re talking [to] the Federal Reserve and SEC and now we have to reconcile the legacy world,” he said. “Everybody has a role to play… It’s going to take a little bit of time what privacy looks like and how global settlement is going to look like.”

At press time, ADA traded at $0.855.

[TITLE]Europe FDI Trends Report 2025: EU-US Trade Agreement Ensures 15% Tariff, Eases Threat of Escalation:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "FDI Trends in Europe (2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Europe experienced a robust growth phase characterized by increased project numbers and capital expenditures from 2023 to 2024, . Europe's share in opened Greenfield Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) projects, dominated by Western Europe, rose to 40% in 2024. Despite visible FDI opportunity, Eurozone GDP growth stunted at 0.9% in 2024, with structural issues like low productivity, rapidly increasing bond yields, and energy costs weighing on industrial competitiveness

Despite healthy levels of inward Greenfield FDI recorded in 2024, Europe's FDI climate is facing the brunt of US levies, weak macroeconomic performance, and prolonged war; these headwinds are explanatory for why opened projects in Europe declined by 44% YoY in H1 2025. Evidently, projects are stalling and/or relocating while investors seek clarity on the new global trade status quo.

To-date:

The EU faces an "all inclusive" 15% tariff rate as part of an EU-US trade agreement signed on July 27th, 2025. The deal effectively halved previously threatened rates (up to 30%) and prevented further escalation. However, copper, steel and aluminum levels remain at 50%.

As part of a US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal, the UK is subject to a baseline 10% tariff rate, made effective April 5th 2025. Still, goods such as copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, steel and aluminium are subject to variable higher rates.

Switzerland has been hit with a 39% tariff rate to curtail exports of luxury goods to the US.

The ability of Ursula von der Leyen-President of the European Commission-and Europe more broadly to retaliate is somewhat hamstrung by the region's dependence on US investment. Europe, unlike emerging economies, is notably less dependent on inward FDI flows with strong intracontinental trade. Still, the US is Europe's largest greenfield investor, announcing 954 projects (2023-H1 2025), trailed by China with 140 over the same time frame.

In terms of announced projects, Europe's distribution of inward FDI is relatively equitable among the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Turkiye and Poland. Furthermore, 40% of incoming projects (announced 2020-2024) are in renewable and alternative power, as the UK rejoins the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the US pivots back toward petrochemical energy.

Moving forward, The analyst's FDI team expects current sectoral trends to escalate, whereby international investment in renewable energy becomes more European-centric. Nations across the UK, EU and Schengen area all boast high-skilled labor, a unified regulatory framework, and attractive green credit incentives. However, whether announced investments translate into opened projects and Europe yields the benefits of renewable energy development depends on whether macroeconomic outlooks ameliorate. Strong institutional frameworks will aid development, but without attractive financial incentives and supportive macroeconomic conditions, projects will continue to stall and international investors will look elsewhere.

[TITLE]Country Risk Rating Report: Q2 2025 Update - Denmark Leads, Followed by Ireland and Switzerland:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Risk Report: Q2 2025 Update" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The twenty-eighth update of the the analyst Country Risk Index (GCRI) Q2 2025 ranks Denmark at the top, followed by Ireland and Switzerland. 43 countries were identified in the low-risk zone, 50 countries under medium risk, 57 countries under high risk, and three countries in the very high-risk zone in GCRI Q2 2025.

Global Risk Report is based on the analyst Country Risk Index (GCRI) which is a unique country risk-rating model that determines the existing and future level of country risk by assessing various qualitative and quantitative factors. The index is formulated to help firms prepare their global business strategies on the basis of historical developments in an economy and also their future expectations.

The Country Risk Index incorporates the latest available macroeconomics, political, social, technological, environmental and legal data from a range of recognized national and international statistical sources, and incorporates proprietary data from the analyst Economics Research. The model also features expert analytical judgment from in-house economists and takes into account their insights and opinions. By applying a robust approach to assessing risk, The analyst analysts ensure that strategists have an effective tool to assess current trends and risks facing the economies across the globe.

Scope

Global risk: The Q2 2025 the analyst Country Risk Index (GCRI) indicates a decrease in the risk score, falling from 55.8 in Q1 2025 to 53.0. This improvement is primarily attributed to a rise in global trade, particularly as US imports increased due to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of upcoming tariff hikes. Furthermore, proactive government measures designed to boost economic activity played a significant role in this favorable shift.

Asia-Pacific: The risk score in Asia-Pacific dropped from 54.6 in Q1 2025 to 51.6 in Q2, indicating a shift in economic conditions. While strong domestic demand and proactive export strategies initially spurred growth, the overall outlook remains cautious. Many regional economies are heavily trade-dependent, making them vulnerable to uncertainties that could hinder progress. The impending US plan to impose 100% tariffs on semiconductors, as of August 2025, presents a serious threat to Southeast Asian nations reliant on semiconductor exports.

Americas: In Q2 2025, the Americas' risk score decreased from 57.4 to 54.8. The US economy experienced a robust rebound, growing at an annualized rate of 3.3% in Q2 2025, a significant turnaround from a 0.5% contraction in Q1 2025. This growth was mostly fueled by increased consumer spending, despite a minor decline in both investment and exports. Overall, the positive economic recovery has fostered a more optimistic risk outlook for the region.

Europe: Europe's risk score declined from 42.6 in Q1 2025 to 39.3 in Q2 2025, reflecting improved economic stability amid ongoing trade tensions. The European Commission's forecast anticipates modest GDP growth for 2025, driven by resilient consumption and investment recovery. However, US trade policies and labor shortages due to an aging population continue to challenge the EU's economic landscape. Despite these challenges, the potential for reduced trade tensions and increased infrastructure spending could bolster growth and enhance resilience in the region.

Middle East and Africa: The risk score for the Middle East and Africa (MEA) declined from 65.5 in Q1 2025 to 63.2 in Q2 2025. The MEA region is poised for growth, with a projected expansion in 2025, driven by increased oil production and diversification efforts in the GCC. Major participants such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE are leveraging technology and tourism to enhance their economies, despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and fiscal risks in oil-dependent nations necessitating careful budget management.

Reasons to Buy

Global Risk Report is a valuable tool that provides critical information and insights to support decision-making, protect your business or investments, and enhance your overall risk management capabilities.

Risk identification: A risk report provides an in-depth analysis of potential risks and threats that may impact your business or investments. It helps identify and prioritize risks, enabling you to take proactive measures to mitigate them.

Decision-making support: A risk report provides valuable insights and data-driven information that can assist you in making informed decisions. It helps you assess the potential impact of risks on your objectives and aids in developing effective strategies to manage and minimize those risks.

[TITLE]Vodafone Ireland’s new Italian boss Sabrina Casalta: ‘Being a CEO was actually not in my plan’:
[TEXT]
Sabrina Casalta works well under pressure. And the new Vodafone Ireland chief has had plenty of it to test her, whether it is in the executive boardroom or on one of her road trips that turn out to be a little more challenging than you would expect.

Casalta says she likes to be forced out of her comfort zone and, with travel, there is always the potential for things to go wrong. A recent 300km trip in Mozambique threw up some interesting obstacles. “It took 12 hours. The road was foggy, there were points where you couldn’t see two metres ahead. The road was ruined by massive holes from the civil war, and there were lots of people and students walking to school on the side of the road,” she recalls. “I was responsible for making the plans. And I was the one driving for the 12 hours.”

The move from Vodafone Italy in the wake of its €8 billion sale to Swisscom to head the Irish business is her latest challenge.

“Being a CEO was actually not in my plan,” she says. “I don’t think there is the ‘final job’. It’s a journey.”

Caslta’s career is not what you would describe as linear.

“I’m not a vertical expert in one area or another. I went through different experiences and I think they were all built around curiosity, and adding pieces and tools to my skills in order to always have a broader impact.”

After graduating with a masters in management engineering, Casalta began working as a consultant, first with PricewaterhouseCoopers (now PwC), and subsequently with Boston Consulting Group. That involved working across multiple industries, focusing mainly on strategy and business transformation but not in financial services and telecoms.

Then, 14 years ago, she took up a role with Vodafone.

“When I got the chance to join Vodafone, I said, why not? It’s a new area, something new to learn and to understand.”

“Why not” seems to be what drives her. After joining Vodafone Italy in a strategy role, she moved on to become an integral part of its fibre services launch, and the early days of its 5G trials. “We started with the very early trial and experimentation into 5G, some of them even before the standard of the technology was completely defined,” she says.

Her most significant experience, she says, came later when she joined Vodafone’s business customer care team, just as the Covid-19 lockdowns began in Northern Italy. Again, “why not?” came into play.

“It was quite a big change for me, coming from strategy perspective. I completely changed my time horizon. When you work on strategy, you work on three, five years perspective; in customer operations, you have to deliver consistently, every single hour, every single day, across team of hundreds of people,” she says. “I think that the learning was on the execution side, but most importantly on the people management side.”

In February 2022, she became chief financial officer of the business, staying in the role for almost three years until the business was sold. That was when the ambition to take on a chief executive role kicked in.

“I realised that all the experience I had, they all made sense together because they gave me the broader perspective

[TITLE]The $300 Billion A.I. Infrastructure Crisis Hiding in Plain Sight:
[TEXT]
The race to scale artificial intelligence has triggered historic investment in GPU infrastructure. Hyperscalers are expected to spend over $300 billion on A.I. hardware in 2025 alone, while enterprises across industries are building their own GPU clusters to keep pace. This may be the largest corporate resource reallocation in modern history, yet beneath the headlines of record spending lies a quieter story. According to the 2024 State of AI Infrastructure at Scale report, most of this hardware goes underused, with more than 75 percent of organizations running their GPUs below 70 percent utilization, even at peak times. Wasted compute has become the silent tax on A.I. This inefficiency inflates costs and slows innovation, creating a competitive disadvantage for companies that should be leading their markets.
