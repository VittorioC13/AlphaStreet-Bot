In the midst of the rising popularity of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and their compounded versions, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been stepping up its efforts to curb the entry of illicit drug materials into the US markets and their improper marketing.

On 5 September, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Marty Makary announced the establishment of a “green list” import alert. This list will include is meant to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in approved GLP-1RAs like such as Eli Lilly’s Zepbound (tirzepatide) and Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy (semaglutide) that are manufactured in FDA-approved facilities from illegal imports for manufacture of compounded alternatives.

At the same time, the FDA is also coming down against direct-to-consumer advertising by drug companies selling unapproved drugs or including misleading information, in a bid to protect consumer interests.

FDA escalates recall of millions of thyroid pills amid potency fears

The FDA has upgraded a nationwide recall of over 54,000 bottles of levothyroxine sodium tablets to a Class II designation, indicating the use of the product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences.

The drug is essential and widely prescribed. Levothyroxine is a synthetic thyroid hormone used to treat hypothyroidism, and with an estimated 80 million prescriptions in 2023, it is the third most prescribed medication in the United States.

The recall was initiated due to potency issues, meaning tablets from the same batch may not deliver a consistent dose. This can lead to serious patient consequences, including side effects from too much medication or ineffectiveness from too little.

The tablets were made by Intas Pharmaceuticals in India, a company that has faced significant FDA scrutiny, including import alerts and a larger recall of the same drug earlier this year for the same reason.

The potency issues with this levothyroxine product mirror the controversial past of other thyroid drugs like Synthroid, suggesting that quality assurance for these sensitive hormones remains a persistent challenge.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has escalated a nationwide recall of a common thyroid drug. The recall of over 54,000 bottles of levothyroxine sodium tablets, initiated by Accord Healthcare Inc., was upgraded to a Class II designation on Oct. 6, signaling heightened risks for patients reliant on the hormone replacement therapy.

Levothyroxine sodium is a lifeline for patients with hypothyroidism. It is also used to treat goiters and a specific type of thyroid cancer. With an estimated 80 million prescriptions filled in 2023, it is the third most prescribed medication in the United States, making any widespread quality issue a major public health concern.

"Levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic thyroid hormone used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. It works by replacing or supplementing the body's natural thyroid hormone to restore normal metabolic levels," Brighteon.AI's Enoch explained.

The prescription-only tablets, in 88 mcg doses, were manufactured in India by Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a company with a recent history of regulatory friction with the U.S. agency. A Class II recall is reserved for situations where the use of a "violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences," a serious classification for a drug that millions depend on to regulate their metabolism.

A lifeline medication and lingering patient uncertainty

This is not an isolated incident for Intas. Earlier this year, the FDA confirmed a separate, larger recall of 160,630 bottles of levothyroxine made by the same company, also due to potency issues and classified as Class II. This recurring problem raises alarming questions

Federal probe uncovers potential fraud in child gender treatments at major hospitals

DOJ alleges Boston Children’s Hospital may have misdiagnosed minors to secure insurance coverage for puberty blockers.

Data shows an unusual spike in "precocious puberty" diagnoses for children aged 10+, far beyond medical norms.

Puberty blockers, FDA-approved only for early puberty, were allegedly prescribed "like candy" for gender dysphoria.

Hospitals received millions in state reimbursements for gender-related services.

Legal battles intensify as federal judges weigh subpoenas for patient records amid claims of fraudulent billing.

Federal prosecutors are scrutinizing major children’s hospitals—including Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)—for potential fraudulent billing practices tied to gender-related medical treatments for minors. The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges that hospitals may have manipulated diagnoses to secure insurance coverage for puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, drugs not FDA-approved for treating gender dysphoria in children.

Court filings reveal that BCH diagnosed hundreds of children aged 10 and older with central precocious puberty (CPP), a condition typically defined by puberty onset before age 8 in girls and 9 in boys. Prosecutors argue that the surge in older diagnoses suggests hospitals mislabeled patients to justify off-label drug prescriptions.

Questionable diagnoses and financial incentives

According to DOJ-submitted insurance data, BCH saw a "large spike" in CPP diagnoses between 2020 and 2023, including at least one 22-year-old patient. Prosecutors contend that these late diagnoses defy medical logic, as puberty at age 10 is biologically normal.
