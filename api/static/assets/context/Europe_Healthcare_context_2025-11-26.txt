[TITLE]Tonix Pharmaceuticals Announces FDA IND Clearance for Phase 2 Study of TNX-102 SL for the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder:
[TEXT]
Tonix plans to initiate potential pivotal Phase 2 HORIZON study of TNX-102 SL in adults with major depressive disorder in mid-2026

More than 21 million US adults experience a major depressive episode each year

CHATHAM, N.J., Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: TNXP) (“Tonix” or the “Company”), a fully-integrated commercial biotechnology company, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) application to support clinical development of TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) 5.6 mg for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.

“There is a clear need for innovative therapies that address depression,” said Seth Lederman, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Tonix Pharmaceuticals. “We believe TNX-102 SL offers a promising approach for individuals suffering from MDD. The unique pharmacological profile of TNX-102 SL is designed to target the disruptive sleep which is often associated with depression. Prior studies of TNX-102 SL in fibromyalgia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed promising signals for improvement of depressive symptoms on the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), respectively. We are excited to advance TNX-102 SL and look forward to evaluating its potential as a new treatment option for those affected by depression.”

The IND clearance enables Tonix to proceed with the potentially pivotal Phase 2 HORIZON study, a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of TNX-102 SL as a first-line monotherapy in adults with MDD.

By products & services, the biochips market is categorized into instruments, consumables, and software & services. The consumables segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period, as biochip technologies generate vast and complex datasets that require advanced analytics and AI-based interpretation. Cloud integration enables remote access, data sharing, and real-time insights, while rising demand for bioinformatics, maintenance, and customization services supports faster, more efficient research and diagnostics.

By type, the market is segmented into DNA Chips, Lab-on-a-Chip, Protein Chips, Tissue Arrays and Cell Arrays. The Lab-on-a-Chip segment is projected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period due to its ability to miniaturize and automate complex laboratory processes, enabling rapid, low-cost, and high-throughput testing. These compact systems integrate multiple analytical functions, such as sample preparation, reaction, and detection, on a single microfluidic platform, reducing reagent use and turnaround time.

The biochips market is divided into North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. In 2024, North America accounted for the largest market share due to its strong biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, well-established research infrastructure, and high investment in precision medicine and genomics. The region is home to major biochip developers, which drive innovation through continuous R&D and product launches. Additionally, supportive government initiatives, robust healthcare expenditure, and early adoption of advanced diagnostic technologies further strengthen market growth. The presence of leading academic institutions and widespread use of biochips in clinical and research applications also contribute to North America's dominant position.

Opportunities in the North American biochips market are expanding, fueled by strong R&D investments, technological innovation, and strategic collaborations among leading life science companies and research institutions. The region benefits from the presence of key players such as Thermo Fisher Scientific, Illumina, and Agilent Technologies, which are advancing microarray and lab-on-chip platforms. In August 2025, Randox Laboratories US Ltd announced plans to expand its Jefferson County facility from a 48-person sales and distribution operation into a full-scale production laboratory. This expansion will boost the company's annual production of 4.1 billion tests and establish Jefferson County as a key US hub for advanced diagnostic solutions, ensuring confidence in patient testing and results. The growing adoption of point-of-care diagnostics, precision medicine initiatives, and AI-integrated bioinformatics solutions is further driving demand. Supported by robust healthcare infrastructure, favorable regulatory frameworks, and sustained funding for genomics and clinical research, North America remains a critical hub for innovation and commercialization in the biochips market.
