[TITLE]European airports race to fix check-in glitch after hacking disruption:

[TITLE]Some flights cancelled amid Dublin Airport T2 disruption:
[TEXT]
Dublin Airport saw a second day of disruption to its check-in and baggage drop in Terminal 2 following yesterday's cyber attack which impacted several airports across Europe.

Airport operator daa said it is continuing to support airlines as they deal with the ongoing disruption.

Aer Lingus said that the incident had "significantly impacted operations", with 13 flights cancelled today. Nine of these were inbound flights, with four outbound.

It is understood that a number of IT experts from the US are to fly into Dublin this evening to check the systems here.

In a statement issued this evening, daa said: "IT teams working hard to restore systems which will allow for normality to resume.

"This will continue tonight - we're hopeful that a full fix isn't far away but there is a chance that manual processes may be required again for the first wave tomorrow morning for some airlines.

"Airlines have aircraft where they need to be, so full schedules expected to operate.

"Some airline processes in airport - check in and bag drop - may still take a bit longer than normal so passengers should plan ahead and give themselves extra time where they can."

A cyber attack at a provider of check-in and boarding systems yesterday disrupted operations at several major European airports including London's Heathrow, the continent's busiest, causing flight delays and cancellations.

[TITLE]Heathrow among major airports hit by delays after cyber attack:
[TEXT]
Heathrow was among a number of major airports across Europe hit by delays after a suspected cyber attack that targeted a service provider for check-in and boarding systems.

The "technical issue" affecting Collins Aerospace, which provides check-in and boarding services for various airlines, resulted in 14 flights being cancelled at Brussels Airport on Saturday, and several more being delayed at London Heathrow, Berlin, and Dublin, among others.

Passengers reported being unable to check in online, instead queuing for hours for staff to deal with them manually at desks and departure gates, only to be told their flights are not taking off.

Heathrow Airport said in an update in the early hours of Sunday morning that "work continues to resolve and recover" from the outage.

"We encourage passengers to check the status of their flights before travelling to Heathrow."

Helen Steel, 49, left Dorset for Heathrow at 3am to travel home to Oslo, with her cat Thomas - but was "shouted at by staff" who told her she would not be able to fly until Sunday.

Describing the situation as an "absolute nightmare", she said: "I've got an animal here, so I'm very concerned
