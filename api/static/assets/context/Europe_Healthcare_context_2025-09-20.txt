Chronic Venous Insufficiency Market Analysis

The CVI market is witnessing a shift from traditional surgical procedures toward less invasive therapies, including endovenous laser treatment, radiofrequency ablation, sclerotherapy, and novel pharmacological approaches. Minimally invasive techniques like Sclerotherapy, Endovenous Laser Therapy (EVLT), and Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) are also gaining traction. EVLT works by inserting a laser fiber into the affected vein, where laser energy is applied to close it. At the same time, RFA uses a catheter to deliver radiofrequency energy that causes the vein to collapse and seal. Compared to conventional surgery, these approaches are less invasive and typically allow faster recovery.

In August 2023, Medtronic received FDA 510(k) clearance for an upgraded ClosureFast RFA catheter with a slimmer 6-F profile, now available in the U.S. Additionally, companies like enVVeno Medical Corporation and VERIGRAFT are actively developing and testing new treatment candidates for Chronic Venous Insufficiency.

[TEXT]
Biogen to drive end-to-end development and commercialization of ThecaFlex DRx™, an investigational implantable device for intrathecal delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)

ThecaFlex DRx™ has the potential to be a new, convenient way to administer medicines to patients living with neurological disorders.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) announced the company has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Massachusetts-based Alcyone Therapeutics. As part of an existing partnership with Alcyone Therapeutics, the companies are advancing ThecaFlex DRx™, an implantable subcutaneous port and catheter device being investigated for the intrathecal delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). ThecaFlex DRx™ is designed to provide an alternative to repeat lumbar punctures in chronic intrathecal administration of medicines, which could ease both patient experience and accessibility for a broader population of people living with neurologic disorders.

Biogen will drive end-to-end development, manufacturing and commercialization of ThecaFlex DRx™. Upon closing, Alcyone employees who will join Biogen will be integrated into the company’s product delivery solutions team, building upon the existing portfolio and expertise in drug-device combination products. The ThecaFlex DRx™ System is initially being evaluated with SPINRAZA® (nusinersen) in patients with spinal muscular atrophy, which will inform pathways for Biogen's broader portfolio of investigational therapies.

“For nearly three decades, Biogen has pioneered ASO development, and we are committed to continuing to improve patient experience and ease of administration," said Nicole Murphy, Head of Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology at Biogen. "We believe the acquisition of Alcyone Therapeutics offers a strategic opportunity to both expand the company’s capabilities and enhance the value proposition of our medicines by offering a meaningful, patient-centered solution.”

“Alcyone has been a pioneer in precision CNS delivery. With ThecaFlex DRx™, following our productive partnership with Biogen, we now have the opportunity to further deliver what could be the first truly patient-centered, chronic intrathecal delivery option for these important therapies,” said PJ Anand, Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Alcyone Therapeutics. “We believe Biogen’s deep expertise in ASOs and its proven track record in advancing drug delivery innovations make it the ideal partner to bring this technology forward.”

Biogen and Alcyone Therapeutics have collaborated since 2023 on the development of ThecaFlex DRx™, with the PIERRE and PIERRE-PK clinical studies for nusinersen currently underway. Nusinersen is currently marketed under the brand name SPINRAZA® and is indicated for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in pediatric and adult patients. Biogen plans to introduce the new drug delivery system for SPINRAZA in early 2028, contingent upon the successful completion of clinical trials and regulatory approval.

Alcyone Therapeutics is based in Lowell, Massachusetts. ThecaFlex DRx™ has been in development since 2019 and is manufactured locally.

[TITLE]Scientists Train AI to Forecast Over 1,000 Diseases, Years in Advance:
[TEXT]
Scientists said Wednesday that they had created an AI model able to predict medical diagnoses years in advance, building on the same technology behind consumer chatbots like ChatGPT.

Based on a patient's case history, the Delphi-2M AI "predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases" years into the future, the team from British, Danish, German and Swiss institutions wrote in a paper published in the journal Nature.

Researchers trained the model on data from Britain's UK Biobank – a large-scale biomedical research database with details on about half a million participants.

Related: More People Are Risking Medical Advice From Chatbots. Here's Why.

Neural networks based on so-called "transformer" architecture – the "T" in "ChatGPT" – most famously tackle language-based tasks, as in the chatbot and its many imitators and competitors.

But understanding a sequence of medical diagnoses is "a bit like learning the grammar in a text," German Cancer Research Center AI expert Moritz Gerstung told journalists.

Delphi-2M "learns the patterns in healthcare data, preceding diagnoses, in which combinations they occur and in which succession", he said, enabling "very meaningful and health-relevant predictions".

Gerstung presented charts suggesting the AI could single out people at far higher or lower risk of suffering a heart attack than their age and other factors would predict.

The team verified Delphi-2M's performance by testing it against data from almost two million people in Denmark's public health database.

But Gerstung and fellow team members stressed that the Delphi-2M tool needed further testing and was not yet ready for clinical use.

"This is still a long way from improved healthcare as the authors acknowledge that both (British and Danish) datasets are biased in terms of age, ethnicity and current healthcare outcomes," commented health technology researcher Peter Bannister, a fellow at Britain's Institution of Engineering and Technology.

But in future systems like Delphi-2M could help "guide the monitoring and possibly earlier clinical interventions for effectively a preventative type of medicine", Gerstung said.

On a larger scale, such tools could help with "optimization of resources across a stretched healthcare system", European Molecular Biology Laboratory co-author Tom Fitzgerald said.

Doctors in many countries already use computer tools to predict risk of disease, such as the QRISK3 program that British family doctors use to assess the danger of heart attack or stroke.

Delphi-2M, by contrast, "can do all diseases at once and over a long time period", said co-author Ewan Birney.

Gustavo Sudre, a King's College London professor specializing in medical AI, commented that the research "looks to be a significant step towards scalable, interpretable and – most importantly – ethically responsible predictive modelling".

"Interpretable" or "explainable" AI is one of the top research goals in the field, as the full inner workings of many large AI models currently remain mysterious even to their creators.
