[TITLE]Asana pays $62M for Milam’s-anchored retail plaza near Coral Gables:
[TEXT]
Asana Partners paid $62.1 million for a shopping center anchored by Milam’s Markets and Walgreens near Coral Gables.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm bought the 92,100-square-foot Red Bird Center at 5761 Bird Road in unincorporated Miami-Dade County from Red Bird Associates, according to a news release from the seller’s broker. The 5.6-acre property is in the Coral Terrace neighborhood.

Danny Finkle and Jorge Portela led the JLL team that represented the seller.

Red Bird Associates is managed by Stephen Brandon of Miami-Dade-based The Brandon Company and Mark Morgan of Overland Park, Kansas-based MD Management, state corporate records show.

Red Bird Center is fully leased, the release says. Tenants include Ace Hardware, Space Coast Credit Union, Quest Diagnostics, AT&T, as well as an animal clinic, pizzeria and eye care office. The property includes an Orion Fuels gas station.

Brandon Company, led by President Jeff Brandon, is a commercial real estate development firm founded in 1974, its website says. MD Management, led by Morgan, is a family-owned real estate developer and manager, according to its website.

Asana –– led by Terry S. Brown, Sam E. Judd and Jason K. Tompkins –– has been investing in South Florida in recent years. In 2018, Asana bought a seven-building retail portfolio at 1787, 1919, 1928 Purdy Avenue; 1900, 1916, 1930 Bay Road; and 1935 West Avenue in Miami Beach’s Sunset Harbour neighborhood for $68.8 million from Scott Robins and Philip Levine.

[TITLE]From gourmet fruits to artisanal breads, instant grocery delivery is going luxe:
[TEXT]
BENGALURU : With speed no longer a differentiator, grocery-delivery platforms are now serving indulgence, freshness, and aspiration—instantly.

From gourmet fruits to ozone-washed greens to artisanal sourdoughs, quick commerce is moving upmarket in search of high-end, better-paying customers to boost their margins.

The latest to join the sprint is food-delivery giant Zomato-owned Blinkit, which is looking to expand its fresh range to include ozone-washed fruits and HACCP-certified produce, as well as handpicked bread and cheese imported from Europe, two people close to the development told Mint.

Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a science-based system to control food safety hazards, widely adopted by national regulators.

Doing so will help the platform increase margins and the basket size, they explained.

To be sure, it already has premium sellers such as Urban Platter selling organic produce, just like Swiggy Instamart and Zepto. However, it now plans to source hydroponics and exotic produce directly through exclusive arrangements with sellers.

“Blinkit’s market strength lends itself perfectly to premium produce, satisfying those users who are consistently showing they will pay more for better-quality farm-fresh goods," said one of the two persons, on condition of anonymity.

Blinkit declined to comment on Mint’s queries.

Its rival, Swiggy Instamart, introduced ‘Handpicked’ in June 2024, partnering with local eateries such as Brik Oven and Iyengar’s Bakery—both also available on Blinkit—to offer a range of global delicacies and oriental products. The platform later integrated the vertical with its larger Instamart service.

The category, coupled with the app's business from its private labels such as Noice, has helped drive up its average order value (AOV) to ₹612 in the June quarter of 2025-26 from ₹487 a year ago, as shown in filings with the stock exchanges.

Even Zepto, Amazon Fresh, and Flipkart Minutes are partnering with niche, upscale food and grocery brands.

The shift reflects the push by quick-commerce firms to chart a viable path to profitability by nudging customers toward higher-value, higher-margin baskets.

Gourmet items—typically priced 20-30% higher than mass-market goods—can have a direct impact on their unit economics, pushing AOV upwards of ₹600-700, according to Naveen Malpani, partner-consumer and retail at business consulting firm Grant Thornton Bharat.

“These categories also carry stronger gross margins and reduce reliance on discounting, aligning with the wider premiumization trend that has been driving value growth for packaged consumer goods companies in 2025," Malpani added.

“Importantly, customers who purchase premium produce and meal packs tend to repeat more often and are more open to cross-sell opportunities such as subscriptions and ready-to-cook kits, thereby improving customer lifetime value."

While Blinkit reported an AOV of ₹669, Swiggy Instamart’s stood at ₹612 in the June quarter of 2025-26.

Blinkit's adjusted revenue exceeded ₹2,400 crore in the quarter, while it incurred a net loss of ₹162 crore due to increased investments in quick commerce.

Swiggy Instamart's operating revenue touched ₹806 crore in the same period, while its net loss widened to ₹797 crore against ₹280 crore in the year-ago period.

Value over price

With many urban consumers willing to pay a premium for clean-label produce, a new wave of farm-fresh startups has emerged in recent years.

Online grocery shoppers tend to have a higher affinity for premium fruits and vegetables, as they are generally equated with better quality, said Pratik Gupta, who founded Pluckk in 2021.

“Even though the fresh category has been typically dominated by a stronger offline presence all these years, the advent of quick commerce has changed the game," he said.

Pluckk supplies gourmet meal kits and ozone-washed, non-GMO fresh fruits and vegetables to large quick and e-commerce retailers as well as offline stores.

Anant Goel, a former executive at Reliance Retail-backed Milkbasket, who founded Handpickd in April 2024, said many users are willing to wait a few extra hours for better produce, with a large part of this shift stemming from growing quality concerns

[TITLE]ESG vs. CSR vs. sustainability: What's the difference?:
[TEXT]
The terms environmental, social and governance and corporate social responsibility are being used more widely to describe how businesses can show their commitment to sustainability.

The terms have some overlapping meaning and are sometimes used interchangeably. But with tightening expectations on corporate practices and increasing concerns surrounding environmental sustainability, businesses should know what these terms mean, how they differ and where they overlap.

In recent years, environmental sustainability has become a top business focus, and for good reason. With growing fears

[TITLE]Carney-championed Net-Zero Banking Alliance shuts down after losing most of its members:
[TEXT]
Open this photo in gallery: Mark Carney makes a keynote address in London in 2020 ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26.

Almost exactly four years after Prime Minister Mark Carney convinced Canada’s largest financial institutions to join a global alliance committed to net-zero emissions related to their lending, the organization is shutting down.

The Net-Zero Banking Alliance, or NZBA, which Mr. Carney helped to establish in April, 2021, while serving as a United Nations special envoy on climate action and finance, ceased operations Friday after losing most of its membership. Political pressure from Republican lawmakers in the United States led the alliance’s largest American members to abandon the group in late 2024. All of Canada’s largest lenders also bailed earlier this year.

The Prime Minister’s Office did not respond to a request for comment.

Analysis: Canada’s industrial carbon pricing system is a mess. Here’s how Carney can fix it

When the alliance was first established ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union was the sole Canadian member of the group that included 63 financial institutions from 32 countries with US$40-trillion in assets. Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada jointly announced plans to join the group in October, 2021.

The alliance went on to publish more than a dozen reports that, according to its website, helped almost 150 banks around the world develop climate-related business strategies and set more than 500 sectoral net-zero targets.

After a widespread backlash to climate-related corporate initiatives that accelerated after the election victory of U.S. President Donald Trump in November, 2024, businesses started a mass exodus from environmentally focused groups.

The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, or NZAMI, the sister organization to the alliance for institutional investors that had more than 325 members managing a combined US$57.5-trillion in assets, also suspended operations in January after its largest member – BlackRock Inc. – decided to leave.

Shortly before leaving the alliance, the chief executives of RBC and BMO suggested it was no longer the best mechanism for financial institutions to pursue their climate goals.

“If our countries have an objective to get to a certain point, we will be part of that, and therefore pulling out of NZBA hypothetically doesn’t lead to non-commitment to net-zero climate change,” RBC chief executive Dave McKay said at a Jan. 8 conference, one week before the lender left the alliance.

“It just means that mechanism, that organization that fostered oversight and policies and rules around what you can and can’t do and how you report, maybe that is not the right mechanism to do it,” he said.

Speaking at the same conference, BMO chief executive Darryl White said the bank was still committed to climate transition, but added, “We also have a commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers, and we will not abandon that.”

“What mechanism you choose to join or bodies that you choose to align with to enforce that – that’s just a pathway,” Mr. White said. “The ultimate goal is unchanged.”

Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist at Greenpeace Canada, said the collapse of the alliance highlights the limits of relying on voluntary measures.

“While Mark Carney the central banker warned the world of the risk climate change posed to the financial system, Mark Carney the Prime Minister can protect our economy and environment by bringing in rules that force banks to take a longer term perspective and shift investment from fossil fuels to clean energy,” Mr. Stewart said in an e-mail.

[TITLE]What to buy and avoid at October Prime Day, per shopping experts:
[TEXT]

Black Friday in October?

Amazon’s highly anticipated fall sale event, Prime Big Deal Days, starts next week — running from Oct. 7 to 8 and bringing some of the best prices of the year on everything from tech to clothing to your favorite skincare.

The e-commerce behemoth often offers prices that rival Black Friday and Cyber Monday, meaning it’s smart to shop strategically. We suggest stocking up on year-round staples that won’t be significantly less (if at all) during the Thanksgiving-timed deals, and buying things that may be scarce in inventory by the time November rolls around. (Or, get ahead on your holiday gifting!)

Scroll on for our suggestions on how to get the most out of October Prime Day.

What to Buy During Prime Big Deal Days

Apple products

Apple

“I’ve waited to buy new AirPods in the past, since they always go on sale during Prime Day,” Page Six Style and Shopping Director Elana Fishman advises. (She’s not alone in coveting the Bluetooth ear buds, given everyone from Taylor Swift to Oprah has been snapped wearing various versions.)

Apple Watches, iPads and other top tech finds from the company have also been discounted during past Prime Days.

Closet staples

Hane's

These Hanes men’s polos are such a versatile layering option and wardrobe staple, and Prime Big Deal Days just might be the perfect time to stock up.

“There are a surprising number of great clothing brands on Amazon these days,” The Post’s VP of Commerce, Jackie Goldstein, said ahead of July’s Prime Day.

K-beauty buys

Medicube

Korean skincare is so popular, Amazon recently launched a dedicated K-beauty storefront. Medicube is consistently a bestseller at the retailer — and among Page Six readers.

Since summer is now in the rearview mirror, it’s a great time to add exfoliating acids — which brighten skin, but may cause sun sensitivity — to your skincare routine,

Hair tools

Dyson

From Kylie Jenner to Beyoncé, plenty of stars have used the famed Airwrap. The multi-use hair tool promises less damage — but given the price-tag, it is certainly best to keep an eye out for sales.

Everyday essentials

Hero Cosmetics

These are the kind of things you will stash in a closet and forget

[TITLE]Cannabidiol Market Size to Hit USD 27.57 Billion by 2032, says Coherent Market Insights:
[TEXT]
Burlingame, CA, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Cannabidiol Market is estimated to be valued at USD 9.46 Bn in 2025 and is expected to reach USD 27.57 Bn by 2032, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.5% from 2025 to 2032. The cannabidiol market is projected to experience steady growth during the forecast period, driven by rising R&D investments and the expanding legalization of medical cannabis across multiple regions. Increasing health awareness and broader acceptance of cannabidiol’s therapeutic benefits in managing diverse health conditions are further expected to boost global investment and market expansion.

Global Cannabidiol Market Key Takeaways

Hemp remains the most widely used source for cannabidiol production, with the target segment expected to account for 58.6% of the global cannabidiol market share in 2025.

Cannabidiol oil is projected to remain the top-selling product during the forecast period.

Cannabidiol consumption is expected to remain high in medical applications throughout the projection period.

North America is set to account for over two-fifths of the global cannabidiol industry share in 2025, making it the market leader.

Asia Pacific is poised to emerge as the most lucrative pocket for cannabidiol manufacturers over the forecast period.

Increasing Acceptance and Legalization Fueling Market Growth

Coherent Market Insights’ new cannabidiol market analysis outlines prominent factors driving industry growth. One such key growth factor is the increasing acceptance and legalization of cannabidiol (CBD).

Many nations are easing laws around hemp-derived cannabidiol. As of September 2025, nearly 50 countries have fully or partially legalized cannabis for medical and/or recreational use. For instance,

In December 2024, Japan changed its laws to allow the use of cannabis-derived drugs containing CBD.

In August 2024, Ukraine legalized medical cannabis, including CBD products, for patients with prescriptions.

This wave of legalization is increasing consumer access and demand for CBD products. It is creating a more stable market as well as encouraging businesses to enter the industry.

Government Restrictions and Limited Scientific Evidence Limiting Market Growth

The global cannabidiol market outlook appears promising, owing to expanding medical applications. However, government restrictions on CBD usage and limited scientific evidence might limit market growth to some extent during the forthcoming period.

Many countries are putting limits on cannabidiol (CBD) to stop misuse. For example, in June 2025, Italy introduced strict rules on CBD products. This may slow down cannabidiol market growth during the assessment period.
