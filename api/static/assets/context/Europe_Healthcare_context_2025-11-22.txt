[TITLE]ZIRCON-X Analysis: TLX250-CDx Impacts Clinical Decision Making for Almost Half of Patients with Indeterminate Renal Masses:
[TEXT]
MELBOURNE, Australia and INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, NASDAQ: TLX, “Telix”) today announces results from the ZIRCON-X study which finds that almost half of all patients imaged with TLX250-CDx (Zircaix®1, 89Zr-DFO-girentuximab) PET/CT2 would have undergone a change in clinical management, when compared with baseline standard of care (SOC) imaging. The data will be presented at the 26th Annual Meeting of the Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO) being held in Phoenix, AZ, December 2 – 5, 2025.

ZIRCON-X was a non-interventional, prospective, post-hoc study sponsored by Telix – using imaging data from Telix’s parent pivotal Phase 3 ZIRCON study3 – that assessed the impact of TLX250-CDx imaging on clinical decision-making versus SOC contrast-enhanced diagnostic imaging in 294 patients with indeterminate renal masses (IRMs)4. The study found that 143 patients (48.6%) would have undergone a change in clinical management if imaged with TLX250-CDx, and over 20% of these patients (31 out of 143) could have potentially avoided invasive biopsy5.

Of all evaluable patients, more than one third (110 out of 294, or 37.4%) would have had a major change in clinical management based on defined categories (see table below), with approximately 30% having their treatment escalated or de-escalated. A subset of 18 patients initially selected for active surveillance would have been escalated to immediate treatment5.

Most common major changes in clinical management5 n ​Biopsy to surgery (partial or total nephrectomy) 24 ​Surgery (partial or total nephrectomy) to biopsy 19 Additional diagnostic to surgery (partial or total nephrectomy) 18 Partial nephrectomy to total nephrectomy 8 Surgery (partial or radical nephrectomy) to additional diagnostic test 7 Total nephrectomy to partial nephrectomy 6

In patients whose planned surgery was changed, TLX250-CDx provided greater clarity on spatial localization of ccRCC within the kidney; thus allowing the physician to determine the most appropriate surgical procedure.

Professor Karolien Goffin, staff member of nuclear medicine at the University Hospital Leuven, Chair of the EANM Oncology & Theranostics Committee and a Principal Investigator on the ZIRCON and ZIRCON-X studies commented, “These are compelling results which demonstrate that TLX250-CDx PET/CT has significant potential to impact clinical decision making in the diagnostic work-up of patients presenting with small IRMs and give physicians greater confidence in clinical planning.”

Dr. David N. Cade, Group Chief Medical Officer at Telix, added, “This analysis is another demonstration of the potential clinical usefulness of TLX250-CDx, Telix’s breakthrough6 precision diagnostic candidate, which has recently been added to international guidelines for renal imaging7. These results indicate that TLX250-CDx may deliver on an unmet need for better non-invasive diagnostic work-up for ccRCC that can improve risk stratification and minimize overtreatment and undertreatment.”

[TITLE]Northwest Biotherapeutics Announces That Construction Activities Are Under Way For the First Grade C Manufacturing Suite in the Sawston, UK Facility:
[TEXT]
BETHESDA, Md., Nov. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Northwest Biotherapeutics (OTCQB:NWBO) (the "Company" or "NWBio"), a biotechnology company developing DCVax® personalized immune therapies for solid tumor cancers, announced that it has engaged a construction firm to carry out the construction of the first Grade C manufacturing suite in the Company's Sawston, UK facility, the construction firm is onsite and the construction activities have begun. The Company anticipates that the manufacturing capacity of the first Grade C suite will more than double the aggregate capacity of the existing Grade B manufacturing suites combined. As such, the Company considers the construction of the first Grade C suite a major step towards potential large scale-up of the Company's production of DCVax® products.

Manufacturing of medical products such as DCVax must be done in clean room facilities in sterile conditions. When manufacturing equipment and procedures involve steps open to the air, the manufacturing must take place in Grade B suites with special air handling and other requirements which are extremely expensive both to develop and to operate. In addition, only one patient's product may be made in a Grade B suite at a time, and the whole suite must stop activity and be specially cleaned in between manufacturing one patient's product and the next. The manufacturing of living cell products in general has traditionally had to be conducted in Grade B suites.

When a medical product is able to be manufactured using closed equipment and procedures that are not open to the air, the manufacturing can be conducted in Grade C manufacturing suites which are much less onerous and expensive to operate. In addition, multiple or numerous patient products may be manufactured simultaneously in a single Grade C manufacturing, and only certain equipment (not the whole suite) must be cleaned between production batches. These differences can enable a major increase in throughput and capacity, together with efficiency gains in both staff and materials.

As the Company has previously reported, the Flaskworks system is specially designed to carry out the key manufacturing processes for DCVax-L products on a closed basis. Developing this system was particularly challenging because the DCVax-L manufacturing process includes the dendritic cells adhering like barnacles to the flasks containing them, and then the mature activated cells being harvested by detaching them without damaging or destroying them. The Company views use of the Flaskworks closed system as key to enabling DCVax-L production to begin taking place in Grade C suites rather than Grade B suites – and the Company views such transition to Grade C suites as central to large scale-up of production.

The Company's business plan currently envisions manufacturing being established in the Grade C suite in the Sawston facility during Q2 of next year, with the construction of the Grade C suite taking approximately 6 months, followed by equipment installation and validation.

As previously reported, Advent worked closely with construction and engineering experts to develop a design and location within the Sawston facility that is expected to enable this first Grade C manufacturing suite to be constructed on a simplified basis at significantly lower construction costs and faster timeline. The project will also involve several million pounds of equipment costs. For example, as noted in the Company's recent 10-Q report, the cost to purchase certain fundamental equipment new is

Third Quarter 2025 Highlights, Recent Developments, and Upcoming Milestones

EscharEx®

Enrollment continues to advance in VALUE, a global Phase III study of EscharEx in venous leg ulcers (VLUs), targeting 216 patients across approximately 40 sites in the U.S. and Europe, the majority of which are already active. The co-primary endpoints are the incidence of complete debridement and the facilitation of wound closure. A pre-specified interim sample-size assessment is planned after 65% of patients complete treatment.

Following constructive FDA feedback aligning on trial design and development strategy, the Company expects to initiate its clinical trial in diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) in the second half of 2026.

An updated market access and pricing assessment conducted by an independent global consulting firm estimated a peak sales opportunity of approximately $831 million for EscharEx. The estimate reflects updated clinical data and modeled health-economic considerations.

NexoBrid®

U.S. adoption continues to expand, with Vericel reporting NexoBrid’s highest quarterly revenue since launch, up 38% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. Vericel reported broad utilization across more than 60 burn centers and plans to pursue a permanent CPT code, which would become effective in 2027.

Commissioning of the expanded NexoBrid manufacturing facility has been completed. The facility is expected to reach full operational readiness by year-end 2025, increasing production capacity sixfold to support growing global demand. Market availability remains subject to the completion of regulatory reviews.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved NexoBrid for use in Australia for both adult and pediatric burn patients, expanding approved markets to 45 countries worldwide.

Corporate Development

Raised $30 million in equity financing from healthcare-focused investors, providing capital to advance the Company’s development programs and commercialization initiatives.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights

Revenue for the third quarter of 2025 was $5.4 million, compared to $4.4 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by higher development service revenue, reflecting additional contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).

Gross profit was $0.9 million, or 16.5% of total revenue, compared to $0.7 million, or 15.5% of total revenue, in the prior-year period.

Research and development expenses were $3.5 million, compared to $2.5 million in the same period of 2024, driven by increased investment in the EscharEx VALUE Phase III trial and related clinical activities.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $4.0 million, compared to $3.2 million in the same period of 2024, primarily due to increased marketing authorization holder expenses.

Operating loss was $6.5 million, compared to $5.1 million for the same period in 2024.

Net loss was $2.7 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to a net loss of $10.3 million, or $0.98 per share, in the third quarter of 2024. The reduction in net loss was primarily driven by non-cash financial income from the revaluation of warrants in the third quarter of 2025, compared to non-cash financial expenses from the revaluation of warrants in the same quarter last year.

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA loss was $5.4 million, compared to a loss of $3.7 million in the prior-year quarter.

Year-to-Date 2025 Financial Highlights

Revenue for the first nine months of 2025 was $15.1 million, compared to $14.4 million in the same period of 2024.

Gross profit was $3.0 million, or 19.7% of total revenue, compared to $1.7 million, or 12.0% of total revenue, in the first nine months of 2024. The margin improvement primarily reflects a more favorable revenue mix.

Research and development expenses were $9.8 million, compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2024.

The call will be available via webcast by clicking HERE or on the Events & Presentations page of the Company’s website.

A replay of the call will be available on the Company’s website at www.mediwound.com .

Non-IFRS Financial Measures

To supplement consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS, the Company has provided a supplementary non-IFRS measure to consider in evaluating the Company’s performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, which it defines as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment, one-time expenses, restructuring and share-based compensation expenses.

Although Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with IFRS, we believe the non-IFRS financial measures we present provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results primarily because they exclude certain non-cash charges or items that we do not believe are reflective of our ongoing operating results when budgeting, planning and forecasting and determining compensation, and when assessing the performance of our business with our senior management. However, investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the Company’s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with IFRS. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with IFRS, it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The non-IFRS measures included in this

[TITLE]Eledon Reports Preliminary Data from First Six Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Treated with Tegoprubart as the Core Immunosuppressant Following Islet Transplantation in Investigator-Initiated Trial at U:
[TEXT]
IRVINE, Calif., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Eledon”) (NASDAQ: ELDN) today announced preliminary results from an investigator-initiated trial conducted at the University of Chicago Medicine’s Transplant Institute and presented at the Rachmiel Levine-Arthur Riggs Diabetes Research Symposium, held November 14-17, 2025 at City of Hope in Los Angeles, California.

The ongoing trial, which has been extended to include a total of 12 subjects, is evaluating tegoprubart, Eledon’s investigational anti-CD40 Ligand (anti-CD40L) antibody, as the core of a tacrolimus-free immunosuppression drug regimen for the prevention of islet transplant rejection in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The results, presented by Piotr Witkowski, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Pancreas and Islet Transplant Program at UChicago Medicine, provide updated preliminary data on the first six subjects in the trial, demonstrating the ability of tegoprubart to prevent the rejection of transplanted islet cells in the absence of calcineurin inhibition resulting in sustained insulin-free management of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) in patients with T1D.

All six transplanted subjects demonstrated marked improvements in glycemic control, achieving and maintaining insulin independence after one or two islet transplants, primarily depending on the subjects’ body mass and baseline daily insulin requirements. The first three participants were transplanted over a year ago and have remained insulin-free, including a patient who has maintained stable blood glucose control reflected by an HbA1c as low as 4.7%, for over 15 months without the use of exogenous insulin. Two subsequent subjects transplanted in July 2025 achieved insulin independence within approximately four weeks following a single islet transplantation and have maintained an HbA1c below 6% for over 3 months. A sixth subject, who was transplanted in early August 2025, recently underwent a second islet infusion and is now insulin free with an HbA1c of 5.3%. All six patients have been free of severe hypoglycemic episodes since their transplants. Tegoprubart was generally well tolerated, with no reported serious infections, no thromboembolic or rejection events, and no signs of the kidney or neurological toxicity often observed with traditional calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression.

“For years, clinicians have been working to find a new medication that can prevent rejection of islet cells while offering a better safety profile than calcineurin inhibitors including tacrolimus, which remain the current standard of care but are often associated with debilitating metabolic, neurologic, and cardiovascular toxicities,” said Dr. Witkowski. “These preliminary data in the first six subjects with T1D as part of our UChicago Medicine clinical trial are very encouraging, with all six subjects achieving insulin independence, and suggest that tegoprubart may be the innovative immunosuppression therapy we need to transform islet transplantation in the years ahead.”

“Breakthrough T1D continues to be encouraged by the data from the investigational use of tegoprubart as a novel immunosuppression alternative to advance islet transplantation,” said Esther Latres, Ph.D., Breakthrough T1D Senior Vice President, Research. “We look forward to continuing to support this promising research and to more data on tegoprubart in islet transplants in the future.”

This clinical trial is funded by Breakthrough T1D (formerly JDRF), with initial support from The Cure Alliance. Breakthrough T1D has also committed to fund a second study evaluating tegoprubart as part of a calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppression drug regimen to prevent islet transplant rejection in individuals with T1D and chronic kidney disease.
