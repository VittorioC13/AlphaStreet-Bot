[TITLE]Amazon will buy thousands of pedal-assist cargo vehicles from Rivian spinoff Also:
[TEXT]
Also, the micromobility startup spun out of Rivian, has landed a commercial deal with Amazon to supply the e-commerce company with thousands of its new pedal-assist cargo quad vehicles that are big enough to carry more than 400 pounds of packages and small enough to use a bike lane.

Under the multi-year collaboration, the two companies will work on customizing the pedal-assist vehicles to meet Amazon’s delivery needs in Europe and the United States. The TM-Q pedal-assist electric quads will launch in spring 2026, according to Also, which was revealed on Wednesday at an event in Oakland alongside the company’s new e-bike called the TM-B.

While Also is a new company, its executives already have a long-held relationship with Amazon. Rivian, the EV maker where Also was born, is backed by Amazon and has supplied the company with more than 25,000 of its electric delivery vans.

“We really understand how to work with each other,” Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe told TechCrunch ahead of the event, adding that everything they learned from the EDV van program was poured into this project. “This is where having Rivian as a large shareholder is very handy because we can do all this tight coordination through one fleet management portal that manages your large vehicles, like the EDV vans, and the Also products.”

The advantage is knowing exactly what Amazon needs, Scaringe added. “There’s no guesswork and Also has benefited from a lot of input from the Rivian team, which has been involved, because they’re so close to Amazon.”

Also started as a skunkworks within Rivian and spun out of the EV maker earlier this year with a new name and $105 million in funding from Eclipse. Also is a stand-alone company, but it has close ties with Rivian, which holds a minority stake. Scaringe will serve on its board, and Also will use — and already has — the automaker’s tech, retail presence, and economies of scale.

The TM-Q and Also’s TM-B e-bike share much of the same DNA, including the drivetrain, a pedal-by-wire system developed by Also. Even some of the physical elements, notably the handlebars and a built-in five-inch circular touchscreen that can be turned to lock and unlock the vehicle, are the same. That touchscreen unit, which displays navigation, media controls, fitness stats, and assist levels, syncs with the Also app to let users check their battery charge, download software updates, and manage security.

The vehicles also share the same battery technology, although the quad cargo vehicles have more power capacity. Instead of incorporating a large battery in the electric quad vehicles, Also has kept them portable and removable. Also president Chris Yu said the company is working on building battery dock stations so you can actually swap them.

Unlike its two-wheeled consumer sibling, the TM-Q will be tailored to commercial uses and includes software that handles logistics, delivery, and charging. The TM-Q’s diminutive stature and pedal-assist system make it ideal for delivering packages to customers who live in dense, urban areas, according to Emily Barber, Director of Amazon’s Global Fleet.

There is already an operational micromobility operation for Also quad cargo vehicles. Amazon has more than 70 micromobility hubs in cities across the U.S. and Europe, Barber said.

Amazon won’t be the only TM-Q customers, though. Yu said Also, noting how popular the quad design was within the company, won’t completely limit its quad cargo vehicles to commercial customers. The company also unveiled a consumer TM-Q that has the same underlying quad platform but lacks the delivery van topper. Instead, the vehicle has a bench system spacious enough to haul a few friends, kids, pets, or groceries.

And there may be other iterations in the future, Yu and Scaringe hinted.

SPRINGFIELD, Mo., Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (the “Company” or “O’Reilly”) (Nasdaq: ORLY), a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry, today announced record revenue and earnings for its third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for U.S. stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, and sales to Team Members, as well as sales from Leap Day for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Online sales for ship-to-home orders and pick-up-in-store orders for U.S. stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation. Comparable store sales increased 5.6% for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025, on top of 1.5% for the same period one year ago. Comparable store sales increased 4.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, on top of 2.4% for the same period one year ago.

During the first nine months of 2025, the Company repurchased 17.6 million shares of its common stock, at an average price per share of $90.95, for a total investment of $1.60 billion. Excise tax on shares repurchased, assessed at one percent of the fair market value of shares repurchased, was $16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter and through the date of this release, the Company repurchased an additional 0.8 million shares of its common stock, at an average price per share of $102.96, for a total investment of $79 million. The Company has repurchased a total of 1.46 billion shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through the date of this release, at an average price of $18.46, for a total aggregate investment of $26.93 billion. As of the date of this release, the Company had approximately $820 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.

Updated Full-Year 2025 Guidance

The table below outlines the Company’s updated guidance for selected full-year 2025 financial data:

For the Year Ending December 31, 2025 Net, new store openings 200 to 210 Comparable store sales 4.0% to 5.0% Total revenue $17.6 billion to $17.8 billion Gross profit as a percentage of sales 51.2% to 51.7% Operating income as a percentage of sales 19.2% to 19.7% Effective income tax rate 21.6% Diluted earnings per share(1) $2.90 to $3.00 Net cash provided by operating activities $2.6 billion to $3.0 billion Capital expenditures $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion Free cash flow(2) $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion

During the third quarter, the Company accelerated the payment timing of transferable renewable energy tax credits that were originally planned to settle in early 2026, resulting in a reduction to its full-year net cash provided by operating activities guidance to the updated range of $2.6 billion to $3.0 billion. The Company has also revised its expected full-year income tax rate from 22.3% to 21.6%, reflecting incremental benefits received from the accelerated payment.

(1) Weighted-average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, used in the denominator of this calculation, includes share repurchases made by the Company through the date of this release. (2) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The table below reconciles Free cash flow guidance to Net cash provided by operating activities guidance, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

For the Year Ending (in millions) December 31, 2025 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,625 to $ 3,035 Less: Capital expenditures 1,100 to 1,200 Excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments 25 to 35 Free cash flow $ 1,500 to $ 1,800

Non-GAAP Information

This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These items include adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, and rent (“EBITDAR”) and free cash flow. The Company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and free cash flow provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company’s core operations. The Company has included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure in the table above and the selected financial information below.

[TITLE]Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA): A Bull Case Theory:
[TEXT]
We came across a bullish thesis on Ulta Beauty, Inc. on X.com by wallstengine. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ULTA. Ulta Beauty, Inc.'s share was trading at $546.75 as of September 30th. ULTA’s trailing and forward P/E were 21.19 and 23.09 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Barclays has upgraded Ulta Beauty (ULTA) from Equal Weight to Overweight, raising its price target to $589 from $518, reflecting growing confidence in the company’s strategic direction under CEO Kecia Steelman, who took the helm in January 2025. Since her appointment, Ulta has implemented a series of rapid and decisive changes that have driven a return to sustainable positive comparable sales and margin expansion, signaling operational improvement across the business. Sequential quarter-over-quarter channel checks indicate a normalization in promotional activity, further supporting a stabilizing earnings trajectory.

The company is also optimizing its retail footprint by slowing the growth of its own-brand stores and planning not to renew the ULTA x Target partnership in August 2026, focusing on higher-margin, strategically positioned locations. Compared with peers, Ulta benefits from relatively low tariff exposure, particularly for goods sourced from Southeast Asia, which reduces cost volatility. Barclays highlights that FY25 guidance is initially conservative, leaving room for potential “beat and raise” quarters throughout the year, which could further drive upside.

Additionally, the broader beauty market, which peaked in 2022, appears to be stabilizing, now growing at a mid-single-digit annual rate, providing a supportive macro backdrop for Ulta’s growth. Overall, the combination of operational improvements, strategic retail optimization, resilient margins, and a recovering beauty industry creates a compelling investment case, suggesting significant upside potential for shareholders while reducing downside risk.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA) by @wallstengine in May 2025, which highlighted accelerating comp momentum, improving consumer engagement, and conservative FY25 guidance creating upside potential. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 34% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as ULTA’s fundamentals continue to improve. Wallstengine shares a similar perspective but emphasizes CEO Steelman’s strategic retail optimization and margin expansion.

Ulta Beauty, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 56 hedge fund portfolios held ULTA at the end of the second quarter which was 42 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of ULTA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]Wayfair to shutter Kentucky plant as part of logistics network revamp:

Listen to the article 1 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Wayfair plans to close a plant in Erlanger, Kentucky, in 2026 after deciding to not renew its lease, the retailer told Supply Chain Dive in an email.

The facility is set to close on or about Sept. 30, 2026, impacting 215 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice dated Oct. 15. Terminations will occur in phases, starting Jan. 1, 2026.

“This layoff will be permanent, and none of the affected employees are represented by a union and bumping rights (that is, the right to avoid termination by displacing another employee) do not exist,” according to the WARN notice.

The closure is the latest step in Wayfair’s ongoing effort to optimize its logistics network, per the email.

As part of its logistics overhaul, Wayfair this year expanded its CastleGate logistics service, which enables the company’s suppliers to fulfill orders for all customers. Through the “Multichannel” expansion, the offering provides an alternative third-party logistics service that caters to big and bulky home goods.

Further, Wayfair announced plans last year to begin offering a consolidated delivery option for business-to-consumer shipments to drive efficiency. The retailer has also worked to improve its data analytics capabilities to optimize last-mile delivery methods for orders and trim logistics costs.

CEO Commentary

“I am proud of our team’s efforts in delivering solid overall results in the fourth quarter, especially given the challenging operating environment,” said Michael Happe, President and Chief Executive Officer of Winnebago Industries. “We drove stronger revenue, improved profitability, gained share in key segments and delivered solid operating cash flow and an improved leverage position. Our performance clearly reflects the advantages of a diversified product portfolio, as strong momentum across our brands and product lines helped offset the operating margin pressure stemming from the ongoing turnaround of our Winnebago-branded businesses, which is proceeding positively."

“While industry conditions continue to reflect higher competitive discounts and allowances, we remain disciplined in how we manage production schedules and inventory levels,” Happe said. “Our focus on aligning our shipments with retail demand has positioned us well to support our dealer partners, maintain inventory health, and keep our brands strong in the eyes of consumers.

“We were delighted with the enthusiasm at September’s RV Open House, where we debuted a range of exciting new products across our three RV brands. We also showcased the tremendous progress being made via the refreshed Winnebago-branded RV lineup and the ongoing rollout of our Grand Design motorized strategy. The positive feedback from our dealers and the interest in our newest models showcase the hard work our product teams are putting into innovating for today’s outdoor recreation customers.”

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results

Net revenues were $777.3 million, an increase of 7.8% compared to $720.9 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024, primarily due to favorable product mix and targeted price increases, partially offset by higher discounts and allowances.

Gross profit was $99.2 million, an increase of 5.2% compared to $94.2 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. Gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points in the quarter to 12.8%, primarily due to costs associated with the transformation of the Winnebago-branded businesses, partially offset by targeted price increases.

Operating expenses were $79.1 million, a decrease of 29.5% compared to $112.0 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024, primarily due to prior year goodwill impairment and cost reduction initiatives in Fiscal 2025, which more than offset Winnebago Industries' investments in its Grand Design motorhome business. As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by 100 basis points to 9.5% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025 from 10.5% of net revenues in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024.

Operating income was $20.1 million compared to an operating loss of $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024, which included a previously disclosed $30.3 million goodwill impairment charge.

Net income was $13.7 million, compared to a net loss of $29.1 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. Reported net income per diluted share was $0.49, compared to a reported net loss per diluted share of $1.01 in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.71, an increase of 153.6% compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.28 in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $38.2 million, an increase of 33.1%, compared to $28.7 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024.

Full Year Fiscal 2025 Results

Net revenues were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 5.9% compared to $3.0 billion in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to a reduction in average selling price per unit related to product mix and lower unit volume, partially offset by targeted price increases.

Gross profit was $365.1 million, a decrease of 15.8% compared to $433.5 million in Fiscal 2024. Gross profit margin decreased 160 basis points year-over-year to 13.0% primarily due to deleverage and slightly higher warranty experience.

Operating expenses were $307.9 million, compared to $333.3 million in Fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the prior year goodwill impairment and cost reduction initiatives in the current year, partially offset by investments to support the growth of the Grand Design motorhome and Barletta marine businesses.

Operating income was $57.2 million, a decrease of 42.9% compared to $100.2 million in Fiscal 2024.

Net income was $25.7 million, compared to net income of $13.0 million in Fiscal 2024. Reported earnings per diluted share was $0.91, an increase of 106.8% compared to reported earnings per diluted share of $0.44 in Fiscal 2024. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.67, a decrease of 50.9% compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.40 in Fiscal 2024.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $121.9 million, a decrease of 36.0%, compared to $190.6 million in Fiscal 2024.

Business Outlook and Financial Guidance

For calendar year 2025, Winnebago Industries anticipates total North American RV wholesale shipments in the range of 320,000 to 340,000 units.

[TITLE]Northrim BanCorp Earns $27.1 Million, or $1.20 Per Diluted Share, in Third Quarter 2025:
[TEXT]
ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northrim BanCorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NRIM) (“Northrim” or the “Company”) today reported net income of $27.1 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $11.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2025, and $8.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in third quarter 2025 profitability as compared to the third quarter a year ago was primarily the result of the gain from the sale of certain assets by Pacific Wealth Advisors of $14.2 million, as well as an increase in net interest income, and higher purchased receivable income, which were partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes and higher other operating expenses. Net interest income increased over the same periods primarily due to higher earning asset balances, lower interest-bearing liability balances, higher yields on earning assets, and a lower cost of funds. Purchased receivable income increased primarily due to the Company’s acquisition of Sallyport Commercial Finance, LLC (“Sallyport or SCF”), which was completed on October 31, 2024. Sallyport and its direct and indirect subsidiaries provide services and products related to purchased receivable factoring and asset-based lending in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

The Company's Board of Directors approved a 4-for-1 forward stock split of its common stock that was effective after the close of business on September 22, 2025, for shareholders of record at the close of business on September 18, 2025 (the “Stock Split”). The Stock Split is part of the Company's ongoing review of optimal trading and spread levels. The intended purpose of the Stock Split is to enhance stock liquidity, make shares more accessible to a broader base of retail investors, and support increased trading activity. All per share ratios in this release have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the Stock Split.

Dividends per share in the third quarter of 2025 remained consistent with the first and second quarter of 2025 at $0.16 per share as compared to $0.155 per share in the third quarter of 2024.

“We achieved yet another quarter of record core earnings as loan yields continued to increase and deposit costs decreased. In addition, we recognized a $10.9 million after-tax gain from the sale of certain assets by Pacific Wealth Advisors where we have a minority interest,” said Mike Huston, Northrim’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Northrim’s Alaskan deposit market share increased by 187 basis points to 17.5% in 2025 and has increased by 531 basis points over the past five years. We are proud of this progress and believe these gains are the result of consistent investments in our people and banking infrastructure.”

Third Quarter 2025 Highlights:

Net interest income in the third quarter of 2025 increased 5% to $35.3 million compared to $33.6 million in the second quarter of 2025 and increased 23% compared to $28.8 million in the third quarter of 2024.

The Company sold $61 million in consumer mortgages in the second quarter of 2025 and $16 million in the third quarter of 2025 that were included in loans held for investment as of the end of 2024 to reduce the concentration of residential real estate loans and to provide additional liquidity for future commercial and construction loan growth.

Alaska Economic Update

(Note: sources for information included in this section are included on page 15.)

The Alaska Department of Labor (“DOL”) has reported Alaska’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in August of 2025 was 4.7% compared to the U.S. rate of 4.3%. The total of 355,900 payroll jobs in Alaska, not including uniformed military, increased 0.8% or 2,900 jobs between August of 2024 and August of 2025. This matched the year-over-year increase for the U.S. of 0.8% for the same period.

According to the DOL, the Oil and Gas sector had the largest growth rate in new jobs of 6% through August compared to the prior year, up 500 direct jobs. The Construction sector added 1,000 positions for a year-over-year growth rate of 4.8% in August of 2025. The Manufacturing sector, which is dominated by seafood processing, added 900 jobs and grew 5.7% in the same period. The larger Health Care sector also grew by 900 jobs for an annual growth rate of 2.1%. Transportation, Warehousing and Utilities added 300 jobs for a 1.1% growth rate. Professional and Business Services increased 200 jobs year-over-year through August of 2025, up 0.7%.

The Government sector declined by 100 jobs, or (0.1%). Government gained 200 State positions, while losing 100 Federal jobs and 200 Local government jobs in Alaska between August of 2024 and August of 2025. Other declining sectors include: Information down 300 jobs or (-6.8%); Leisure/Hospitality declined 100 jobs (-0.2%); Wholesale Trade lost 100 jobs (-1.5%) and Financial Activities, down 100 jobs (-0.9%).

Alaska’s seasonally adjusted personal income was $59.4 billion in the second quarter of 2025 according to the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis (“BEA”). Alaska had an annualized improvement of 9.7% in the first quarter and 5% in the second quarter of 2025. This is compared to the national average of 6.4% in the first quarter and 5.5% in second quarter of 2025. Alaska enjoyed an annual personal income improvement of 5.8% in 2024 compared to the U.S. increase of 5.6%. Per capita personal income in Alaska is now estimated at $80,208 according to the BEA, ranking it 12th highest of the 50 U.S. states.

Alaska’s Gross State Product (“GSP”) in the second quarter of 2025 reached $74.2 billion according to the BEA. Alaska’s inflation adjusted “real” GSP increased 1.5% in 2024, 1.8% annualized in the first quarter of 2025, and 2% in the second quarter of 2025. The average U.S. GDP growth rate was 2.8% for 2024, annualized -0.6% in the first quarter of 2025 and 3.8% in the second quarter of 2025. Alaska’s real GSP improvement in the second quarter of 2025 was led by the Mining, Oil & Gas sector; Transportation & Warehousing; Professional, Scientific & Technical Services; and Manufacturing, but was somewhat offset by decreases in Retail Trade and Government.

Alaska exported $5.9 billion in goods to foreign countries in 2024 according to the U.S. International Trade Administration. China is the largest importer of Alaska’s products at $1.5 billion, followed by Australia at $804 million, Japan at $674 million and South Korea at $634 million in 2024. Fish and related maritime products accounted for the largest volume at $2.1 billion, followed by minerals and ores $2 billion, and primary metals at $992 million in 2024. Oil & Gas international exports were $380 million because the majority of Alaska’s production is refined and consumed within the United States.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, for the U.S. increased 2.9% between August of 2024 and August of 2025. In Alaska, the rate of increase was lower at 2.4% for the same time period. The largest increases since last August came from Apparel (+6.9%), Food and beverage (+3.9%), and Housing (+3.8%). Slower increases or declining costs in Medical Care (+1.2%), Gasoline (+0.9%), Transportation (-1.2%) and Recreation (-1.7%) through August 2025 have helped moderate inflationary pressures in Alaska relative to the U.S.

The monthly average price of Alaska North Slope (“ANS”) crude oil has ranged between a high of $76.39 a barrel in January of 2025 and a low of $67.07 in May of 2025. The August 2025 average was $69.29. The Alaska Department of Revenue (“DOR”) calculated ANS crude oil production was 461 thousand barrels per day (“bpd”) in Alaska’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Production rose to 469 thousand bpd in fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. In the Spring 2025 Revenue Forecast published March 12, 2025, the DOR expects production to continue to grow to 663 thousand bpd, or 41% by fiscal year 2034. This is primarily a result of new production coming on-line in and around the NPR-A region west of Prudhoe Bay. A partnership between Santos and Repsol is constructing the new Pikka field and ConocoPhillips is developing the large new Willow field. There are also several smaller new fields in Alaska’s North Slope that are contributing to the State of Alaska’s production growth estimate.

The Alaska Permanent Fund is seeded annually by the oil wealth the State continues to save each year and has grown significantly over 40 years of successful investment. As of August 31, 2025 the fund’s value was $83.26 billion. According to the DOR it is scheduled to contribute $3.7 billion to Alaska’s General Fund in fiscal year 2025 for general government spending and over $600 million to pay the annual dividend of $1,000 in October to Alaskan residents.

According to the Alaska Multiple Listing Services, the average sales price of a single-family home in Anchorage rose 6.2% in 2024 to $510,015, following a 5.2% increase in 2023. This was the seventh consecutive year of price increases. Through September of 2025 prices continued to increase on average 3.7% to $529,097.

The average sales price for single family homes in the Matanuska Susitna Borough rose 3.8% in 2024 to $412,859, after increasing 4% in 2023. This continues a trend of average price increases for more than a decade in the region. Through September of 2025 prices continued to increase on average 6.7% to $440,366. These two markets represent where the vast majority of the Bank’s residential lending activity occurs.

The Alaska Multiple Listing Services reported a 3.4% increase in the number of units sold in Anchorage when comparing 2024 to 2023. The first nine months of 2025 saw a 4.7% increase in home sales compared to the same nine months of 2024 in Anchorage.

Last year there was virtually no change in the number of homes sold in the Matanuska Susitna Borough, with only four fewer homes sold in 2024 than in 2023 or -0.2%. In the first nine months of 2025 the number of units sold has increased by 133 sold or 11.1% in the Matanuska Susitna Borough compared to the first nine months of 2024.

(the "Bank") and its insurance, investments and equipment financing subsidiaries, announced net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 of $25.6 million, or $0.89 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $18.6 million, or $0.63 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Gross loans and leases increased $54.7 million, or 0.8%, from September 30, 2024, primarily due to increases in construction, commercial real estate, residential mortgage and home equity loans, partially offset by decreases in commercial loans and lease financings.

Deposits and Liquidity

Total deposits increased $635.5 million, or 9.7% (38.8% annualized), from June 30, 2025 and $458.9 million, or 6.8% (9.1% annualized), from December 31, 2024, primarily due to seasonal increases in public funds deposits and increases in commercial and brokered deposits, partially offset by a decrease in consumer deposits. Total deposits increased $364.0 million, or 5.3%, from September 30, 2024, primarily due to increases in public funds deposits and increases in commercial and brokered deposits, partially offset by a decrease in consumer deposits.

Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $1.4 billion and represented 19.3% of total deposits at September 30, 2025, compared to $1.5 billion representing 22.2% of total deposits at June 30, 2025. Unprotected deposits, which excludes insured, internal, and collateralized deposit accounts, totaled $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion at September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025, respectively.

As of September 30, 2025, the Corporation and its subsidiaries reported cash and cash equivalents totaling $816.7 million, which reflected the $662.2 million increase in interest-earning deposits with other banks in the third quarter, and had committed borrowing capacity of $3.6 billion, of which $1.8 billion was available.

The increase in net interest income for the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by higher average balances on loans and cash and cash equivalents and increased loan yields, as well as a reduction in our overall cost of funds. The increase in net interest income for the third quarter of 2025 compared to the second quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by the increased average balance and yields on cash and cash equivalents and increased loan yields, which outpaced a decline in average loan balances.

Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.17% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 3.20% for the second quarter of 2025 and 2.82% for the third quarter of 2024. Excess liquidity reduced net interest margin by approximately 16 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to approximately four basis points for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 and approximately nine basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the impact of excess liquidity, the net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, would have been 3.33% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to 3.24% for the second quarter of 2025 and 2.91% for the third quarter of 2024.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 was $21.9 million, an increase of $1.8 million, or 8.8%, from the comparable period in the prior year.

Other service fee income increased $601 thousand, or 33.1%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable period in the prior year. The three months ended September 30, 2025 included a $306 thousand valuation allowance recorded on mortgage servicing rights, compared to a $785 thousand valuation allowance recorded in the third quarter of 2024, each of which were driven by the decrease in interest rates during the respective periods and the impact on prepayments speed assumptions.

Investment advisory commission and fee income increased $352 thousand, or 6.6%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to new customer relationships and the appreciation of assets under management and supervision.

Service charges on deposit accounts increased $265 thousand, or 13.0%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in treasury management income.

Insurance commission and fee income increased $230 thousand, or 4.4%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in commercial line premiums.

Net gain on mortgage banking activities decreased $448 thousand, or 34.6%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreased salable volume.

Other income decreased $316 thousand, or 22.6%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease of $303 thousand in gains on sale of Small Business Administration loans.

Salaries, benefits and commissions increased $950 thousand, or 3.1%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to annual merit increases and an increase in incentive compensation due to increased profitability, partially offset by an increase in capitalized compensation driven by higher loan production.

Other expense increased $967 thousand, or 14.8%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable period in the prior year due to increases in the Pennsylvania bank shares tax expense and loan workout fees, primarily related to one commercial real estate loan relationship.

Professional fees increased $297 thousand, or 18.8%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in consultant fees for data integration resources.

Tax Provision

The effective income tax rate was 20.0% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared to an effective tax rate of 20.6% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was favorably impacted by proceeds of BOLI death benefits received in the period. Excluding the BOLI death benefits, the effective tax rate was 20.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2025.

Asset Quality and Provision for Credit Losses

Nonperforming assets totaled $52.1 million at September 30, 2025, $50.6 million at June 30, 2025, and $36.6 million at September 30, 2024.

New Delhi: Swiss packaged foods company Nestle SA highlighted India for the first time in its post-earnings call as a market with "strong performance and good momentum," amid unprecedented challenges the company is facing globally. Another European company with a strong presence in the country, Reckitt Benckiser , cited India "as a standout market but disrupted by goods and services tax (GST) changes."Nestle global CFO Anna Manz told analysts on the company's earnings call, "Outside of China, we've got some really good momentum and that's because of the investments that we've been making in those high priority investment areas. We're really seeing that show up across strong performance across India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan."Last week, the multinational's India unit, which makes Maggi noodles and Purina pet food, reported a 10.8% year-on-year increase in domestic quarterly sales to ₹5,411 crore, which it said was "its highest-ever quarterly sales led by broad-based volume growth." Nestle is among the first large FMCG companies to declare earnings for the September quarter, which saw the rollout of a revamped GST that led to a slash in levies on thousands of daily use products.Globally, for the first nine months of 2025, Nestle SA's sales fell 1.9% year-on-year to $82.8 billion. The company has seen the exit of chairman Paul Bulcke and the termination of two chief executives--Mark Schneider and Laurent Freixe--within one year. Nestle SA's new global chief Philipp Navratil announced 16,000 worldwide job cuts in the earnings announcement, describing it as a "hard but necessary" decision.On Wednesday, Reckitt Benckiser said the three-month period was a "sell-out" quarter in India but added that revenue growth was impacted by the GST change in September, resulting in a shift of trade orders to the fourth quarter.Emerging markets "had a standout performance, growing 15.5% in the quarter," said Kris Licht, chief executive of the British consumer healthcare firm that makes Dettol soap and Lysol disinfectant. "This reflects broad-based growth across all categories and continued strong in-market performance in India and China."The September quarter saw Reckitt report like-for-like net revenue growth of 7% across the group, led by emerging markets, which saw like-for-like net revenue growth up 15.5%.India posted low single-digit growth in the quarter for Reckitt, said CFO Shannon Eisenhardt. "We've talked about the impact in Q3 of GST phasing being low to mid-single digit and that our India like-for-like was low single digit in Q3," he said. "India's delivered high single-digit growth previously, and we expect this to simply be phasing. We expect India to continue contributing in that way going forward." Godrej Consumer Products and Dabur too have flagged short-term impact on sales and profitability in their September quarter updates, which they attributed to GST-related disruptions, citing the lag in new orders by trade for clearing existing stock and delayed pantry buying by consumers.Addressing an analyst query specific to emerging markets, Licht said: "We have a very successful business in India... delivering great performance now for a long time. We have a big opportunity to take the next tranche of markets to that level of excellence and execution, and that's a big focus at the moment in our emerging markets portfolio."

[TITLE]Textile Dyes Market to Reach US$15.58 Billion by 2033 | Astute Analytica:
[TEXT]
Chicago, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global textile dyes market was valued at US$ 9.31 billion in 2024 and is expected to US$ 15.58 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 5.89% during the forecast period 2023–2033.

The global textile dyes market is propelled by technological innovation, stringent regulations, and a seismic shift in consumer consciousness, the industry is moving towards a more sustainable and efficient future. Stakeholders are witnessing unprecedented changes, from the molecular level of dye chemistry to the geopolitical distribution of manufacturing power.

Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/tyextile-dyes-market

However, a wave of stringent international regulations is fundamentally reshaping industry practices. Governments and global bodies are mandating higher standards for environmental protection and consumer safety. For instance, India's 2024 regulations now actively prohibit the use of 112 specific azo- and benzidine-based dyes. In addition, the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) initiative's 2025 standards are pushing for the complete elimination of hazardous substances. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Water Act remains a pivotal regulation for American textile manufacturers in 2024. These measures are creating a new baseline for operational excellence for the textile dyes market.

Furthermore, compliance is becoming more technologically integrated and data-driven. The EU's 2025 Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) mandates a unique QR code for each product's Digital Product Passport. For 2025, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol will require dyehouses to report on two specific emission scopes. Concurrently, companies are being evaluated based on contributions to three UN Sustainable Development Goals: SDG 6, SDG 12, and SDG 13. A World Bank finding that over 70 toxic chemicals originate solely from textile dyeing underscores the urgency behind these global regulatory actions.

Evolving Consumer Ethics and Spending Habits Power Sustainable Dye Demand

Modern consumers in the textile dyes market are increasingly making purchasing decisions based on environmental and ethical considerations. A 2024 survey showed that 78 out of 100 consumers deem sustainability an important purchasing factor. Moreover, 55 out of 100 of those consumers indicated a willingness to pay more for eco-friendly brands. This trend is supported by significant spending power. Households in the European Union are projected to spend approximately 297.17 billion USD on clothing in 2024 alone. Such figures reveal a massive market receptive to sustainable products.

The considerable scale of consumer spending translates into powerful market-shaping forces. The average clothing expenditure in the EU for 2024 is 663.89 USD per person. Meanwhile, the U.S. textile industry stands as the second-largest exporter of textile-related products globally in 2024, reflecting robust demand. In the United Kingdom, the value of manufactured textiles is anticipated to exceed 8,130 million USD in 2024. A reported 12% increase in demand for naturally derived food additives in 2023 also signals a broader consumer shift towards natural ingredients, influencing the textile dyes market.

Key Players Vie for Dominance Through Strategic Mergers and Product Launches

The competitive landscape of the textile dyes market is intensely dynamic. Key players are making bold moves to capture market share, especially within the high-growth natural dyes segment. In February 2024, Birla Cellulose launched one innovative product, Intellicolor, to revolutionize dyeing. Following that, a major partnership between two companies, Archroma and Cotton Inc., was renewed in April 2024 to advance sustainable dye development.

Market Overview

The global yoga clothing market has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, evolving from a niche segment into a multi-billion dollar industry. The market's valuation increased substantially from USD 19,252.97 million in 2018 to USD 33,341.52 million in 2024, reflecting a period of intense consumer interest and brand investment. Looking ahead, the forecast period of 2025 to 2032 is poised for continued strong performance, with a projected CAGR of 8.23% leading to an estimated market size of USD 65,660.34 million by 2032. This growth is not merely a consequence of more people practicing yoga; it is intricately linked to the broader wellness movement and the "athleisure" phenomenon.

Modern consumers demand apparel that offers performance-enhancing features like moisture-wicking, four-way stretch, and breathability, without compromising on aesthetic appeal. Brands are responding with versatile collections that cater to both athletic pursuits and casual, everyday wear. For instance, the rise of remote work has further boosted demand for comfortable yet presentable clothing, with yoga pants and tops becoming staples in the work-from-home wardrobe. This convergence of fashion, fitness, and lifestyle continues to broaden the consumer base for yoga apparel far beyond dedicated yoga practitioners, solidifying its position as a significant and enduring category in the global apparel industry.

Key Growth Determinants

The proliferation of health and wellness consciousness on a global scale is the primary determinant of growth for the yoga clothing market. Consumers are increasingly proactive

[TITLE]Why the L’Oréal-Kering Tie-in Could Change the Playbook for Armani:
[TEXT]
Updated 3:24 p.m. ET Oct. 21

The playbook for Giorgio Armani could change now that L’Oréal has a blooming partnership with Kering.

As previously reported, news broke Sunday night that Kering Beauty is being sold to L’Oréal for 4 billion euros. Concurrently, Kering and L’Oréal are forming a long-term strategic partnership in beauty and wellness.

Might this partnership expand into fashion? Only time will tell. But it could make good sense when it comes to Armani.

Wills of the late designer Giorgio Armani, who died on Sept. 4 at age 91, opened the possibility of L’Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and EssilorLuxottica as potential buyers of his namesake company.

RELATED: L’Oréal’s Sales Growth Accelerated in Q3

L’Oréal and EssilorLuxottica are licensees for fragrance and beauty, and eyewear, respectively.

“I continue to expect L’Oréal and EssilorLuxottica as the most probable acquirors of their respective Armani businesses,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein. “With apparel and leather goods likely licensed to a third party long-term — same as Estée Lauder has done with Tom Ford.

“I wonder if in this context Kering could be the third-party licensee,” Solca continued. “Having said that, Kering is more likely to concentrate on getting its core business back on an even keel.”

Armani’s two wills, dated March 15 and April 5, were made public Sept. 12. After 12 months from their opening and within 18 months at the most, an initial 15 percent of his company could be sold to either L’Oréal, LVMH or Essilor Luxottica, they stipulate. Armani did not rule out other companies, as long as they are operating in the world of fashion and luxury, and of equal standing.

The same buyer would have the right to purchase a 30 percent to 54.9 percent stake in Armani between the third and fifth years, or in five years and within eight to consider a public listing in Italy as a priority or on other markets of equal standing.

Following even a potential listing, the Armani Foundation would keep a 30.1 percent stake of the group to ensure its control.

Regarding the Armani company, Nicolas Hieronimus, chief executive officer of L’Oréal, during a call Tuesday evening with analysts and journalists to discuss third-quarter and nine-months results reiterated sadness in the passing of Giorgio Armani, with whom the group collaborated for 40 years.

“We are very honored that in his success and in the instructions that he left with his heirs, L’Oréal is considered as a potential acquirer, at least of the first 15 percent,” Hieronimus said. “We said we would consider all the options. It’s a bit too soon. The family is mourning and focused also on driving this business.

“The only important thing that I can confirm today is that the deal we just did with Kering does not prevent us from considering any of the options that are on the table with Armani,” he continued. “So we will rediscuss it in the future.”

L’Oréal generally sticks with its core competency of beauty, but has ventured into fashion in the past — first with Lanvin, which it owned between 1994 and 2001, and more recently with Mugler, which became part of the French giant’s portfolio as part of the deal when it acquired the Mugler brands and Azzaro fragrances from Groupe Clarins in 2020.

Most recently, in early February, L’Oréal joined forces with Jacquemus, linking a long-term beauty license and taking a 10 percent stake in the fashion business.

Fashion and beauty are very different animals, even if they share some brand DNA, so it is considered unlikely L’Oréal would want to run Armani fashion itself.

No doubt, L’Oréal desires to keep the Armani fragrance and beauty license past 2050. That’s where the partnership with Kering could come in. And in the late ’90s, rumors swirled for years that Gucci wanted to buy Armani, although a deal never materialized.

The Armani fragrance and beauty license is a jewel in the crown of L’Oréal’s Luxe division, where it has been a “billionaire” brand since 2017. Blockbuster Armani products such as Sì fragrances and Maestro foundation have attracted A-list brand ambassadors like actress Cate Blanchett and Hanni, the lead singer of NewJeans, who helped transform Armani beauty into a sustainable, global powerhouse.

In March 2018, L’Oréal and Armani renewed that license until 2025, after having worked together since 1988. It was among Armani’s first licenses.

At the time of the renewal, Giorgio Armani said in a statement that “over the years our mutual trust has constantly generated excellent results.”

Kering, for its part, could merit from adding at least one more powerful fashion holding at this time when it’s struggling to turn around its star Gucci brand. Gucci has Demna as a new designer, which energized buyers with his debut display there at the recent Milan Fashion Week in September. But a turnaround at Gucci will take time.

Meanwhile, Kering’s newly appointed CEO Luca de Meo has sprung into action to revive the ailing company. The Kering Beauty announcement — coming just one month after his official arrival — was a surprise to the beauty and fashion industries. But financial analysts have lauded the move.

The Kering Beauty deal will be a windfall for Kering, whose net debt amounted to 9.5 billion euros on June 30. However, whether Kering would want to make a major acquisition like Armani remains to be seen.

HSBC cited 2024 filings that show Armani generated 2.3 billion euros in sales from fashion and

Amazon and Rivian are back together again.

The e-commerce giant is collaborating with Rivian’s Also spinoff on a custom-designed, pedal-assisted, four-wheel cargo bike. The bike would likely be based on the TM-Q quad vehicle that was unveiled by Also today in San Francisco. Amazon says it wants to expand its fleet of micromobility vehicles with “thousands of quads” that it will deploy across Europe and the US.

The deal signals the next phase in the partnership between Amazon and Rivian, which worked together on the EDV electric van for many years. For several years, Rivian’s van was exclusive to Amazon. But after that exclusivity ended, Rivian said it would sell the van to any commercial fleet owner who was interested.

“Micromobility solutions like pedal-assist e-cargo quads allow us to quickly deliver to customers in dense, urban cities, while helping reduce traffic and noise,” said Emily Barber, Director of Amazon’s Global Fleet, in a statement. “Similar to our Rivian EDV partnership, working with ALSO provides an opportunity to continue to innovate in this space, building on our delivery logistics experience, paired with their advanced technology, safety, and performance features.”

Amazon has been using electric cargo bikes for deliveries in cities across the US and Canada. The bikes are adapt at navigating dense cities where curb space is at a premium.

The Also TM-Q shares many of the same features as the TM-B two-wheeled e-bike, including pedal-by-wire technology and removable battery that doubles as a mobile power bank.

LOS ANGELES — Inside a historic aircraft hangar in Playa Vista, crowds of people gathered on Thursday to browse the latest fashions from handbags to clothing and shoes as they prepared for the holiday shopping season.

These weren’t shoppers or retailer buyers searching for the latest products. Instead, they were YouTube video creators who were being courted by brands from Lowe’s to Shark Beauty to encourage online audiences to buy their products.

Aaron Ramirez, a 22-year-old influencer who focuses on men’s fashion and lifestyle, stood in front of racks of carefully curated shelves of backpacks as he decided which items he would endorse for his 234,000 YouTube subscribers.

Black Friday 2025 isn’t just a shopping event — in our world, and the lives of pretty much every other American, it’s practically a competitive sport.

Picture this: a virtual colosseum where deal-hungry gladiators refresh Amazon carts with twitchy fingers, AI-powered shopping assistants whisper gift suggestions into Gen Z’s earbuds and the familiar buzz of “only 3 left in stock” triggers a primal adrenaline rush. In a year marked by overt economic anxiety and tighter budgets, Black Friday sales and Cyber Monday deals are expected to become even more aggressive —and more unpredictable — than ever.

Retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, Target and lululemon are already in a high-stakes game of early discounting, vying for attention from shoppers whose wallets are thinner and patience shorter.

“As we’ve seen shoppers shift to starting their shopping earlier, retailers have shifted to meet consumer timelines,” Ally Anderson, senior director of insights and strategy at LTK, exclusively shared with Post Wanted. “While Black Friday and Cyber Monday continue to be major shopping events for retailers and consumers, the holiday sales period has become much longer.”

Rather than being confined to just two days, retailers now start sales earlier and extend them longer. “Just within the past few years, October has now become the kickoff to holiday shopping with all the major retailers offering sales,” she added. This holds true with Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days that recently took the e-commerce space by storm.

When is Black Friday 2025?

Mark your calendars: Black Friday 2025 falls on Nov. 28, but blink and you might miss it. That’s because the best Black Friday deals are now racing each other to launch in early November (or even late October). Thanks to inflation-weary consumers and warnings
