AMD has sealed a $1 billion deal with the US Department of Energy to develop two supercomputers, Lux and Discovery, in collaboration with Oracle and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). Both supercomputers will live at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Lux is slated to come online fairly soon in early 2026, with Discovery following in 2029.

Both build on the work that went into the Frontier supercomputer, which is also housed at ORNL and was the fastest in the world until El Capitan came online last year at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. AMD also helped develop those supercomputers, so this isn’t its first time working with the US government on a project like this.

[TITLE]Qualcomm shares jump 11% as chip giant unveils new AI chips to rival Nvidia’s:
[TEXT]
Chip giant Qualcomm announced Monday that it will release two new artificial intelligence chips – setting the stage for a head-to-head race with billionaire Jensen Huang’s Nvidia.

It’s a major shift for Qualcomm, which has long focused on manufacturing semiconductors for wireless activity and mobile phones – not for the power-hungry data centers that are powering the AI boom.

Shares in Qualcomm jumped 11% Monday to close at $187.68.

Qualcomm — headed by Brazilian-born CEO Cristiano Amon — said its new, super-powered chips will be available in liquid-cooled server racks, which help customers like cloud service providers save on operational costs.

Nvidia and AMD also sell their graphics processing units, or GPUs, in full-rack systems. Large language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT rely on these powerful systems.

Still, Qualcomm is facing a steep uphill battle. Nvidia already dominates about 90% of the data center market and boasts a massive $4.6 trillion market cap.

Nvidia’s chips were used to train OpenAI’s ChatGPT, still widely viewed as the most popular AI chatbot.

But earlier this month, OpenAI broadened its supply chain. It announced plans to start buying chips from rival AMD, and even potentially take a stake in the company.

The AI race has shown no signs of slowing down. Nearly $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures will be spent on AI infrastructure through 2030, according to a McKinsey estimate.

[TITLE]Qualcomm Soars 20% After Unleashing AI Chip Attack on Nvidia:
[TEXT]
This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock exploded as much as 20% early Monday after the chipmaker revealed two new artificial intelligence accelerator chips aimed squarely at Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) core business. The AI200 will begin shipping next year, followed by the AI250 in 2027, and both will be offered as standalone units or plug-in cards for existing machines. For a company long synonymous with smartphone semiconductors, this could mark the start of a much larger play one that puts Qualcomm head-to-head with Nvidia in the battle for AI data center dominance.

Durga Malladi, Qualcomm's senior vice president, said the company's rich software stack and open ecosystem support could make it easier for enterprises to deploy and scale pre-trained AI models across its inference platforms. That framing lands Qualcomm squarely in the same conversation as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), both of which are racing to close the gap with Nvidia's powerful position in AI computing. The announcement triggered one of Qualcomm's strongest single-day rallies this year, as investors weighed the potential of its new chips to capture share in a market where supply shortages and surging demand have kept Nvidia in command.

The broader context is staggering: according to BlackRock Investment Institute, major hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft could collectively invest around $3 trillion by 2030 to build and operate AI data centers. That tide of spending has already drawn new entrants into the hardware race most recently, a multibillion-dollar partnership between OpenAI and AMD to power AI data centers using AMD chips. Qualcomm's entrance, timed as AI infrastructure spending accelerates worldwide, could signal a new phase in the semiconductor competition one defined by performance, efficiency, and the scale of capital willing to chase the next trillion-dollar opportunity.

Qualcomm is launching a pair of new AI chips in an attempt to challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the market. On Monday, Qualcomm announced plans to release its new AI200 chip next year, followed by the AI250 in 2027 — both of which are built on the company’s mobile neural processing technology.

The new chips are built for deploying AI models, rather than training them. The launch marks a notable change for Qualcomm, which has primarily made processors for mobile phones, laptops, tablets, and telecommunications equipment.

As reported by CNBC, Qualcomm’s AI-focused processors are based on the company’s Hexagon neural processing units that power AI features in its chips for mobile devices and laptops. CNBC reports that Qualcomm’s AI processors can work inside a rack with up to 72 chips functioning as a single computer, similar to Nvidia and AMD’s GPUs.

Qualcomm’s AI200 chip features 768GB of RAM, along with performance optimized for AI inference. Meanwhile, the AI250 will come with “a generational leap in efficiency” that the company claims will allow for “much lower power consumption.” Humain, the AI company that exists under Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, has already announced plans to use the AI200 and AI250 to power computing systems, building on a partnership to develop AI datacenters across Saudi Arabia.

[TITLE]Big relief for Vodafone Idea in AGR battle — a look at how the case unfolded:
[TEXT]
Vodafone Idea (Vi) Ltd received a significant reprieve on Monday after the Supreme Court allowed the government to address the telecom operator's grievances and reassess the demand for Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues without judicial intervention.

The ruling offers a much-needed breather to the financially strained company, which has long sought operational stability to stay afloat in India’s hyper-competitive telecom sector.

The Supreme Court also noted that the decision on any relief to the telecom operator is a policy matter. The government became a major shareholder in Vodafone Idea earlier this year, with a 49% stake through a debt-to-equity swap.

The case pertains to Vodafone Idea filing a petition last month challenging the Department of Telecommunications’ (DoT) demand for an additional ₹9,450 crore towards AGR dues.

Timeline of the AGR dispute — March 1999: The issue originated when the government launched the New Telecom Policy, under which a revenue-sharing model was also introduced, in which the telecom companies agreed to share a certain percentage of revenue with the government. The dispute arose from differing interpretations of AGR, with the DoT arguing it included all revenue, while companies contended it should only include core telecom revenues.

— October 2019: The Vodafone Idea AGR dispute dates back to October 2019, when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the DoT, leaving operators like Vodafone Idea burdened with massive liabilities. At the time, the DoT insisted that all revenue, including from the sale of assets and interest, should be included in AGR. Telecom companies argued that only income from core telecom services should be taxed, Mint reported earlier.

— July 2021: The apex court reaffirmed its stance that the dues determined and reported by the DoT were final and could not be re-assessed or self-assessed by the companies.

— October 2021: After intense pressure from the industry, the government amended the definition of AGR to exclude non-telecom income. This change brought major relief to the operators, though it did not apply retrospectively to the long-pending dues that sparked years of litigation, according to a report by Khaitan and Co.

— May 2025: Vodafone Idea filed a plea seeking relief from AGR liabilities. collectively amounting to over ₹80,000 crore, citing financial distress. Shortly after, the Supreme Court dismissed petitions by major telecom operators, including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and Tata Teleservices seeking waivers on interest, penalties, and interest on penalties related to AGR dues.

— September 2025: Vodafone Idea filed a petition on 8 September, in which the company contested DoT's demand for an additional ₹9,450 crore and sought a waiver of interest and penalties. The Supreme Court initially scheduled the hearing of the Vodafone Idea-AGR case for 19 September but later postponed it to September 26.

— October 2025: The hearing, which was scheduled for 26 September, was again postponed to 6 October and then to 13 October as the government requested for additional time. The SC on 13 October decided to adjourn Vodafone Idea's plea seeking a waiver from paying interest and penalties on its AGR dues demand raised by DoT. Finally, on 27 October, the SC allowed the Union government to reconsider and reassess the AGR dues demanded from Vodafone Idea, treating it as a policy matter under the government's domain.

How much does Vodafone Idea owe now? In 2020, the Supreme Court upheld DoT's calculations for dues until 2016-17, ruling out any scope for self-assessment or reassessment of dues. However, in its petition filed on 8 September, Vodafone Idea argued that DoT has now raised fresh demands for additional payments covering the period up to FY2018-19, Mint reported.

The company currently faces an additional demand of ₹9,450 crore in dues. According to the petition, Dot raised an additional demand of ₹2,774 crore from Idea Group and Vodafone Idea (post-merger in August 2018), whereas the demand against Vodafone Group (pre-merger) was ₹6,675 crore.
