[TITLE]BW Energy Makes Strategic Angola Entry with Chevron-Operated Block Deal:
[TEXT]
BW Energy has taken a major step into Angola’s offshore sector, striking a joint deal with Maurel & Prom (M&P) to acquire minority stakes in two producing deepwater blocks from Azule Energy, the Eni–BP joint venture that dominates much of the country’s upstream landscape.

Under the agreement, the consortium will purchase a combined 20% interest in Block 14 and 10% in the adjacent Block 14K. BW Energy’s net stake will be 10% in Block 14 and 5% in Block 14K, while M&P will hold the same. The transaction gives BW Energy an immediate producing foothold in Angola—one of Africa’s most established oil provinces—and positions the company for future operated developments in the region.

“Entry into Angola is a key step in BW Energy’s West Africa growth strategy,” CEO Carl K. Arnet said. “We see clear upsides beyond current production in Block 14 and the opportunity to develop stranded assets using existing infrastructure.”

Block 14, operated by Chevron, is a mature deepwater hub with nine producing fields and gross output of around 40,000 barrels per day. BW Energy’s share will total roughly 4,000 bpd. Block 14K, a cross-border tie-back between Angola and Congo, delivers an additional 2,000 bpd via existing facilities.

Net producing reserves for BW Energy are estimated at 9.3 million barrels, with scope for further recovery gains through additional infill drilling and development work. The licenses run until 2038, and decommissioning obligations are already provisioned.

The acquisition carries a base consideration of $97.5 million for BW Energy and the same for M&P, with each company paying a $6 million upfront deposit. Contingent payments of up to $57.5 million per party may be triggered if Brent crude exceeds set thresholds between 2026 and 2028 or if production milestones linked to the PKBB development are met.

Regulatory approval from Angola’s National Oil, Gas and Biofuels Agency (ANPG) is required, with closing expected by mid-2026.

For BW Energy—fresh off drilling progress in Namibia’s Kudu area—the deal marks another building block in a strategy focused on developing proven reserves and leveraging existing infrastructure in Africa’s mature basins.

[TITLE]Trump plans envision major U.S. investment in Russia, restoring oil flows to Europe, WSJ says:
[TEXT]
MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for peace in Ukraine includes proposals to restore Russian energy flows to Europe, major U.S. investment in Russian rare earths and energy, and tapping frozen Russian sovereign assets, the Wall Street Journal said.

The newspaper said the plans were detailed in appendices to peace proposals handed to European counterparts over recent weeks.

They include a plan for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap $200 billion of frozen Russian sovereign assets for projects in Ukraine, including a major new data center powered by the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces, the paper said.

U.S. companies would invest in Russian strategic sectors such as rare-earth extraction and oil drilling in the Arctic, while Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the world would be restored, it added.

The paper said one unidentified European official compared the proposed U.S.-Russian energy deals to an economic version of the 1945 Yalta conference.

At that meeting, the victors of World War Two, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, divided up their spheres of interest in Europe.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, formed of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies in deal for Namibia offshore oil field:
[TEXT]
TotalEnergies will join Portuguese firm Galp to operate Namibia's Mopane oil field, which could contain at least 10 billion barrels, according to estimates - Copyright GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP Andrew Harnik

TotalEnergies said Tuesday it had reached a deal to become a partner in the Mopane oil field off the coast of Namibia, where exploration remains underway.

The deal with Galp will see TotalEnergies joining the Portuguese firm as an operator as more exploration wells are drilled in view to develop the field for production.

“The transaction positions TotalEnergies as the operator of the two largest oil discoveries in Namibia and opens the way for the development of a major producing hub, generating long-term value for the country and partners,” the French firm said in a statement.

Galp said last year it estimated the Mopane field could contain at least 10 billion barrels of oil.

The deal will see TotalEnergies take a 40 percent stake in the petroleum exploration licence that includes Mopane. Galp will retain a 40 percent stake, alongside the Namibian national oil company Namcor and private firm Custos, which each hold 10 percent stakes.

In exchange, TotalEnergies will finance half of Galp’s capital expenditures for exploration and appraisal of the Mopane field, as well as initial development, with repayment to come from future cash flows from the project.

Galp will also get a 10 percent stake in the nearby Venus exploration zone, where TotalEnergies has discovered oil.

TotalEnergies said it hopes to make a final investment decision on whether to develop production at Venus next year.

TotalEnergies shares were up 0.4 percent in afternoon trading on the Paris stock exchange, where the blue-chip CAC 40 index was down 0.6 percent.

The government has notified the new Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, bringing into force a modern regulatory framework aimed at attracting investment and improving ease of doing business in the oil and gas sector.The rules, issued under the recently approved Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Act, 2025, replace the earlier system of multiple licences with a single petroleum lease covering exploration, development and production of all hydrocarbons, including shale, according to a gazette notification.The new framework provides lease tenures of up to 30 years, extendable for the full economic life of a field, with terms protected from adverse changes. Criminal penalties for violations have been removed and replaced with higher financial penalties of Rs 25 lakh, plus Rs 10 lakh per day for continuing breaches. The rules also allow lessees to share infrastructure to improve operational efficiency.Environmental provisions have mandated time-bound plans for zero gas flaring and reduced greenhouse emissions.Applications for petroleum leases must now be decided within 180 days, and disputes may be resolved through an expedited mechanism, including a neutral arbitration seat for foreign investors.The Oil Industry Safety Directorate has been designated as the competent authority for offshore safety, audits and standard-setting in exploration and production operations.Commenting on the move, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said, "In a landmark moment today, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, have been amended to offer ease of business and operations".With a broader spectrum of rights under one petroleum lease, the lessees will have the right to carry out all types of mineral oil operations under one petroleum lease, he said, adding that they may undertake decarbonisation and comprehensive energy projects at oilfields.Application for the grant of a petroleum lease will be decided within 180 days. Long-term leases of up to 30 years may be granted and may be extended up to the economic life of the field, allowing the lessee to make a planned investment decision.Lessees will make an annual declaration to the government of the installed, utilised and excess capacity of the infrastructure facilities owned by it, he said.The new rules permit lessees to jointly develop or share infrastructure facilities by mutual agreement.Seat of arbitration of lease and contractual disputes, where all lessees or contractors are companies incorporated in India, will be New Delhi. Where any member is a foreign company as defined in the Companies Act, a neutral seat of arbitration may be opted for.Rules require NOCs to promptly notify all existing and new discoveries, submit field development plans within prescribed time limits, obtain central government approval for development areas, and regularly report development and production activities. Vedanta Group chairman Anil Agarwal said, "Notifying the landmark reforms to India's oil and gas regulatory framework" is "a truly historic development"."The world has long recognised India's vast untapped hydrocarbon potential, and these new rules finally create the environment needed to unlock it," he said."India produces some of the most affordable oil and gas globally. These reforms will directly benefit consumers - especially the poorest - by enabling greater domestic production and reducing dependence on imports."He said this is the kind of bold, inclusive policy that transformed the United States from a major importer into an energy surplus nation."I never imagined I would witness such a reform in my lifetime. Our energy security is both our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity. With these changes, I am confident that India can produce at least 50 per cent of its energy domestically."

[TITLE]Atlantica Closes the Acquisition of Statkraft's Renewable Energy Platform in Canada:
[TEXT]
December 10, 2025 – Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure today announced it completed the previously announced acquisition of a Canadian renewable energy platform, marking an important milestone in the Company’s growth strategy in North America.

The platform includes 236 MW in operation and a 0.6 GW pipeline of renewable and storage projects and a small team of experienced employees who have joined Atlantica. This acquisition expands Atlantica’s presence in the Canadian market and strengthens its position in the broader North American renewables sector.

The operating portfolio includes a 51% stake in l’Érable, a 100 MW wind facility in Quebec, in operation since 2013, and a 136 MW wind asset in Alberta that began operations in early 2025. Both assets are backed by long-term PPAs with investment-grade counterparties, with an average remaining contract life of approximately 13 years. The platform also adds approximately 0.6 GW of solar, wind, and storage projects under development across several Canadian provinces, further strengthening Atlantica’s position in Canada.

In addition, Atlantica successfully closed the project financing of Winnifred with National Bank of Canada.

Santiago Seage, Atlantica’s CEO, said: “This transaction is a key step in our North American growth strategy. We are pleased to welcome the new team members to Atlantica. The integration of this experienced local team will complement our existing Canadian operations and enhance our capabilities to capture future growth opportunities across the region”. Santiago added: “This acquisition significantly expands our presence in a core market with attractive growth prospects.”

Atlantica previously announced in August 2025 that it had signed an agreement to acquire this platform. Following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the transaction has now successfully closed.

About Atlantica

Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure Ltd. is a sustainable infrastructure company that owns a diversified portfolio of contracted renewable energy, storage, efficient natural gas, electric transmission, and water assets in North America, Europe, and South America (www.atlantica.com).

[TITLE]Corporate America is scrambling to hire energy traders as the AI boom pressures electricity costs:
[TEXT]
As the race for AI development booms, demand for power has soared and is expected to grow in the US at a rate five to 10 times faster over the next 10 years than in the previous decade. That demand, in turn, is set to make electricity more expensive, and more difficult, to acquire.

To help stave off a shortfall and manage their exposure to a fluctuating market, major US companies are rushing to get into the increasingly complex business of energy trading.

Some of Big Tech's largest players have entered the arena, with Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) all receiving licenses by the Federal Energy Regulatory Council to buy and sell wholesale power contracts as they seek to manage their intense energy needs.

But it's not just tech anymore. In late November, the Walt Disney Company (DIS) posted a job listing for an energy trader to purchase and schedule power.

A Walt Disney World entrance arch gate in Orlando, Fla., on Feb. 9, 2022. · JHVEPhoto via Getty Images

"For a company that's either a big source of power demand or power supply, you have risk, you have power market vulnerability," Rob Gramlich, the director of energy consultancy Grid Strategies, said. "A [trading] function is really a way to mitigate your risk."

Contract terms that a company might strike with a utility company were looser when demand was lower. But as the market has tightened, utilities have locked down their exposures and are implementing new policies, such as requiring the company purchasing electricity to agree to certain quantities regardless of how much they'll actually use.

Say a tech giant building a data center estimates it will use 2 gigawatts of power. The local utility might agree to provide that power, but only if the tech company pays for 1.5 GW up front. If its actual needs end up being only 1 GW, the company is paying for an extra 500 megawatts of power it doesn't need.

Instead of having to eat the loss, an energy trader employed at this firm could go to the open market and sell that power to another buyer, covering the cost.

The average price for electricity in the US in September was 7% higher than a year prior, according to the most recent available data from the Energy Information Administration, which releases electricity numbers on a two-month delay. The price of natural gas (NG=F), one of the key input metrics for electricity cost, has also been on a tear, up more than 60% since the same time last year.

With prices rising so quickly, companies that consume a large amount of power, like Microsoft or Disney, have a strong incentive to sign long-term contracts locking in a stable, market-insensitive price for their electricity.

[TITLE]How data centers are driving up the cost of electricity — and what grid operators can do:
[TEXT]
Consumers see data centers as the energy-hungry culprits behind rising energy prices. Utilities see data centers as large customers who could help finance grid upgrades. As the data center boom irrevocably alters the regional electricity market, regulators have been left to sort out who pays to keep the power flowing.

[TITLE]GREG BLACKIE: Green New Scam Causing America’s Energy Crisis:
[TEXT]
Our country is facing an energy crisis. No, not because of new demand from data centers or AI. Instead, it’s because utilities in nearly every state, due to government imposed “renewable” mandates, self-imposed mandates, and the supercharging of the Green New Scam under the so-called “Inflation Reduction Act,” have been shutting down vital coal resources and building out almost exclusively intermittent and costly resources like solar, wind, and battery storage.

President Donald Trump understands this, and that is why on day one of his administration he declared an Energy Emergency. Then, a few months later, the President signed a trio of Executive Orders designed to keep our “beautiful, clean coal” burning and providing the reliable, baseload, and affordable electricity Americans have benefitted from for generations.

Those orders have been used to keep coal generation online that was slated to shut down in Michigan and will potentially keep two units operating that were scheduled to shut down in Colorado this December. In Arizona, however, the Cholla Power Plant in Navajo County was shuttered by the utility just weeks after Trump explicitly called out the plant for saving in a press conference.

Unlike states with green mandates, Arizona essentially has none. Instead, our utilities, like many around the country, have self-imposed commitments to go “Net Zero” by 2050. To meet that target, they have planned to shut down all coal generation in the state by 2032 and plan to build out almost exclusively solar, wind, and battery storage to meet an expected explosive growth in demand, at a cost of tens of billions of dollars. So it is no surprise that like much of the rest of the country, Arizona is facing an energy crisis. (RELATED: Democrats Run Away From ‘Green New Deal’ After Peddling Radical Plan For Years)

Taking a look at our largest regulated utilities (APS, TEP, and UNS) and the largest nonprofit utility, SRP, future plans paint an alarming picture. Combined, over the next 15 years, these utilities expect to see demand increase from 19,200 MW to 28,000 MW. For reference, 1,000 MW of electricity is enough to power roughly 250,000 homes. To meet that growth in demand, however, Arizonans will only get a net increase of 989 MW of reliable generation (coal, natural gas, and nuclear) compared to 22,543 MW (or nearly 23 times as much) of intermittent solar, wind, and battery storage.

One theme is becoming prevalent as the new year approaches: The technology giants that have been shouldering this bull market will no longer be running the show.Wall Street strategists at firms including Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley are advising clients to buy less popular pockets of the market, placing sectors like health care, industrials and energy at the top of their shopping lists for 2026 over the Magnificent Seven cohort that includes Nvidia Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.For years, investing in Big Tech firms has been a no-brainer, given their stalwart balance sheets and fat profits. Now, there’s increasing scepticism over whether the sector, which has surged some 300% since the bull market began three years ago, can keep justifying its lofty valuations and ambitious spending on artificial intelligence technology. Earnings readouts from AI bellwethers Oracle Corp. and Broadcom Inc. that failed to meet lofty expectations amplified those concerns this week.Worries around the red-hot trade come amid rising optimism over the broader US economy in the new year. The setup may push investors to pile into the lagging groups in the S&P 500 at the cost of megacap tech.“I’m hearing
