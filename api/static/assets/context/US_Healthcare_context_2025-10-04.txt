[TITLE]FDA Approves New Generic Version of Abortion Drug Mifepristone:
[TEXT]
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new generic version of the abortion pill on Tuesday, prompting outrage from conservatives and the pro-life movement.

The FDA’s approval of a generic form of mifepristone — the first drug used in a two-drug medication abortion regimen — comes as the agency, under the direction of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is performing a safety review of the drug following a shocking study suggesting a much higher complication rate than previously reported.

The FDA specifically approved a generic form of the abortion pill produced by Evita Solutions LLC, a company that says its mission is to “normalize abortion” and make it “accessible to all.” In the FDA’s letter to Evita Solutions LLC, the agency said it concluded the drug is “bioequivalent and therapeutically equivalent” to the brand name mifepristone drug Mifeprex, which is made by Danco Laboratories, and has therefore met the requirements for approval.

[TITLE]Are for-profits, private equity to blame for rising medical costs, reduced quality, choice? — Harvard Gazette:
[TEXT]
For-profits, private equity can boost innovation, growth, care, according to co-author of new paper. But gains need to be aligned with patient outcomes.

Frustrated by the relentless rise in healthcare costs, many Americans think they know who’s to blame for the high cost of prescription drugs, the shuttering of local hospitals and clinics, and the merger of their favorite doctor’s medical practice with a competitor: for-profit corporations and private equity firms.

This growing trend in the U.S. is known as corporatization. Investors supply much-needed funding to pharmaceutical and biomedical companies, healthcare institutions, and physicians to help pay for drug development, meet escalating expenses, and increase efficiency and scale. But too often, critics say, the push for profit ends up leaving patients with reduced quality and choice, and ever-surging costs.

In a new paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, co-author Amitabh Chandra argues private investment in the healthcare system fills a critical need that others, like the federal government and nonprofits, simply cannot.

In this edited conversation, Chandra, who is director of the Malcolm Wiener Center for Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School and the Henry and Allison McCance Family Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, said contrary to popular opinion, profit-seeking in healthcare doesn’t necessarily mean that patients will be worse off.

What is corporatization?

Corporatization is essentially a deal between a medical organization and investors. The organization receives capital that can be used for new technologies, upgraded facilities, research, or competitive salaries.

In return, investors expect a share of the profits. The share might be small or large — 1 percent, 10 percent, or even 50 percent — depending on the terms of the agreement. At its core, corporatization “unlocks” money for growth, but it does so in a way that prioritizes profits, since investors can always move their funds elsewhere if returns are lacking

You say private investment in healthcare isn’t necessarily bad. What are some of the benefits besides an infusion of cash?

The deal between an investor and a medical organization is voluntary, so it clearly benefits those two parties. But the real question is whether it benefits society — and that’s not always obvious.

The key measure is what happens to patient outcomes when corporatization occurs. In some areas, such as nursing homes, the record is poor. Here, some private equity firm owners may cut staffing and reduce quality to boost profits, which has been linked to higher patient mortality.

“The key measure is what happens to patient outcomes when corporatization occurs.”

But in other areas, corporatization has delivered real benefits. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is one example. Because IVF is capital-intensive, larger corporate networks can use scale, data, and investment in technology to improve success rates. Patients benefit because quality is measurable (pregnancy rates), and clinics compete directly on outcomes and price.

Similarly, in the biopharmaceutical industry, private investment has been indispensable for funding the huge costs of drug development, enabling the creation of treatments that otherwise wouldn’t exist.

So, the benefits of corporatization beyond just “more money” depend on whether the investment is used to expand scale, improve processes, or foster innovation in ways that actually improve patient outcomes.

Because healthcare and scientific R&D are so expensive, isn’t tension between market incentives and health outcomes, between patients and profits, inevitable?

I don’t think so. The “inevitable tension” view assumes that anytime profits are involved, patients’ well-being is compromised. But imagine a world without profits — would patients automatically be better off? The answer is no.

Much of healthcare depends on improving quality and driving innovation: treating a heart attack patient better this year than last, developing new medicines, or adopting better technologies. All of that requires capital, and profits are what attract that capital.

It’s true that people worry — often rightly —

Key Factors Driving the Growth of the Graves' Orbitopathy Market

Rising Graves' Orbitopathy Prevalence

According to DelveInsight analysis, there were approximately 1.4 million diagnosed prevalent cases of Graves' orbitopathy in the 7MM in 2024, with the number projected to rise by 2034. In 2024, the US reported that the highest cases were mild, followed by moderate-to-severe cases, and sight-threatening cases of Graves' orbitopathy, and these numbers are anticipated to rise throughout the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. The disproportionately higher prevalence of early-stage cases across all categories underscores the impact of increased disease awareness, earlier symptom recognition, and advancements in diagnostic tools.

Role of Standardized Diagnostic Tools

Enhanced awareness and standardized tools like VISA and EUGOGO aid early Graves' orbitopathy diagnosis, enabling timely interventions to prevent severe progression.

TEPEZZA: Only Approved TED Drug

With TEPEZZA as the only approved therapy, there is a significant market opportunity for new treatments targeting underlying mechanisms like autoimmunity and offering novel routes of administration in Graves' orbitopathy.

Graves' Orbitopathy Competitive Landscape

The Graves' orbitopathy clinical trial landscape is highly competitive, with late-stage candidates such as Viridian Therapeutics/Kissei Pharmaceutical's Veligrotug (VRDN-001), VRDN-003, argenx's efgartigimod PH20 SC, Immunovant Sciences/HanAll Biopharma/Samsung Biologics's batoclimab, Sling Therapeutics' Linsitinib, Tourmaline Bio's Pacibekitug, and others, showing promise as disease-modifying, steroid-sparing therapies to improve outcomes in moderate-to-severe TED.

Graves' Orbitopathy Market Analysis

Graves' orbitopathy currently has few treatment options, with Amgen'sTEPEZZA (teprotumumab-trbw) being the only therapy formally approved. The disease's complex autoimmune processes and varied clinical manifestations make the development of targeted, disease-modifying treatments particularly difficult, resulting in a significant unmet medical need.

Available pharmacological interventions include glucocorticoids, mycophenolate, rituximab, tocilizumab, teprotumumab, and cyclosporine/mTOR inhibitors. Oral prednisone is commonly used, while higher doses or intravenous administration are typically reserved for cases involving optic nerve compression.

Emerging therapies such as Efgartigimod PH20 SC and Batoclimab (IMVT-1401; RVT-1401) target FcRn to reduce pathogenic IgG autoantibodies in thyroid eye disease. Efgartigimod is a subcutaneous antibody fragment designed for optimized absorption, whereas Batoclimab is a subcutaneous monoclonal antibody developed for multiple IgG-mediated autoimmune disorders. IGF-1R inhibitors, including Veligrotug (VRDN-001) and VRDN-003, decrease proptosis and orbital inflammation, with VRDN-003 providing an extended half-life and flexible dosing. Collectively, these therapies offer complementary, targeted strategies with unique mechanisms and pharmacokinetic profiles to enhance patient outcomes.

Graves' Orbitopathy Competitive Landscape

The Graves' orbitopathy treatment landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with multiple promising candidates advancing through various stages of development. Key investigational therapies include Viridian Therapeutics/Kissei Pharmaceutical's Veligrotug (VRDN-001) and VRDN-003, argenx's Efgartigimod PH20 SC, Immunovant Sciences/HanAll Biopharma/Samsung Biologics' Batoclimab (IMVT-1401), and others.

Viridian's lead intravenous (IV) monoclonal antibody candidate, Veligrotug (VRDN-001), is being developed as a potential best-in-class therapy for thyroid eye disease (TED). Clinical data through Week 6 demonstrate strong efficacy and good tolerability, though no direct comparisons with the approved anti-IGF-1R antibody have been conducted. Veligrotug is being studied in two global Phase III trials: THRIVE (NCT05176639) for active TED and THRIVE-2 (NCT06021054) for chronic TED. Long-term results from THRIVE show that 70% of patients maintained a proptosis response at Week 52. Regulatory filings include a planned US BLA submission in 2H 2025 and an anticipated EU MAA submission in 1H 2026, with a US launch targeted for 2H 2026. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in May 2025 due to the rapid response to proptosis and durable improvement in diplopia, making veligrotug eligible for Priority Review.

Viridian's VRDN-003 is a potential best-in-class subcutaneous (SC) monoclonal antibody targeting IGF-1R. It shares the same binding domain as veligrotug (VRDN-001). Still, it has been engineered for a longer half-life, aiming to maintain IV veligrotug's clinical efficacy while offering improved patient convenience and potentially better safety through SC administration. Viridian began two global Phase III trials in August 2024: REVEAL-1 for active TED and REVEAL-2 for chronic TED. Topline results from both studies are expected in the first half of 2026, with a BLA submission targeted for the end of 2026 and a potential launch for both active and chronic TED in 2027.

argenx's Efgartigimod PH20 SC is a fully human antibody fragment designed to inhibit FcRn, reducing pathogenic IgG autoantibodies implicated in autoimmune diseases, including TED. It is currently in Phase III proof-of-concept trials, with topline results expected in 2H 2026. The subcutaneous PH20 formulation improves drug absorption and patient convenience.

Immunovant Sciences' Batoclimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets FcRn, reducing IgG antibody levels. Elevated IgG antibodies drive many autoimmune diseases, and batoclimab is being developed as a self-administered SC injection. Phase III data for TED are anticipated in 2H 2025, with additional indications under investigation.

The anticipated launch of these emerging therapies are poised to transform the Graves' orbitopathy market landscape in the coming years. As these cutting-edge therapies continue to mature and gain regulatory approval, they are expected to reshape the Graves' orbitopathy market landscape, offering new standards of care and unlocking opportunities for medical innovation and economic growth.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new generic version of the abortion pill on Tuesday, prompting outrage from conservatives and the pro-life movement.

The FDA’s approval of a generic form of mifepristone — the first drug used in a two-drug medication abortion regimen — comes as the agency, under the direction of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is performing a safety review of the drug following a shocking study suggesting a much higher complication rate than previously reported.

The FDA specifically approved a generic form of the abortion pill produced by Evita Solutions LLC, a company that says its mission is to “normalize abortion” and make it “accessible to all.” In the FDA’s letter to Evita Solutions LLC, the agency said it concluded the drug is “bioequivalent and therapeutically equivalent” to the brand name mifepristone drug Mifeprex, which is made by Danco Laboratories, and has therefore met the requirements for approval.

[TITLE]Are for-profits, private equity to blame for rising medical costs, reduced quality, choice? — Harvard Gazette:
[TEXT]
For-profits, private equity can boost innovation, growth, care, according to co-author of new paper. But gains need to be aligned with patient outcomes.

Frustrated by the relentless rise in healthcare costs, many Americans think they know who’s to blame for the high cost of prescription drugs, the shuttering of local hospitals and clinics, and the merger of their favorite doctor’s medical practice with a competitor: for-profit corporations and private equity firms.

This growing trend in the U.S. is known as corporatization. Investors supply much-needed funding to pharmaceutical and biomedical companies, healthcare institutions, and physicians to help pay for drug development, meet escalating expenses, and increase efficiency and scale. But too often, critics say, the push for profit ends up leaving patients with reduced quality and choice, and ever-surging costs.

In a new paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, co-author Amitabh Chandra argues private investment in the healthcare system fills a critical need that others, like the federal government and nonprofits, simply cannot.

In this edited conversation, Chandra, who is director of the Malcolm Wiener Center for Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School and the Henry and Allison McCance Family Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, said contrary to popular opinion, profit-seeking in healthcare doesn’t necessarily mean that patients will be worse off.

What is corporatization?

Corporatization is essentially a deal between a medical organization and investors. The organization receives capital that can be used for new technologies, upgraded facilities, research, or competitive salaries.

In return, investors expect a share of the profits. The share might be small or large — 1 percent, 10 percent, or even 50 percent — depending on the terms of the agreement. At its core, corporatization “unlocks” money for growth, but it does so in a way that prioritizes profits, since investors can always move their funds elsewhere if returns are lacking

You say private investment in healthcare isn’t necessarily bad. What are some of the benefits besides an infusion of cash?

The deal between an investor and a medical organization is voluntary, so it clearly benefits those two parties. But the real question is whether it benefits society — and that’s not always obvious.

The key measure is what happens to patient outcomes when corporatization occurs. In some areas, such as nursing homes, the record is poor. Here, some private equity firm owners may cut staffing and reduce quality to boost profits, which has been linked to higher patient mortality.

“The key measure is what happens to patient outcomes when corporatization occurs.”

But in other areas, corporatization has delivered real benefits. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is one example. Because IVF is capital-intensive, larger corporate networks can use scale, data, and investment in technology to improve success rates. Patients benefit because quality is measurable (pregnancy rates), and clinics compete directly on outcomes and price.

Similarly, in the biopharmaceutical industry, private investment has been indispensable for funding the huge costs of drug development, enabling the creation of treatments that otherwise wouldn’t exist.

So, the benefits of corporatization beyond just “more money” depend on whether the investment is used to expand scale, improve processes, or foster innovation in ways that actually improve patient outcomes.

Because healthcare and scientific R&D are so expensive, isn’t tension between market incentives and health outcomes, between patients and profits, inevitable?

I don’t think so. The “inevitable tension” view assumes that anytime profits are involved, patients’ well-being is compromised. But imagine a world without profits — would patients automatically be better off? The answer is no.

Much of healthcare depends on improving quality and driving innovation: treating a heart attack patient better this year than last, developing new medicines, or adopting better technologies. All of that requires capital, and profits are what attract that capital.

It’s true that people worry — often rightly —
