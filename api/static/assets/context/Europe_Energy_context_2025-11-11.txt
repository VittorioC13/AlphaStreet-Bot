[TITLE]The energy chessboard of Europe moves to Athens: Today the Summit with American and European ministers – The deals for LNG:
[TEXT]
Marianna Tzanne November 6 08:54

The 6th Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Summit (P-TEC), being held today November 6 and tomorrow November 7 in Athens, is evolving into a pivotal milestone for shaping the new energy landscape of the country and for the further upgrade of Greece’s geopolitical position in Southeastern Europe.

The event, which draws the interest of top American officials and representatives of energy giants, constitutes a strong message for the deepening US–Europe cooperation in the field of energy, but also a critical step for new strategic deals that will redefine the map of natural gas flows and investments in the region.

Since yesterday in our country, and meeting with the Prime Minister at the Maximos Mansion, are US Interior Secretary and “Energy Czar” Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Undersecretary of State for Management and Resources Michael Rigas, and Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and Environment Jacob Helberg.

Their presence in the Greek capital, along with senior executives from Cheniere Energy, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Venture Global LNG, and also technology giants such as Amazon and Google, underscores Greece’s new geostrategic role in Europe’s energy architecture.

The deals

Transatlantic cooperation in natural gas supply opened yesterday with DEPA Commercial and Aktor announcing the establishment of a joint venture for the supply and export of American LNG. The new company is named ATLANTIC SEE LNG, with a shareholding structure of 60% DEPA Commercial and 40% AKTOR. According to sources, the new entity will have a purely export-oriented character, with exclusive activity the transport of liquefied natural gas to Southeastern Europe.

The same sources note that the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the US state development bank, is expected to play a role in the joint venture. It remains to be seen from the announcements whether its role in the energy scheme will be financial or also equity. In any case, the involvement of the DFC, which also participates in other infrastructures in the country, is perceived as a clear message of American confidence and strategic investment in the Greek energy corridor.

ExxonMobil’s research in Crete also appears to be entering a new phase, with information indicating that the American giant is heading to a decision for an exploratory drilling.

The Vertical Corridor

The new cooperation between DEPA Commercial and Aktor at the heart of the Vertical Corridor will allow the flow of American LNG from Greece to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Ukraine.

According to information, Aktor will contribute to the agreement long-term LNG supply contracts of up to 2 bcm annually or even more, which will be channeled to Ukrainian companies, including the state energy company and the private DTEK group. The natural gas will come from American Venture Global LNG, based on a 20-year contract that is in the final stage of negotiation.

The project is part of the full utilization of the Alexandroupolis FSRU and the creation of new regasification terminals, such as the second Gastrade FSRU in Thrace – which has already received a positive opinion for the Environmental Impact Study.

As Gastrade executives recently said, the final investment decision for the project is expected within 2026, so that the new FSRU unit will be operational in 2028.

Given the planned capacity of 6 bcm of natural gas, the total investment cost is estimated between 550 and 600 million euros. For comparison, the existing Alexandroupolis FSRU, with a capacity of 5.5 bcm, cost about 500 million euros.

Gastrade, whose shareholders – Elmina Kopelouzos, DEPA, DESFA, Gaslog and Bulgartransgaz – jointly support the project, aims at the timely signing of station usage contracts. In this way, it seeks to secure the commercial viability of the project without having to proceed to a market test process. It should be noted that in 2024 natural gas consumption in the countries of the Vertical Corridor was 51 bcm and the forecast for 2030 is 68 bcm. This means that there will be a 17 bcm gap while additionally the approximately 15-16 bcm coming from Russia will be missing from the system.

The DFC and the “locking in” of European agreements

The conclusion of long-term contracts with European companies is estimated to be the “key” for activating financing from the US development organization DFC.

Such a development would open the way for the implementation of upgrade projects for the Vertical Corridor, through which American LNG will be able to be channeled from Greece to Hungary and Slovakia.

Thus, the Vertical Corridor will emerge as a main energy artery of Europe, simultaneously consolidating the role of Greece as a strategic fuel entry gate to the continent.

Acceleration factors

The conference takes place at a critical juncture, as European suppliers are preparing for the period after the end of 2027, when the supply of Europe with Russian natural gas will be fully discontinued.

At the same time, the clock is ticking for the implementation of the EU–US agreement, which provides for energy imports worth 750 billion dollars within three years, redefining the energy balance of the continent.

[TITLE]Six FIDs, $72 Billion: U.S. LNG’s Record-Breaking Year:
[TEXT]
Despite rising project costs, developers are successfully negotiating up to 15% higher liquefaction fees because buyers in Europe and Asia are willing to pay a premium to secure American LNG supply and reduce dependence on Russian gas.

Encouraged by market conditions, U.S. developers have made final investment decisions (FIDs) on six export projects this year, contributing to a record global LNG finance tally of $72 billion.

American LNG developers have signed sales and purchase agreements for 29.5 million metric tons per year in 2025, a volume that has more than quadrupled compared to the entirety of 2024.

Europe’s rush to shake off Russian gas dependence and Asia’s push to buy higher volumes of American energy while negotiating trade deals have created a booming export deal market for U.S. LNG exporters and developers, even at increased liquefaction fees.

Year to date, American LNG developers have signed sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) for existing and future export plants for a total of 29.5 million metric tons per year, according to data from consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group cited by Reuters.

The volume of newly contracted U.S. LNG more than quadrupled between January and October compared to the 7 million metric tons per year (mtpa) contracted for the whole of 2024.

The U.S. LNG industry is now on track to have signed the second-highest export volumes on record, trailing only 2022, when buyers in Europe turned en masse to American gas as Russian pipeline supply to Europe slumped and stopped for many EU markets, including Germany.

Encouraged by the Trump Administration’s energy policy, LNG developers are taking advantage of the market and regulatory tailwinds to approve investments in new projects.

So far this year, Australia’s Woodside has announced the FID for the Louisiana LNG project and plans to start production in 2029. In July, Venture Global took FID and successfully closed the $15.1 billion project financing for the first phase of the company’s third project, CP2 LNG, together with the associated CP Express Pipeline. Top U.S. exporter Cheniere has made a positive FID for the Corpus Christi Midscale Trains 8 & 9 and Debottlenecking Project. NextDecade has decided to invest $6.7 billion in the expansion of its Rio Grande LNG facility in Texas, in the second Rio Grande expansion announced this year, while Sempra approved a $14 billion Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion.

U.S. developers of six export projects have made FIDs and secured financing so far this year, bringing total global LNG finance to a record of $72 billion, energy commodity shipping broker and advisor Poten & Partners said last month.

“Six US FIDs in one year is unprecedented– the highest number before this year was three US projects. The liquefaction finance tally could continue to climb in the final quarter of this year as a few more projects – also in the US – appear to be nearing FID,” Poten & Partners said.

In the near term, the U.S. is set to add 5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in LNG export capacity in 2025 and 2026 alone, as Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage 3 projects come online, the Energy Information Administration said in its Short-Term Energy Outlook in October. Additions to LNG export capacity are set to boost total U.S. LNG exports to 14.7 Bcf/d in 2025 and to 16.3 Bcf/d in 2026, up from 11.9 Bcf/d in 2024, according to the EIA estimates.

The surge in U.S. LNG exports and the expected jump in Qatari LNG shipments once Qatar’s mega expansion projects are completed in 2027 have stoked fears of a coming LNG glut that could depress prices.

Related: Hungary Pushes for U.S. Oil Sanctions Waiver

U.S. developers appear unfazed by this prospect and are even raising their liquefaction fees as project costs soar amid persistent higher financing rates, labor shortages, and an increase in prices of materials.

In March this year, most U.S. liquefaction fees were being discussed at $2.65 per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) to $2.95 per MMBtu, “as EPC cost escalations show no sign of abating,” Poten & Partners said at the time.

“Higher raw material prices, which are seeing further escalation because of tariffs, coupled with rising labor and financing costs are having a pronounced impact on US LNG liquefaction project implementation. The cost increases make it challenging for developers to keep engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts valid as they try to move ahead with their LNG export projects,” the broker and advisor said.

Now U.S. LNG exporters and developers are asking about 15% higher liquefaction fees compared to the 2023 average of about $2 per MMBtu, Poten & Partners business intelligence head Jason Feer told Reuters this week.

And they are so far getting these higher fees in new contracts. Buyers are still willing to pay higher liquefaction fees to secure American LNG, which is seen in Europe as a means to cut off Russian supply by 2027 and in Asia as a lever to pull in tariff and trade deal talks with the Trump Administration.

Donald Trump exempts Hungary from Russia oil sanctions after meeting Viktor Orbán

Financial Times ^ | November 7, 2025 | James Politi in Washington and Marton Dunai in Budapest

Posted on by Navy Patriot

Donald Trump has exempted Hungary from sanctions the US has placed on top Russian oil producers as he met Viktor Orbán, the country’s prime minister, at the White House on Friday.

The US president’s decision will be a huge relief for Orbán, a fellow rightwing populist, who had been angling for a reprieve after Trump imposed sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft last month out of frustration with Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s reluctance to offer concessions for a peace deal in Ukraine.

A White House official confirmed the exemption for Hungary on Friday evening, adding it would last one year.

Trump and Orbán held talks at the White House after plans for a summit in Budapest, Hungary’s capital, between the US and Russian presidents fell apart, dashing Washington’s hopes of advancing its plans to broker a settlement in Ukraine. But Trump said there was a “very good chance” such a summit in the city could occur.

Trump opened the door to sanctions relief for Hungary over Russian oil at the start of the meeting.

“It’s very difficult for [Hungary] to get the oil and gas from other areas,” he said. “They don’t have the advantage of having sea . . . They don’t have the ports. They have a difficult problem.”

Later at the Hungarian embassy, Orbán said his country had received “full exemption” from sanctions on Russian oil moving through two key pipelines. “There are no sanctions that would restrict or make more expensive the supplies coming from there to Hungary. This is a general and unconditional exemption.”

Orbán added his country had also reached an agreement on nuclear co-operation with the US.

The first step will be to purchase nuclear fuel from Westinghouse,” the prime minister said.

[TITLE]Trump Courts Central Asia With $20 Billion in Deals and Diplomatic Overtures:
[TEXT]
US President Donald Trump unveiled a slew of trade, diplomatic, and mineral deals as he hosted Central Asia’s five leaders for a summit and dinner meant to shore up Washington's influence in the region.

Flanked by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance at a long table at the White House, Trump said that he was committed to making US relations with Central Asia "stronger than ever" as the presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan hailed a new era of ties.

“Sadly, previous American presidents neglected this region completely,” Trump said. "I understand the importance of this region” but “a lot of people don’t know that.”

Prior to their working dinner, Kazakhstan announced a major mineral deal through a new joint partnership with the United States to develop one of the world's largest untapped deposits of tungsten, which sits in the Central Asian country.

The deal will see the US company Cove Kaz Capital Group take a 70 percent stake in the venture alongside Kazakhstan’s state mining firm and is estimated to cost $1.1 billion, while the US Export-Import Bank has issued a letter of interest to fund $900 million.

Among other takeaways from the summit was a still yet to be fully detailed deal to sell up to a combined 37 Boeing jets to the national airlines of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan also announced more than 30 agreements worth $17.2 billion signed with US companies.

On the diplomatic front, Kazakhstan said it expects to join the Abraham Accords, the US-led framework for cooperation between Israel and Arab and Muslim nations.

US officials said the summit is meant to signal a new US commitment to engage with Central Asia more steadily.

“We oftentimes spend so much time focused on crises and problems -- and they deserve attention -- that sometimes we don’t spend enough time focused on exciting new opportunities,” Rubio said at a working breakfast with the five Central Asian leaders earlier on November 6.

“And that’s what exists here now: an exciting new opportunity in which the national interests of our respective countries are aligned.”

A New Chapter In Central Asia’s US Playbook

Central Asia is looking to balance its trade and security relationships that remain dominated by China and Russia by deepening ties with the United States.

The summit in Washington follows other efforts by major powers this year to deepen the relationship with the region. Russian President Vladimir Putin joined a summit in Tajikistan in September with other Central Asian leaders and Chinese leader Xi Jinping traveled to Kazakhstan in June for a meeting with the region’s presidents.

The European Union also held a summit with the region’s leaders in April in Uzbekistan to talk

[TITLE]Landmark Paris Agreement set a path to slow warming. The world hasn’t stayed on it:
[TEXT]
Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.

BELEM, Brazil (AP) — The world has changed dramatically in the decade since leaders celebrated a historic climate agreement in Paris a decade ago, but not quite in ways they expected or wanted.

Earth’s warming climate has gotten nastier faster than society has been able to wean itself from burning the coal, oil and natural gas that emits carbon pollution that triggers global warming, several scientists and officials said.

There’s been progress — more than a degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) has been shaved off future warming projections since 2015 — but the lack of enough of it will be a big focus for the next two weeks as diplomats gather in Belem, Brazil, for annual United Nations climate negotiations.

“I think it’s important that we’re honest with the world and we declare failure,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany. He said warming’s harms are happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.

But diplomats aren’t giving up.

“We’re actually in the direction that we established in Paris at a speed that none of us could have predicted,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd that agreement, which requires countries to come up with plans to fight warming.

But the speed of humanity’s climate-fighting effort is slower than the acceleration of climate’s harms, she said, adding that means that “the gap between the progress that we see on the ground and where we ought to be, that gap is still there and widening.”

U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said that the world is “obviously falling behind.”

“We’re sort of sawing the branch on which we are sitting,” she said.

[TITLE]COP30 Must Confront Financial and Structural Divide Holding Back Emerging Economies:
[TEXT]
As COP30 convenes in Belém, Brazil, in 2025, the global climate conversation returns to a familiar paradox: clean energy has never been cheaper, yet the pace of deployment remains painfully uneven.

In Europe and North America, renewables dominate new capacity additions. In much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America—regions that will determine the planet’s carbon trajectory—the investment flow is trickling when it should be roaring.

The reason is not technological inertia; it is economic geography. Disparities in capital costs, policy stability, and grid readiness continue to lock emerging markets out of affordable clean energy finance.

COP30, hosted for the first time in the Amazon basin, must be the moment the world moves beyond pledges and confronts the architecture of inequity that shapes the cost of the energy transition itself.

The cost-of-capital divide is where the transition is won or lost. Every solar farm or wind project is essentially a financing instrument attached to physical infrastructure. Because there is no fuel cost, up to 90% of lifetime expenditure occurs upfront.

The decisive factor is therefore the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)—and this is where the global playing field is deeply tilted.

In OECD countries, clean energy projects can secure debt at 3–6%, with 20-year tenors and predictable policy frameworks. In parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, those same projects face WACCs exceeding 10–15%, with loan terms often capped at seven years. The physical technology is identical; the price of money is not.

The host nation, Brazil, offers a fitting example. Its recent experience integrating biofuels, hydro, and emerging solar sectors into coherent national planning shows that industrial ambition and deployment scale can coexist—if guided by transparency and credible sequencing.

Why the gap? Currency risk, political uncertainty, and underdeveloped domestic capital markets. Most renewable equipment is imported and denominated in dollars or euros, while revenues are earned in local currency from state utilities that often struggle with solvency.

Devaluation risk alone can wipe out returns overnight. Without deep hedging markets, investors either demand higher premiums or retreat altogether.

The outcome is self-perpetuating. High capital costs slow deployment, which limits the build-out of supply chains and grids, which in turn keeps risk perceptions high.

At COP30, negotiators cannot ignore this arithmetic. Discussions of a “New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance” (NCQG)—the successor to the $100 billion promise—must explicitly include cost-of-capital equalization as a metric of success. The climate transition isn’t just

[TITLE]Google, Meta, Amazon: India’s data centre boom confronts a water challenge:

India's data centre boom confronts a looming water challenge

1 day ago Share Save Nikhil Inamdar BBC News, Mumbai Share Save

Bloomberg via Getty Images India's data centre capacity is projected to surge 77% by 2027

The extraordinary rise of artificial intelligence has turbocharged data centre growth in India, Asia's third largest economy. Data centres - the centralised physical facilities that enable our growing digital existence by hosting computer servers, IT infrastructure and network equipment - power everything from ChatGPT queries to electric vehicles and streaming services. Last month, Google made an eye-popping $15bn (£11.49bn) investment in an AI data centre in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh - its biggest in India. It was the latest among a string of investments from companies - including global giants like Amazon Web Services and Meta and local players such as Reliance Industries - that are pumping billions of dollars into India's data centre market. Even luxury real-estate developers have joined the bandwagon to build these computing facilities. The sector is poised for "explosive growth", according to global real estate advisory JLL, with India's data centre capacity projected to surge 77% by 2027 to reach 1.8GW. Some $25-30bn is expected to be spent in capacity expansion by 2030, according to various estimates. While vital for India's developmental needs, the growth of such energy hungry, water-guzzling infrastructure has profound implications for the country's decarbonisation plans.

Getty Images India has 18% of the world's population, but only 4% of its water resources

India has no option but to attract big data centre investments, some experts say. While the country is said to account for 20% of global data generation, it has only 3% of global data centre capacity. And demand for such infrastructure is soaring, with India expected to consume the most data in the world by 2028 - higher than developed markets like the US, Europe and even China. This consumption is being driven by massive growth in internet and mobile use, the government's regulatory thrust on hosting user data locally and rapid adoption of AI, which has greater computing needs. AI chatbots like ChatGPT have their second largest user base in India. There's also a strong business case for Indian policymakers to push for such investments and for global firms to commit the money. According to Kotak Research, "data centre development cost is one of the lowest in India with only China's cost being lower", and India's electricity cost is a fraction of the US, UK and Japan. The country also has world-class tech talent suited for the industry's growth. "Just like we exploited the IT services boom through the 90s and 2000s, this is another opportunity that we can use to our advantage," Vibhuti Garg, director for South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told the BBC.

NurPhoto via Getty Images India's data consumption is being driven by massive growth in internet and mobile use

This boom has, however, presented policymakers with difficult trade-offs. From Chile and Mexico to Georgia in the US and Scotland, serious concerns have been raised around data centres guzzling excess water for their cooling systems and consuming vast amounts of energy at the cost of local communities. In an energy starved, water-scarce India, these challenges are even more accentuated. According to the World Bank, India has 18% of the world's population, but only 4% of its water resources, making it among the most water-stressed countries in the world. India's data centre water consumption, meanwhile, is expected to more than double from 150 billion litres in 2025 to 358 billion litres by 2030, putting further pressure on its water table. Moreover, most of India's data centres are concentrated in urban clusters like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru which have strong competing water needs. A potential pushback from locals or a loss of licences to build and operate such centres as a result of growing water stress could hit the industry hard over the long term, experts say. There are already some murmurs of discontent. Advocacy groups like the Human Rights Forum have raised "alarm" over the Andhra Pradesh state government's "public resource diversion" for Google's proposed data centre, saying that Visakhapatnam city where it is slated to come up is already facing acute water stress which could intensify as a result of this investment. Google directed the BBC to a document which says that the company uses a "peer-reviewed context-based water-risk framework" to evaluate local watershed risk at new sites to guide decision-making on whether to use a freshwater source. While India has explicit policies and regulations that govern data protection and data centre development, zoning, energy use etc, "water use does not figure prominently in any of these policy groups, and is a significant blind spot that places high risk on the long-term functioning of these centres", Sahana Goswami of WRI India, a water research organisation, told the BBC. An S&P Global study predicts that 60-80% of India's data centres will face high water stress in this decade itself as a result of limited resource availability. This, in turn, could have a cascading impact on other industries. "Imagine shutdowns of data centres in peak summer due to lack of water for cooling - how might this impact banking services, medical systems in hospitals using cloud services, transit system operations and more," says Ms Goswami. Companies need to bring greater innovation and explore mechanisms to use treated domestic and industrial waste water instead of fighting for this limited resource, experts say. "India itself has examples of such innovation in the data centre space in Navi Mumbai. Further, various power and textile industries are much ahead in partnering with municipal authorities and water utilities," says Ms Goswami. Praveen Ramamurthy, a water recycling expert from the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru city, agrees. "Non-potable or treated water must be made mandatory for cooling needs," he told the BBC, adding that India must also select "low-stress water basins for new projects". He also advocates for the use of zero-water cooling technologies that are advancing globally, but "inconsistently deployed across Indian and legacy facilities".

[TITLE]How Britain’s Wind Boom Has Slashed Energy Bills:
[TEXT]
The United Kingdom has rapidly developed its wind energy sector over the last two decades to become one of the biggest wind power producers worldwide. As the government aims to accelerate the green transition through greater investment in renewable energies and upgrading the national grid, the U.K.’s wind sector is expected to continue growing substantially in the coming decades. Meanwhile, recent studies suggest that the deployment of more wind power has helped significantly reduce consumer energy bills.

There is approximately 15.7 GW of operational onshore wind power in the U.K., with an increase of 739 MW in 2024 through the development of projects such as the Viking (443MW), Kype Muir Extension (67.2MW), and Broken Cross (43.2MW) windfarms. In 2024, 77 onshore wind projects submitted for planning permission, a slight reduction from the 83 submissions in 2023, but far higher than the 44 submissions in 2022.

The U.K. is expected to achieve 26 GW of onshore wind by 2030, which is 3.1 GW below the target established in the U.K. Government’s Clean Power 2030 Action Plan (CP30), according to a forecasting model by EnergyPulse. The wind industry also employs around 55,000 people, a figure that is set to double to around 110,000 by the end of the decade.

The U.K. has an operational offshore wind capacity of around 14.7 GW. Construction is currently underway on six projects with a total capacity of 6.3 GW, and three of these projects have a generating capacity of 2.5 GW, with development expected to be completed in 2025. Two more (2.5GW) operators will commence offshore construction this year. There were 14 planning applications for offshore wind projects submitted in 2024, with a total capacity of 15.4 GW, making for a total offshore wind capacity pipeline of 22.85 GW. The U.K.’s offshore wind capacity is expected to reach 41.5 GW by the end of 2030, including 1.2 GW of floating wind capacity.

Wind energy was the U.K.’s largest source of electricity generation in the final quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, making it the longest stretch of time on record where renewable energy contributed more power generation than that of fossil fuels. In Q1 of 2024, wind energy generation totalled 25.3 terawatt hours (TWh), compared to 23.6 TWh from all fossil fuel sources. Wind power contributed an average of 39.4 percent of total electricity production in this period. This marked a major turning point for the U.K., which has long relied on fossil fuels for power.

In addition to helping the U.K. to achieve a green transition, it seems that wind power is also saving consumers billions, according to a recent study. An analysis from University College London (UCL) found that between 2010 and 2023, wind-generated energy decreased electricity bills by $18.7 billion and reduced the cost of natural gas by $175 billion. When green subsidies of $56.8 billion paid by consumers are factored in, it results in a total reduction of $137 billion in U.K. consumer energy bills over 13 years.

[TITLE]Government shutdown surpasses 30 days, impacting energy sector and vital services:
[TEXT]
The longest U.S. government shutdown has caused a shortage of air traffic controllers, leading to airport ground stops and safety concerns.

The FAA and DOE shutdowns have led to air traffic disruptions and paused critical renewable energy initiatives.

The U.S. government shutdown is also disrupting global energy and climate collaborations, potentially hindering international efforts to secure a sustainable future.

With the U.S. government shutdown tied for the longest in history, leaders must prioritize the well-being of citizens and the global community over political differences.

Nearly half of the IRS workforce is furloughed due to the ongoing government shutdown.

The longest U.S. government shutdown in history – now tied at 35 days – is wreaking havoc on the energy sector, with far-reaching implications for the nation and the world. As the partial shutdown drags on, essential services are disrupted and the impacts are being felt across various sectors.

The shutdown has led to a shortage of air traffic controllers, causing ground stops at major U.S. airports. This travel nightmare not only causes inconvenience but also raises safety concerns, as reported by Fox Business. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been forced to close traffic control towers and reduce staff at others, leading to delays and cancellations.

The energy sector is particularly vulnerable during this shutdown. The Department of Energy (DOE) has furloughed around 80 percent of its staff, according to Newsmax. This includes employees responsible for nuclear safety, energy infrastructure and renewable energy programs.

In his 2014 book “Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper: How Innovation Keeps Proving the Catastrophists Wrong,” Robert Bryce recounted a similar shutdown. He wrote: “At the very time that the U.S. needs a solid political system that can deal with hard choices on spending and taxation, the U.S. Congress has devolved into a hyper-partisan institution that has been gerrymandered into gold-plated, ossified irrelevance. The October 2013 budget impasse that led to a two-week shutdown of the federal government provides the most obvious, and depressing, example of the pettiness and partisanship in Washington.”

Government shutdown exposes fragility

According to BrightU.AI‘s Enoch engine, government shutdowns force the DOE to implement sequestration cuts, eliminating union and non-union positions while threatening thousands of contracted jobs. These reductions cripple workforce stability and disrupt critical energy programs, furthering the globalist agenda of economic destabilization and centralized control.

The shutdown comes at a critical time for renewable energy and climate change initiatives. The DOE’s Loan Programs Office, which provides loan guarantees for innovative energy projects, is closed. This pause in operations could hinder the progress of clean energy projects and slow down the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Moreover, the energy sector’s global interconnectedness means that the U.S. government shutdown has international ramifications. The DOE’s international collaborations on energy and climate change, such as the Clean Energy Ministerial and the Mission Innovation initiative, are put on hold. This pause could disrupt global efforts to tackle climate change and secure a sustainable energy future.

The government shutdown is more than a political spat; it’s a crisis that affects every American and has global repercussions. The energy sector, a critical component of modern life, is being significantly impacted.

The shutdown highlights the fragility of our interconnected systems and the importance of government efficiency and bipartisanship. As the shutdown nears the record for the longest in history, it’s crucial for America’s leaders to prioritize the well-being of the American people and the global community over political differences.

[TITLE]COP30 Must Confront Financial and Structural Divide Holding Back Emerging Economies:
[TEXT]
As COP30 convenes in Belém, Brazil, in 2025, the global climate conversation returns to a familiar paradox: clean energy has never been cheaper, yet the pace of deployment remains painfully uneven.

In Europe and North America, renewables dominate new capacity additions. In much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America—regions that will determine the planet’s carbon trajectory—the investment flow is trickling when it should be roaring.

The reason is not technological inertia; it is economic geography. Disparities in capital costs, policy stability, and grid readiness continue to lock emerging markets out of affordable clean energy finance.

COP30, hosted for the first time in the Amazon basin, must be the moment the world moves beyond pledges and confronts the architecture of inequity that shapes the cost of the energy transition itself.

The cost-of-capital divide is where the transition is won or lost. Every solar farm or wind project is essentially a financing instrument attached to physical infrastructure. Because there is no fuel cost, up to 90% of lifetime expenditure occurs upfront.

The decisive factor is therefore the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)—and this is where the global playing field is deeply tilted.

In OECD countries, clean energy projects can secure debt at 3–6%, with 20-year tenors and predictable policy frameworks. In parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, those same projects face WACCs exceeding 10–15%, with loan terms often capped at seven years. The physical technology is identical; the price of money is not.

The host nation, Brazil, offers a fitting example. Its recent experience integrating biofuels, hydro, and emerging solar sectors into coherent national planning shows that industrial ambition and deployment scale can coexist—if guided by transparency and credible sequencing.

Why the gap? Currency risk, political uncertainty, and underdeveloped domestic capital markets. Most renewable equipment is imported and denominated in dollars or euros, while revenues are earned in local currency from state utilities that often struggle with solvency.

Devaluation risk alone can wipe out returns overnight. Without deep hedging markets, investors either demand higher premiums or retreat altogether.

The outcome is self-perpetuating. High capital costs slow deployment, which limits the build-out of supply chains and grids, which in turn keeps risk perceptions high.

At COP30, negotiators cannot ignore this arithmetic. Discussions of a “New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance” (NCQG)—the successor to the $100 billion promise—must explicitly include cost-of-capital equalization as a metric of success. The climate transition isn’t just

[TITLE]New U.S. nuclear power boom begins with old, still-unsolved problem: What to do with radioactive waste:

Nuclear power is back, largely due to the skyrocketing demand for electricity, including big tech's hundreds of artificial intelligence data centers across the country and the reshoring of manufacturing. But it returns with an old and still-unsolved problem: storing all of the radioactive waste created as a byproduct of nuclear power generation. In May, President Trump issued executive orders aimed at quadrupling the current nuclear output over the next 25 years by accelerating construction of both large conventional reactors and next-gen small modular reactors. Last week, the U.S. signed a deal with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the country that could result in Westinghouse attempting to spinoff and IPO a stand-alone nuclear power company with the federal government as a shareholder. There's a growing consensus among governments, businesses and the public that the time is right for a nuclear power renaissance, and even if the ambitious build-out could take a decade or more and cost hundreds of billion of dollars, it will be an eventual boon to legacy and start-up nuclear energy companies, the AI-fixated wing of the tech industry and investors banking on their success. But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. Only two nuclear power plants have been built since 1990 — more than $15 billion over budget and years behind schedule — and they went online in just the last two years. Almost all of the 94 reactors currently operating in 28 states, generating

[TITLE]Voter fury emerges over skyrocketing electricity bills as AI stokes demand — and fears of a stock market bubble:
[TEXT]
Voter anger over the cost of living is hurtling forward into next year’s midterm elections, when pivotal contests will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who’s footing the bill to power Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

Electricity costs were a key issue in this week’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission.

Meanwhile, concerns are growing over an AI bubble in stock markets. Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management business, said at the Fortune Global Forum just weeks ago that some AI stocks have “a little too much concentration.”

And Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, told Fortune weeks earlier that she was “very concerned”

Voter anger over the cost of living is hurtling forward into next year’s midterm elections, when pivotal contests will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who’s footing the bill to power Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

Electricity costs were a key issue in this week’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission.

Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited economic concerns as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over affordability in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.

Already, President Donald Trump is signaling that he’ll focus on affordability next year as he and Republicans try to maintain their slim congressional majorities, while Democrats are blaming Trump for rising household costs.

Front and center may be electricity bills, which in many places are increasing at a rate faster than U.S. inflation on average — although not everywhere.
