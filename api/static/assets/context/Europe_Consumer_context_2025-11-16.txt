[TITLE]Miami-Dade committee advances David Martin’s takeover of Miami Seaquarium:
[TEXT]
A Miami-Dade County committee gave David Martin’s Terra the green light to take over the troubled Miami Seaquarium in Virginia Key. Now the Coconut Grove-based firm will seek approval from the full county commission next month.

On Thursday, the Miami-Dade appropriations committee advanced Terra’s proposal to acquire Miami Seaquarium’s lease from the bankrupt company that owned the longtime attraction. A Terra affiliate is buying the lease and Miami Seaquarium for $22.5 million.

A Delaware bankruptcy court approved the deal, but it needs the county’s approval because Miami-Dade owns the property at 4400 Rickenbacker Causeway.

Martin aims to reimagine the aging Virginia Key landmark into a vibrant waterfront destination. His plan entails a new marina, baywalk, retail and restaurant row, plus an accredited aquarium that will not house any marine mammals.

“Our team is excited to advance on a plan that will see at least $100 million invested in restoring the site as a destination for locals and visitors,” Martin said in a statement. “The redeveloped seaquarium will also generate significant community benefits, including more than $750 million in revenue for the county and hundreds of jobs.”

[TITLE]Walmart shares are up 312% during outgoing CEO Doug McMillon's tenure. Here's how that compares to its rivals:
[TEXT]
Walmart logo is seen near the store in Austin, United States on Oct. 23, 2025.

When incoming Walmart CEO John Furner steps into the retailer's top role, he will try to follow up a period of dramatic share growth that many of Walmart's rivals have failed to match.

Walmart's stock has more than quadrupled since outgoing CEO Doug McMillon began in the role in February 2014. Across nine of the 12 calendar years when McMillon has been Walmart's leader, the company posted positive stock returns.

Among Walmart's main rivals in the retail and grocery business, only Amazon and Costco have had better stock returns since McMillon took the job. Meanwhile, Walmart's stock has outperformed those of competitors like Target , Dollar General , Dollar Tree , Kroger and Albertsons .

McMillon will officially step down at the end of January, but will stay on as executive chairman and advisor. While Furner will face a challenge in replicating the company's performance under his predecessor, he has been a key catalyst for the company's success as CEO of its largest sector, Walmart's U.S. business.

Along with huge gains on Wall Street, McMillon oversaw a significant period of growth for the nation's largest grocer, which included sharp sales increases, wage hikes for hourly workers and transformation of the nation's low-price leader into a major e-commerce player. He also steered the retailer through the tumult of a global pandemic, historic levels of inflation and higher tariffs.

Sales during McMillon's first three years in the role were roughly flat — with revenues of $486 billion, $482 billion and $485 billion in the fiscal years ending January 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Yet those years were followed by steady growth, and those gains have accelerated since 2021, after the Covid pandemic pushed more people to shop online and inflation nudged even wealthier shoppers to seek value. Walmart posted annual revenue of about $681 billion in the fiscal year ended earlier this year, an approximately 40% jump from the company's annual revenue the first year of McMillon's tenure.

This year, Walmart is on track to post annual revenues of over $700 billion for the first time ever. Ironically, however, it is also expected to lose its crown as the largest retailer by annual revenue to its biggest e-commerce rival, Amazon .

Earlier this year, Amazon leapfrogged Walmart in quarterly sales for the first time. Compared to Walmart, it has a different mix to its business because of its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses.

[TITLE]Walmart CEO Doug McMillon delivered 15% annual returns:
[TEXT]
Walmart CEO Doug McMillon delivered 15% annual returns

The retiring executive’s decade-long tenure produced stronger shareholder returns than most other recently departed chief executives

Doug McMillon is leaving Walmart with an impressive track record. The chief executive announced his retirement plans for January, capping a decade of leadership that delivered some of the strongest returns among recently departing CEOs at major corporations.

A Reuters analysis examining companies that changed leadership over the past 18 months reveals how McMillon’s performance stacks up against peers. The study included major names like Nestle and Starbucks, providing context for evaluating executive performance across different industries and market conditions.

Ranking the annualized returns

In terms of annualized total returns, Walmart secured second place among the companies analyzed. Under McMillon’s leadership since January 2014, the retail giant posted 15% annualized total returns, calculated from the day before he assumed office through November 14, 2025.

Only Danish jewelry brand Pandora outperformed Walmart in this metric. Under Alexander Lacik’s leadership beginning in February 2019, Pandora delivered 17% annualized total returns to shareholders. The company announced in September that Lacik would retire in March and be succeeded by marketing chief Berta de Pablos-Barbier.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, German sportswear brand Puma struggled significantly. Under Arne Freundt, the company posted a negative 36.6% annualized total return before he was replaced in April by former Adidas sales chief Arthur Hoeld. The dramatic underperformance highlights the challenges facing some European fashion and sportswear brands.

Total return measurements tell another story

When examining cumulative total returns rather than annualized figures, the rankings shift somewhat. French luxury group Kering claimed top honors with an extraordinary 520% total return over 20 years under Francois-Henri Pinault’s leadership from March 2005 through September 2025.

Walmart captured second place in this measurement as well, delivering 419% total returns during McMillon’s tenure. This substantial figure demonstrates consistent value creation for shareholders over an extended period rather than short-term gains followed by stagnation.

Several well-known companies performed poorly by this measure. Drinks group Diageo, athletic wear giant Nike and KitKat maker Nestle ranked among the worst performers, suggesting challenges in their respective industries or execution issues under departing leadership.

McMillon’s transformation of Walmart

McMillon took control of Walmart in January 2014 during a critical period for traditional retail. The rise of e-commerce threatened brick-and-mortar retailers, with Amazon emerging as a dominant force reshaping consumer shopping habits.

Under his leadership, Walmart invested heavily in digital capabilities while leveraging its massive physical footprint as a competitive advantage. The company developed robust online ordering systems, curbside pickup services and same-day delivery options that integrated digital convenience with existing store networks.

These investments required significant capital expenditures and short-term profit sacrifices but positioned Walmart to compete effectively against pure-play online retailers. The strategy proved particularly valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic when consumers rapidly shifted toward online shopping and contactless fulfillment options.

McMillon also prioritized employee wages and benefits, raising minimum pay levels and expanding opportunities for advancement. While these moves increased operating costs, they helped reduce turnover and improve customer service quality at a time when labor markets tightened significantly.

Leadership transition plans

Walmart announced that U.S. division chief John Furner would succeed McMillon as CEO. Furner has deep experience within the company and familiarity with its operations, suggesting continuity in strategic direction rather than dramatic changes.

Internal succession planning demonstrates board confidence in the company’s leadership development processes. Organizations that successfully promote from within typically maintain cultural continuity while avoiding the disruption and uncertainty that sometimes accompanies external CEO searches.

Furner faces challenges including ongoing e-commerce competition, inflation pressures affecting consumer spending, and the need to continue modernizing Walmart’s technology infrastructure. However, he inherits a company in strong financial position with clear competitive advantages in retail.

Broader CEO transition trends

The Reuters analysis captured a period of unusual CEO turnover across major corporations. Multiple factors have driven these changes, including mandatory retirement ages, performance issues, strategic disagreements with boards, and executives choosing to step down for personal reasons.

CEO transitions often trigger stock volatility as investors assess whether new leadership will maintain successful strategies or pursue different directions. Companies with clear succession plans and strong internal candidates typically experience less disruption than those conducting external searches.

The performance comparisons highlight how different industries and business models affect returns independent of CEO quality. Luxury goods companies like Kering benefited from strong demand growth in emerging markets, while traditional consumer goods companies faced mature markets and intense competition.

What the numbers reveal

McMillon’s strong performance metrics reflect both skillful leadership and favorable industry dynamics. Walmart entered his tenure with significant competitive advantages including scale, supplier relationships, real estate holdings and brand recognition.

However, those advantages alone didn’t guarantee success. Other large retailers with similar starting positions struggled during the same period. McMillon’s willingness to invest in digital transformation despite short-term cost pressures distinguished Walmart’s approach from competitors who moved more slowly or half-heartedly embraced e-commerce.

The 15% annualized return and 419% cumulative return figures place McMillon among successful long-tenured CEOs at major corporations. These returns exceeded broader market benchmarks over the same period while navigating significant industry disruption.

Legacy and future outlook

As McMillon prepares to step down, his tenure will be remembered for successfully steering Walmart through digital transformation while maintaining its position as America’s largest retailer. The company enters new leadership with strong competitive positioning and clear strategic direction.

Whether Furner can maintain similar performance levels remains uncertain. Different economic conditions, competitive dynamics and consumer preferences will shape his tenure differently than McMillon’s decade. However, the strong foundation established provides advantages as Walmart continues evolving in an increasingly digital retail landscape.

[TITLE]Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. Reports Financial Results for Third Quarter of 2025:
[TEXT]
Key third quarter reported data points:

Revenue of $16.4 million, +3.5% vs. Q3 2024

GAAP net income from continuing operations of $651 thousand vs. $861 thousand in Q3 2024

GAAP net income from continuing operations per fully diluted share of $0.012 vs. $0.017 in Q3 2024

Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $321 thousand vs. $1 million in Q3 2024

Subsequent Event: Announced new leadership in CEO Gary Schubert

BROADVIEW, Ill., Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: IVFH) (“we,” “our,” “us,” “IVFH” or the “Company”), a national seller of gourmet specialty foods to professional chefs, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Gary Schubert, Chief Executive Officer of IVFH, remarked, “In Q3 2025, revenue from continuing operations increased by 3.5% year-over-year, primarily driven by contributions from the Golden Organics and LoCo Foods acquisitions. While overall results reflected modest growth, certain areas of the business remain challenged as we execute on a strategic realignment. Revenue from our Digital Channels segment declined by 4.5% for the quarter and 5.4% year-to-date, largely driven by continued softness with our largest digital partner. However, the Digital Channels decline has continued to moderate, and we are seeing encouraging momentum from newer partnerships. Our newest digital partner generated over $500,000 in sales during the quarter, and both that partner and Amazon, delivered triple-digit year-over-year growth. This momentum is helping diversify our revenue base and stabilize overall results within the digital segment, but we recognize that much work remains to be done. National Distribution, which includes our airline catering business was stable in Q3 and increased by 8.1% year-to-date. While Local Distribution increased by 33% in Q3 and 54.7% year-to-date, with acquisitions in this space driving the increase from prior periods. Excluding the acquisitions, Local Distribution declined by 21.5% for the quarter and 10.4% year-to-date.

“GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 23.5%, consistent with last year. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) declined by approximately $698 thousand compared to Q3 2024, primarily due to sales declines in certain categories, underperformance in recently acquired businesses, and a reversal of previously accrued share-based compensation.”

“In the third quarter, we took swift and decisive action to correct operational inefficiencies that became increasingly apparent in mid-summer. We are beginning to see early signs of stabilization from these recent actions. These actions included the exit of the cheese-conversion business, the relocation of airline catering operations to our Chicago facility, and leadership changes at Golden Organics to strengthen operational oversight. In addition, we entered a Letter of Intent (LOI) for the sale of our former Pennsylvania facility. Both parties continue to work in good faith toward final documentation and closing following the completion of the due diligence period.”

“The third quarter marks an important step forward in IVFH’s transformation, and subsequent to quarter end we have made continued progress to simplify our operating model, strengthen leadership alignment, and build a culture based upon clear accountability. In the past month since assuming the CEO position, we have clarified ownership across every function and consolidated leadership under experienced operators, including bringing back Argie Liarakos who previously led Artisan at the Company for over a decade. We have also continued to align our technology and operational teams under a single leader, creating a cohesive operating rhythm designed to enhance collaboration, improve speed of execution, and ensure every function is accountable for measurable outcomes.”

“To remain competitive in digital foodservice distribution, reliability and price are essential prerequisites. Foodservice customers will not accept anything less than on-time, in-full delivery at a competitive prices. Our teams understand this clearly, and we are committed to improving reliability, accuracy, and speed at every level of the organization. We will continue onboarding new suppliers, expanding our item catalog, and signing new platforms, but our top priority is building the operational foundation that enables sustainable growth. Every initiative we undertake will be measured against these fundamentals—stabilization, modernization, and execution discipline—to position IVFH for long-term success.”

“Our focused exit from non-core activities has simplified the business and will allow us to grow responsibly, modernize our technology foundation, and strengthen partnerships that align with our specialty foodservice focus. IVFH remains fundamentally strong, and our focus is sharper than ever. As we continue to streamline operations, modernize systems, and align our teams across people, process, and technology, we are positioning the Company to deliver sustainable profitability and long-term shareholder value. The path forward is clear, disciplined, and built for durable growth,” Mr. Schubert concluded.

[TITLE]Edible Garden Posts 9% Revenue Growth as Non-Perishable CPG Units Surge 49.3% Year-Over-Year:
[TEXT]
Hydroponic Basil, Potted Herbs, and Wheatgrass Accelerate; International Nutraceutical Sales Nearly Double Year-Over-Year

Company's Portfolio Optimization and Expansion into CEA-Informed, Better-For-You Shelf Stable Categories Pushes Market Penetration and Growth

Conference Call to Be Held Today at 8:00 am ET.

BELVIDERE, N.J., Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edible Garden AG Incorporated (“Edible Garden” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: EDBL, EDBLW), a leading provider of controlled environment agriculture (CEA) solutions and sustainable, locally grown organic produce, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. The third quarter is traditionally the slowest of the year for Edible Garden, however the results reflect the early benefits of the Company’s strategic evolution toward a CEA informed consumer packaged goods (CPG) model. The Company demonstrated revenue growth, with sales up 9% compared to the third quarter of 2024. Edible Garden also broadened its distribution network and gained momentum in the shelf-stable product segment. The fourth quarter, historically the Company’s strongest period, is expected to further demonstrate the positive impact of this transformation.

Financial & Operating Highlights for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025

Non-perishable unit sales increased approximately 49.3% year-over-year, driven by strong performance across the Company’s shelf-stable product lines including Kick. Sports Nutrition, Pickle Party™, Pulp®, and Vitamin Whey®.

Private Label products sold through major big box retailers outperformed in the second quarter, climbing 15.1% year-over-year

Same store Hydroponic Basil up 28.6%, Potted Herbs up 22.6%, and Wheatgrass up 59.2%

International vitamin and supplements revenue rose 90.2% versus year-over-year

“Over the past several quarters, we’ve been executing a strategic transformation of Edible Garden into a diversified, innovation-driven consumer packaged goods company, and we’re now seeing clear results,” said Jim Kras, Chief Executive Officer of Edible Garden. “The third quarter marked a key milestone as we experienced revenue growth, expanded our product distribution to Kroger to include fresh potted and cut herbs, added major retail customers including The Fresh Market, and expanded internationally through partners such as PriceSmart and Amazon.”

“Our CPG- focused strategy enables us to expand beyond fresh produce into shelf-stable, branded offerings that align with growing demand for clean-label, functional, and better-for-you foods. Our expanding portfolio - featuring Kick. Sports Nutrition, Pickle Party™, Pulp®, and Vitamin Whey® - is driving continued momentum and is expected to contribute to margin improvement, while supporting broader geographic reach and more consistent, year-round sales across both fresh and shelf-stable categories.”

“We further expanded our retail footprint during the quarter, launching our USDA Organic fresh herb line at Kroger, introducing Edible Garden-branded herbs at The Fresh Market, and strengthening our Midwest presence through Pete’s Fresh Market and Angelo Caputo’s Fresh Markets. We believe these relationships, along with robust private-label programs, underscore the growing strength of the Edible Garden brand and our commitment to freshness, innovation, and sustainability.”

“The acquisition of NaturalShrimp’s assets is expected to enhance our vertical integration and add sustainable aquaculture capabilities that align with our mission and brand values. Together with ongoing innovation under our Zero-Waste Inspired® mission, we are investing in health-focused product development and building a stronger platform for scale. We believe these initiatives will position Edible Garden as a next-generation sustainable food company with multiple high-growth revenue streams.”

“Looking ahead, we believe the most challenging phase of this transformation is behind us. We’ve built a more resilient organization—one that is better-positioned to capture growth across both fresh and non-perishable categories—and we are on our way toward achieving our goal of long-term, sustainable profitability. We’re excited

[TITLE]FitLife Brands Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
OMAHA, NE, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FitLife Brands, Inc. (“FitLife” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: FTLF), a provider of innovative and proprietary nutritional supplements and wellness products, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025 include:

On August 8, 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Irwin Naturals (“Irwin”), and Irwin’s operating results for the period of August 9 through September 30 are included in FitLife’s consolidated financials for the third quarter of 2025.

Total revenue was $23.5 million, an increase of 47% compared to the third quarter of 2024.

Wholesale revenue was $13.2 million, representing 56% of revenue and an increase of 156% compared to the third quarter of 2024.

Excluding the amortization of the inventory step-up related to the Irwin acquisition, gross margin was 38.9% compared to 43.8% during the third quarter of 2024.

Net income was $0.9 million compared to $2.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, with the decline driven primarily by transaction expense associated with acquisition of Irwin, lower gross margin, and higher income tax expense.

Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share were $0.10 and $0.09, respectively, compared to $0.23 and $0.21 during the third quarter of 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA was $3.8 million, a 6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2024.

For the third quarter ended September 30, 2025, total revenue was $23.5 million, an increase of 47% compared to $16.0 million during the same period last year. Revenue from Irwin accounted for $6.8 million of the $7.5 million increase.

Wholesale revenue for the quarter was $13.2 million, an increase of 156% compared to the third quarter of 2024. Excluding the $6.5 million of wholesale revenue contributed by Irwin, wholesale revenue for the Company’s other brands increased 30% compared to the third quarter of 2024, with wholesale revenue for Legacy FitLife (excluding MRC), MRC, and MusclePharm increasing 3%, 20%, and 112% respectively. Wholesale revenue accounted for 56% and 32% of the Company’s total revenue during the quarters ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Online revenue for the quarter was $10.3 million, a decrease of 5% compared to the third quarter of 2024. Excluding the $0.3 million of online revenue contributed by Irwin, online revenue for the Company’s other brands declined 8% compared to the third quarter of 2024. Online revenue for Legacy FitLife (excluding MRC) increased by 14% during the quarter, while MRC declined by 16% and MusclePharm declined by 3%. Online revenue accounted for 44% and 68% of the Company’s total revenue during the quarters ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, was 37.2% compared to 43.8% during the same period in the prior year. Excluding the amortization of the inventory step-up related to the Irwin acquisition, gross margin was 38.9% for the third quarter of 2025.

Net income for the third quarter of 2025 was $0.9 million compared to $2.1 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.10 and $0.09, respectively, compared to $0.23 and $0.21 during the third quarter of 2024. The decline in net income and earnings per share is primarily due to transaction expense associated with the Irwin acquisition, lower gross margin, and increased income tax expense.

Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, was $3.8 million, a 6% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months, which includes less than eight weeks of Irwin’s results, was $13.6 million.

Performance of Acquired Brands

One of the primary metrics used by management to evaluate the performance of the Company’s brands is contribution, a non-GAAP financial measure which management defines as gross profit less advertising and marketing expenditures. Other companies may also report contribution as a performance metric, but their definition or calculation of contribution may differ from the Company’s. Management believes that contribution, as defined by the Company, is a particularly relevant performance metric since it incorporates the gross profit associated with a specific brand or collection of brands as well as the advertising and marketing expenditures associated with the same brand or brands. With limited exception, other operating expense incurred by the Company is generally not allocable to a specific brand or collection of brands.

Management intends to provide this level of disclosure for acquired brands for approximately two years following a transaction, after which the performance of acquired brands will be reported as part of Legacy FitLife results. Other than for MusclePharm, the numbers in the contribution tables presented below in the body of the

[TITLE]On Holding Continues to Beat Projections in Third Quarter:
[TEXT]
Story was updated at 4:16 p.m. Wednesday.

Nike may be clawing its way back to popularity, but don’t count out On Holding.

Despite some analyst hesitation that the popular Swiss running brand may be losing some of its steam to a reviving Nike, the company once again posted record sales and profits in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.

“We continue to reiterate that we are on a different journey — to become the most premium brand in the industry,” Martin Hoffmann, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, told WWD.

It appears to be working.

Adjusted net income in the period nearly tripled to 142 million Swiss francs from 50 million Swiss francs in the prior year on a 24.9 percent sales gain, or 34.5 percent on a constant currency basis, to 794.4 million Swiss francs. Adjusted earnings per share were 0.36 Swiss francs, up from 0.09 Swiss francs in the prior year.

This beat Wall Street expectations of a quarterly sales increase of 20.1 percent and adjusted earnings per share of 0.27 Swiss francs.

The company’s direct-to-consumer sales increased 27.6 percent to 14.7 million Swiss francs, or 37.5 percent on a constant currency basis, while sales in the wholesale channel rose 23.3 percent, or 32.5 percent on a constant currency basis, to 479.6 million Swiss francs.

By region, net sales increased 33 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 21 percent in the Americas and 109.2 percent in Asia-Pacific on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific is the company’s fastest-growing region with four consecutive quarters of triple-digit sales growth, and analysts were expecting sales in the American market to slow.

“The U.S. continues to be strong,” Hoffmann said. This comes despite a price increase of around 7 percent on select lifestyle products starting in the second half of the year. He said the company has experienced no resistance to the price hikes. “We continue to power on full-price sales,” he said on an earnings call Wednesday morning, adding that “affluent consumers are not price-sensitive.”

By category, net sales from shoes rose 21.1 percent to 731.3 million Swiss francs; apparel sales increased 86.9 percent to 50.1 million Swiss francs, and accessories sales rose 145.3 percent to 13 million Swiss francs.

Although apparel still represents around 8 percent of overall sales, Hoffmann said it is growing more strongly than footwear. And in the quarter, the company sold more than 1 million pieces of apparel for the first time, and the short-term goal is to raise the total sales percentage of the category to double digits. Hoffmann said on the call that the training and tennis categories are most popular, and the plan for the future is to “attack in additional categories” that can be worn every day.

He added that apparel penetration in the company’s retail stores is much higher, hitting between 10 and 20 percent, and in many cases serves as an introduction to the brand. On the call, he said apparel has become “a key acquisition channel” since apparel shoppers “buy more frequently and with bigger baskets. We are also seeing a clear shift toward younger customers in apparel, highlighting the sizable and well-defined long-term opportunity. Importantly, we are not building apparel as an add-on to our footwear business, but as a company within the company serving the same communities but with a unique product offering and customer experience. As a result, apparel is driving incremental high value growth across all our channels.”

Turning to retail, On operates 60 stores globally with additions in the Ginza in Tokyo; a flagship in its hometown of Zurich; Palo Alto, Calif.; its first South Korean store in Seoul, and a unit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Hoffmann said only a small number of stores are slated to open this year but the company will continue to add between 20 and 25 units a year in the future. “That’s the cadence we had this year,” he said.

While its own stores are an important part of the business, Hoffmann stressed that wholesale continues to be a key cog in its wheel. He said with the big-box stores such as Dick’s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker, there are 60 percent of doors that do not carry the brand. And within the run specialty channel, he expects business to be strong next year as the company introduces new models of some of its key franchises, such as the Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner.

On the earnings call, Caspar Coppetti, cofounder and executive co-chairman of On, singled out New York City Marathon women’s winner Hellen Obiri, an On athlete, who wore the new Cloudboom Strike Lightspray, as proof that its “new technology is being trusted and adopted by the world’s best athletes in the most iconic races. Our strategy is clear. Technology is proven at the highest level of competition and then refined to deliver the best experience for every type of runner. This elite credibility flows directly to our core performance running franchises Cloudsurfer, Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner. These are the engines that have won millions of fans and driven our significant sustained growth in the run category.”

Next year, Coppetti said, the company will launch the Cloudsufer Max, a model featuring “engineering and foam innovations,” as well as the LightSpray Cloudmonster Hyper, a shoe for everyday runners that features the company’s “championship level technology.”

As a result of the strong third-quarter results, the company raised its outlook for the year and is expecting net sales to grow 34 percent on a constant currency basis, to 2.91 billion Swiss francs, up from 31 percent previously. Analysts were expecting sales for the year to increase 28.2 percent. And in 2026, Hoffmann said, the company is projecting growth of at least 23 percent.

Hoffmann said the optimism is driven by the momentum already experienced in the fourth quarter and the strong sales in China. Looking ahead, the company plans to release a holiday campaign and continue to lean into collaborations, such as ones that just released with Loewe, with which it codesigned a Cloudsolo sneaker, as well as a capsule of apparel and footwear with SkyHigh Farm Goods.

Hoffmann declined to say if its partnership with Zendaya will get a refresh later this year, but Coppetti pointed to the popularity of the Cloudzoon Moon shoe collaboration it introduced with her this August as evidence of the company’s ability to blend fashion and performance. The shoe — and the fall collection she wore in the campaign — are helping the brand gain “connection and traction with young, aspirational consumers, especially teens,” he said on the earnings call.

Despite the strong showing, analysts still had some reservations. Tom Nikic of Needham & Co. said although On “remains the strongest growth company in our coverage,” he lowered his price target to $52 from $62 “as we believe that multiples in the second have moved structurally lower.” But he retained his “buy” rating on the stock.

Peter McGoldrick of Stifel also maintained a buy rating on the stock, writing that while there may be a “deceleration in fourth-quarter reported revenue growth and higher operating expenses,” he remained encouraged by the results against a challenging environment.

John Kernan of TD Cowen also retained a buy rating on the stock and reiterated his $55 target, and Cristina Fernandez of Telsey Group said the strong results disproved “concerns of a slowdown due to intense competition and a discerning U.S. consumer.”

Shares on Wednesday of On Holding closed up 18 percent to $41.51.

[TITLE]How Does the End Begin?:
[TEXT]
The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 account for 40% of the index’s market cap. Since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, AI-related stocks have registered 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth, and 90% of capital spending growth. Meanwhile, AI investments accounted for nearly 92% of the U.S. GDP growth this year. Without those AI investments, Harvard economist Jason Furman noted, growth would be flat. As Ruchir Sharma concluded in the Financial Times, “America is now one big bet on AI,” adding, “AI better deliver for the U.S., or its economy and markets will lose the one leg they are now standing on.” This concentration creates fragility, and how the end begins becomes more visible.

ICE & Wiping Grandma’s Ass

I’m especially proud of the above header, and there is a connection. The S&P, Nasdaq, and DJIA are some of the most damaging metrics in modern history as they create the illusion of prosperity, even as depravity rages on. The cloud cover for a masked, secret police terrorizing communities is these indices. As long as your 401(k) is going up, then everything must make sense and be okay, no? No. Trump could not send troops into U.S. cities if the S&P were down, vs. up, 13%. AI stocks, and the sugar high they have inspired across the entire market, numb Americans from the nagging tooth pain that we are descending into fascism. Yeah, those evil people who wipe your grandma’s ass, pick our crops, and build our homes can be treated inhumanely as long as Nvidia remains worth more than the entire German stock market.

Trillion-Dollar Question

Valuations for the Mag 10 — the original group of seven leading tech stocks, plus AMD, Broadcom, and Palantir — are high, but not yet at historic peaks. The 24-month forward P/E ratio of the Mag 10 is 35x. In 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, the top 10 stocks traded at 52x forward earnings. Implicit in these valuations, however, is an assumption that AI will help these companies cut costs, or grow revenues by $1 trillion in the next two years. I believe we’re either going to see a massive destruction in valuations, infecting all U.S. stocks and global markets. Or we’re going to see a massive destruction in employment across industries with the highest concentrations of white-collar workers. Both scenarios are ugly.

If Mag 10 valuations are cut in half, the S&P and global markets would decline by 20% and 10%, respectively. In the U.S., the immediate impact would be felt by the wealthiest 10%, who own 87% of the stocks. Those households won’t struggle to pay their bills, but they may be the tail of the whip on the economy, as wealthy households have the luxury of decreasing their spending dramatically, vs. middle-class households, who spend the majority of their income on basics. If the top 10%, who account for half the consumer spending in the U.S., hit the brakes, the nation gets whiplash. I estimate that if the wealthy see their portfolios drop by 20%, we could see a 2-3% decline in GDP. For context: From peak to trough, the Great Recession registered a 4.3% drop in GDP.

If the Mag 10 justify their valuations by delivering $1 trillion in cost-cutting (Latin for “layoffs”), the impact will hit white-collar workers first, but the contagion could spread. Assuming an average white-collar wage of $100,000 per year, that’s 10 million jobs lost and a 6% increase in unemployment. That estimate is conservative compared to the “white-collar bloodbath” predicted by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who told Axios, “AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment 10%–20% in the next one to five years.” The IMF warns that 60% of jobs are already exposed to AI in advanced economies and 40% in emerging markets. According to Okun’s Law, for every 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, real GDP falls by approximately 2 percentage points. But AI could be a different story, with some experts predicting jobless growth. According to a J.P. Morgan report, AI may do to white-collar work what automation did to middle-skill jobs like sales, manufacturing, and construction in the 1980s. The canary in the coal mine may be recent college graduates. Stanford economists found that early-career workers (ages 22 to 25) in the most AI-exposed jobs have experienced a 13% relative decline in employment. If this trend accelerates, today’s challenges around wealth inequality and political volatility will seem quaint.

Past Bubbles

A 2018 study that examined 51 innovations between 1825 and 2000 found 37 were accompanied by bubbles. The destruction that followed in each bubble’s wake, however, varied greatly, depending on several factors. Bubbles inflated by political policies are more destructive than those inflated by new technologies, according to economic historians William Quinn and John Turner. The size of the capital investment is also important. British railway investment in the 1840s was 15%–20% of GDP. When that bubble burst, unemployment doubled. In the U.S., railroad capex averaged 2.4% of GDP in the 1870s. That bubble drove the financial panic of 1873. In both cases, however, those investments paid (delayed) dividends in the form of rail capacity that helped distribute the promise of the Industrial Revolution. In contrast, as The Economist noted, the capex by electronics firms in the 1980s fueled Japan’s asset price bubble, but the spending “ultimately served no useful function.” Finally, the severity of a crash depends on who takes the losses. A second British rail bubble in the 1860s hit banks hard. The recent NFT bubble was a case study in the greater fool theory, but the contagion didn’t reach the broader economy.

Bubble Trouble?

You can’t predict when/if a bubble will burst, but Azeem Azhar, founder of Exponential View, and researcher Nathan Warren, created a framework that compares historic bubbles with AI today. In their estimation, AI is a boom, but “booms can sour quickly and there are several pressure points worth watching.” If AI capex exceeds 2% of GDP, that’s cause for concern; it’s currently estimated at around 1.3%. A sustained fall in enterprise or consumer spending levels is another pressure point. A flawed, though perhaps directionally correct MIT study, rattled the AI ecosystem claiming that 95% of firms have yet to see measurable ROI from their AI pilot programs. We’re approaching a valuation redline if/when P/E ratios reach the 50x to 60x range. Finally, if internal cash covers less than 25% of capex, Azhar and Warren believe investments in data centers will come under pressure.

Dot-Com Vibes

The AI infrastructure build-out has accelerated recently with an estimated $1 trillion in new commitments. Some firms are making deals with money and assets that don’t yet exist. See: OpenAI promising Oracle $300 billion — money it doesn’t have — for infrastructure Oracle hasn’t built. In other cases, revenue comes from “circular financing,” where dollars rotate between firms, obscuring true market demand. See: Nvidia’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which OpenAI will use to buy … Nvidia chips. Circular financing deals were common toward the end of the dot-com bubble, when similar deals contributed to a crash that destroyed 77% of Nasdaq market value. If we are on the precipice of a bubble popping, Nvidia and OpenAI will likely be ground zero. But the fallout would be widespread, as an ecosystem that resembles an ouroboros lives and dies by a shared narrative.

Fragile

In his book Irrational Exuberance Robert Shiller wrote, “The word ‘bubble’ creates a mental picture of an expanding soap bubble, which is destined to pop suddenly and irrevocably. But speculative bubbles are as easily ended; indeed, they may deflate somewhat, as the story changes, and then reflate.” The operative word is “story.” Entrepreneurs, aka storytellers, deploy narratives to capture imaginations and capital in order to pull the future forward. Valuations aren’t a function of balance sheets, but of the stories that give those balance sheets meaning and direction. In the case of AI, a key storyline is shifting. A Prof G analysis of ChatGPT data found that work-related prompts fell from 47% in 2022 to 27% in 2025; ChatGPT has 76% market share. As my Markets cohost Ed Elson said, “the bull case for AI is that it’s going to transform work, but what we’re learning is it’s mostly just affecting your personal life.”

The trouble isn’t the shifting narrative, but the fragility of America’s bet on AI and wealthy consumers driving growth. If McDonald’s goes out of business, the fast-food industry will continue to meet demand for cheap calories; the industry is robust (i.e., anti-fragile). J.P. Morgan, now worth more than the 10 biggest banks in the EU combined, is too big to fail. America’s bet on AI is now a bet without hedge. If companies that aren’t the Mag 10 (i.e., the S&P 490) report they’re scaling back AI investments as the adoption layer fails to launch, the connective tissue between AI, trillions in market cap, and the broader economy severs. The experts have already deemed the grid and electrons as the gating factor to our AI future. However, they’re ignoring a more glaring possibility: AI may be more like VR than GPS and just not offer the ROI built into these valuations. Also, citizens burned by tech executives writing books on gender balance as they launch products that result in teen girls cutting themselves may decide character AI and porn are disastrous for our sons.

If China’s AI program produces another “Sputnik moment” similar to DeepSeek earlier this year, valuations for U.S. AI firms could tumble. And if reports including Apple’s “The Illusion of Thinking” extinguish the hope that artificial general intelligence is near, AI, and by extension the American economy, may experience a significant correction. We’re the biggest economy in the world and the most powerful nation in history. However, concentrating wealth in so few hands, betting on so few companies, makes us fragile.

When asked what one piece of advice I’d give young people, I offer “Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.” Our economy rests on the belief that AI is even better than it seems. Careful…

Life is so rich,

P.S. For Prof G Conversations I spoke with Kai Ryssdal, host and senior editor of Marketplace. We discussed the risk of stagflation, the growing divide between the top 10% and everyone else, and why America’s economic strength still depends on the health of its democratic institutions. Listen here, and watch here.

[TITLE]Trump Secures New Trade Deal Frameworks in Europe and Latin America:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump this week secured five new trade deal frameworks to reduce U.S. costs of living, foster greater foreign investment, and address Washington’s trade deficits with other nations. Whether these deals will be enough to reduce high U.S. grocery prices and counter Chinese competition on critical minerals, though, is still to be seen.

Welcome back to World Brief, where we’re looking at the White House ’s latest trade deals, China ’s anger over U.S. and Japanese support for Taiwan , and a massive Russian assault on Kyiv .

[TITLE]The Trump Trade Tracker:
[TEXT]
That deadline has been extended both formally and informally, and the trade deals have been few and far between since that initial announcement.

It’s not quite the “ 90 deals in 90 days ” that Trump administration officials claimed were possible back in April, when U.S. President Donald Trump put a 90-day pause on the steep tariffs that he had announced on nearly all U.S. trading partners on April 2. The 90-day pause was intended to allow time for those trading partners to negotiate bilateral deals with Washington to avoid the worst of the tariffs.

It’s not quite the “90 deals in 90 days” that Trump administration officials claimed were possible back in April, when U.S. President Donald Trump put a 90-day pause on the steep tariffs that he had announced on nearly all U.S. trading partners on April 2. The 90-day pause was intended to allow time for those trading partners to negotiate bilateral deals with Washington to avoid the worst of the tariffs.

That deadline has been extended both formally and informally, and the trade deals have been few and far between since that initial announcement.

But several countries have signed trade agreements with Trump with varying degrees of permanence and formality, often locking in lower tariff rates than the ones he previously threatened in exchange for lowering their own trade barriers to U.S. goods.

New Tariff Rates Based on Preliminary White House Deals

Many of these agreements have been made public by unilateral announcements, either from the White House or by Trump directly on his social media platform Truth Social (though in all cases the countries or governments in question have acknowledged the deal on their side).

These also don’t appear to be formal, binding agreements, unlike, say, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which was ratified by all three countries. The European Union described its deal as a “political agreement,” and multiple countries including the Philippines and the United Kingdom indicated in their statements that further negotiations on specific products and sectors will continue—leaving room for additional disagreements or disputes.

The vast majority of countries still face the sweeping tariffs that Trump sought to impose on April 2, and for the sake of clarity, we have used those tariff rates as a comparison—even though in some cases Trump has threatened higher tariffs in the interim. The other caveat is that these numbers aren’t always definitive or all-encompassing. The administration has said U.S. tariffs on steel, for example, will be negotiated separately, and the tariff rates below have some additional exemptions that we will explain further.

That said, here is everything we know

[TITLE]Govt withdraws BIS norms on polyester chain, polymers; user industry cites relief on costs for MSMEs:
[TEXT]
The Centre has withdrawn quality control orders (QCOs) on a wide range of polyester and petrochemical inputs, in a move that spells relief for user industries such as apparel and footwear, while raising competition from imports for local manufacturers of these key inputs.

QCOs issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) subject manufacturers and importers of specific goods to certain standards. While they ensure greater quality, they also raise costs, which cascade down to industries which use these raw materials.

The order from the department of chemicals and petrochemicals comes after a Niti Aayog committee led by former cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba recommended relaxing QCOs. These orders raise costs for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which import them in large quantities.

While the withdrawal will make raw materials accessible for makers of textiles and PVC products, it may impact manufacturers such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and the Aditya Birla Group companies Grasim and Thai Acrylic Fibre.

Also Read | Filatex bets on polyester recycling and renewables for next phase of growth

Queries sent to Indian Oil and the Aditya Birla Group remained unanswered till press time.

Reliance has always priced its products keeping the long-term growth of textile industry in mind, a company spokesperson said in an email. "This has been our philosophy from the from the day we started manufacturing products & polyester and integrated backwards. We welcome the decision of the government, and we will continue to stay competitive offering the best quality products to the downstream industry for domestic and value-added export market."

The withdrawal of QCOs fulfils an MSME industry wish, significantly benefiting textile makers, said Rahul Mehta, chief mentor of the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India. However, it also goes against the government's original plan to expand the ambit of QCOs to cover more products.

The raw materials now free of QCOs are used to make man-made fibres, plastics, packaging, footwear, consumer goods, appliances and automotive components. Several of them such as PTA, MEG, polypropylene, PVC and ABS are among India’s most critical chemical imports, sourced from China, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Thailand and Singapore. Products like polyester staple fibre, POY and FDY also rely on imports during periods of domestic shortage, particularly from China and Indonesia.

Welcome decision

Just last week, the Chemicals and Petrochemicals Manufacturers Association had written to the government, making a strong case for QCOs. While industries abroad benefitted from state subsidies, India's QCOs helped counter them, the association had said. On Thursday, the association did not respond to a query

[TITLE]Global retail rebound lifts outlook for Indian apparel exporters:
[TEXT]
Global retail demand is showing signs of recovery, signaling a potential turnaround for Indian garment exporters. Leading players such as Gokaldas Exports and Pearl Global Industries are reworking their strategies, diversifying markets, expanding production bases outside India, and positioning for trade advantages under proposed free trade agreements (FTAs).

The companies, in post-Q2 investor calls, indicated that order inflows from key markets such as the US and Europe have begun to stabilise, with new business emerging from regions like Japan and Australia. This, combined with the ongoing sourcing diversification by global retailers, is expected to set the stage for a steadier growth cycle for Indian exporters.

“In the longer term, sourcing diversification is a key theme for all customers. With likely tariff rationalisation, India will remain one of the top contenders among Asian peers,” said Sivaramakrishnan Ganapathi, Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of Gokaldas Exports.

“The recently announced India-UK FTA offers a 12 per cent duty advantage over China and puts India on par with Bangladesh, creating strong export potential. A trade deal with the EU could open significant opportunities as well,” he added.

Gokaldas, which has been expanding its footprint in the UK and EU, is witnessing growing visibility from its Africa operations, leveraging the low-tariff regime and potential renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Currently, Africa contributes

[TITLE]Walmart shares are up 312% during outgoing CEO Doug McMillon's tenure. Here's how that compares to its rivals:
[TEXT]
Walmart logo is seen near the store in Austin, United States on Oct. 23, 2025.

When incoming Walmart CEO John Furner steps into the retailer's top role, he will try to follow up a period of dramatic share growth that many of Walmart's rivals have failed to match.

Walmart's stock has more than quadrupled since outgoing CEO Doug McMillon began in the role in February 2014. Across nine of the 12 calendar years when McMillon has been Walmart's leader, the company posted positive stock returns.

Among Walmart's main rivals in the retail and grocery business, only Amazon and Costco have had better stock returns since McMillon took the job. Meanwhile, Walmart's stock has outperformed those of competitors like Target , Dollar General , Dollar Tree , Kroger and Albertsons .

McMillon will officially step down at the end of January, but will stay on as executive chairman and advisor. While Furner will face a challenge in replicating the company's performance under his predecessor, he has been a key catalyst for the company's success as CEO of its largest sector, Walmart's U.S. business.

Along with huge gains on Wall Street, McMillon oversaw a significant period of growth for the nation's largest grocer, which included sharp sales increases, wage hikes for hourly workers and transformation of the nation's low-price leader into a major e-commerce player. He also steered the retailer through the tumult of a global pandemic, historic levels of inflation and higher tariffs.

Sales during McMillon's first three years in the role were roughly flat — with revenues of $486 billion, $482 billion and $485 billion in the fiscal years ending January 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Yet those years were followed by steady growth, and those gains have accelerated since 2021, after the Covid pandemic pushed more people to shop online and inflation nudged even wealthier shoppers to seek value. Walmart posted annual revenue of about $681 billion in the fiscal year ended earlier this year, an approximately 40% jump from the company's annual revenue the first year of McMillon's tenure.

This year, Walmart is on track to post annual revenues of over $700 billion for the first time ever. Ironically, however, it is also expected to lose its crown as the largest retailer by annual revenue to its biggest e-commerce rival, Amazon .

Earlier this year, Amazon leapfrogged Walmart in quarterly sales for the first time. Compared to Walmart, it has a different mix to its business because of its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses.

[TITLE]Walmart CEO Doug McMillon delivered 15% annual returns:
[TEXT]
Walmart CEO Doug McMillon delivered 15% annual returns

The retiring executive’s decade-long tenure produced stronger shareholder returns than most other recently departed chief executives

Doug McMillon is leaving Walmart with an impressive track record. The chief executive announced his retirement plans for January, capping a decade of leadership that delivered some of the strongest returns among recently departing CEOs at major corporations.

A Reuters analysis examining companies that changed leadership over the past 18 months reveals how McMillon’s performance stacks up against peers. The study included major names like Nestle and Starbucks, providing context for evaluating executive performance across different industries and market conditions.

Ranking the annualized returns

In terms of annualized total returns, Walmart secured second place among the companies analyzed. Under McMillon’s leadership since January 2014, the retail giant posted 15% annualized total returns, calculated from the day before he assumed office through November 14, 2025.

Only Danish jewelry brand Pandora outperformed Walmart in this metric. Under Alexander Lacik’s leadership beginning in February 2019, Pandora delivered 17% annualized total returns to shareholders. The company announced in September that Lacik would retire in March and be succeeded by marketing chief Berta de Pablos-Barbier.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, German sportswear brand Puma struggled significantly. Under Arne Freundt, the company posted a negative 36.6% annualized total return before he was replaced in April by former Adidas sales chief Arthur Hoeld. The dramatic underperformance highlights the challenges facing some European fashion and sportswear brands.

Total return measurements tell another story

When examining cumulative total returns rather than annualized figures, the rankings shift somewhat. French luxury group Kering claimed top honors with an extraordinary 520% total return over 20 years under Francois-Henri Pinault’s leadership from March 2005 through September 2025.

Walmart captured second place in this measurement as well, delivering 419% total returns during McMillon’s tenure. This substantial figure demonstrates consistent value creation for shareholders over an extended period rather than short-term gains followed by stagnation.

Several well-known companies performed poorly by this measure. Drinks group Diageo, athletic wear giant Nike and KitKat maker Nestle ranked among the worst performers, suggesting challenges in their respective industries or execution issues under departing leadership.

McMillon’s transformation of Walmart

McMillon took control of Walmart in January 2014 during a critical period for traditional retail. The rise of e-commerce threatened brick-and-mortar retailers, with Amazon emerging as a dominant force reshaping consumer shopping habits.

Under his leadership, Walmart invested heavily in digital capabilities while leveraging its massive physical footprint as a competitive advantage. The company developed robust online ordering systems, curbside pickup services and same-day delivery options that integrated digital convenience with existing store networks.

These investments required significant capital expenditures and short-term profit sacrifices but positioned Walmart to compete effectively against pure-play online retailers. The strategy proved particularly valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic when consumers rapidly shifted toward online shopping and contactless fulfillment options.

McMillon also prioritized employee wages and benefits, raising minimum pay levels and expanding opportunities for advancement. While these moves increased operating costs, they helped reduce turnover and improve customer service quality at a time when labor markets tightened significantly.

Leadership transition plans

Walmart announced that U.S. division chief John Furner would succeed McMillon as CEO. Furner has deep experience within the company and familiarity with its operations, suggesting continuity in strategic direction rather than dramatic changes.

Internal succession planning demonstrates board confidence in the company’s leadership development processes. Organizations that successfully promote from within typically maintain cultural continuity while avoiding the disruption and uncertainty that sometimes accompanies external CEO searches.

Furner faces challenges including ongoing e-commerce competition, inflation pressures affecting consumer spending, and the need to continue modernizing Walmart’s technology infrastructure. However, he inherits a company in strong financial position with clear competitive advantages in retail.

Broader CEO transition trends

The Reuters analysis captured a period of unusual CEO turnover across major corporations. Multiple factors have driven these changes, including mandatory retirement ages, performance issues, strategic disagreements with boards, and executives choosing to step down for personal reasons.

CEO transitions often trigger stock volatility as investors assess whether new leadership will maintain successful strategies or pursue different directions. Companies with clear succession plans and strong internal candidates typically experience less disruption than those conducting external searches.

The performance comparisons highlight how different industries and business models affect returns independent of CEO quality. Luxury goods companies like Kering benefited from strong demand growth in emerging markets, while traditional consumer goods companies faced mature markets and intense competition.

What the numbers reveal

McMillon’s strong performance metrics reflect both skillful leadership and favorable industry dynamics. Walmart entered his tenure with significant competitive advantages including scale, supplier relationships, real estate holdings and brand recognition.

However, those advantages alone didn’t guarantee success. Other large retailers with similar starting positions struggled during the same period. McMillon’s willingness to invest in digital transformation despite short-term cost pressures distinguished Walmart’s approach from competitors who moved more slowly or half-heartedly embraced e-commerce.

The 15% annualized return and 419% cumulative return figures place McMillon among successful long-tenured CEOs at major corporations. These returns exceeded broader market benchmarks over the same period while navigating significant industry disruption.

Legacy and future outlook

As McMillon prepares to step down, his tenure will be remembered for successfully steering Walmart through digital transformation while maintaining its position as America’s largest retailer. The company enters new leadership with strong competitive positioning and clear strategic direction.

Whether Furner can maintain similar performance levels remains uncertain. Different economic conditions, competitive dynamics and consumer preferences will shape his tenure differently than McMillon’s decade. However, the strong foundation established provides advantages as Walmart continues evolving in an increasingly digital retail landscape.

[TITLE]Scento Invests €25M to Revolutionize European Luxury Perfume Discovery and Transform Online Fragrance Shopping at Scale:
[TEXT]
Paris, France, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scento, Europe’s premium fragrance discovery retailer, today announced a €25 million strategic investment to revolutionize how European consumers discover, experience, and purchase designer and niche fragrances online. Headquartered at the prestigious Place Vendôme in Paris – the historic epicenter of haute parfumerie – Scento is deploying capital to transform the €19 billion European fragrance market through authenticated supply partnerships, AI-driven scent personalization, and proprietary machine learning technology.

The investment accelerates Scento’s expansion across all 19 European markets, deepens the continent’s largest authenticated catalog of over 2,000 designer perfume brands and niche luxury fragrance houses, and scales proprietary AI recommendation algorithms that match individual customers with personalized scent profiles based on olfactory preferences, lifestyle patterns, and seasonal mood variations.

“The legacy perfume industry optimized for single-bottle loyalty and repeat purchases of the same fragrance. Modern consumers don’t live that way – our identities, preferences, and daily rituals are fluid,” said Sebastian Dobrincu, Co-Founder and CEO of Scento. “Scento builds the future of luxury fragrance retail by respecting this natural fluidity. We combine authenticated supply chains with AI-powered fragrance discovery to deliver the right premium scent at the right moment. Discovery feels personal, intelligent, and effortless – customers return because our platform adapts to their evolving taste, not because we’ve locked them into rigid subscription models.”

Addressing Critical Friction in the €19 Billion European Fragrance Market

The European luxury perfume and fragrance market—valued at €19 billion in 2025 and projected to grow at a 2.69% CAGR through 2030—has historically suffered from significant e-commerce friction. Online perfume shopping faces notoriously high return rates and customer uncertainty due to the inability to physically experience scent before purchase. Scento’s breakthrough model eliminates this barrier by combining authenticated fragrance sampling with AI-driven olfactory profiling, creating a trusted digital pathway from initial scent discovery to full-size luxury bottle purchase.

Unlike traditional perfume retailers and fragrance subscription boxes, Scento leverages proprietary machine learning algorithms to analyze individual scent preferences, skin chemistry compatibility, seasonal preferences, occasion-based needs, and fragrance family affinities. This AI-powered personalization engine processes thousands of data points across designer fragrances, niche perfume houses, and independent artisanal creators to deliver hyper-personalized fragrance recommendations that evolve with each customer interaction.

Strategic Investment Priorities: Technology, Authentication, and Market Expansion

Scento’s €25 million investment funds three strategic growth initiatives designed to cement the company’s position as Europe’s definitive luxury fragrance discovery destination:

Authenticated Supply Network Expansion: Scaling direct partnerships with over 2,000 verified designer perfume brands and niche luxury fragrance houses—from prestigious Parisian maisons and heritage Italian perfumers to emerging independent artisanal creators—ensuring 100% authenticity verification and eliminating counterfeit risk in online perfume retail. AI-Driven Fragrance Discovery at Scale: Deploying advanced machine learning infrastructure across all 19 European markets to power personalized scent profiling, olfactory preference mapping, real-time recommendation algorithms, and predictive fragrance matching that adapts to seasonal trends, occasion-based needs, and individual lifestyle evolution. Next-Generation Perfume E-Commerce Infrastructure: Building technology systems to support multi-market digital perfumery operations, including localized scent discovery experiences, authenticated sampling logistics, full-bottle conversion optimization, and premium customer service tailored to luxury fragrance shoppers across diverse European markets.

World-Record Innovation: First Brand Launched at 41,000 Feet

[TITLE]Online Design Platforms Are Charting New Revenue Streams:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Design websites have been on an upward swing since the COVID-19 pandemic ignited an appetite for all things home. And while the personal luxury goods market is expected to show a drop in revenues this year, luxury home websites are expanding their reach to a broad spectrum of clients in search of curated solutions for residential and hospitality spaces.

That sort of edge starts with offline branded and luxury residential and hospitality projects, from the deserts of the United Arab Emirates to the streets of New York City. These bespoke commissions are providing a strong new revenue stream for e-commerce players on and offline.

A prime example of how this relationship is burgeoning is The Greenwich in New York City, with which Italian design platform Artemest took a deep dive into the luxury real estate world, unveiling its first model residence concept in a penthouse valued at $13.5 million in 2024. The project’s main partners said the idea behind inviting Italian brands and designers to imbue select spaces with their signature flair was part of a broader effort to build the residence as a strong brand. This sort of strategy is echoing worldwide. It also highlights a broader effort to create a narrative within new spaces and distinguish properties with hard-to-find, rare pieces.

Earlier in November, Artemest also unveiled a fully furnished penthouse in London, located at Embassy Gardens. Inside the property, every detail — from sculptural lighting to bespoke furniture — was sourced from Artemest.

Artemest’s chief executive officer Marco Credendino said emerging markets in the Middle East, where contract business is booming, are a major driver of sales. “The business has evolved from being focused purely on residential projects to a balanced mix that includes hospitality and food and beverage. Bespoke contract work is becoming a significant part of our business,” he said.

Overall, Artemest said it expects 35 percent year-on-year growth in 2025, reaching roughly $40 million in revenue. The first half of the year has already reflected that positive trajectory, he said. “This confirms that our model — blending Italian craftsmanship with a global digital and offline presence — continues to resonate strongly with clients around the world,” Credendino said.

A Leg-up

Online operations are also able to execute projects in a way interior design firms alone cannot. An added edge for an operation like Artemest is its roster of 1,000 artisans and designers at its fingertips to choose from. The firm also has an in-house team that guides clients through every step of the project, from creative concept to delivery, working with trusted partners to bridge the gap between consumer and producer.

“What makes the difference for us is the way we approach it — every project is treated as a one-of-a-kind collaboration, where the goal is to deliver something truly exceptional and tailored. Clients today are looking for warmth, character, and a sense of identity in their public spaces, and that’s exactly what Italian craftsmanship brings: authenticity, quality, and the unmistakable touch of Made in Italy,” he said.

Competition Is Growing

In December, London-based platform Invisible Collection revealed the completion of its first bespoke interior design project for The Surrey’s private residences in New York City. Like Artemest, Invisible Collection has a similar network edge and was able to provide one-of-a-kind interior design services, affording prospective buyers access to a bespoke curation of contemporary furniture from the platform’s roster of well-known talents.

Architectural designer Laura Gonzalez, architect and interior decorator Charles Zana and architect and furniture designer Thierry Lemaire are among those who fit in with the platform’s enriched contemporary French aesthetic.

On Tuesday, Invisible Collection unveiled its exclusive partnership with luxury and branded residential development operator Rhodium, a leading adviser and operator of ultra-luxury and branded residential developments. Going forward, the two companies will offer developers and homeowners an integrated service that combines operational expertise with made-to-order interior design by some of the world’s most respected designers and artisans.

“We launched Invisible Collection with design connoisseurs and collectors in mind, thinking of all the sophisticated residential projects that call for bespoke, made-to-order creations. I think we are succeeding, as our worldwide sales are largely driven by this clientele.” Invisible Collection cofounder Isabelle Dubern-Mallevays told WWD.

Game-changing Terrain

When Milan-based Dexelance, which owns upscale furniture and lighting firms Meridiani, Davide Groppi and Gervasoni, bought Mohd, a historic furniture business and early pioneer of the online luxury design business, showrooms in the U.S. saw this as a possible game changer for Dexelance, which only recently established showrooms in New York City and Boston.

Mohd, which was established in Sicily in the 1960s, currently has
