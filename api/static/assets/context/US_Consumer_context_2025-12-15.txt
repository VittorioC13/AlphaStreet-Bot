[TITLE]CEO TALKS: Galeries Lafayette’s Nicolas Houzé Talks Big Investment Bets as ‘Boring Retail Is Dead’:
[TEXT]
PARIS — Retail runs in Nicolas Houzé’s blood.

A fifth-generation member of the French family behind Galeries Lafayette, Houzé joined the business in 2006, led the department store as chief executive officer for more than a decade, then followed his father’s footsteps into the role of chair of the group’s executive board last year.

In addition to steering the Galeries Lafayette Group, he chairs France’s strategic committee for fashion and luxury and presides over the union of city-center retailers. On Dec. 1, he was also named president of the International Association of Department Stores, taking the helm as global retail continues to seek recovery.

Last month, Houzé marked a milestone for the group by opening Galeries Lafayette’s first store in India, which is the country’s first stand-alone high-street department store. He has been central to leading the company’s post-pandemic recovery while expanding its international footprint and navigating the shifting trends in fashion, e-commerce and rapidly-changing consumer habits.

In a wide-ranging interview in his office with sweeping views of the Sacré-Cœur, Houzé said the group is doubling down on its department-store model even as much of the industry pulls back, and gaining traction from a growing demand for watches, jewelry and beauty, following the overall rebound at its Paris flagship.

Early acquisitions of multibrand retailers Louis Pion and Royal Quartz, and later the Mauboussin jewelry brand, helped secure the group’s position in the watch and jewelry segment and reinforced relationships with brands such as Rolex — all of which were aimed at strengthening Galeries Lafayette’s core business.

While many were sounding the death knell for brick-and-mortar retail during the pandemic, the group took a counterintuitive bet with a 400 million euro investment to renovate its flagship on Boulevard Haussmann in Paris over four years. The move paid off, with sales returning to 2019 levels by 2024.

A further 400 million euros is now earmarked for upgrades in Paris — including a full overhaul of the stand-alone men’s building to be completed by the end of 2027 — and across its regional network, positioning the family-owned retailer for a new phase of growth.

Galeries Lafayette is still pursuing measured international expansion and strengthening its brand globally. It is reexamining its China strategy, and has an eye on opportunities in the Middle East, including Riyadh.

Houzé spoke to WWD

[TITLE]Target wants to revive ‘Tar-zhay.’ It just debuted a preview of that in New York:
[TEXT]
New York —

Target hopes that a recapturing of its cultural cachet will spark a turnaround for its business. It’s turning to a fashion-forward New York neighborhood to get started.

The chain unveiled its first-ever concept store in SoHo this week, adorned with stylish apparel, designer collaborations, and beauty products — all key areas that its incoming CEO hopes will revive its former “Tar-zhay” glory.

Michael Fiddelke, Target’s current chief operating officer, is replacing longtime leader Brian Cornell as CEO in February. Following the August announcement, he immediately laid out his vision to recover Target’s image as being both affordable and trendy.

A focus on design is certainly evident at the location at 600 Broadway, which doesn’t look like a typical drably lit big-box store. Shoppers enter through Target’s trademark bullseye, which is adorned with red-colored shelves filled with new products, and then continue through a corridor to the redesigned beauty and makeup section.

“Michael has been really clear coming in that we are a design-led company and that means not just the products that we carry, but how we actually think through the decisions that drive our overall experience,” Cara Sylvester, Target’s chief guest experience officer, told CNN.

Target has been in a deep slump for years, largely due to its own strategic missteps. Sales began to falter in 2022 as post-pandemic shoppers pulled back spending, with the brand eventually losing customers to rivals like Walmart and Amazon.

Sylvester noted that Fiddelke has three clear priorities to aid in a turnaround: better merchandise, an elevated in-store experience with remodels and improved technology.

“What you’re seeing here is really the first two priorities come to life,” she said of the SoHo store.

Oliver Chen, a retail and luxury analyst for TD Cowen, said Target’s concept store can be a good showcase to help bring back that “Tar-zhay” luster.

“This can really help when Target’s trying to embrace new brands to be rolled out,” he told CNN, adding that people want to “love” the retailer again.

In transition

The turnaround efforts in SoHo could mean broader changes more than 1,000 miles away at Target’s headquarters in Minneapolis and at its more than 2,000 locations nationwide.

The retailer released another dismal earnings report in November, partially because consumers are cutting back on non-essential spending like home goods and fashion — key areas for Target. More than half of Target’s sales are discretionary.

It’s also reeling from a consumer boycott after it cut back its diversity, equality and inclusion efforts earlier this year. Target (TGT) shares have lost a third of their value in 2025.

However, Joe Feldman, senior managing director at Telsey Advisory Group, said the brand has felt “off” since well before this year.

He traces Target’s loss of cultural appeal back to June 2023, when it found itself immersed in controversy after pulling Pride month merchandise at some of its stores.

Target originally opened the location in 2022 and sits at 600 Broadway. Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for Target

“That’s part of why the business has not been as strong ever since then and they’ve had fits and starts, but generally speaking, their business hasn’t really recovered,” he told CNN.

Target also has more competition when it comes to trendy home goods and fashion sold at lower prices, Feldman said. That includes rivals like Walmart, but also Wayfair and off-price retailers like T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, Marshall’s and Ross Dress for Less.

“Target was trying to fix the day-to-day issues facing them and lost track of the merchandising,” he said.

Feldman praised Target’s private-label kid clothing and denim selection. But although he’s seen minor improvements in fashion, there’s “still a lot of work to be done” with its home products.

Chen agreed that home goods is Target’s “biggest problem.” That’s due in part to the housing slowdown and because shoppers are pulling back spending on higher-priced items.

Stylish SoHo

When the Target SoHo location initially opened in 2022, it mostly focused on convenience store fare, like packaged foods and drug store items. There was only a small selection of home goods and fresh foods.

The refreshed store now showcases clothing in its Target-esque logo at the entrance. That was a missed opportunity for a neighborhood like SoHo, Sylvester said, flanked with flagships from New Balance, Aritizia and American Eagle.

The front of the store will be changed monthly. Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for Target

The front will be freshened up with a new theme monthly, currently displaying affordable holiday gifts.

Another key area is a “Curated By” section, a monthly selection of Target offerings chosen by a New York City celebrity. The inaugural edition was picked by comedian and actress Megan Stalter.

In the back of the store are Target-branded gifts aimed at tourists, along with a revamped beauty section. The latter is a category where the retailer can be competitive, Feldman said, because young shoppers are attracted to the celeb-led space.

Beauty makes up 12% of Target’s bottom line, according to its annual report, with sales growing for the past three years. Still, it’s had some stumbles after its partnership with Ulta ended.

Target admits that all the changes made to the SoHo location, which reopens this weekend, won’t be introduced universally across the country. But Sylvester expects the store to provide “a lot of learnings of how can we scale pieces and parts of it.”

Incoming CEO Fiddelke also appeared at last Monday’s press preview, with Feldman noting that his “fingerprints” are on the concept because his name was mentioned in the

[TITLE]Rural demand surges as GST rate cuts, slowing inflation help to boost consumption:
[TEXT]
NEW DELHI: India’s rural economy expanded and recovered strongly in late 2025, with consumption, incomes and investment improving after a key tax reform and as inflation eased, a survey showed.

So far this year, 79.2% of the rural households increased consumption expenditure – the highest so far in FY26 – compared with 76.2% in the previous round, according to the November 2025 round of NABARD’s Rural Economic Conditions and Sentiments Survey (RECSS). Additionally, 67.3% of monthly income is now spent on consumption, the highest share since the survey began, aided by GST rate rationalization.

The survey was conducted after the rationalization of the goods and services tax was announced by the GST Council on 3 September during the festival season and against a backdrop of a sharp moderation in rural inflation and food deflation. The results were mixed during this period for companies benefiting from lower taxation as consumers postponed purchases in anticipation of the revised rates.

The GST rate cuts that came into effect on 22 September positively impacted categories such as television, automobiles, air-conditioners, refrigerators, soaps, and biscuits.

“The rural consumption demand buoyancy appears to have received a boost after the GST rate rationalization, with improved real purchasing power of rural non-farm income due to softer inflation also contributing to the momentum,” as per the survey findings.

Also Read | After rate cuts, GST Council moves to tackle inverted duty anomalies

Large consumer companies such as Nestlé, Parle Products and Marico reported similar trends in the September quarter. Several companies continue to double down on the rural markets.

Biscuit maker Parle Products registered faster growth in its ₹10- ₹20 price packs in the rural markets after the GST reduction. In India’s snacking category, ₹5- ₹10 packs account for the bulk of the market.

“As a result of the reduction in GST, overall consumption has gone up… some of the premium items have seen really good traction. In rural sales, we've seen good traction and good growth coming in lower-unit packs of our premium products as well,” said Mayank Shah of Parle.

This includes ₹10 and ₹20 packs of Hide & Seek, Milano and NutriChoice biscuits. Parle also sells Parle-G biscuits for as low as ₹2. GST on biscuits was reduced to 5% from 18%.

The rise in consumption coincided with perceptions of rural households of inflation easing to 3.77%, falling below 4% for the first time since the survey was initiated.

Rural growth India’s rural markets are hugely important for large consumer goods makers. The rural markets account for 38% of sales for packaged consumer goods and two-thirds of Indians living and earning livelihood.

Nestlé India is building the right portfolio and distribution to tap more rural consumers, chairman and managing director Manish Tiwary said in a recent interview with Mint.

“We definitely now have prosperity in those markets. In the last two years, rural is clocking twice the growth of urban markets. To tap rural markets, you need the right technology to make sure you do it at the right cost,” he said.

The packaged foods maker gets 15% of its sales from the rural markets and plans to increase this share.

“It needs the right portfolio and the right reach initiatives—we are working on both. Rural is growing 1.5-1.6 times that of urban,” he added.

Demand for FMCG in the rural markets grew faster than in the urban areas in the three months ended September, according to market researcher NIQ. Volume growth in the rural areas stood at 7.7% in the quarter, compared with 3.7% in the urban markets.

“The Indian FMCG sector continues to demonstrate resilience, with rural markets leading the charge for seven consecutive quarters. While urban recovery is gaining traction, particularly in smaller towns, rural demand remains the cornerstone of volume expansion,” NIQ said.

Stronger macros India’s economy recorded an unexpected six-quarter high growth rate of 8.2% in July-September, the government said in late November. Growth was helped by stronger expansion in manufacturing, financial services and consumption.

Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) growth rose to 7.9% from 7.1% in the prior quarter. Retail inflation slowed to 1.7% in the September quarter from 2.7% in Q1, while wholesale inflation eased to 0.02% from 0.26%.

It helps that food inflation—accounting for nearly 40% of the CPI basket—has been in negative territory for five months, pulling down overall inflation.

“With the decline in rural food prices over four consecutive months (June-September 2025), a section of the rural households seems to have increased the share of total monthly consumption devoted to food, and as a result, the overall share of food in monthly consumption expenditure rose to 55.4%, which is the highest among all rounds of this survey,” according to the survey.

Parle’s Shah said the rural markets are currently growing 8-10% for the biscuit maker, with urban growth at 4-5%.

“If you look at the last six to seven quarters, rural growth has been outpacing urban… overall macroeconomic indicators are very positive for rural,” he said.

Manoj Verma, COO at Bikaji Foods, which draws 45% of its business from the rural markets, said, “In the last one year we have seen a lot of small, local players emerge in rural markets, and when you refer to external data, growth is driven by unit packs, which means that small packs overall, in terms of consumption, have grown faster, indicating stronger demand emerging from rural market.”

Sharper focus Others expect greater focus on rural markets going forward.

“Over the next few years, the centre of gravity for volume growth across wider consumption categories will increasingly shift to rural markets as households move beyond subsistence into small but steady upgrades in food, personal care, mobility, and home essentials, provided monsoons remain supportive and real rural incomes start to turn decisively upward,” said Deepak H, country head and partner at Ipsos Strategy3, India, the management consulting and strategy arm of Ipsos.

During its September quarter earnings call, Hindustan Unilever CEO and managing director Priya Nair said, “There is a huge transformation taking place in rural areas in the country and we will double down behind growing across the price brand pyramid of the country.”

The recent GST rate reforms directly benefitted 40% of HUL's portfolio, which has now moved to the 5% GST slab. The company has planned “bolder marketing transformation and channel transformation” for the rural markets.

[TITLE]Retail inflation inches up to 0.7% in Nov on higher food prices:
[TEXT]
Retail inflation based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 0.71 per cent in November against the multi-year low of 0.3 per cent in October, government data showed on Friday. With this, experts feel another round of policy interest rate (repo rate) cut is possible.

“The increase in headline inflation and food inflation during November 2025 is mainly attributed to increase in inflation of vegetables, egg, meat and fish, spices, fuel and light,” the Statistics Ministry said. The headline number has been below the median rate (4 per cent) of targeted inflation range of 2 per cent to 6 per cent for ten successive months. November is the second successive month of below 1 per cent inflation rate.

Core inflation (headline inflation minus food and fuel inflation) stood at 4.2 per cent in November, slightly lower than 4.3 per cent of October. “The impact from GST rate cuts was visible in segments like clothing & footwear, household goods & services, recreation & amusement and transport & communication,” a note by HDFC Bank said.

Rate cut

Looking ahead, inflation is expected to rise. “While the inflation trajectory is expected to move upward from here on, we see the trajectory fairly benign until 1HFY27. Going ahead, with RBI having kept additional actions data dependent we see some room for 25bp of repo rate cut,” said Upasna Bhardwaj, Chief Economist, Kotak Mahindra Bank. However, the rate cutting cycle is clearly nearing the end, followed by a prolonged pause, she added.

Garima Kapoor, Economist at Elara Capital, also felt that rate cut is possible. “Headline CPI for FY26 will likely undershoot RBI’s estimate by 15-20 bps. With visibility of the print remaining below 4 per cent in Q1FY27, we believe room for another 25bps rate cut is still open,” she said.

According to Rajni Sinha, Chief Economist at CareEdge, the upcoming introduction of the new CPI series will be an important development to monitor. From a monetary policy perspective, the recent rise in inflation is unlikely to be a concern for the RBI. “Even though there is scope for another 25 bps rate cut based on the inflation projection, we expect the MPC to pause and preserve the policy space for a future rate cut only if the growth outlook worsens,” she said.

Some economists felt that the developments with regard to the trade deal with the US will also have bearing on rate cut. A note by Barclays anticipated that inconclusive trade talks between India and the US, pushing trade deal expectations to March, are likely to pose headwinds to growth.

“Should India continue to face 50 per cent tariffs (25 per cent reciprocal + 25 per cent secondary) until the February 6 meeting, the risk of a follow-up 25 bp cut is real. In our base case, we expect the punitive 25 per cent secondary tariffs on India to get waived off by then and thus expect a pause at the February 2026 meeting, maintaining the repo rate at 5.25 per cent,” the note said..
