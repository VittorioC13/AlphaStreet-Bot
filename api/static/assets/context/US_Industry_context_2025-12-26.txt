[TITLE]Consumer goods play: Bharti, Warburg buy 49% stake in Haier India for $2 bn:
[TEXT]
For Chinese firms, there are very few opportunities in India to get a strategic partner in a financial investment capacity. "The last time we saw something this big happen was the MG-JSW deal," this person added. In March 2024, a clutch of Indian investors, led by billionaire Sajjan Jindal’s conglomerate, picked up 51% of MG Motor India to create JSW MG Motor India Pvt. Ltd. China’s SAIC Motor Corp. until then owned 100% in the maker of Hector and Windsor cars. Deal details were not disclosed then.

[TITLE]Samsung Biologics to Acquire First U.S. Drug Manufacturing Facility in $280M Deal – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
A South Korean biomanufacturing giant is set to purchase its first drug production facility in the U.S. for a sum worthy of its tech giant parent.

Samsung Biologics’ American subsidiary will pay $280 million to acquire biopharmaceutical company Human Genome Sciences from GSK, in a deal expected to close early next year. The deal secures Samsung Biologics’ first manufacturing base in the U.S., at a two-building campus in Rockville, Md., with a combined 60,000 liters of capacity.

Samsung Biologics is the world’s largest contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) by capacity, with 785,000 liters of current capacity across its two major biomanufacturing campuses in Incheon, South Korea. The company specializes in monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, mRNA therapies and next-generation treatments.

The Maryland industrial/life sciences campus at 9911 Belward Campus Drive will support the production of both clinical and commercial production of pharmaceuticals. Samsung Biologics is expected to retain 500 employees at the sites. The company also plans to further upgrade the facilities and bolster their production capacity.

“This landmark acquisition is a testament to our unwavering commitment to advancing global healthcare and bolstering our manufacturing capabilities in the U.S.,” John Rim, Samsung Biologics president and CEO, said in a statement. “The investment will enable us to deepen our collaboration with federal, state and local stakeholders to best serve our customers and partners while ensuring a reliable and stable supply of life-saving therapeutics.”

The Maryland Life Sciences Corridor, between Rockville, Gaithersburg and East Baltimore — as well as the DMV in general — is among the country’s largest hubs of biotechnology development. Frederick, Md.-based developer Matan Companies earlier this month, for example, secured a 161,500-square-foot lease with Montgomery County Public Schools at the landlord’s two-building industrial/life sciences complex in Gaithersburg. Though it wasn’t immediately clear how the school system plans to use the facility.

AstraZeneca in July meanwhile announced a $50 billion boost to its U.S. investments by 2030. Chief among the pharma giant’s plans is a new $4.5 billion manufacturing facility in Albemarle County, Va., its largest ever built. AstraZeneca will also use the funds to expand its already 1.3 million-square-foot life sciences campus in Gaithersburg, not far from the property owned by Matan. GSK made a similar, $30 billion investment pledge in September.

“Along with GSK’s recent commitment to invest $30 billion in R&D and manufacturing in the US over the next five years, the [Samsung Biologics] deal enables us to further focus on building the agility, capacity and capability needed in our manufacturing network to deliver the next generation of specialty medicines and vaccines. I am confident in a positive partnership and future for the Rockville site,” Regis Simard, GSK’s president of global supply chain, said in a statement.

MatX, PolyX, FFoodi, Spark Labs, ISG Intelligence, and Gilboa Nexus selected to lead accelerators under “Transition from Manufacturing to Development” program

JERUSALEM, ISRAEL, December 24, 2025 / EINPresswire.com / -- The Israel Innovation Authority announced today the selection of six winners through a competitive procedure for the establishment and operation of MOFET accelerators. These accelerators will assist in advancing breakthrough research and development in the manufacturing industry, under the new “Transition from Manufacturing to Development” program of the MOFET Fund.

The initiative, the first of its kind in Israel, is designed to drive structural transformation across Israeli industry by pairing advanced, market-oriented technological development with robust industrial manufacturing infrastructure. Through this combined approach, the program seeks to help manufacturing companies build advanced R&D capabilities and strengthen their competitiveness in global markets.

The selected accelerators will serve as dedicated professional support entities for manufacturing companies, providing complementary R&D infrastructure and hands-on guidance across the product development journey. Support will span market mapping, opportunity identification and ideation; techno-economic feasibility validation; prototype development and piloting; and the development of market-ready industrial products, including preparation for entry into international markets.

The Israel Innovation Authority’s total investment in the establishment and operation of the accelerators amounts to approximately NIS 30 million. The program is intended for manufacturing companies whose core activity is based on manufacturing in Israel and whose R&D investment is below 7% of annual turnover, enabling a meaningful shift toward R&D-oriented industrial activity.

A study conducted by the Israel Innovation Authority found that a key barrier to expanding R&D in these companies is the absence of a structured process for building product strategy, alongside insufficient dedicated R&D infrastructure. The MOFET accelerators are designed to close these gaps by providing both practical tools and sustained professional support throughout product development.

Dror Bin, CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, said: “The objective of the MOFET accelerators is to accelerate the transformation of manufacturing-oriented companies into companies that conduct R&D, namely, into high-tech companies, and to support them throughout all stages of this journey, from ideation to the development of a globally competitive innovative product. Over time, the ability of Israel’s manufacturing companies to compete with global industry leaders depends on technological innovation and the development of breakthrough products.”

Through the accelerators, participating companies will be exposed to innovative solutions and advanced technologies, including access to leading researchers and domain experts; physical infrastructure for experimentation and techno-economic feasibility testing; as well as comprehensive business support for company management during the development of technological products. The program will also help companies build in-house R&D capacity, train leadership and teams, and connect to strategic partnerships, investors, and additional stakeholders in Israel and globally.

The selected consortia include partnerships with leading strategic consulting firms, such as EY, Shaldor Consulting, Arieli Group, and Goldratt Group, as well as prominent investors including Dr. Shimon Eckhouse (founder of the Alon MedTech Ventures incubator and the global medical aesthetics companies Lumenis and Syneron), Shani Shenhav Group (supporting operations and investment activity with approximately 4,000 clients worldwide), Amir Zaidman (co-founder of The Kitchen Foodtech Hub incubator), and Dagan Eshel (co-founder of the Alpha Strauss initiative). The program also brings together R&D laboratories and academic institutions, including the Institute for Advanced Materials at the Technion, the Plastics and Rubber Center at Shenkar, Daron Laboratories, Taga, FoodLab, PlasticApp by Kafrit, and Gevasol Group.

Companies seeking to participate in the new “Transition from Manufacturing to Development” program may do so through three flexible and independent stages: Ideation, Techno-economic Feasibility, and Product Development. Companies are not required to complete all stages and may enter the program at any stage based on their business and technological needs, while receiving close professional support from the selected accelerators.

By John Jannarone

A unit of A-CAP has filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York against Leadenhall Capital Partners, accusing the latter of fraud in dealings with 777 Partners.

Both A-CAP and Leadenhall have been creditors to 777, which once tried to buy the Premier League’s Everton Football Club. In the complaint, A-CAP argues that Leadenhall was aware of problems with collateral and was effectively “in” on the fraudulent activity.

[TITLE]QSR continued to witness softer demand environment during December quarter : Elara Capital:
[TEXT]
The Quick Service Restaurants sector continued to witness a soft demand environment in the December quarter due to lower footfalls to outlets among other factors, a report by Elara Capital noted. While GST rate cuts and festival demand did lead to some uptick but the momentum faded in November-December period, the report noted.

“ As per our preliminary checks, the macro-environment has been subdued for the sector through Q3FY26. QSR stores witnessed muted traffic. While the GST rate cuts were positive, that largely translated into tactical price reductions in key menus by the QSR players to sustain demand rather than any material margin gains,” the report noted. On same-store-sales growth trends, the report pointed out that while there was 1-2 per cent year-on-year (SSSG) growth in October during the festival period. However, this momentum faded, with QSR chains seeing 1 -3 per cent decline. Due to these factors, the report noted that there was no major “uplift or recovery” in terms of same store sales growth, a key metric for the industry.

However, the report noted that Jubilant Foodworks, which operates Domino’s, has been an outlier among peers in terms of margins, profitable expansion and delivery salience.

The report noted that the nine month performance of the QSR industry is expected to be muted. It said revenue decline on an average of about 2.9 per cent is expected to be reported by some of the QSR chains. It added that GST 2.0 offered a modest tailwind in terms of consumer discretionary spending, with benefits expected to unfold in a phased manner .

[TITLE]India venture capital momentum defies global funding headwinds in 2025: Report:
[TEXT]
India’s venture capital (VC) market strengthened its global standing in 2025, recording year-on-year (YoY) double-digit growth in both deal volumes and values during January-November despite persistent volatility across major economies.

An analysis of GlobalData’s Deals Database revealed that the total number of VC deals announced in India increased by around 11% YoY during January-November 2025 while the corresponding value rose by around 17%.

Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “This growth can be attributed to several factors, including a robust digital infrastructure, a burgeoning middle class, and a favorable regulatory environment that encourages entrepreneurship.”

India’s growth trajectory is especially noteworthy, considering the volatility across other major markets. While the US and the UK saw a contraction in deal volumes, India continued to post growth. At the same time, VC funding values declined in China and the UK, further underscoring India’s relative outperformance.

Bose adds: “India continues to remain among the top five markets globally for VC funding activity. And with the significant YoY growth in both deal volume and value, India further solidifies its position as a key player in the global VC space.”

India accounted for around 8% share of the total number of VC deals announced globally during January-November 2025 while its share of the global value stood at around 4%.

Bose concludes: “Looking ahead, India’s VC ecosystem is likely to enter a more selective yet higher-quality growth phase, with capital increasingly concentrating around scalable, revenue-generating startups rather than purely speculative plays. As global investors rebalance portfolios amid macro uncertainty, India stands to benefit from its combination of market depth, digital adoption, and policy continuity, potentially driving larger ticket sizes and deeper sectoral specialization in 2026 and beyond.”

[TITLE]Jeffs’ Brands and Scanary: The Radar Revolution That Could Transform the Homeland-Security Market:
[TEXT]
Tel Aviv, Israel, Dec. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jeffs' Brands Ltd. (Nasdaq: JFBR) (“Jeffs’ Brands”), a data-driven e-commerce company strategically pivoting into homeland security, today provided additional information regarding Scanary Ltd. (“Scanary”), an Israeli deep-tech startup's groundbreaking AI-powered radar system that promises to redefine concealed threat detection without disrupting the flow of people. In an era of emerging security threats-from mass shootings to terrorist attacks in crowded public spaces—traditional security screening methods are increasingly inadequate. Long lines at metal detectors and X-ray machines create bottlenecks, frustrate crowds, and leave vulnerabilities in open areas where threats can enter undetected. Enter Scanary Ltd. (“Scanary”), an Israeli deep-tech startup's groundbreaking AI-powered radar system that promises to redefine concealed threat detection without disrupting the flow of people.

To bring this revolutionary technology to global markets, Jeffs' Brands identified Scanary's immense potential early on and, through Jeffs' Brands subsidiary, KeepZone AI Inc. (“KeepZone”), Jeffs' Brands secured the exclusive distribution rights for Scanary’s technology in key regions, accelerating the deployment of this solution.

Founded in 2024 by defense and high-tech veterans from the Israeli Defense Forces’s elite units, Scanary emerged in mid-2025 with a patented technology that combines electromagnetic radar imaging with advanced artificial intelligence.

How Scanary Works: Frictionless, Standoff Detection

At its core, Scanary employs proprietary near-field radar sensors combined with artificial intelligence to generate three-dimensional images of people and carried objects in open environments, with flexible sensor placement of up to approximately 10 meters. Individuals move naturally through the screening area without stopping, emptying pockets, or removing personal items such as belts or shoes. Operating continuously and in real time, the system enables high-throughput screening across large, open spaces while maintaining a seamless visitor experience.

The AI engine classifies threats in real-time: distinguishing guns, knives, or explosives from harmless items like phones or keys. Alerts overlay on existing CCTV feeds, pinpointing threats with 3D visualizations and notifying security via mobile devices.

Crucially, it's privacy-first: no facial recognition, no biometric data, no body imaging—just material and shape analysis. It holds Conformité Européenne (“CE”) and General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) approvals in Europe, with U.S. processes underway.

A Game-Changer for High-Threat Venues

Scanary targets exactly where traditional checkpoints fail -- airports terminals, stadiums, transit hubs, malls, concerts, and border areas. A recent pilot at Pais Arena Jerusalem during December 2025 concerts, orchestrated by KeepZone, validated the system's real-world performance.

Reshaping Homeland Security

If widely adopted, Scanary could fundamentally alter homeland security:

Eliminate Bottlenecks : Frictionless screening means no line, improving crowd flow and reducing secondary risks like stampedes in evacuations.

: Frictionless screening means no line, improving crowd flow and reducing secondary risks like stampedes in evacuations. Proactive Threat Neutralization : Remote detection allows security to intercept threats before they reach choke points, enabling layered defense in "soft targets."

: Remote detection allows security to intercept threats before they reach choke points, enabling layered defense in "soft targets." Cost and Resource Efficiency : Fewer personnel needed for manual checks, which can result in lower operational costs in high-traffic venues.

: Respectful, non-intrusive scans boost public acceptance, contrasting with invasive pat-downs or imaging scanners. Scalability Against Evolving Threats: AI adaptation counters new concealment methods, from non-metallic explosives to 3D-printed weapons.

Jeffs' Brands Drives Scanary's Rapid Global Acceleration

Through its subsidiary, Jeffs' Brands secured exclusive distribution rights in key markets, including Canada, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, and stadiums in Israel. KeepZone has committed a structured $1 million investment (repayable via revenue shares) in Scanary and appointed security expert Alon Dayan as the Chief Executive Officer of KeepZone, demonstrating bold foresight in recognizing Scanary as a disruptive force in the homeland security market. By expanding the partnership and facilitating a successful live pilot at Pais Arena Jerusalem in December 2025, Jeffs' Brands, through its subsidiary, has played a pivotal role in accelerating Scanary's path to global deployment.

In a global security screening market projected to grow significantly, technologies like Scanary align with trends toward contactless, AI-driven solutions-nechoing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration’s pushes for touchless screening to reduce physical contact and wait times.

While challenges remain, such as obtaining regulatory approvals, integration costs, and false positives in diverse crowds, Scanary, bolstered by partners like Jeffs' Brands, represents a leap forward. The future of homeland security has the potential to be checkpoint-free, radar-guided, and invisibly vigilant. Scanary isn't just detecting threats- it's reimagining how we prevent them.

[TITLE]Stardust Power Secures Financing To Advance Oklahoma Lithium Refinery Toward Construction:
[TEXT]
GREENWICH, Conn., Dec. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stardust Power Inc. (NASDAQ: SDST) (“Stardust Power” or “the Company”), an American developer of battery-grade lithium carbonate, today announced it has executed a Securities Purchase Agreement with a single institutional investor providing for up to $15.0 million in senior secured convertible debt financing to support early-stage construction activities at its lithium refinery project in Muskogee, Oklahoma.

The facility includes an initial $4.0 million drawdown and provides the Company with flexible capital to advance detailed engineering, infrastructure, and procurement activities as it progresses toward construction. The financing has a 24-month term, includes an initial repayment moratorium, and provides the Company with the option to repay the facility in cash or common stock. The facility is intended to support near-term development activities and may serve as bridge financing as the Company advances toward project-level construction financing.

“This facility marks an important step as we prepare for construction and provides optionality and meaningful flexibility as we execute the next phase of the Muskogee project,” said Roshan Pujari, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Stardust Power. “We are building a robust capital stack with flexibility and shareholder value in mind and are focused on keeping our capital structure aligned with upcoming project milestones.”

The Company plans to fund construction of its 50,000 metric ton per annum refinery through a combination of asset-level equity and asset-level debt financing, designed to minimize public equity dilution and maximize shareholder value, with early stage investor engagement reflecting interest in the project’s shovel-ready status.

[TITLE]BMO Capital Sees Impressive Guidance and Construction Cloud Momentum at Autodesk (ADSK):
[TEXT]
Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) is one of the best growth stocks to buy in 2026. On November 26, BMO Capital raised the firm’s price target on Autodesk to $343 from $333 and kept a Market Perform rating on the shares. Despite a difficult sales environment, Autodesk delivered strong Q3 2025 results marked by improving growth and impressive Q4 guidance. BMO Capital remains optimistic due to the continued success of Construction Cloud and the company’s ongoing efforts to unify siloed workflows for its industrial and construction clients.

A day before this rating, the company announced its Q3 2025 earnings results. Autodesk reported non-GAAP EPS of $2.67, which exceeded analyst expectations of $2.50. Total revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $1.85 billion. This performance was supported by a $124 million contribution from the company’s new transaction model; excluding this impact and currency fluctuations, underlying revenue growth remained a healthy 12%.

BMO Capital Sees Impressive Guidance and Construction Cloud Momentum at Autodesk (ADSK)

Strategic momentum at Autodesk was driven by the convergence of design and make workflows within the Autodesk Construction Cloud/ACC and the integration of AI-powered automations. In the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations/AECO segment, revenue remained strong as investments in data centers and infrastructure offset softness in commercial sectors. Management highlighted that AI adoption is yielding tangible productivity gains, noting that the acceptance rate for AI-powered auto-constraints in Fusion has surpassed 60%, with 90% of those sketches becoming fully constrained.

Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) provides 3D design, engineering, and entertainment technology solutions worldwide.

[TITLE]Forman Capital Provides $37M Construction Financing for Houston-Area Retail Center – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Ferguson Family Partners has secured $37.1 million in construction financing to build The Oaks of District West, a 10-building mixed-use center outside of Houston, Texas, Commercial Observer can first report.

Forman Capital provided the construction loan, while Daniel Eidson of Concord Summit Capital arranged the transaction.

Scott Mehlman, chief investment officer and partner at Forman Capital, noted in a statement that the Richmond submarket of Houston, where The Oak of District West will be located, has experienced a surge in residential building in recent years, but retail has failed to keep pace.

“Our client is addressing a clear market gap, and the early leasing momentum speaks to both the strength of the location and the quality of the concept,” said Mehlman.

The open-air project is already 70 percent pre-leased in its 15 tenant spaces, even though construction is expected to last until the third quarter of 2027. Tenants include Pacific Coast Tacos, Virtual Golf Bar, Pecan Jack’s Ice Cream, and Picklr, a national indoor pickleball company.

Located at 21711 FM-1093 in Richmond, Texas, directly off the Westpark Tollway and South Peak Road, The Oaks of District West will span more than 87,000 square feet across 10 buildings on a site that sits 30 miles southwest of Downtown Houston.

Brett Forman, managing partner of Forman Capital, said in a statement that the new retail center will tap into the affluent residential community within the Richmond area.

“The Oaks of District West aligns directly with Forman Capital’s retail thesis of investing in necessity-driven centers in affluent residential markets,” he said.
