If you have a high tolerance for risk, then it could be worth checking out the small cap ASX stock in this article.

That's because Bell Potter believes the signing of an "impressive deal" could be the catalyst to sending its shares materially higher.

Which small cap ASX stock?

The stock that Bell Potter is bullish on is Immutep Ltd (ASX: IMM).

It is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is developing a novel LAG-3 (lymphocyte activation gene-3) immunotherapy for cancer and autoimmune disease.

Its core technology is based on the LAG3 protein, which is a key mediator of the immune system.

Immutep's lead drug candidate, eftilagimod alpha (efti), is currently undergoing clinical trials in five different oncology indications.

What is the broker saying?

Bell Potter was very pleased to see the small cap ASX stock sign an exclusive license agreement with Dr Reddy's Laboratories (NYSE: RDY). This is for the development and commercialisation of its lead asset Efti in all countries outside North America, Europe, Japan and China.

As part of the deal, Immutep will receive US$20 million (A$30 million) upfront, US$350 million (A$528 million) in potential development and commercial milestones, and double-digit royalties on net sales.

Commenting on the deal, the broker said:

We view this as an impressive deal that provides: (1) financial and industry validation from a credible pharma company in Emerging Markets, (2) significant non-dilutive cash in the form of A$30m upfront plus potential milestones, (3) leaves the commercial rights to the most lucrative US, EU and Japanese markets (>90% of market value) unencumbered for future licensing/M&A opportunities, and (4) could spur other industry parties (most obviously clinical collaborator Merck) to more actively engage for rights to the US and EU markets.

Big potential returns

According to the note, the broker has responded to the update by retaining its speculative buy rating on the small cap ASX stock with an improved price target of 60 cents (from 46 cents).

Based on its current share price of 32 cents, this implies potential upside of almost 90% for investors over the next 12 months.

Commenting on its recommendation, Bell Potter said:

[TITLE]Chinese Firms Pour $80B Into Global Clean-Tech:
[TEXT]
Chinese foreign investment in clean energy has jumped to $80 billion in the year to November 2025, with Trump’s aggressive trade tariffs prompting many countries to deepen energy ties with China. That’s good for a 60% annualized increase compared with a total of $100 billion spent over the previous two years with Beijing leveraging its dominance in energy transition technologies. China already was the global leader in sectors such as solar and wind energy as well as electric vehicles and EV batteries before the Trump administration withdrew federal support for clean energy projects.

“The clean-tech economy represents a flourishing form of South-South cooperation, where national development goals meet China’s techno-industrial might,” Caroline Wang, analyst at Australian-based think tank Climate Energy Finance (CEF) said in a report. “While the US sees China’s rise as a threat, many developing countries are inspired by its success and aim to emulate it.”

According to CEF, Southeast Asia is China’s top destination for clean energy investments, led by Indonesia and Malaysia. Major projects here include a $6 billion battery plant in Indonesia being jointly developed by Indonesia Battery, Aneka Tambang and China’s EV battery giant, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL).

The Middle East and North Africa are also seeing a surge in Chinese renewable energy investments as governments try to lower reliance on oil. Countries are offering diverse incentives in a bid to attract Chinese clean-tech investments, including competitive tax rates and fast-tracked project approvals. These projects are mainly focused on facilitating joint-venture projects with local partners, building local manufacturing capacity and boosting employment.

Interestingly, China’s clean energy sector is also doing brisk business with less developed economies even as the U.S. retreats from the clean energy race. In fact, 51% of China’s EV sales growth in the current year has come from nations outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Exports to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) surged 75% during the first eight months of 2025, while EV exports to Africa nearly tripled, led by Morocco and Nigeria with the West African nation recording a six-fold surge in purchases. Meanwhile, exports to the Middle East jumped 72% while sales to Latin America grew 11%. But it's not just electric vehicles. China exported 46 GW of solar PV equipment in August, more than Australia’s total installed capacity.

“China’s electrotech is becoming the basis of the new energy system, with continued cost reductions driving faster growth than ever, especially in emerging economies,” Ember analysts wrote.

And, it’s all being driven by a virtuous cycle of falling renewable energy prices, an economic phenomenon where increased adoption and production lead to lower costs, which in turn encourages more adoption and production, creating a self-sustaining downward spiral of prices and upward surge in deployment. This cycle is driven by technological advancements, economies of scale in manufacturing, increased competition, and more efficient installation and operation of renewable systems.

China’s value of green energy exports has actually declined by 47% in dollar terms since its March 2023 peak, with the country’s solar manufacturers currently embroiled in a vicious price war. Since 2020, China has seen dramatic price reductions in both solar panels and EV batteries, with solar module prices falling significantly. An average EV battery pack price in China dropped by

[TITLE]Ethereum network sees 62% drop in fees: Is ETH price at risk?:
[TEXT]
Key takeaways:

Ethereum’s base layer activity has cooled, with fees and TVL dropping, showing slower demand despite the recent price recovery.

Layer-2 networks are growing rapidly, helping to support Ethereum even as base layer usage weakens and traders remain cautious.

Ether (ETH) rallied to a three-week high near $3,400 on Tuesday after weak United States job market data reinforced expectations that US monetary policy could become less restrictive sooner than previously thought.

Even with the 11.2% weekly gains, traders still worry that sluggish Ethereum network activity and limited demand for bullish leverage may curb the short-term upside.

Blockchains ranked by seven-day network fees, USD. Source: Nansen

Nansen data shows that Ethereum’s 30-day network fees dropped by 62%, a far deeper pullback than the roughly 22% decline observed on Tron, Solana and HyperEVM during the same window.

Some activity, however, stood out: transactions on Base rose 108%, while Polygon recorded an 81% increase, suggesting continued momentum across Ethereum’s expanding layer-2 ecosystem.

The Ethereum Fusaka upgrade on Dec. 3 introduced changes designed to improve rollup efficiency, which may have contributed to the lower network fees noted throughout the month.

ETH perpetual futures eight-hour funding rate. Source: CoinGlass

On Tuesday, the annualized funding rate for ETH perpetual futures held near 9%, reflecting a fairly even distribution of leveraged positions between buyers (longs) and sellers (shorts). Under normal market conditions, this indicator tends to oscillate between 6% and 12% to account for capital costs; levels above that range usually signal stronger bullish positioning.

Traders turned more defensive after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 1.85 million layoffs in October, the highest figure since 2023. Markets are now pricing in a 0.25% interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday, while attention shifts to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments following the Committee meeting.

Ethereum’s layer-2 growth offsets base layer fee declines

Despite the recent bullish momentum, Ether still trades 32% below its all-time high of $4,597 from August. To gauge whether demand for the Ethereum network is genuinely declining, it’s useful to look at the impact on decentralized applications (DApps).

Volumes on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges fell to $13.4 billion over seven days, down from $23.6 billion four weeks earlier. Likewise, decentralized application revenues reached a five-month low of $12.3 million during the same period. Overall, demand for Ethereum’s base layer processing has been slipping since it peaked in late August.

Ethereum DApps with $500 million or higher in TVL. Source: DefiLlama

Some of Ethereum’s leading DApps saw a sharp drop in total value locked (TVL), including Pendle, Athena, Morpho and Spark. Aggregate TVL on the Ethereum base layer fell to $76 billion from $100 billion two months earlier. Even so, Ethereum’s dominance remains intact with a 68% market share, while runner-up Solana holds under 10%.

Ether bulls argue that the network’s strong incentives for layer-2 scalability offer a more sustainable model compared with the heavier load and centralized coordination required by competing blockchains. Ethereum is positioned to capture a significant share of future growth in decentralized finance (DeFi).

US Securities and Exchange Commission Paul Atkins reportedly said in a FOX Business interview that tokenization of the US market could occur in “a couple of years,” adding that blockchain offers “huge benefits” such as predictability and transparency. Atkins said the US should “embrace this new technology, bring it onshore where it can work under American rules.”

While Ethereum’s base layer fees have seen a sharp decline, along with the drop in TVL, activity across the layer-2 ecosystem continues to expand. Currently, neither onchain nor derivatives data indicate a meaningful weakness in ETH price dynamics.

What will be the defining stories in the venture capital world from a top investor’s perspective in 2026? To help answer this question, Digital Journal spoke with Mike Collins, CEO of Alumni Ventures,

Alumni Ventures is one of the most active venture capital firms in the world. The firm has over $1.5 billion in assets, and the firm is ranked #20 on Time Magazine’s Top VC firms for 2025.

Digital Journal: What are the most investable opportunities within the AI value chain right now?

Mike Collins: The short answer: not where the headlines are.

Most people obsess over foundation models and leaderboard scores. That’s interesting, but it’s not where most of the returns will come from. Our team at Alumni Ventures sees these three parts of the AI value chain that are especially attractive right now.

Picks, shovels, and plumbing (AI infrastructure and tooling)

The world is underestimating how much raw compute, cooling, and infrastructure this AI wave will need. Companies like Rigetti (quantum computing) and Lambda (GPU cloud) are tackling the hard infrastructure problems every serious AI company will eventually run into. We also love enabling tech like Frore Systems with solid-state cooling — the boring-sounding stuff that quietly becomes essential.

Vertical AI apps with clear ROI, not science projects

We’re especially excited

“We will see a resurgence in open source software in journalism — but with new models for support and ongoing development.”

Journalism tends to treat technology as something that happened to it, like an asteroid. In 2026, that stance will become untenable.

Governments are beginning to understand that their reliance on Silicon Valley technology is a liability. Jurisdictions like the European Union are funding alternative ecosystems where software is developed in accordance with their values: respectful of privacy and in opposition to extractive business models.

News organizations face similar vulnerabilities, but unlike governments, they haven’t begun to treat their technology choices as integral to their own survival.

They should. Without a fundamental shift in how newsrooms think

[TITLE]Govt clears two fund managers to roll out ₹1 trillion deep-tech RDI scheme:
[TEXT]
NEW DELHI: The Department of Science and Technology (DST) has cleared two fund managers and is close to shortlisting two more to operationalize the Centre’s ₹1 trillion research, development and innovation (RDI) incentivization scheme, three senior officials with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The approvals mark the first concrete step toward rolling out the scheme, announced earlier this year and cleared by the Union cabinet in July, to strengthen domestic deep-tech research and development (R&D).

With the fund-management structure taking shape, the first tranche of applications from startups under the RDI scheme is expected to open by March 2026 across sectors including industrial electronics, semiconductors and quantum computing.

The officials, requesting anonymity, said that Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (Birac) and the Technology Development Board (TDB) have been approved by DST’s RDI cell to handle the rollout of funds. Two other entities—Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) and SBI Funds Management Ltd, the AIF arm of the country’s largest public-sector lender—are close to being finalized.

“The RDI scheme has the need for four fund managers to handle the amount—one alternative investment funds (AIF) firm, one industrial bank, one technology specialist and one product specialist. DST is looking for bodies that have experience in understanding deep technologies, which is why the process of appointing the managers has taken long," one of the three officials cited above said.

“Implementation of the scheme will be carried out through second-level fund managers, which may include alternate investment funds (AIFs), development finance institutions (DFIs), non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and focused research organizations (FROs). TDB and Birac were identified in the Cabinet Note as potential fund managers, and the process of onboarding them is underway. As statutory bodies under the ministry, they may be appointed by nomination under the scheme guidelines," Jyoti Sharma, head—RDI cell, Department of Science and Technology, told Mint.

For onboarding additional fund managers, a notice inviting applications has been issued and is available on the RDI Fund website, Sharma said, adding that appointments will be made after evaluating proposals from eligible AIFs, DFIs, NBFCs and FROs.

A second official added that during a roundtable with industry stakeholders in Bengaluru on 4 December, RDI cell head Sharma indicated that the remaining two fund managers could be finalized within three months, if not earlier. This was the second such industry consultation after an earlier meeting in Mumbai, with a third planned in Delhi in the coming weeks.

Queries sent to the DST secretary, Birac, Sidbi and SBI-AIF remained unanswered at press time.

According to the officials, Birac and TDB are set to formally open applications within the next few weeks to fund research-based product development, with the other two managers expected to begin similar processes before the end of this fiscal year.

Eligibility and funding rules

“The RDI fund will only be made available to an India-registered company, whose controlling decisions are headed and managed by an Indian citizen. This is being done to ensure that the intellectual property, which has to be registered in India, adds to the gross domestic product of India itself," said Ashok Chandak, president of industry body, India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (Iesa).

Iesa is working with DST’s RDI cell to enable industry dialogues.

“The DST has not decided on an upper cap for the maximum amount that a company can raise, and the idea is that they will figure this out as they speak with more startups and research divisions of companies," the second official said, adding that the DST is taking a 50-50 approach to this fund, wherein startups applying for funding under the scheme would need to raise an amount equivalent to what they receive from RDI, from private investors.

Sharma confirmed that DST has not finalized whether there will be an upper limit on the amount of funding a company can request.

“This is being done to bring large industrial entities and private investors on to the deep-tech funding table, and boost R&D spending among Indian corporates," the official added.

The finance ministry has allocated ₹20,000 crore to the RDI scheme for FY26. While the fund remains unused so far, disbursals are expected to begin by the end of the 2026 calendar year. Any funds issued beyond March 2026 will fall under a fresh tranche.

Industry response

Industry stakeholders said the scheme could play a key role in supporting India’s tech-product ecosystem.

“Our operations in FSID, at IISc Bangalore, have so far been based on research grants from the government, in order to help companies develop products that cater to strategic import substitution opportunities. Going forward, the rollout of the RDI fund can help bring forth a larger amount of funds to entities developing products, and help scale to supply the market," said Yogesh Pandit, director of product acceleration, Foundation of Science, Innovation and Development (FSID) at IISc Bangalore.

Pandit, who leads Pravriddhi, the FSID’s product acceleration programme, has supported eight entities in securing funds through a 75-25 mix of research grants and private equity.

One example is Predictive Edge, an IIoT startup that monitors voltage, current and vibration of rotating machines to predict service needs. Another is Kirloskar Pneumatic Co. Ltd, which said in a note that it is working with IISc Bangalore and the Ministry of Heavy Industries to “explore improvements in compressor performance, advanced materials, and intelligent process systems."

“With the RDI scheme, companies will have a larger go-to fund to rely upon to develop technologies and make a large number of products indigenously that are imported today," Pandit added.

Chandak added that the scheme could prove to be significantly valuable for domestic electronics and semiconductor design companies in building patents and product reference designs.

“The scheme has been designed to work differently from the IT ministry’s production-linked incentive schemes, which are designed to help established companies generate scale now. With the RDI scheme, the DST is looking at a 10-year roadmap of product development, giving them large development and gestation time to build high-tech products at scale," he said.

[TITLE]SEALSQ Takes Decisive Action, Boosts Quantum Investment Fund from $35 Million to Over $100 Million:
[TEXT]
Geneva, Switzerland, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

New Funding Push Accelerates Europe’s Quantum-Safe Digital Ecosystem, Develops a Sovereign Quantum Computer, and Establishes a European Quantum Corridor

SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES) ("SEALSQ" or "Company"), a company that focuses on developing and selling Semiconductors, PKI, and Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products, supported by a strong liquidity position of almost $450 million, today announced its strategic decision to reinforce Europe’s leadership in Quantum Security, Post-Quantum technologies, and sovereign Quantum computing by increasing Quantum Investment Fund from $35 million to over $100 million. With this step, SEALSQ has significantly amplified its intention to drive Europe’s technological sovereignty, accelerate the rollout of a fully Quantum-Safe digital ecosystem, contribute to the development of a European sovereign Quantum Computer, establish a pan-European Quantum Corridor connecting research, industry, and secure infrastructure across the continent.

A sovereign Quantum Computer is a Quantum computing system that is designed, manufactured, operated, and secured entirely within Europe, without dependence on foreign technologies, cloud infrastructure, or supply chains. Such a system would ensure full regional control over Quantum processors, secure elements, cryptographic layers, algorithms, and data flows. Such a system could embody strategic autonomy, eliminate exposure to foreign vulnerabilities or extraterritorial regulations, preserve European intellectual property, and comply with sovereign cybersecurity and data-protection frameworks. SEALSQ believes that the development of a sovereign Quantum Computer is essential for maintaining Europe’s long-term technological independence and protecting sensitive governmental, industrial, and scientific workloads in the Quantum era.

SEALSQ’s expanded Quantum Fund is being deployed with the goal of accelerating the convergence of Quantum-resilient hardware, PQC algorithms, secure satellite and terrestrial communications, blockchain-backed identity systems, and AI-enhanced hardware security modules. SEALSQ maintains that these foundational elements are necessary not only to build a Post-Quantum secure digital ecosystem but also to create the technological infrastructure required for a sovereign Quantum Computer and a unified continental Quantum Corridor.

Several strategic investments already executed demonstrate SEALSQ’s coordinated approach and its global expansion. Specifically…

In Spain, the company, along with its parent company, WISeKey International Holding AG, (“WISeKey”) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), a leading global cybersecurity, blockchain, and IoT company, has committed approximately $12 million to develop a Post-Quantum Semiconductor Personalization and Test Center in Murcia, supported by €20 million from the Spanish government’s SETT.ES program.

In Switzerland, a $3.5 million investment in WeCan Group aims to integrate PQC-secured blockchain identity capabilities into financial and enterprise systems. SEALSQ has also deployed $10 million into WISeSat.Space with the aim to further develop its satellite constellation to deliver Post-Quantum encrypted global communications, enabling secure connectivity across the Quantum Corridor’s terrestrial and space-based nodes.

SEALSQ has also deployed $10 million into WISeSat.Space with the aim to further develop its satellite constellation to deliver Post-Quantum encrypted global communications, enabling secure connectivity across the Quantum Corridor’s terrestrial and space-based nodes. In France, the acquisition of IC’Alps for a total consideration valued at approximately $14 million enhances SEALSQ’s ability to develop custom Quantum-ready silicon optimized for algorithms such as CRYSTALS-Kyber. An investment in French startup ColibriTD brings QKD and hybrid PQC capabilities into SEALSQ’s architecture, strengthening the end-to-end secure communication needed for Europe’s Quantum future.

An investment in French startup ColibriTD brings QKD and hybrid PQC capabilities into SEALSQ’s architecture, strengthening the end-to-end secure communication needed for Europe’s Quantum future. In USA, the company has made a strategic investment in EeroQ, a U.S.-based quantum chip design company pioneering a breakthrough approach to building a quantum computer using electrons on helium (eHe). This investment aligns with SEALSQ’s Quantum Made in USA strategy and reinforces its commitment to strengthening the United States and Europe’s leadership in quantum-resistant technologies and future quantum computing platforms.

As Quantum computing evolves, traditional encryption and legacy cybersecurity systems are expected to become vulnerable. SEALSQ’s expanded Quantum Fund plans to ensure that Europe can protect its data, communications, and digital identities against Quantum-enabled threats while laying the groundwork for a sovereign Quantum Computer and a pan-European Quantum Corridor that unites critical infrastructure, research, and industry in a secure, interoperable framework.

“This integrated strategy is not a collection of isolated technologies, it is a coordinated mission to build the world’s first fully vertically integrated quantum computing ecosystem, support the development of a sovereign European Quantum Computer, and establish a Quantum Corridor that ancors Europe’s technological future,” said Carlos Moreira, CEO of SEALSQ. “By increasing our Quantum Fund to over $100 million, we are accelerating the innovation required to protect governments, enterprises, and citizens in the Quantum era. We are building the critical infrastructure of tomorrow, today.”

With its strong liquidity, expanding technological footprint, and commitment to European digital sovereignty, SEALSQ is uniquely positioned to shape the secure Quantum future of Europe and beyond.

[TITLE]'The Money Is Very, Very Clear:' BlackRock Says The Biggest Winners Of AI Revolution Are Hidden In Plain Sight — And Investors Are Missing Them:
[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Ben Powell, the chief investment strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at BlackRock Inc., predicts that the current wave of capital investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure is far from its peak.

AI Capex Boom Favors Chipmakers, Suppliers

Powell, on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Finance Week, highlighted that the suppliers of AI “picks and shovels” such as chipmakers, energy producers, and copper-wire manufacturers are the primary beneficiaries of the ongoing capital influx, reported CNBC.

He noted that AI-driven capital spending is accelerating with no signs of easing, as major tech firms race fiercely for dominance in what they view as a winner-takes-all battle.

Don’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Powell added that major tech companies are only beginning to tap credit markets to finance the next wave of AI growth, signaling that even more capital is on the horizon.

He said "the money is very, very clear," adding that BlackRock expects the broader capex boom to continue.

Powell said the hyperscalers are acting as though anything short of first place would push them out of the market, prompting an aggressive ramp-up in spending, even if it risks overshooting.

Powell said much of this capital will likely move toward the companies enabling the AI build-out rather than the model makers themselves, echoing a rising belief among global investors that the most durable gains from the AI boom may come from the hardware, energy, and infrastructure supporting it.

AI Growth Shifts From Spending To Execution

In its new global outlook, earlier this month, BlackRock argued that the U.S. economy is entering a capital-intensive regime driven by massive AI investment, one that keeps growth resilient even as traditional business-cycle signals cool. The firm estimates that global AI capex could reach $5 trillion to $8 trillion by 2030, with the U.S. leading the buildout.

However, concerns about a potential AI bubble have long centered on whether demand would justify the sector’s explosive valuations.

Jordi Visser of 22V Research says the next phase of AI investing won't hinge on who spends the most, but on who can execute under constraints. As the industry shifts from capital limits to delivery limits, he argues that success will depend on execution, infrastructure readiness, and project management. By 2026, the winners will be the companies that can turn contracts into real capacity while protecting margins despite rising costs and tighter deadlines.

[TITLE]Hinge CEO McLeod stepping down to lead Match Group-backed AI dating startup:
[TEXT]
Dec 9 : Match Group said on Tuesday that Hinge founder and CEO Justin McLeod will step down to launch Overtone, an AI-powered dating venture backed by the company, signaling a major bet on artificial intelligence.

Jackie Jantos, currently Hinge's president and chief marketing officer, will take over as CEO. Jantos has overseen the app's expansion into Europe and Latin America and led product initiatives targeting Gen Z users.

Overtone, incubated within Hinge during 2025, will operate as an independent company focused on using AI and voice tools to create connections, the company said.

Match Group plans to lead Overtone's initial funding round in early 2026 and hold a significant ownership stake. McLeod will serve as chairman of Overtone and remain as an adviser to Hinge through March.

"With MTCH retaining a substantial ownership position, the company seems to be making sure that it will not be left behind on potentially significant developments," said MScience analyst Chandler Willison.

The move underscores Match Group's effort to defend its dominant position in the traditional online dating ecosystem with apps like Tinder and OkCupid, while hedging on experimental ventures that could reshape the industry, Willison added.

McLeod founded Hinge in 2011 and helped it become one of Match Group's fastest-growing brands.

AI-DRIVEN MATCHMAKING

Match Group, which continues to be one of the dominant players in the online dating sector with its applications, is still placing its bets on AI connection amid evolving demand from younger users, who continue to engage with AI-powered and niche matchmaking apps.

Rivals such as Bumble and Grindr have also stepped up investments in AI, betting on new features that improve personalization and bolster safety to face rising criticism of "swiping fatigue."

Several startups, including AI-first dating platforms Teaser and Blush, are also experimenting with generative AI tools and conversational agents designed to mimic human chemistry and improve first-date conversions.

The sectorwide embrace of AI comes amid slowing user growth, rising competition and mounting pressure to rekindle growth, pushing dating companies to reimagine how algorithms can make introductions feel more natural.

As reported by Bloomberg, the largest deal came from Unconventional AI, which raised $475 million in a seed round at a $4.5 billion valuation as it builds a novel computer optimized for AI workloads. The company was founded two months ago by former Databricks head of AI Naveen Rao and aims to rethink the architecture of AI computing by drawing inspiration from biology and analog physics.

According to the report, Unconventional AI is designing systems that prioritize energy efficiency by exploring semiconductor-level physics, analog computational approaches and new ways to scale compute without hitting power constraints. The $475 million represents the first portion of a fundraising effort that may reach $1 billion as the company prototypes multiple architectures in search of a paradigm that can scale more efficiently than today’s GPU-based systems.

Investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Lux Capital, DCVC, Jeff Bezos, Databricks and Rao himself, who invested $10 million on the same terms as outside backers.

Training and Support Tools Attract Interest

Yoodli announced a $13.7 million fundraise and the launch of its AI Roleplays product, an expansion of its communication-skills platform. The company said the new category is designed to help users rehearse difficult workplace conversations through structured AI simulations.

The model generates realistic conversational scenarios across sales, coaching, interviewing and feedback settings, allowing users to practice and refine delivery. Yoodli noted that organizations are increasingly turning to AI-based experiential training to improve managerial readiness and customer-facing communication. The financing brings Yoodli’s total capital raised above $20 million and will support expansion into corporate learning and global distribution.

In Europe, Parloa, an AI-powered customer-service automation platform, is preparing a new fundraising round that could value the company at more than $2 billion. Parloa aims to secure about $200 million to scale its conversational-AI stack, which helps enterprises automate call-center workflows, routing, self-service and agent assistance.

The potential round reflects the accelerating demand for AI systems that can manage high-volume, multi-language customer interactions. Parloa has leaned heavily into enterprise-grade reliability and integrations, citing strong traction with retailers and logistics providers that are turning to automation to reduce support costs and improve service levels. If completed, the round would place Parloa among Europe’s highest-valued customer-experience AI companies.

Vertical AI Firms Extend Their Momentum

Another major transaction came from Harvey, which announced that Andreessen Horowitz led a $160 million investment as the legal-tech firm continues expanding its AI platform for law firms and corporate counsel. Harvey builds AI systems that support large-scale document review, contract analysis, research and drafting.

The company said the funding will accelerate its work on structured reasoning and enterprise controls, areas that matter for legal workflows that require auditability, data security and consistent outputs. Harvey’s raise reinforces investor confidence in vertical AI systems built for expert tasks rather than broad consumer use.

ChemLex, a startup applying AI to chemical research and discovery, announced new funding and the release of its ChemLex 1.0 platform. The company’s technology automates chemical structure generation, prediction and analysis, aiming to shorten discovery cycles for industrial chemistry, materials science and pharmaceuticals.

ChemLex said the new capital will be used to scale scientific-grade models that can interpret molecular data, run simulations and generate synthesis pathways. The firm highlighted that demand is growing for AI tools that can augment R&D teams facing rising complexity and global competition. The release of ChemLex 1.0 positions the company within a rising class of scientific-AI startups designing foundation models tailored to chemistry and biology rather than text or images.

Flex, a U.S. FinTech serving mid-sized businesses, raised $60 million in a Series B round reported by PYMNTS. Portage Ventures led the financing, which lifts Flex’s valuation to roughly $500 million. The firm offers an AI-native financial platform that combines business banking, payments, private credit, treasury and personal-finance tools for owners of mid-market companies.

[TITLE]European Union probes Google for possible 'anticompetitive' use of copyrighted material for AI-generated summaries:
[TEXT]
Google faces a fresh antitrust investigation in Brussels over whether it ripped off copyrighted material to train its artificial intelligence models without properly compensating publishers, the European Commission announced Tuesday.

The European Union’s antitrust cops expressed concern that Google used web publishers’ articles and videos to build its “AI Overviews” search summary feature and “AI Mode” search function without paying them or allowing them to opt out.

The investigation is centered on Google’s handling of articles from news publishers and content creators, as well as videos uploaded to YouTube.

“AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies,” EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera said in a statement.

The investigation could further raise tensions between the EU and the Trump administration, which has been critical of the 27-member bloc’s ongoing campaign of fines and penalties against US tech companies.

A Google spokesperson said the EU’s inquiry “risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever.”

“Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era,” the spokesperson added.

In September, the EU slapped Google with a $3.4 billion fine after determining it broke competition rules related to advertising technology. President Trump blasted that action as “discriminatory.”

Earlier this week, Trump warned Europe to be “very careful” after it imposed a $140 million fine on Elon Musk’s social media platform X for alleged violations of the EU’s content moderation policies.

At the same time, Google and other tech firms remain under intense scrutiny within the US over their AI training practices.

As The Post reported, a group of top conservatives including ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon recently demanded that the administration reject Big Tech’s argument that its use of copyrighted material is protected by so-called “fair use doctrine.”

Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, which is locked in a fierce AI competition with Google, recently announced a new set of licensing deals with top publishers, including CNN and Fox News.

Fox News shares a common owner with News Corp, which publishes The Post.
