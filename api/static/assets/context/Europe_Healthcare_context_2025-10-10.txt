Key Factors Driving the Growth of the CAR T-Cell Therapy for Multiple Myeloma Market

Rising Multiple Myeloma Incidence

The increasing number of multiple myeloma cases worldwide is a significant driver for CAR T-cell therapy adoption. In the US alone, over 32,000 new cases are diagnosed annually, highlighting the growing need for effective treatments. According to DelveInsight analysis, among the 7MM, the highest number of incident cases was reported in the US in 2024, at nearly 34,000, which are further expected to increase by 2034.

Efficacy of BCMA-Targeted Therapies

BCMA-targeted CAR T-cell therapies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb/Bluebird Bio’s ABECMA and Johnson & Johnson’s CARVYKTI, have demonstrated high response rates in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. These therapies offer new hope for patients who have exhausted other treatment options.

Rising CAR T-Cell Therapy for Multiple Myeloma Clinical Trial Activity

Some of the prominent players in this field include Arcellx and Kite (a Gilead company) (anitocabtagene autoleucel, anito-cel), CARsgen Therapeutics (Zevor-cel, zevorcabtagene autoleucel), Kelonia Therapeutics (KLN-1010), Poseida Therapeutics/Roche (P-BCMA-ALLO1), Juno Therapeutics (Bristol Myers Squibb) (arlocabtagene autoleucel), Gracell Biopharmaceuticals (GC012F), Caribou Biosciences (CB-011), and others.

CAR T-Cell Therapy for Multiple Myeloma Market Analysis

CAR-T cell therapy is emerging as a highly promising treatment for multiple myeloma, particularly for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. These therapies target B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a protein found on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. By explicitly focusing on BCMA, CAR-T therapies have shown remarkable efficacy, achieving high response rates in patients who have already undergone and exhausted other treatment options.

Currently, two CAR-T therapies, ABECMA (idecabtagene vicleucel) and CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), have received FDA approval for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Notably, CARVYKTI is the first and only BCMA-targeted therapy approved by the US FDA for patients who have received at least one prior line of treatment and has become the most commercially successful CAR-T therapy for multiple myeloma, with sales in its first seven quarters surpassing historical CAR-T launches.

Despite their efficacy, CAR-T therapies are associated with safety concerns, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Initial adoption may also be limited by factors including cost, convenience, and manufacturing turnaround time; however, ongoing advancements are expected to reduce side effects and accelerate production. In heavily pretreated multiple myeloma patients, CAR-T therapies are a significant focus, though bispecific antibodies have also been approved in this segment. While CAR-T therapies are often preferred, they come with their own challenges, and research continues to explore optimal sequencing with bispecific antibodies, given the high overall response rates observed for both classes.

As a novel and innovative treatment, CAR-T therapy has relatively few agents currently under clinical development for multiple myeloma. These include Anitocabtagene autoleucel (Arcellx/Kite), Zevor-cel (zevorcabtagene autoleucel) from CARsgen Therapeutics, Arlocabtagene autoleucel (Juno Therapeutics/Bristol-Myers Squibb), and others.

[TITLE]Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Market Forecast Report 2025-2035, with Focus on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi, Merck & Co., Checkpoint Therapeutics, Incyte, and Sirnaomics:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Market - A Global and Regional Analysis: Focus on Country and Region - Analysis and Forecast, 2025-2035" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma market is poised for significant growth as increasing incidences of skin cancers, and advancements in treatment modalities continue to drive market expansion. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common form of non-melanoma skin cancer, is experiencing a growing prevalence due to heightened UV exposure, environmental factors, and demographic shifts such as an aging global population. As a result, the need for early detection, and effective treatment strategies has never been more critical, with healthcare providers and researchers focusing on improving patient outcomes and reducing disease burden.

One of the most influential developments shaping the global cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma market is the rise of innovative therapies, particularly in the fields of immunotherapy and targeted treatments. Recent breakthroughs such as the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies are revolutionizing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma management, offering new hope for patients with advanced or metastatic disease. These therapies have demonstrated superior efficacy compared to traditional treatments, leading to increased adoption across various healthcare settings. The strong pipeline of investigational drugs, combined with ongoing clinical trials exploring combination therapies, is expected to significantly boost market growth in the coming years.

The growing awareness of skin cancer risks, particularly in high-incidence regions like North America, Europe, and Australia, is another key driver of the global cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma market. Public health campaigns, government initiatives, and increasing educational outreach have all contributed to earlier detection and higher screening rates. This trend is encouraging healthcare providers to invest in state-of-the-art diagnostic technologies, including dermoscopy, AI-powered imaging systems, and molecular diagnostics, thereby improving accuracy and treatment planning.

In addition, the global cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma market is witnessing increased adoption of less invasive and highly effective treatment modalities, such as Mohs micrographic surgery, cryotherapy, and laser-based approaches. These techniques not only offer high cure rates but also minimize tissue damage and cosmetic concerns, making them especially attractive for patients with tumors in sensitive or visible areas. Advances in surgical precision and post-operative care are further enhancing patient satisfaction and long-term outcomes.

However, the market is not without its challenges. The high cost of advanced therapies, particularly biologics and immunotherapies, continues to pose affordability issues especially in low- and middle-income countries. Limited access to specialized healthcare infrastructure, shortage of trained dermatologists and oncologists, and disparities in reimbursement policies may hinder the equitable growth of the global cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma market across different regions. Despite these barriers, increasing investment in global health infrastructure and a growing focus on universal healthcare coverage are expected to improve accessibility in underserved areas.

The competitive landscape of the global cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma market is becoming increasingly dynamic, with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies intensifying their focus on R&D initiatives. Strategic collaborations, mergers, and licensing agreements are facilitating faster drug development and broader distribution networks.

Looking ahead, the global cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma market is expected to maintain a strong growth trajectory. Factors such as technological advancements in diagnostics, rising incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, expanding geriatric population, and increased public and private healthcare spending will continue to support market expansion. As awareness and access improve globally, the market is anticipated to play an increasingly prominent role in the broader oncology and dermatology sectors, offering improved clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients worldwide.

The global cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma market is expected to see significant expansion, driven by continuous innovation in treatment methodologies, alongside the increasing global focus on improving patient outcomes. The adoption of advanced surgical and pharmacologic treatments is expected to propel the market to new heights over the forecast period.
