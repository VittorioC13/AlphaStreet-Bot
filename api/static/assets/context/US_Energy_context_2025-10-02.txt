[TITLE]Dragonfly Energy Holdings Corp. (DFLI) Upgraded to Hold After Ember RV Deal:
[TEXT]
Dragonfly Energy Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:DFLI) is among the best fast money stocks to buy now. On Friday, Wall Street Zen upgraded Dragonfly Energy Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:DFLI) to hold. This revision can be attributed to the company’s OEM collaboration with Ember Recreational Vehicles, which was announced on September 9, 2025. Under the contract, Ember’s 2026 Overland Series will feature Battle Born Batteries as part of the new Max Solar Package.

A testament to the many years-long partnership with Ember, the new standard Max Solar Package will enable Ember’s customers to benefit from a complete energy system for prolonged off-grid adventures, including 3.5 to 7 kWh of LiFePO₄ batteries and 1,200 watts of rooftop solar.

Why AirJoule Technologies Corp (AIRJ) Is Plunging in 2025?

Developed to support a wide range of needs, the power system will include Battle Born GC3 deep-cycle batteries to enhance the overall experience. As stated by Wade Seaburg, Chief Commercial Officer of Dragonfly Energy Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:DFLI),

By making Battle Born Batteries standard in the Overland Series, we believe Ember is giving its customers the energy storage capacity they need to take full advantage of their solar power. That means longer run times, the ability to power real appliances, and a more confident experience off the grid.

Dragonfly Energy Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:DFLI), headquartered in Reno, Nevada, is a manufacturer and seller of deep-cycle lithium-ion batteries for vehicles, vessels, and industrial and energy storage markets. With a commitment to providing sustainable power solutions, the company operates through two segments: direct-to-consumers and original equipment manufacturers.

While we acknowledge the potential of DFLI as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]BP Invests in New $5 Billion U.S. Gulf Oil Project:
[TEXT]
BP has reached the final investment decision on its estimated $5 billion Tiber-Guadalupe project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as part of its strategy to grow upstream production and boost its U.S. output to more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030.

Tiber-Guadalupe, 100%-owned by the UK-based supermajor, will be BP’s seventh operated oil and gas production hub in the Gulf of America, featuring a new floating production platform with the capacity to produce 80,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

Production from the project is expected to start in 2030 and is one of the 8-10 major projects that BP plans to start up globally between 2028 and 2030.

The estimated $5 billion Tiber-Guadalupe project is fully accommodated within BP prudent financial framework, which the supermajor geared toward the upstream business earlier this year in a major strategy reset to slash investments in renewables and focus on its core business of producing oil and gas.

Under the new strategy, BP will aim for 10 new major upstream projects to start up by the end of 2027, and a further 8–10 projects by the end of 2030. Production is also expected to grow to 2.3–2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in 2030, with capacity to increase to 2035.

In the United States, together with its 100%-owned Kaskida project, BP expects to invest around $10 billion to deliver its Gulf of America Paleogene projects.

Tiber-Guadalupe and Kaskida will help BP to boost its capacity to produce more than 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from the U.S. offshore region by 2030. The major aims to increase its offshore and onshore production in the United States to more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030.

“Along with its sister project Kaskida, Tiber-Guadalupe will play a critical role in bp’s focus on delivering secure and reliable energy the world needs today and tomorrow,” said Andy Krieger, BP’s senior vice president, Gulf of America and Canada.

Just last week, BP said that global oil demand is set to rise through 2030 amid weaker-than-expected efficiency gains. In its 2025 Energy Outlook, BP ditched its forecast from last year that oil demand could peak as soon as this year.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies sells half of US solar portfolio, invests in natural gas assets:
[TEXT]

As anti-renewables sentiment swirls in the United States, French international energy giant TotalEnergies is offloading half of its North American solar portfolio in a transaction with an enterprise value of $1.25 billion. At the same time, the company has signaled its commitment to expanding natural gas production stateside, acquiring a 49% interest in assets owned and operated by Continental Resources in the Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma.

The moves are part of a plan to cut annual capital spending by $1 billion and sell more power assets. However, the market still seems concerned with TotalEnergies’ recent rise in debt. Shares fell 2% after CEO Patrick Pouyanne hosted an investor day on Monday, according to Reuters. The company’s capex cut, to $15–17 billion a year for 2027 to 2030, is part of a drive to save $7.5 billion.

Selling Solar

On Monday, TotalEnergies signed an agreement with insurance vehicles and accounts managed by KKR, a leading global investment firm, for the sale of a 50% stake in its 1.4 gigawatt (GW) solar portfolio in North America. TotalEnergies expects to receive a total of $950 million at closing, following refinancing.

The transaction includes six utility-scale solar assets with a combined capacity of 1.3 GW and 41 distributed generation assets totalling 140 megawatts (MW), primarily in the United States. The electricity production of each project has either been sold to third parties or will be commercialized by TotalEnergies. TotalEnergies will keep a 50% stake in the assets and continue to operate them after the closing of the transaction.

“We are pleased to enter into this new strategic partnership with KKR in North America, a key deregulated electricity market, to expand our integrated business model”, said Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables & Power at TotalEnergies. “Aligned with our strategy, this transaction unlocks value from newly commissioned assets and further strengthens the profitability of our Integrated Power business.”

TotalEnergies has committed more than $23 billion to date in energy transition investments.

“TotalEnergies’ North American solar portfolio is a great fit for us, representing high-quality renewable energy assets with long-term contracts,” observed Cecilio Velasco, managing director at KKR.

Buying Natural Gas

TotalEnergies also announced an agreement Monday with Continental Resources to acquire a 49% interest in natural gas-producing assets owned and operated by Continental Resources in the Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma. This acquisition of low-cost and long-plateau assets, well connected to Henry Hub through existing midstream infrastructure, further strengthens TotalEnergies’ integration across the liquefied natural gas (LNG) value chain in the United States, according to the company.

The assets have the potential to reach a gross production of around 350 MMscfd by 2030 and to sustain this production level over the long term. They will enable TotalEnergies to secure a net gas production of around 150 MMscfd. This acquisition of non-operated shale gas assets complements the Dorado and Constellation acquisitions that TotalEnergies completed in 2024 in the Eagle Ford Basin. TotalEnergies also operates a technical production of around 500 MMscfd in the Barnett.

“This acquisition will further increase our natural gas production in the United States and consolidate TotalEnergies’ integrated LNG position with a competitive low-cost and low-emission gas production”, said Nicolas Terraz, President, exploration & production at TotalEnergies. “We are delighted to partner with Continental Resources, a reference operator in the Anadarko Basin, recognized for its strong technical expertise and operational excellence.”

[TITLE]Vistra announces Comanche deal, plan to add 860 MW of natural gas:
[TEXT]
Vistra Corp. has reached a final investment decision to expand gas capacity at its Permian Basin Power Plant, locking in a plan to build two new natural gas power units totaling 860 MW, the company said Monday.

“This expansion more than triples the site's current capacity from 325 MW to 1,185 MW,” Vistra said in a release. The decision to expand was “based on customer demand and to meet West Texas' growing power needs, particularly the state's expanding oil and natural gas industries.”

“As the leading competitive generator in Texas, customers from residential to commercial and industrial are turning to Vistra to help them meet their energy needs,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “We recognize that energy is critical to powering this economic opportunity, and we expect Texas will play an outsized role.”

Vistra also filed an 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, confirming that it “has entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement (with options to extend for up to an additional 20 years) with a large, investment grade company ... pursuant to which the Company has agreed to supply to the Customer 1,200 MW of carbon-free power from the Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant.”

Vistra said it “anticipates power delivery to begin in the fourth quarter of 2027 and ramp to full capacity by 2032.” The company received permission last year from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the operation of Comanche through 2053, an additional 20 years beyond its original licenses.

On Sept. 22, Jefferies downgraded Vistra’s stock to “hold” based on the lack of a deal up to that point and their view that the company’s stock, which rallied based on excitement

[TITLE]La Caisse to Acquire Australian Renewable Energy Firm Edify Energy:
[TEXT]
'The agreement with La Caisse is a pivotal moment for Edify, providing balance sheet strength to seriously ramp up Edify's speed of execution of firm dispatchable green generator'.

Global investment group La Caisse said it has entered into a binding agreement to acquire renewable energy and battery storage company Edify Energy and support its next phase of growth.

Once completed, the transaction, together with further equity capital funding, is expected to represent an investment of around $0.72 billion (CAD 1 billion). The investment will fund the acquisition of Edify and provide equity to finance two ready-to-build integrated solar and battery energy storage system (BESS) hybrid projects totaling 900 megawatts (MW) / 3,600 megawatt-hours (MWh) for its offtake partners, Rio Tinto and the Commonwealth of Australia, La Caisse said in a news release.

The transaction will also support Edify's pipeline of hybrid and battery storage projects of more than 11 gigawatts (GW), according to the release.

“The agreement with La Caisse is a pivotal moment for Edify, providing balance sheet strength to seriously ramp up Edify’s speed of execution of firm dispatchable green generators,” John Cole, Edify founder and executive chairman, said.

“I am so very proud of the business that Edify has become and the exceptional team that creates and delivers the solutions to meet and exceed the needs of our customers and the grid. In La Caisse, we have found the perfect owner to supercharge the business and take Edify’s enviable market position to the next level,” Cole added.

"Our acquisition of Edify highlights the track record and expertise of its team and a commitment to Australia’s clean energy future," Emmanuel Jaclot, executive vice president and head of infrastructure and sustainability at La Caisse, said.

"With our long-term capital and sustainability expertise, Edify will accelerate the delivery of large-scale renewable and storage projects that strengthen the grid and advance decarbonization. This reflects our strong conviction in the critical role these technologies will continue to play in the global energy transition,” Jaclot said.

Founded in 2015, Edify describes itself as one of Australia’s leading green electricity companies, with expertise spanning the full life-cycle of renewable energy development and operations. The company said it pioneered the country’s first utility-scale solar and battery storage project in 2018 and has since delivered 11 projects across New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, totaling more than 1.1 GW of capacity.

Earlier in the month, Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and La Caisse launched a large-scale, diversified agricultural platform to generate high-quality Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs), with global miner Rio Tinto as a foundation offtaker.

La Caisse said it has invested $131 million (AUD 200 million), with a $33 million (AUD 50 million) commitment from the CEFC, to create the Meldora platform, managed by Australian agriculture and natural capital asset manager, Gunn Agri Partners (GAP).

Meldora has purchased its first asset, a broadacre and irrigation farm of more than 15,000 hectares in Central Queensland, according to an earlier statement.

Meldora will combine sustainable agricultural production with large-scale Environmental Plantings under the ACCU scheme, underpinned by a long-term offtake from Rio Tinto for part of the ACCUs to be issued. Under the Environmental Plantings methodology for ACCUs, native vegetation is planted and maintained for a minimum of 25 years for some projects and as long as a century for others, providing long-term carbon sequestration and biodiversity benefits, the statement said.

[TITLE]Private equity sees profits in power utilities as electric bills rise and Big Tech seeks more energy:
[TEXT]
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”
