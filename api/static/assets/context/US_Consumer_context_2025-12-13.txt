[TITLE]CEO TALKS: Galeries Lafayette’s Nicolas Houzé Talks Big Investment Bets as ‘Boring Retail Is Dead’:
[TEXT]
PARIS — Retail runs in Nicolas Houzé’s blood.

A fifth-generation member of the French family behind Galeries Lafayette, Houzé joined the business in 2006, led the department store as chief executive officer for more than a decade, then followed his father’s footsteps into the role of chair of the group’s executive board last year.

In addition to steering the Galeries Lafayette Group, he chairs France’s strategic committee for fashion and luxury and presides over the union of city-center retailers. On Dec. 1, he was also named president of the International Association of Department Stores, taking the helm as global retail continues to seek recovery.

Last month, Houzé marked a milestone for the group by opening Galeries Lafayette’s first store in India, which is the country’s first stand-alone high-street department store. He has been central to leading the company’s post-pandemic recovery while expanding its international footprint and navigating the shifting trends in fashion, e-commerce and rapidly-changing consumer habits.

In a wide-ranging interview in his office with sweeping views of the Sacré-Cœur, Houzé said the group is doubling down on its department-store model even as much of the industry pulls back, and gaining traction from a growing demand for watches, jewelry and beauty, following the overall rebound at its Paris flagship.

Early acquisitions of multibrand retailers Louis Pion and Royal Quartz, and later the Mauboussin jewelry brand, helped secure the group’s position in the watch and jewelry segment and reinforced relationships with brands such as Rolex — all of which were aimed at strengthening Galeries Lafayette’s core business.

While many were sounding the death knell for brick-and-mortar retail during the pandemic, the group took a counterintuitive bet with a 400 million euro investment to renovate its flagship on Boulevard Haussmann in Paris over four years. The move paid off, with sales returning to 2019 levels by 2024.

A further 400 million euros is now earmarked for upgrades in Paris — including a full overhaul of the stand-alone men’s building to be completed by the end of 2027 — and across its regional network, positioning the family-owned retailer for a new phase of growth.

Galeries Lafayette is still pursuing measured international expansion and strengthening its brand globally. It is reexamining its China strategy, and has an eye on opportunities in the Middle East, including Riyadh.

Houzé spoke to WWD

Focusing on companies with consistently strong profit margins signals stable operations, pricing power, and effective cost control—qualities that reduce risk and support predictable, long-term returns. In the September quarter, retail investors increased holdings in 133 stocks (market cap above Rs 2,500 crore, net sales over Rs 100 crore, net profit margin above 10% for four consecutive quarters), excluding banks and financials.

[TITLE]Why Jim Cramer is optimistic after Magnum Ice Cream's IPO:
[TEXT]
CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday explained why he's fairly positive on Magnum Ice Cream Company, which made its Wall Street debut earlier this week after spinning off from consumer giant Unilever .

"We finally, by the grace of God — or at least, the grace of Unilever — have a pure play ice cream stock, now that The Magnum Ice Cream Company has been spun off and started trading independently," he said. "And, after taking a closer look at the story, I have to say, this one's pretty sweet."

Magnum Ice Cream might fare better as an independent company than as part of a giant conglomerate, Cramer suggested. He noted that the company struggled for a while under Unilever but said business has picked up since the dessert maker started spinning off. He indicated the improvement could be in part a result of the company's autonomy and ability to concentrate on the product.

Cramer cited comments from Magnum Ice Cream CEO Peter ter Kulve, who told CNBC that "Unilever had to focus on its category, and we needed real focus on ice cream." ter Kulve said his company is now able to invest in its "growth opportunity" without having "to balance that between all kinds of different categories at Unilever."

Cramer stressed that Magnum Ice Cream is the biggest player on the field as it owns some of the world's largest brands: Wall's, Ben & Jerry's, Cornetto, Breyer's, Good Humor, Klondike, its namesake, as well as Talenti gelato. Magnum Ice Cream claims it has 21% global market share, Cramer pointed out, which is almost double that of its leading competitor.

Magnum Ice Cream also seems able to handle the rise of GLP-1 weight loss drugs, Cramer said, even as the broader snack and junk food industry has been hurt by the trend.

Now might be a good time to buy the stock because the price-to-earnings multiple is lower than many of its packaged goods peers, Cramer said, such as Mondelez , Hershey and Nestle. However, he conceded that those names are expected to grow their earnings next year while Magnum Ice Cream is anticipating small loss.

"Still, the stock's trading at a pretty sizable discount to its peers," Cramer said. "So if you want to bet on the ice cream business, you've got my blessing to do some buying right here."

Magnum Ice Cream did not immediately respond to request for comment.

[TITLE]Nestle India's Premiumisation Game: CEO Manish Tiwary Eyes Tighter SKUs On Quick Comm Boost:
[TEXT]
Discussing his vision for consumers, Tiwary said many people in the Delhi-NCR region, especially Gurugram are now living like Europeans. "I want every house in Gururgram to have an espresso machine as they can afford it. They are used to it and now with the quick commerce segment, they have a new route to markets," Tiwary told NDTV Profit.

Tiwary explained that earlier if one walked into a store, a company could have a maximum of 5,000-6,000 SKUs because real estate is expensive. "Today one of our best selling SKUs in NCR's quick commerce region is Nescafe Roastery. The product comes in medium roast and black roast."

According to the newly-appointed CEO, earlier it was very difficult to search for these products in a physical store. "Now, with search algorithm, we get to know the moment consumers buy a roastery. So, that quick route to markets is definitely helping us boost our e-commerce journey," he said.

According to Nestle, the company is witnessing premiumisation trend universally across urban and rural, the maker of Maggi, Kit Kat, and Nescafe. In the traditional trade space, Tiwary highlighted the resilience of the service by the local kirana waalas in urban and rural areas. ''I see them as the backbone. Organised market can never match that," he said.

Nestle India is probably the best supplier when it comes to supply chain market. "This is why our market share in quick commerce are better than in general trade. I see that working well for us. The segment will grow as long as innovation lasts," he said. Tiwary said Nestle India has fixed a revenue target of achieving over annual 40% growth in the rural space.

[TITLE]‘Dynamic pricing’ used to raise costs of everything from food and Uber rides to museum visits:
[TEXT]
If you feel like you’re being nickel-and-dimed everywhere you shop – you probably are.

Instacart has been using a shady AI algorithm that charges different prices to different customers on the same grocery items in the same stores without telling them, according to an explosive study released by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative earlier this week.

At a Target store in North Canton, Ohio, for example, the popular grocery app charged one customer $2.99 for Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter – while other Instacart users paid as much as $3.59 for the same jar picked up from the same location, the study found.

But it’s not just Instacart using cutting-edge tech to set higher prices. So-called “dynamic pricing” practices have been used by rideshares Uber and Lyft; Las Vegas convenience stores; children’s museums and zoos; and even your local grocery stores.

4 One customer at Caesars Palace noted that his wife was charged $10 for a Snickers bar and Gatorade and the next day, he was charged $14 for the same items Tam Nguyen / NYPost Design

Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and Kroger have already rolled out electronic price tags that allow workers to raise shelf prices in a matter of minutes. Walmart has said it’s planning to add the tags to thousands of stores by 2026.

Variable pricing is nothing new, but artificial intelligence has made it easier for companies of all sizes to leverage dynamic pricing – and “when something is easier to use, it becomes easy also to take advantage of,” said Pascal Yammine, CEO at Zilliant, an AI-driven pricing strategy firm.

Wendy’s faced heated backlash last year over its plans to invest $20 million in digital menu boards that could change the price of a Dave’s burger in real time – but it quickly walked back the comments, saying it “will not implement surge pricing … We didn’t use that phrase.”

While businesses have always adjusted prices to find the highest amount a customer will fork over, now artificial intelligence, advanced algorithms and massive troves of user data are allowing companies to be more exacting than ever.

“The problem isn’t that companies across multiple industries are using AI for dynamic pricing or even surge pricing,” Yammine said. “The problem is more around transparency and trust.”

Variable pricing, after all, can benefit consumers in some ways – offering discounts when they bulk-buy at Costco, allowing them to compare Amazon prices to other retailers online, and saving them money on plane tickets and vacations when they book during off-seasons, he noted.

The problem arises when data collection and algorithms are used without customers’ knowledge, experts said.

Just last month, the Justice Department settled its case against real estate tech firm RealPage, which allegedly used “completely sensitive information” to jack up rents for tenants.

Around the same time, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul made New York the first state to prohibit the use of algorithmic tools in setting rent prices.

Furious New Yorkers have blasted “slime balls” Uber and Lyft for hiking prices when subway lines are shut down during rainstorms – reportedly charging $80 for a 10-minute ride to work.

People have also reported being charged higher Uber fares when using a personal credit card instead of a corporate one. Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog suggested in a report that Uber might charge more on users with low phone batteries — the idea seeming to be that customers are more likely to pay higher prices when they’re desperate — though the company denied this.

CANTON, Mass. and NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Destination XL Group, Inc. (“DXL”) (NASDAQ: DXLG), the leading integrated commerce retailer of Big + Tall men’s clothing and footwear, and FBB Holdings I, Inc.
