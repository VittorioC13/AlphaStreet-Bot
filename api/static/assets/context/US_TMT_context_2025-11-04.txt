[TITLE]TCS says $6.5 bn data-centre bet will lag IT business on profitability:
[TEXT]
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s management has admitted that the profitability of its $6.5-billion pivot towards data centres will be lower than that of its mainstay information technology (IT) services business.

“Yes, it (data centre business) won't get the same RoEs (return on equity) as you would expect from the TCS business, but we are confident we'll be able to maintain industry-leading return ratios," said chief financial officer Samir Seksaria in a fireside chat between the company's management and Kotak Institutional Equities.

RoE, a measure of profitability, shows how effectively a company uses shareholder investments to generate earnings.

On 9 October, the country’s largest IT services company announced plans to establish a 1GW AI data centre in India through a new business unit, which it later named HyperVault AI Data Centre Ltd. The company said it expects to achieve this in phases by spending

[TITLE]I spoke to Bill de Blasio about being cloned—and what public figures can do when AI fakes strike: ‘All you can do is go online and deny what it is’:
[TEXT]
In the age of AI, reality could be rewritten overnight. One day, you’re publicly supporting one of your favorite mayoral candidates—the next, an AI-generated quote states the opposite.

That situation happened to former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio (important distinction the d is lower case not uppercase). Days leading up to the New York City mayor’s race, a reporter from The Times of London sent an email to what he thought was Bill de Blasio on his thoughts on Zohran Mamdani’s policies, who is a democrat leading in the race.

The results were unexpected, as the respondent wrote, “In my view, the math doesn’t hold up under scrutiny, and the political hurdles are substantial.” After picking up on other outlets and social media, the real Bill de Blasio stood up, saying the story was entirely false and fabricated, and doesn’t reflect his views.

The person impersonating him admitted to using ChatGPT to compose a response criticizing Mamdani’s tax plans, saying it was unlikely to raise the amount of money to reach his goals.

The scenario, now resolved, raises another question: What do you do if you are catfished by AI, a deepfake, or someone online?

[TITLE]Exclusive-Nexperia cuts wafer supplies to Chinese plant, ratcheting up chip disruptions:
[TEXT]
By Che Pan and Wen-Yee Lee

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has suspended supplies of wafers to its Chinese assembly plant, according to a letter addressed to its customers that was reviewed by Reuters, which could exacerbate a supply squeeze that is worrying automakers worldwide.

The letter, which was dated October 29 and signed by Nexperia interim CEO Stefan Tilger, said the company imposed the suspension on supplies to its plant in Dongguan, in southern China's Guangdong province, on October 26, saying it was "a direct consequence of the local management's recent failure to comply with the agreed contractual payment terms."

Nexperia has been locked in a dispute with its Chinese unit after the Dutch government took control of Nexperia from its Chinese owner Wingtech Technology on September 30. It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.

Nexperia's move came after the Dutch chipmaker's Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.

LARGE VOLUMES OF CHIPS

The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70% of the Netherlands-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.

"While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable," the letter said.

"Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers."

Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem.

Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.

A spokesperson for Nexperia confirmed it sent the letter and the company could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A spokesperson for the Dutch government referred questions about the wafer shut-off to Nexperia, saying the move had been a corporate decision while state intervention "concerns the preservation of production capacity and is not aimed at the company's day-to-day operations".

[TITLE]Taiwan plans to raise 2025 growth target as AI boom boosts Q3 figures:
[TEXT]
TAIPEI :Taiwan plans to raise its economic growth forecast this year to more than 5 per cent after the economy expanded by a better-than-expected rate in the third quarter given a strong performance by the crucial tech sector thanks to the AI boom.

Taiwan's gross domestic product grew 7.64 per cent year-on-year in the July-September quarter, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said on Friday. That surpassed the 6.0 per cent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, though slightly lagged the 8.01 per cent growth rate in the second quarter.

The better-than-expected growth will pave the way to raise the full-year forecast to more than 5 per cent, the agency said, from a previous prediction of 4.45 per cent. A formal unveiling of the final forecast for 2025 will come at the end of next month.

"The performance was truly outstanding," said analyst Kevin Wang of Taishin Investment Advisory. "It mainly benefited from strong demand for AI, driving increased capital expenditure in the cloud industry, supporting robust AI exports, and offsetting the impact of weak exports from traditional industries."

Taiwan's key semiconductor chip industry is currently exempt from the 20 per cent U.S. tariffs on Taiwanese exports in effect since August.

Taiwan is in talks with the United States to get that rate reduced.

Taiwan is a major hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Nvidia, and home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, whose semiconductors are widely used for AI applications.

Taiwan's tech firms have reported roaring demand thanks to the surge in interest in AI applications.

TSMC this month reported a record, forecast-beating quarterly profit, and raised its 2025 full-year revenue forecast on a bullish outlook for spending on AI.

The continued strong growth of the economy reinforces the view that Taiwan's central bank will be one of the few in Asia to leave interest rates unchanged this coming year, some analysts said.

"The main reasons are mild inflationary pressure and the far better-than-expected economic growth," said Wang.

Taiwan's statistics agency will provide revised figures on November 28 with more details and the update of its forward-looking forecasts.

NEW DELHI: PE firm Tillman Global Holdings (TGH) is in negotiations to invest $4-6 billion (around Rs 35,000-52,800 crore) in Vodafone Idea (Vi) and take operational control of the cash-strapped and loss-making telecom operator, people aware of the matter said.The investment, however, will happen only if the government provides a comprehensive package covering all the liabilities of Vi, including dues based on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) and spectrum payments.“If the deal happens, TGH will take the promoter status and take control from existing promoters Aditya Birla Group and UK’s Vodafone ,” said one of the people. The Indian government — telco’s largest shareholder with a nearly 49% stake — will stay a passive minority investor, he said.The New York-based investment firm is not seeking a waiver of all dues, but a restructuring of the liabilities that will give some breathing space to the company, and has submitted a detailed proposal to the government, the people said.“The proposal from TGH would be in conjunction with the dues being resolved. The restructuring package sought by the firm would be conditioned on its investment and its investment would be conditioned on the waiver package,” said the person quoted earlier.In case the government provides a relief package to Vi, a deal may be finalised in the coming months.“From the government’s perspective, it’s not

The apex court allowing the Centre to reconsider and reconcile Vodafone Idea 's Rs 5,606 crore AGR dues for FY17 offers the government a space to formulate a plan for the telco's sustainability, according to various brokerages.Citi, in its report, termed the Monday's developments in the Supreme Court as one that could have significant positive ramifications for Vodafone Idea.Citi believes that AGR relief could be in the form of a partial waiver of dues or extension of timeline for payment of the dues, even a combination of the two."...today's development should, in our view, help clear the overhang around VI's sustainability," Citi said.With a large lumpsum amount towards AGR dues coming up for payment by VIL to the government in March 2026, Citi believes "that relief from the government should be forthcoming well ahead of this deadline i.e., in the coming weeks and months".Clarity on relief towards AGR dues from the government has been a key challenge and major obstacle for Vodafone Idea in completing its Rs 25,000 crore planned bank funding."We reckon AGR relief by the government could provide much-needed confidence to banks to extend credit to the company. This, in turn, would alleviate concerns

[TITLE]Malaysia exempts US tech giants from digital taxes and USP contribution:
[TEXT]
Last weekend, Malaysia and the United States (US) have signed a trade agreement which covers several aspects in the digital and technology space.

Among the key provisions is Malaysia’s agreement not to impose a digital service tax on US tech companies and to scrap the mandatory 6% contribution to a domestic fund previously required to operate in the country.

When it comes to ICT infrastructure, including 5G and 6G, Malaysia also commits to using only technology suppliers that meet agreed security standards, in mutual consultation with the United States.

Digital service tax exemption for US tech firms

Under the agreement, Malaysia shall not impose any form of digital services taxes, or similar taxes that discriminate against US tech companies. This is seen as a move to protect US-based digital service providers ranging from social media to streaming and cloud computing platforms.

Malaysia has imposed a 6% digital tax on online services since 1st January 2020. The government has collected over RM400 million in the first year and RM1.6 billion in 2024. The service tax on digital services is applicable on various online platforms such as Google, Netflix, Adobe, PlayStation Store, Steam, Facebook and AWS.

With this agreement, Malaysians may soon be able to subscribe and access these US-based digital services without the digital tax.

Waiver of 6% Universal Service Provision (USP) contribution for US tech giants

Besides digital tax, Malaysia has agreed to exempt US social media and cloud service providers from contributing to a domestic fund in order to operate in Malaysia. The clause effectively exempts major US tech platforms from contributing to MCMC’s Universal Service Provision (USP) fund, which supports telecommunications and rural connectivity initiatives such as deploying new towers and fibre in underserved areas.

Currently, all social media and cloud service providers, both domestic and international operating in Malaysia, are required to contribute 6% of their revenue to the fund like any other telco as part of their licence requirement from the MCMC.

Transparent and impartial regulation for social media and cloud partners

The agreement also states that Malaysia shall administer its domestic laws and regulations for social media platforms and cloud providers in a transparent, impartial, and non-discriminatory manner, and in accordance with the principles of due process.

This seems to indicate that any regulatory enforcement by the MCMC on US-based platforms, which may include content moderation or data disclosure, must be conducted according to clear procedures, in a transparent and fair manner, and without discrimination.

Permanent suspension of DNS redirection to local DNS servers

Interestingly, the agreement also touches on the controversial DNS redirection that was conducted quietly by the MCMC in 2024. As part of the agreement, Malaysia shall repeal or permanently suspend the directive of redirecting all DNS traffic to local DNS service.

As reported back in August 2024, telcos had been instructed by the MCMC to enhance their “DNS management” to protect citizens from online harm. At the time, internet traffic that goes through alternative DNS such as Google and Cloudflare were forced back to local DNS. After public backlash, Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil announced a U Turn on the directive.

Trusted technology clauses for 5G, 6G, satellites and undersea cables

A key addition in the agreement is Malaysia’s pledge to only use communications technology suppliers that do not compromise the “security, safeguards, or intellectual property” of ICT infrastructure. This covers major critical connectivity from 5G and 6G networks, satellite communications and undersea cables.

It is also stated that both Malaysia and US governments will consult to determine whether specific suppliers fail to meet these standards. On the surface, this seems to imply that Malaysia is aligning towards US-backed and trusted technology partners.

Malaysia must consult US on digital trade, no restrictions on rare earth exports

Malaysia is also required to consult with the United States before entering into a new digital trade agreement with another country that jeopardises US interest.

Separately, Malaysia is also required to refrain from banning critical mineral exports to the US and shall remove any rare earth export quota to the US. Malaysia also commits to the expedient development of its rare earth and critical minerals in partnership with US companies to ensure secure and diversified supply chains.

Malaysia also must provide greater certainty for companies involved in critical mineral extraction, including granting extended operating licenses with a focus on enhancing their technical capabilities, creating certainty for businesses to increase production and supporting operational growth.

Malaysia also agrees to encourage supply of rare earth magnets on favourable terms to the US, subject to mutually agreed arrangements. Malaysia shall also not impose restrictions on the sale of rare earth magnets to US companies.

What are the long-term implications for Malaysia’s digital and tech policy?

The trade agreement signed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and US President Donald Trump offers Malaysia better access to the US market. While the US reciprocal tariffs on Malaysia is still maintained at 19%, 1,711 items have been exempted which include key export commodities such as palm oil, rubber, cocoa, aircraft components and pharmaceuticals.

Although Malaysia’s exemptions and security clauses in the tech sector will largely benefit US technology giants, questions remain over their long-term implications for domestic players and other global tech ecosystems.

Will Malaysia extend the 6% digital-tax exemption and 6% USP-fund contribution waiver to Malaysia-based platforms and cloud-service providers? If not, this could create an uneven playing field where US tech companies enjoy preferential advantages over home-grown innovators.

The technology clauses governing critical ICT infrastructure and digital trade also raise concerns about Malaysia’s freedom of technology choice. At present, U Mobile is partnering with Huawei and ZTE for its second 5G network rollout. Several years ago, the United States warned Malaysia about potential national security risks arising from Huawei’s involvement in the country’s 5G rollout.

Will Malaysia’s technology options in future be limited to suppliers deemed favourable to the West? How do we ensure digital sovereignty and fair competition?

[TITLE]Judges Are Noticing Error-Ridden, AI-Generated Legal Briefs:
[TEXT]
Judges around the world are dealing with a growing problem: legal briefs that were generated with the help of artificial intelligence and submitted with errors such as citations to cases that don't exist, according to attorneys and court documents. The trend serves as a cautionary tale for people who are learning to use AI tools at work, the AP reports. Many employers want to hire workers who can use the technology to help with tasks such as conducting research and drafting reports. As teachers, accountants, and marketing professionals begin engaging with AI chatbots and assistants to generate ideas and improve productivity, they're also discovering the programs can make mistakes.

A French data scientist and lawyer, Damien Charlotin, has catalogued at least 490 court filings in the past six months that contained "hallucinations," which are AI responses that contain false or misleading information. The pace is accelerating as more people use AI, he said. "Even the more sophisticated player can have an issue with this," Charlotin said. "AI can be a boon. It's wonderful, but also there are these pitfalls." Charlotin, a senior research fellow at HEC Paris, a business school located just outside France's capital city, created a database to track cases in which a judge ruled that generative AI produced hallucinated content such as fabricated case law and false quotes. The majority of rulings are from US cases in which plaintiffs represented themselves without an attorney, he said.

But even high-profile companies have submitted problematic legal documents. A federal judge in Colorado ruled that a lawyer for MyPillow Inc., filed a brief containing nearly 30 defective citations as part of a defamation case against the company and founder Michael Lindell. The legal profession isn't the only one wrestling with AI's foibles. The AI overviews that appear at the top of web search result pages frequently contain errors. And AI tools also raise privacy concerns. Workers in all industries need to be cautious about the details they upload or put into prompts to ensure they're safeguarding the confidential information of employers and clients. (For more, the AP has tips for how to use AI at work more safely.)

[TITLE]OpenAI Just Cut a Deal With California. Critics Say It’s Full of Holes:
[TEXT]
“We will be keeping a close eye on OpenAI to ensure ongoing adherence to its charitable mission and the protection of the safety of all Californians,” Bonta wrote.

Robert Bartlett, a professor of law and business at Stanford Law School, has studied and worked in the venture capital ecosystem for three decades. He said OpenAI’s start as a nonprofit was unusual and related to its unique mission around artificial intelligence. But it found being a nonprofit restrictive, making it difficult to raise capital and compensate its employees with equity in the company. Its restructuring should pave the way for an eventual initial public offering.

Bartlett said the new arrangement that the nonprofit, a minority stakeholder, will have oversight of the public benefit corporation is also unusual. He said the deal envisions a “pretty active role” for the nonprofit’s safety committee, which will include the right to control safety procedures and halt the release of AI models made by the corporation. OpenAI previously named four members of the safety committee on its website and has said all current members of the non-profit board will serve on the for-profit board, with some as observers.

But not knowing exactly how much overlap there might be between the boards of the nonprofit and the corporation is a big question, as is the ultimate composition of the committee, Bartlett said.

“We’ll have to see what happens, who’s on the committee, how active (they are), and their relationship to OpenAI,” Bartlett said. “Will (the structure) be meaningful and consistent with the AG’s focus on safety?”

Steven Adler previously led a product safety team at OpenAI. On Tuesday he published an op-ed in the New York Times that argues that the company can’t be trusted when they say they can safely deploy erotica chatbots in part because it has a history of ignoring risks.

He told CalMatters that under the restructure that he thinks the nonprofit’s safety committee needs more independence to operate effectively. “I hope that a truly independent body will do a better job of protecting the organization’s mission than one that feels any pull toward profits,” he said.

“There’s a bazillion conflicts of interest here.” Judith Bell, San Francisco Foundation

OpenAI’s restructuring drew ire from Eyes On OpenAI, a coalition of more than 60 California nonprofit organizations who have argued for more than a year that attorneys general should force the company to transfer its assets to an independent nonprofit entity. The precedent for this approach comes from Blue Cross of California, which started as a nonprofit. Following a transfer of assets to a for-profit subsidiary in the 1990s, that organization gave more than $3 billion in stock to two foundations.

San Francisco Foundation chief Impact Officer Judith Bell, a member of the Eyes on OpenAI coalition, said the deal could set a precedent for startups to evade taxes, and is also concerned that under the restructuring the same people can serve on boards of directors for the for-profit and the nonprofit.

“There’s a bazillion conflicts of interest here,” she said, adding that those conflicts are particularly worrisome given the broad potential harms the foundation needs to keep an eye on, including how the tech impacts children, the economy, the workplace, and society.

The deal speaks to the tremendous influence of a corporation to push forward a deal, said Orson Aguilar, director of the advocacy nonprofit LatinoProsperity and a member of the Eyes On OpenAI coalition.

He believes OpenAI lost its way when key executives realized they could make an enormous amount of money for themselves. Members of the nonprofit board, meanwhile, variously quit and lost influence after some of them attempted to oust CEO Sam Altman in 2023.

“The nonprofit continues to operate under the influence of the for-profit it supposedly oversees and that’s been our biggest objection and nothing today tells us that anything meaningful has changed that,” he said.

[TITLE]China’s five-year plan shifts focus to tech self-reliance and consumer spending:
[TEXT]
Investing.com -- China outlined its economic blueprint for the next five years, signalling a strategic pivot toward technology independence and domestic consumption as the world’s second-largest economy seeks to navigate geopolitical tensions and structural challenges.

The proposed 15th Five-Year Plan, covering 2026 to 2030, prioritizes high-quality growth over rapid expansion, with technology innovation and industrial upgrades leading the agenda. The plan comes as Beijing grapples with a slowing property sector, deflationary pressures, and tightening U.S. restrictions on access to advanced technology.

The government aims to raise China’s per capita GDP from roughly $14000 expected in 2025 to between $25000 and $30000 by 2035, categorized as “moderately developed” status.

That goal implies annual economic growth of around 4.5%, a notable slowdown from the double-digit rates China achieved in previous decades but reflective of its maturing economy.

Technology self-sufficiency tops the plan’s priorities, with UBS analysts expect research and development spending to grow at least 7% annually, reaching 3.2% of GDP by 2030 from 2.7% last year.

The plan calls for a three-tier approach: strengthening basic research capabilities, expanding artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure including cloud computing and data centers, and applying AI to emerging fields such as quantum technology, bio-manufacturing, and brain-computer interfaces.

Beijing also wants to move traditional industries including mining, chemicals, shipbuilding, and textiles up the global value chain, reducing reliance on foreign technology and boosting competitiveness.

Focus on consumption

For years, China’s economy has been criticized for over-reliance on investment and exports at the expense of household spending. The new plan pledges to “significantly” increase the household consumption rate, though specific targets won’t be revealed until the final version is released in March 2026.

The government plans to strengthen social safety nets in education, healthcare, and care for children and the elderly, areas where inadequate coverage has historically prompted Chinese households to save heavily rather than spend.

UBS analysts said the proposal largely matched expectations but showed a slightly more positive emphasis on balancing supply and demand than anticipated. Detailed numerical targets and sector-specific guidelines will be released after China’s annual legislative meetings in March.

The plan marks a continuation of China’s shift away from property-driven growth toward a manufacturing and technology-led model, a transition that began under the previous five-year plan but now faces a more challenging external environment.
