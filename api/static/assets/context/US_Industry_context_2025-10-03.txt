[TITLE]Low-Carbon Construction Materials Industry Analysis Report 2025: Global Market to Reach $79.2 Billion by 2030 - Net-Zero Targets, Green Building Standards and Sustainable Investment Drive Growth:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Low-Carbon Construction Materials - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Low-Carbon Construction Materials was estimated at US$66.2 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$79.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.0% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Low-carbon construction materials are gaining rapid importance in the global effort to mitigate climate change and promote sustainable urban growth. As cities expand and infrastructure demands grow, the construction sector is under intense scrutiny for its role in greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly 40 percent of global CO2 output when combined with building operations. Traditional materials such as cement, steel, and conventional concrete have particularly high carbon footprints due to energy-intensive manufacturing processes. Low-carbon alternatives are now being adopted to reduce this environmental burden without compromising performance or durability. These materials include fly ash-based cement, recycled steel, engineered timber, geopolymer concrete, and carbon-capturing bricks. They are engineered to produce fewer emissions throughout their lifecycle, from production and transport to installation and demolition.

Governments and regulatory bodies are encouraging the use of such materials through green building codes, tax incentives, and climate pledges, while international organizations advocate for net-zero construction practices. Urban planners and developers are responding by integrating low-carbon materials into the design of schools, hospitals, commercial centers, and residential buildings. These products not only reduce carbon output but also often offer benefits such as thermal insulation, moisture control, and resistance to wear and corrosion. As sustainable architecture gains cultural and economic momentum, low-carbon materials are becoming not just an environmental choice but a strategic necessity in the future of responsible construction.

What Factors Are Driving the Global Growth of the Low-Carbon Construction Materials Market?

The growth in the global low-carbon construction materials market is driven by a convergence of regulatory mandates, climate imperatives, technological readiness, and changing stakeholder priorities. One of the most significant drivers is the commitment by governments and international bodies to reach net-zero emissions targets, many of which hinge on reducing carbon in the construction sector. Legislative action in the form of stricter emissions regulations, embodied carbon reporting requirements, and green building standards is creating a policy environment that strongly favors low-carbon materials. Investment in infrastructure, particularly in regions undergoing rapid urbanization such as Asia-Pacific and Africa, is providing opportunities for the widespread adoption of new, sustainable building technologies.

Additionally, rising energy costs and material scarcity are prompting builders to consider alternatives that offer long-term economic advantages through reduced maintenance, operational efficiency, and lower lifecycle emissions. Financial institutions and investors are increasingly directing capital toward projects that meet environmental criteria, reinforcing market growth through green bonds and sustainability-linked loans. Strategic collaborations between construction firms, technology startups, and academic institutions are accelerating research and market readiness for scalable low-carbon materials.

Digital transformation in the construction industry is further enabling the integration of these materials through tools that measure, validate, and optimize carbon performance. Public awareness and advocacy are also exerting pressure on brands and developers to disclose environmental practices and adopt greener supply chains. These interlocking drivers are building a robust foundation for the expansion of the low-carbon construction materials market, ensuring it will remain a central pillar of the global transition toward a more sustainable built environment.

How Are Innovations in Material Science Transforming the Performance of Low-Carbon Alternatives?

Material science advancements are at the heart of the ongoing transformation in low-carbon construction, enabling new formulations and composites that outperform traditional materials in both sustainability and engineering terms. Researchers and manufacturers are focusing on alternative binders and aggregates that dramatically reduce the need for carbon-intensive components like Portland cement. Innovations such as alkali-activated materials, bio-cement derived from bacterial processes, and nanomaterial-enhanced concrete are emerging as high-performance, eco-conscious options. These materials can be customized for specific structural or environmental requirements, whether it`s enhancing compressive strength, improving water resistance, or increasing thermal performance.

Technologies that integrate carbon capture and utilization (CCU) directly into the production process are also being commercialized, turning construction materials into carbon sinks rather than sources. 3D printing in construction is allowing for the precise use of low-carbon material mixtures, significantly reducing waste while maintaining structural integrity. Prefabrication and modular construction methods are also gaining popularity, as they often use advanced low-carbon composites and promote resource efficiency. In addition, recycled content is being more effectively integrated into new materials, including reclaimed aggregates, crushed glass, plastic waste, and industrial byproducts like slag or fly ash. These innovations are making it possible for architects and engineers to meet strict building codes and performance standards while drastically cutting emissions. As data-driven design tools and lifecycle assessment software become more accessible, stakeholders can make informed decisions

[TITLE]Firehawk Aerospace secures $60 million investment from Presto Tech Horizons:
[TEXT]
Firehawk Aerospace has secured an oversubscribed $60 million investment round led by 1789 Capital. The venture capital firm’s partnership group includes Donald Trump Jr. Presto Tech Horizons (PTH), a defense and resilience tech fund created through a partnership between European venture capital firm Presto Ventures and Czechoslovak Group, also contributed to the round.

Firehawk is using 3D printing technology to produce propellant and solid rocket motors. The company aims to make the manufacture of advanced energetics faster, safer, and more flexible. Their approach can also be used for artillery charges, allowing ammunition production to be rapid, reliable, and scalable.

Firehawk’s method uses commercial-off-the-shelf equipment and new additive manufacturing processes to greatly reduce production times. This transforms the energetics supply chain. With this latest funding, Firehawk plans to improve Europe’s ability to locally source critical munitions supply chain elements.

Firehawk’s defense mission gains traction

This will boost resilience and ensure sustained defense readiness for NATO and allied forces. Will Edwards, CEO of Firehawk, said, “The conflict in Ukraine proves that while drones give warfighters a decisive edge, munitions like missiles and rockets are the core of combat power.

A supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and propellant and energetics production are currently the biggest constraints on missile, rocket, and artillery manufacturing. Enabling the European defense industry to produce these weapons quickly and at scale is the core of Firehawk’s mission. We’re proud to partner with Presto Tech Horizons and CSG to bolster the European energetics supply chain.”

Michal Strnad, Chairman of the Board and owner of Czechoslovak Group, stressed the importance of investing in innovative defense technologies given the current geopolitical climate.

“Firehawk can play a crucial role in the future of not only rocket propulsion but also ammunition production. This innovative project can strengthen cooperation between leaders of the American and European defense industries.”

The involved parties are already looking at opportunities for industrial application of Firehawk’s technologies. Matej Luhovy, newly appointed Partner at Presto Tech Horizons, said, “Since the early 2010s, scientists and engineers have explored 3D printing to unlock faster, safer, and more flexible solid propellant production.

Firehawk is the first to truly deliver on that promise. Their technology doesn’t just speed up propellant manufacture—it fundamentally reshapes the supply chain for missiles and rockets.”

This investment marks a major milestone for Firehawk Aerospace and its mission to revolutionize the energetics supply chain for defense industries.
