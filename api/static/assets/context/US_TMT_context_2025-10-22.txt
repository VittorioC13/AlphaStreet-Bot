[TITLE]Are We in a Financial Bubble?:
[TEXT]
While there is ample reason to believe that AI-driven investments are in bubble territory, the real question is when – and how – the end might come. For anyone hazarding a guess, the lessons of past bubbles, combined with key financial-market indicators, offer a useful guide.

LONDON – Financial bubbles are notoriously difficult to define in real time – until the moment they burst. To say with any conviction whether we are in one now, one must understand the magnitude and intensity of today’s AI investment boom, as well as the timing of the potential bubble’s end.

There are at least four ways to determine when a bubble is building in financial markets. The first is to look at valuations. Even when conventional valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings (PE) ratios reach excessive levels, the market might excuse this by focusing on new metrics to justify overvaluations.

For much of the past 25 years, the average PE ratio across the S&P 500 has been 16x, whereas now it is 25x. But this increase can be justified by focusing on the potential for new productivity gains from AI, or on products with a national-security value – such as semiconductors, which will be protected and ultimately backstopped by the government.

Moreover, some commentators argue that existing indicators like GDP simply are not capturing new sources of growth potential in the economy. For now, the fact that expected equity returns are higher than bond returns means that equity valuations are indeed “rational,” even if they seem high.

A second factor to consider is the prevailing narrative, which usually revolves around the message that “this time is different.” A bubble is almost always buttressed by belief in a new paradigm or emerging technology – whether it be the internet, the Japanese production process, electricity, railroads, or canals. The typical narrative creates a mental bridge between what actually is (current cash flows) and what could be (forecasts of future revenues).

The bridge is what lures investors to buy into a possible upside. While they may start by focusing on the rationally calculable growth forecasts of the business, the next step is to buy into an irrational story

[TITLE]Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq jump as Apple leads tech stocks higher ahead of busy earnings week:
[TEXT]
US stocks rallied on Monday as Wall Street braced for a packed week of high-profile earnings and the delayed release of key inflation data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed more than 1.1%, over 500 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained almost 1.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 1.4%, as Apple (AAPL) stock surged to a record high on strong iPhone 17 demand.

Markets are setting aside a laundry list of worries to focus instead on earnings season, which shifts into high gear this week. Hopes are high, with reports from Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC), Netflix (NFLX), and Coca-Cola (KO) leading the highlights in a busy roster.

On Monday, eyes will be on Zions Bancorp's (ZION) third quarter results due after the bell. The regional lender's disclosure of bad loans linked to fraud last week spooked investors with concerns

[TITLE]Vicor steps up its IP licensing practice:
[TEXT]
ANDOVER, Mass., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vicor Corporation (NASDAQ: VICR) Intellectual Property (IP) stemming from Vicor’s development of high-density power system technology is key to performance in high growth markets such as AI. Licensed access to foundational IP, including to 800V, 48V and 12V bus converters and Vertical Power Delivery (VPD), is necessary to ensure supply chain resilience and scalability. Without a license, computing, automotive and industrial systems are subject to importation bans or injunctions because of patent infringement by copycat power module makers and contract manufacturers.

In 2025 the International Trade Commission issued a Limited Exclusion Order (LEO) banning importation into the US of infringing bus converters, and computing systems containing the same, covered by certain Vicor patents. The LEO remains in force for the life of infringed patents and applies to all infringing computing systems made by contract manufacturers which, as Respondents in the ITC investigation, were found to infringe. The LEO has led to settlements and licensing agreements by leading OEMs and hyper-scalers resulting in nearly $300 million in expected contribution to Vicor’s revenues through 2026.

Having established licensing as a pillar for growth, Vicor is stepping up its IP licensing practice, headed by Andrew D’Amico, General Counsel for Intellectual Property and supported by Vicor’s in-house licensing team and outside counsel, including law firms partnering with Vicor to assert its IP.

Commenting on the success of Vicor’s licensing practice, Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Vinciarelli stated: “Q3 licensing revenues surpassed Vicor’s quarterly investment in R&D. At 18% of revenues, Vicor’s R&D far exceeds the R&D percentage of revenues of infringing power module makers and contract manufacturers, reflecting differences between antithetical business models respectively focused on innovation and copying.

As high-density power systems pioneered by Vicor, including bus converters and VPD, are on the critical path to high performance computing, Vicor’s IP licensing practice may grow to a greater fraction of Vicor’s module business. Leveraging its first ChiP™ foundry and the high current density of 5th generation ChiPs and 2nd Generation VPD, Vicor’s module business is also expected to grow substantially apart from and as a result of its related IP licensing practice. OEMs and hyperscalers need a license, need to renew their license or need to expand its scope. Vicor is pursuing additional actions to curtail access to infringing computing systems sourced from infringing contract manufacturers relying on infringing power module makers.”

[TITLE]What’s up with… Vodafone, T-Mobile US, Proximus:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Vodafone Group and partner Vodafone Ukraine are building a subsea cable in the Black Sea to link Ukraine with Bulgaria, Turkey and Georgia; T-Mobile US is looking to capitalise on its nationwide 5G-Advanced rollout with a ‘private network-like’ service offering; Iliad’s owner Xavier Niel is keen to increase his influence over Belgium’s national operator Proximus, it seems; and much more!

The Vodafone Group and Vodafone Ukraine – which is not part of the Vodafone Group, despite the name – are to invest €100m in the deployment of a new high-capacity submarine cable system, dubbed Kardesa, across the Black Sea. It will connect Bulgaria, Georgia, Turkey and Ukraine. The claim is that Kardesa, which is set to boast 500 TBit/s of data capacity, will help improve the diversity of digital routes across the region and “create a modern digital corridor between Europe and Asia”. The first landing for the new festoon will be in Bulgaria in 2027 with subsequent landings in Turkey, then Georgia and then Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, work on the new system in war-torn Ukraine will only take place in “internationally recognised safe zones”. London, UK-based subsea networks specialist Xtera will design and deliver the €100m turnkey project. While there is a lot of excitement currently

[TITLE]Forrester’s 2025 Technology Strategy Impact Award Winner And Finalists For North America:
[TEXT]
Each year, Forrester’s Technology Strategy Impact Award recognizes organizations that exemplify high-performance IT (HPIT): those that continuously improve business outcomes through technology, guided by alignment, trust, and adaptivity. The 2025 North America award highlights three standout organizations that have redefined what strategic IT leadership looks like in complex, high-stakes environments.

This year’s winner, the United States Department of the Navy, demonstrated exceptional speed and scale in deploying secure, mission-critical technologies across a globally distributed workforce. Finalists CBRE and Verizon impressed with their transformative use of AI, data, and automation to drive measurable impact across commercial real estate and telecommunications. Together, these organizations showcase how HPIT can deliver resilience, innovation, and strategic advantage.

Winner: United States Department Of The Navy

The Department of Navy’s IT organization demonstrated how even the most complex public-sector enterprise can deliver secure, scalable innovation at speed. Supporting over 850,000 personnel globally, the Department of Navy’s strategy exemplifies all three of the high-performance IT principles of alignment, adaptivity, and trust, setting a new benchmark for public-sector transformation.

Strategic alignment that drives measurable mission outcomes. The Department of Navy shifted from compliance-driven IT to mission-focused outcomes, anchoring every initiative to Top-Level Requirements (TLRs). Structured governance through the Information Superiority Advisory Board ensures that technology investments directly support operational priorities. Application rationalization freed up hundreds of millions in budget and engineering capacity, which was reinvested into modernization efforts like DON GPT and containerization.

Adaptivity engineered for speed and scale. The Innovation Adoption Kit (IAK) and “Accelerating Change Design Concepts” (ACDCs) reduced acquisition cycles from 12–18 months to weeks. Containerization became department policy, accelerating deployment and portability across cloud and tactical environments. DON GPT, a secure generative AI assistant, scaled rapidly across departments, delivering 20–30% productivity gains. Structured piloting and divestment frameworks enabled fast experimentation and resource reallocation.

Trust built through resilience and secure innovation. Flank Speed became the first secure cloud environment in the Department of Defense to achieve full Zero Trust compliance, three years ahead of schedule. Privacy controls embedded in AI deployments protect sensitive data and build user confidence. Resilience was validated through rapid recovery of containerized apps during regional outages. Ethical AI governance reassured vendors and internal stakeholders, accelerating collaboration and adoption.

Innovation composed with open standards. The Department of Navy’s open development standards model allows new code capabilities from multiple vendors and programs to plug into a cohesive shared platform without lengthy reengineering. This novel “plug and fight” approach enables small teams and large-scale partners to work in concert to introduce new mission applications in weeks rather than years. Structured Challenges and Adaptive Roadmapping programs enhance the pipeline of value-focused problem statements from warfighters directly to builders, a process that has already been leveraged to enhance the mission capabilities of unmanned surface vessels.
