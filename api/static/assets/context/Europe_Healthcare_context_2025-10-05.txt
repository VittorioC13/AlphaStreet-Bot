[TEXT]
Through its investment, Angelini Ventures aims to promote the expansion and acceleration of Serenis’ digital health and wellbeing services and amplify its leadership in delivering transformative solutions to corporate clients

Investment represents a significant opportunity to advance accessible, technology-enabled care in a rapidly expanding field

Rome, Italy, 3 October 2025 – Angelini Ventures, the corporate venture firm of Angelini Industries focused on investing in companies developing innovative solutions in BioTech and HealthTech, announces it has led, alongside CDP Venture Capital as co-lead investor, a €12 million follow-on investment in Serenis, a pioneer and one of the fastest growing companies dedicated to improving access to mental health and wellbeing services in Italy.

Founded in 2021 by Silvia Wang and Daniele Francescon, Serenis has rapidly grown into one of the leading platforms for mental and physical wellbeing in Europe. Today, the company has built a network of over 2,500 licensed professionals – including psychotherapists, psychiatrists, nutritionists, and coaches – and has supported more than 170,000 people with around 1.5 million completed therapy sessions. The team has expanded to 65 employees, and serves more than 250 companies, reaching over 300,000 employees through corporate wellbeing programs with clients such as Nestlé, Satispay, Leroy Merlin, and Q8. This strong traction translated into revenues growing from €2M in 2022 to €25M in 2024, with a run-rate already above €40M in 2025.

Serenis’ hybrid model connects people with qualified therapists through proprietary digital technology, tackling accessibility barriers and the stigma that often surround mental health disorders. This investment will accelerate Serenis’ innovation in digital care services, strengthen its proprietary technologies and expand its leadership in delivering transformative solutions to corporate clients.

At Angelini Ventures, mental health and brain health are a core priority. Building on investments in innovative therapeutics for depression, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in medtech solutions such as devices for epilepsy, Angelini Ventures is committed to supporting advances that can transform care. The investment in Serenis reflects this focus and underscores the firm’s belief that improving mental and brain health is essential to addressing some of the most pressing current healthcare challenges.

Elia Stupka, Managing Director of Angelini Ventures and board member of Serenis since its first financing round, said “We are proud to have believed in Serenis since its early steps and to accompany its growth today as lead investor. Investing in Serenis means believing that mental and physical wellbeing should be accessible to everyone. At Angelini Ventures, we are honored to support a team that, with clinical rigor and innovation, is building an accessible and sustainable model of digital and in-person care, set to become a benchmark in Italy.”

Silvia Wang, Founder of Serenis, added “Innovation in digital mental health depends on ambitious entrepreneurial initiatives, and this milestone highlights both the growth we have achieved and the potential for further expansion ahead.”

[TITLE]XOMA Royalty Extends Tender Offer to Acquire LAVA Therapeutics N.V.:
[TEXT]
EMERYVILLE, Calif. and UTRECHT, The Netherlands and PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XOMA Royalty Corporation (“XOMA Royalty”) (NASDAQ: XOMA) and LAVA Therapeutics N.V. (“LAVA”) (Nasdaq: LVTX) today announced the extension of the expiration of the tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of common shares of LAVA, for (i) a cash amount to be determined in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, plus (ii) a non-transferable contingent value right (“CVR”) per share representing the right to receive 75% of the net proceeds related to LAVA’s two partnered assets and 75% of any net proceeds from any out license or sale of LAVA’s unpartnered programs (the “Offer”).

The Offer, which was previously scheduled to expire one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 3, 2025, has been extended until one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on October 17, 2025, unless the Offer is further extended or earlier terminated. The proposed acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.

LAVA shareholders who previously have tendered their shares do not need to re-tender their shares or take any other action in response to the extension of the Offer. LAVA shareholders have signed support agreements to tender their shares in the Offer prior to the expiration date and support the Offer.

The closing of the Offer is subject to certain conditions, including the tender of LAVA common shares representing at least 80% (or, in certain cases, 75%) of LAVA’s issued and outstanding shares, the condition that certain resolutions are adopted by LAVA’s shareholders meeting, a minimum cash balance at closing, and other customary closing conditions. Following a subsequent offering period, LAVA will undergo a corporate reorganization designed to result in XOMA Royalty acquiring 100% of the shares in LAVA’s successor and all then-remaining LAVA shareholders (other than XOMA Royalty) receiving the same cash and non-transferable contingent value right consideration per share as is provided in the tender offer, subject to applicable withholding taxes.

[TITLE]Rockcliffe Labs Launches $75 Million Canadian Development Financing at $10 per Share, Reflecting $300 Million Post-Money Valuation; Executes License with a Canadian University for a Late-Stage Sepsis :
[TEXT]
TORONTO, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rockcliffe Labs Inc. (“Rockcliffe Labs” or the “Company”), a Canadian biotechnology venture creation platform, announces the launch of a $75 million non-brokered private placement in Canada (the “Offering”) at $10.00 per common share. The Offering reflects a post-money valuation of approximately $300 million and is structured as the development financing contemplated under Rockcliffe Labs’ license term sheet with a Canadian university.

As part of that license, the Canadian university will hold a 7.5% equity interest in Rockcliffe Labs, equal to approximately 2.25 million shares valued at $22.5 million at the Offering price. This equity position includes anti-dilution protection until completion of the development financing, aligning the university’s interests with Rockcliffe Labs and its investors.

Strategic Positioning

Rockcliffe Labs is structured as a biotechnology venture creation platform, designed to integrate Canadian academic research with the clinical, regulatory, and commercialization expertise required to bring therapies to market. Unlike single-asset biotechs, Rockcliffe Labs develops multiple programs within a unified framework, creating a diversified pipeline and allowing risk to be spread across a portfolio of technologies.

Lead Program: Sepsis Biomarker–Based Candidate

The lead program licensed from a Canadian university is a late-stage biomarker–based candidate for sepsis, one of the most serious and costly conditions encountered in intensive care. Sepsis remains a large unmet medical need with limited therapeutic options and substantial global mortality and morbidity. Rockcliffe Labs intends to advance the program toward Phase 3 clinical trials in Canada within twelve (12) months of execution of the definitive license agreement, with a parallel U.S. regulatory path prepared if required.

Territory and Expansion

The license provides exclusive rights in North America, with options to expand into additional regions including Europe, Asia (excluding China), South America, Australia/New Zealand, the Middle East, and Africa. Rights in China remain licensed separately, representing a potential future partnering opportunity.

Capitalization Summary (Post-Financing at ~$300M Valuation)

Holder / Group Shares (M) % Ownership Value ($M) Founders & Early Shareholders 25.25 72.2%

252.5 Canadian University (equity under license) 2.25 6.4%

22.5 New Canadian Investors (this Offering) 7.50 21.4%

75.0

Roadmap and Next Steps

Proceeds from the Offering will be allocated to: advancing the sepsis biomarker–based program to Phase 3 readiness in Canada; expanding regulatory engagement with Health Canada; building the infrastructure required to support clinical development and commercialization; and growing Rockcliffe Labs’ venture creation platform to incorporate additional Canadian academic partnerships and pipeline assets.
