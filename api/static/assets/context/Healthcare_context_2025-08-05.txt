Augments Supernus central nervous system discovery platforms and expertise.

Strong fit with existing Supernus infrastructure is expected to result in cost synergies of up to $200 million on an annual basis.

The acquisition is expected to be accretive in 2026.

The Offer and the Merger

The Offer and withdrawal rights for all outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Shares”), of Sage in exchange for (i) $8.50 per Share, net to the seller in cash, subject to any withholding of taxes and without interest (the “Closing Amount”), plus (ii) one non-transferable and non-tradable contingent value right per Share (a “CVR”), which represents the right to receive up to $3.50 per Share upon the satisfaction of specified milestones (as described further in the Offer to Purchase), net to the seller in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes, pursuant to the CVR Agreement (the Closing Amount plus one CVR collectively, the “Offer Price”), expired as scheduled at one minute following 11:59 p.m., New York time, on July 30, 2025 (the “Expiration Time”).

Each CVR paid to Sage stockholders represents a non-transferable and non-tradable contractual contingent right to receive a cash payment of up to $3.50, net to the seller in cash, subject to any withholding of taxes and without interest, upon the achievement of certain milestones in accordance with the terms of the Contingent Value Rights Agreement entered into between Supernus and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC as rights agent, (the “CVR Agreement”).

One milestone payment of $0.50 per CVR, net to the seller in cash, subject to any withholding of taxes and without interest, is payable (subject to certain terms and conditions) upon the first commercial sale after Regulatory Approval (as defined in the CVR Agreement) in Japan to a third-party customer of the pharmaceutical product that is marketed in the United States under the name ZURZUVAE and is the subject of the current regulatory filing (including any amended filings based thereon) by Shionogi & Co., Ltd., inclusive of its affiliates, in Japan for Major Depressive Disorder by June 30, 2026.

Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, the depositary for the Offer, has advised Supernus that a total of 36,313,509 Shares were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer, representing approximately 58 percent of the Shares outstanding.

All of the conditions of the Offer have been satisfied, and effective as of the Expiration Time, Supernus and its wholly owned subsidiary, Saphire, Inc. (“Purchaser”), accepted for payment all Shares that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer, and will as promptly as practicable thereafter pay for all such validly tendered Shares.

In connection with the merger, each Share not previously purchased in the Offer (other than (i) Shares held by Sage (or held in Sage’s treasury) immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, (ii) any Shares held by Supernus or Purchaser or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Supernus or Purchaser immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, or (iii) Shares held by any stockholder who was entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and properly exercised and perfected their respective demands for appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the effective time of the merger, has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL with respect to such Shares) was converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest.

Co-led by Oak HC/FT and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), the round included participation from existing investors, such as the OpenAI Startup Fund and Optum Ventures, and new investors Frist Cressey Ventures, Town Hall Ventures, Smash Capital, Georgian and Founders Circle Capital.

Ambient Healthcare's platform is built on proprietary AI reasoning models that enable clinical documentation, coding and clinical workflow support. The platform leverages ambient listening to automate documentation, providing clinicians with specialty-specific chart summaries. It also provides suggestions for Hierarchical Condition Categories , E/M levels and ICD-10 and CPT codes in real time. With the new funds, the company plans to expand the AI platform across health systems and advance product delivery.

Clinical documentation is a trenchant issue in healthcare, contributing to inefficient workflows and rising provider burnout. AI is proving helpful in mitigating this challenge, particularly ambient AI documentation tools. Data from 2024 reveals that clinicians who use ambient AI clinical documentation tools reported positive outcomes, with 43.5% noting decreased time on clinical documentation after visits.

The Ambience Healthcare platform not only aims to ease clinical documentation and coding burdens, but it also aims to personalize the provider experience. It is also designed to adapt to different priorities and workflows across more than 100 specialties, including oncology, psychiatry and emergency medicine. The platform integrates directly into health system EHRs, according to the company.

"When we first backed Ambience at the seed, we saw the potential for their ambient AI product to be the wedge into a number of essential clinical workflows over time," said Julie Yoo, general partner at a16z, in the news release. "In a space now crowded with point solutions, the exceptional team at Ambience has executed impressively over the years by expanding into a robust platform, grounded in real clinical needs -- tailored to subspecialties, trusted by frontline providers, and delivering clear value to health systems."

Numerous health systems, including Cleveland Clinic, UCSF Health and Houston Methodist, use the platform. A 2025 KLAS report shows that while most customers noted the vendor's ability to deliver new technology based on client feedback and expressed satisfaction with the platform's EHR integration, some want deeper integration.

[TITLE]UPDATE - Axonius Acquires Medical Device Security Specialist Cynerio for More Than $100 Million to Target Healthcare Market:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, July 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Axonius , the global leader in cyber asset intelligence, today announced that it has acquired Cynerio , a pioneer in medical device security for more than $100 million in a cash and stock transaction.

The acquisition looks to address a critical challenge for healthcare providers, where the proliferation of connected medical devices has created a vast and unprotected attack surface. These specialized assets, essential to patient care, have historically been invisible to traditional security tools, creating significant risk to both patient safety and hospital operations.

“Hospitals have been operating with a massive digital security blind spot,” said Dean Sysman, co-founder and CEO, Axonius. “The very devices essential for patient care, from infusion pumps to MRI machines, have been completely invisible to cybersecurity teams, creating a dangerous, unprotected attack surface. This acquisition will help end that.”

Sysman added, “By integrating Cynerio’s deep clinical expertise with Axonius asset intelligence, we can offer healthcare providers what they’ve been asking for: a single source of truth capable of securing their entire clinical environment.”

“In today’s healthcare environments, risk doesn’t respect the boundaries between clinical and enterprise systems. The combination of Cynerio's specialized medical device context with Axonius' foundational asset intelligence addresses this challenge directly," said Rasu Shrestha, MD, MBA, EVP and Chief Innovation and Commercialization Officer at Advocate Health, and Chairman of the Board at Cynerio. "It provides the holistic visibility required to manage the entire connected attack surface, enabling healthcare organizations to build more resilient security programs. This is a vital step forward in helping ensure technology can securely and effectively support the core mission of patient care.”

Today’s news represents a significant shift in the healthcare cybersecurity landscape. The acquisition was driven by a shared understanding that securing medical devices in a silo is no longer sufficient. Both companies recognized a growing customer demand for a single, unified platform to manage and secure the entire clinical environment—from traditional IT infrastructure to connected medical devices. By combining Axonius’ asset intelligence platform with Cynerio’s deep medical device expertise, the company is positioned to meet the immediate needs of hospitals while setting the foundation for broader Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) security.

As part of the acquisition, Cynerio co-founder and CEO, Leon Lerman, will join Axonius as senior vice president. Co-founder Daniel Brodie will join the Office of the CTO. The Cynerio team joins Axonius to accelerate the company’s expansion into the healthcare
