[TITLE]Pakistan Buys First U.S. Oil Cargo After Trade Deal:
[TEXT]
Pakistani refiner Cnergyico will import Pakistan’s first U.S. crude oil cargo in October following the trade and energy cooperation deal the two countries signed earlier this week.

Cnergyico will import on October 1 million barrels of American crude via top commodity trader Vitol, Usama Qureshi, vice chairman of the biggest refiner in oil-import-dependent Pakistan, told Reuters on Friday.

The cargo of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is set to load from Houston in August and arrive in Pakistan in late October, the executive said.

“This is a test spot cargo under our umbrella term agreement with Vitol. If it is commercially viable and available, we could import at least one cargo per month,” Qureshi added.

The cargo will not be for resale and will help diversify Pakistan’s predominantly Middle Eastern supply of crude oil.

This first U.S. crude purchase by Pakistan follows the trade deal announced earlier this week.

Following months of negotiations, the United States and Pakistan this week signed a trade deal that will involve the joint development of Pakistan’s oil resources.

“We have just concluded a Deal with the Country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive Oil Reserves,” U.S. President Donald Trump said on social media.

“We are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling Oil to India some day!” Trump also said on Truth Social.

Pakistan is an importer of energy, but it may hold substantial reserves of oil and gas in shale formations.

This year, Pakistan also updated its oil and gas reserves estimate, revising the oil reserves part upwards by 23% from a year earlier, to 238 million barrels. The revision came on the back of seven fields where discoveries were made in the period.

New Delhi: US President Donald Trump has announced a trade deal with Pakistan, highlighting a joint initiative to develop oil reserves in the South Asian country and even floated the idea that "some day" Islamabad might sell oil to New Delhi, hours after announcing 25% tariffs with additional penalties on India.The US and Pakistan are currently in the process of selecting the oil company for the partnership, Trump stated in a post on Truth Social."We have just concluded a Deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves. We are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership. Who knows, maybe they'll be selling oil to India some day!," Trump wrote.The remarks came after Trump announced the new tariffs on imports from India starting Friday, citing Washington's trade deficit with New Delhi and its purchase of Russian oil.Sources told ET that the trade deal with Pakistan is as amorphous as US' trade deals with Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam. Trump's announcement may be aimed at arm twisting India to agree to a deal by the end of this week, claimed an expert on India-US affairs.Pakistan's oil reserves remain largely unexplored and it imports most of its crude oil requirements. According to some estimates, Pakistan is ranked 52nd in the world in proven oil reserves.

[TITLE]Electronics and renewable energy investments set to dominate state’s investment announcements in Thoothukudi:
[TEXT]
As the Tamil Nadu government kicks off its regional investment summits ‘TN Rising’ from Thoothukudi on Monday, electronics manufacturing and renewable energy sectors are set to take centrestage.

Sources told businessline that South Tamil Nadu’s existing strengths in precision manufacturing and green energy, electronics and renewable energy investments are set to be the highlight of the TN Rising conclave at Thoothukudi. The Tuticorin port is also a huge draw for these manufacturing entities to set up export-oriented units, sources said.

Businessline has learnt that high precision electronics manufacturing firm Yeemak, along with its group company Jeanuvs proposes to invest around ₹3,500 crores in Thootukudi for manufacturing Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and consumer electronics. This is set to be a large manufacturing set up with potential to employ over 7,000 people, sources in the know said.

Interestingly, the facility, once operational, will cater to both domestic and export market and is also set to dabble in defence manufacturing. “The company is also exploring ways to leverage the facility as an advanced integrated artillery ammunition and missile manufacturing factory,” an electronics industry insider said.

With the likes of Tata Power and Vikram Solar present in South Tamil Nadu, the region is also attracting renewable energy projects. This has also attracted Delhi-based Mobius Energy to set up a new ₹1,000 crore solar cell and module manufacturing facility in the district of Theni, with an MoU likely to be signed for it on Monday.

Beyond Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli, South Tamil Nadu is also seeing the mushrooming of more investment clusters. Dindigul and Theni’s agriculture strengths offer potential for companies in the value-added food exports space, and the temple town of Madurai too is fast emerging as an IT hardware and software hub.

Following Thoothukudi, the state also plans to conduct editions of the Regional Investment Conclaves in western, central, and northern Tamil Nadu.
