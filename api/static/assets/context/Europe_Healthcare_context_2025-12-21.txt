[TITLE]Athira Pharma Announces Exclusive License to Lasofoxifene Phase 3 Development Program for Metastatic Breast Cancer Candidate and a Financing for up to $236 Million:
[TEXT]
Phase 3 Development Program of Novel Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) Represents Potential Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity as Treatment Option for Patients with ESR1-Mutations

Financing Co-Led by Commodore Capital, Perceptive Advisors and TCGX Supports Development of Lasofoxifene through Phase 3 Clinical Topline Data Readout and Regulatory Milestones

Conference Call Today at 8:30 am Eastern Time

BOTHELL, Wash., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Athira Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATHA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of novel therapeutics for high unmet medical needs, today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire the rights for the development and commercialization of lasofoxifene, a promising clinical asset in a potentially registrational Phase 3 trial. The ongoing Phase 3 ELAINE-3 clinical trial (NCT05696626) is greater than 50% enrolled with data expected in mid-2027.

Athira has acquired an exclusive global license (excluding Asia and certain countries in the Middle East) from Sermonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for rights to develop and commercialize lasofoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for the potential treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

In conjunction with this transaction, Athira also announced an upfront financing of $90 million in private placement financing of common stock and warrants, with the warrants providing, if exercised, up to an additional $146 million to support development of the new program through key clinical and regulatory milestones. The financing was co-led by Commodore Capital, Perceptive Advisors, and TCGX, with participation from ADAR1, Blackstone Multi-Asset Investing, Kalehua Capital, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Spruce Street Capital, and 9vc. The Company anticipates the upfront financing will support lasofoxifene development through its topline data readout and key regulatory milestones, with sufficient capital for runway into 2028.

“Today marks a defining moment for our company. This agreement for the rights to the Phase 3 lasofoxifene program for metastatic breast cancer is a significant step in building a pipeline with the potential to change lives and create enduring value,” said Mark Litton, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Athira. “This program provides a near-term opportunity to generate pivotal data necessary for the approval of lasofoxifene and to establish it as the new standard of care to treat ESR1-mutant breast cancer in patients who have progressed on aromatase inhibitors and prior CDK4/6 inhibitors. Supported by compelling Phase 2 clinical data and backed by blue-chip investors, we have a clear development strategy and are committed to advancing therapies that matter to patients while delivering value for our shareholders.”

“In the ELAINE-2 clinical trial, lasofoxifene demonstrated the potential to provide meaningful combination efficacy with 13 months of progression-free survival in heavily pre-treated second- and third-line ESR1-mutated metastatic breast cancer patients. We believe lasofoxifene has the potential to be the preferred endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients given its tissue-selective SERM profile may allow for the preservation of estrogen function in non-breast tissue, which provides tolerability and potential bone protection and quality of life benefits,” noted David Portman, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Sermonix. “With the Phase 3 trial now more than 50% enrolled, we look forward to delivering pivotal data in mid-2027 and advancing toward a regulatory submission.”

“We are excited to announce this financing to help accelerate the development of lasofoxifene,” said Cariad Chester, Managing Partner at TCGX. “With its differentiated profile, lasofoxifene has the potential to become the endocrine therapy of choice for the approximately 40% of breast cancer patients who develop ESR1 mutations and have progressed on aromatase inhibitors and prior CDK4/6 inhibitors. The accomplished team at Athira is committed to efficiently executing the ongoing pivotal trial of lasofoxifene, and we believe, lasofoxifene, may become the treatment of choice for oncologists and patients who are battling this challenging disease.”

“The scientific and clinical data supporting lasofoxifene are compelling, and we are confident in Athira’s leadership to drive the Company’s next chapter with clarity, urgency, and excellence. We’re proud to support this evolution and excited by the opportunity to deliver meaningful impact for patients and shareholders alike,” stated Joseph Edelman, Founder and CEO of Perceptive Advisors.

Details of the Transaction

Sermonix License Agreement

In connection with the entry into the Sermonix license agreement, Athira will issue to Sermonix, as partial consideration, a pre-funded warrant to purchase approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $0.001 per share. Athira will also be obligated to make certain payments to Sermonix of up to $100.0 million if Athira achieves certain commercialization or annual net sales milestones with respect to licensed products with respect to lasofoxifene, including royalty payments on the net sales of any licensed products in any licensed territory, ranging from sub-single digit to low-single digit royalties depending on pre-specified net sales.

Financing

On December 18, 2025, Athira entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors, pursuant to which Athira has agreed to issue and sell approximately 5.4 million shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase approximately 8.8 million shares of common stock and accompanying warrants to purchase approximately 23.0 million shares of common stock and/or pre-funded warrants (representing 162.5% of the aggregate shares and shares underlying the pre-funded warrants), with an exercise price of $6.35 per share (the “Series A common warrants”), and accompanying warrants to purchase approximately 21.3 million shares of common stock and/or pre-funded warrants (representing 150% of the aggregate shares and shares underlying the pre-funded warrants), with an exercise price of $7.62 per share (the “Series B common warrants”) (the “Private Placement”). The common stock, including the accompanying Series A common warrants and Series B common warrants, will be sold at a price of $6.35 per share, and the pre-funded warrants, including the accompanying Series A common warrants and Series B common warrants, will be sold at the price per underlying pre-funded warrant share of the common stock less the exercise price of $0.001 per share.

[TITLE]ProPhase Labs Signs Non-Binding LOI for Proposed Reverse Merger with Advanced Biological Laboratories:
[TEXT]
Proposed transaction aims to deliver near-term value for ProPhase shareholders, long-term growth for ABL, and create a global, innovation-driven company.

Company to hold a virtual conference call today at 10:00 a.m. ET

UNIONDALE, NY, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProPhase Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRPH) ("ProPhase") and Advanced Biological Laboratories S.A. ("ABL"), a European biotechnology and MedTech group, today announced that they have entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent ("LOI") regarding a proposed reverse merger transaction pursuant to which ABL would become the majority owner of the combined entity (the “Proposed Transaction”).

The LOI reflects preliminary understandings only and does not create any obligation to consummate a transaction, except with respect to customary confidentiality and expense provisions. The Proposed Transaction remains subject to completion of due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, regulatory approvals, Nasdaq listing requirements, and other customary closing conditions.

While subject to finalization in definitive agreements, the parties have discussed a preliminary, non-binding valuation framework for the legacy ProPhase business that may imply an enterprise value of up to approximately $30 million. Under the terms contemplated in the LOI, subject to applicable law, board approvals, and definitive documentation, ProPhase Labs may declare a special cash dividend of up to $10 million payable to shareholders of ProPhase Labs common stock as of a record date to be determined. Any such cash distribution would be separate from and not part of the merged operating company. Additionally, as described below, all Crown Medical Collections receivables are expected to be carved out for the exclusive benefit of current ProPhase shareholders.

This framework represents the preliminary structure, subject to definitive documentation, for the transaction, expressly excludes certain cash distributions, asset carve-outs, and retained liabilities described below, and is subject to change based on due diligence, capitalization adjustments, financing activity, market conditions and final transaction terms. The parties currently anticipate working toward execution of definitive documentation within approximately 60 to 90 days.

Strategic Rationale and Leadership Commentary

“This LOI represents what we believe is one of the most important strategic developments in ProPhase Labs’ history,” said Ted Karkus, Chief Executive Officer of ProPhase Labs. “The proposed transaction structure is designed to deliver meaningful near-term value to our existing shareholders, while aligning ProPhase within the ABL Group, a global leader in molecular analysis, clinical research, and healthcare innovation that can accelerate the development and long-term potential of our genomics and diagnostic programs.”

Transaction Structure and Operating Focus

The Proposed Transaction envisions that ABL shareholders would own approximately 76% of the combined company at closing. Following completion of the merger, a newly established U.S. subsidiary would hold and operate ProPhase’s Nebula Genomics platform, BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer Test program, and select consumer health businesses, enabling focused capital allocation and strategic execution.

ABL would contribute its global infrastructure, including advanced data processing systems, cloud computing for health data, and financing capabilities. The ABL Group operates successful businesses:

ABL Diagnostics (Euronext: ABLD, FR001400AHX6) delivers cutting-edge molecular testing solutions.

CDL Pharma provides clinical trial logistics and sample management services.

Humedics commercializes the LiMAx® liver function capacity test, a real-time breath test supporting liver surgery and transplantation.

These companies would become sister entities to the new U.S. subsidiary, which is expected to remain under ProPhase’s current management team.

“This proposed transaction represents a highly strategic opportunity for the ABL Group,” said Dr. Chalom B. Sayada, CEO of ABL. “By combining with a Nasdaq-listed U.S. platform, ABL will gain enhanced access to U.S. capital markets and accelerate commercialization of its portfolio in the United States. At the same time, ABL’s international distribution network and regulatory expertise will support global expansion of ProPhase’s BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer Test, Nebula Genomics, and consumer health businesses. This combination is intended to create meaningful, two-way strategic value and reinforces our commitment to innovation, global reach, and sustainable growth.”

Significant Value Carve-Outs for Current ProPhase Shareholders

Under the LOI, ProPhase Labs may declare a special cash dividend of up to $10 million payable to shareholders of record as of a date to be determined. This distribution would be separate from the merged operating company.

Additionally, all Crown Medical Collections receivables are expected to be carved out for the exclusive benefit of current ProPhase shareholders, with anticipated collections of approximately $50 million net. These estimates are forward-looking and subject to significant uncertainty, including collection risk and timing variability.

Together, these elements provide current ProPhase shareholders with a differentiated value pathway independent of the future performance of the combined company.

Allocation of Assets and Liabilities

The combined operating company would assume only those liabilities expressly agreed in definitive documentation, currently contemplated to include approximately $5 million of ProPhase Labs’ existing indebtedness. All other legacy liabilities would remain with ProPhase Labs and would not be obligations of the post-merger entity.

Transaction Status

The proposed transaction remains subject to due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, regulatory approvals, Nasdaq listing requirements, and other customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be reached or that the transaction will be consummated.

CEO to Present to Shareholders

ProPhase will present to shareholders today, December 19, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. ET during the Virtual Non-Deal Roadshow Series hosted by Renmark Financial Communications Inc.
