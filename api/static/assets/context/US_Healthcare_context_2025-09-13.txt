[TITLE]Dems Say They'll Stand Firm Against Budget Deal Unless GOP Halts Attack on Healthcare:
[TEXT]
Democratic leaders said Thursday that they plan to hold up negotiations on a potential government shutdown unless Republicans agree to forfeit a policy change that is expected to dramatically raise health insurance premiums for millions of Americans.

Health insurance premiums are expected to rise significantly for approximately 22 million Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans after Republicans refused to extend enhanced tax credits when passing Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" in July.

In remarks on Capitol Hill Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) were in total agreement not to negotiate unless Republicans agree to extend the tax credits.

“On this issue, we’re totally united. The Republicans have to come to meet with us in a true bipartisan negotiation to satisfy the American people’s needs on healthcare, or they won't get our votes, plain and simple,” Schumer warned at a press conference.

"We will not support a partisan spending agreement that continues to rip away healthcare from the American people. Period. Full stop,” Jeffries said.

The enhanced tax credits, which were created in 2021 under the American Rescue Plan Act and later extended through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, are credited with reducing the insurance premiums of millions of people who purchase health insurance through government exchanges.

The tax credits have reduced insurance premiums by 44% on average—over $700 per enrollee—and have contributed to the number of people purchasing insurance on the exchanges more than doubling to over 24 million in 2025.

According to a report released Wednesday by KFF:

Nine in 10 enrollees (92%) receive some amount of premium tax credit. If these enhanced tax credits expire at the end of 2025, out-of-pocket premiums would rise by over 75% on average for the vast majority of individuals and families buying coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces.

The increases come as insurance companies, citing "slumping share prices," per the Financial Times, are planning the largest hike to premiums in 15 years, including an 18% increase for those buying from ACA exchanges.

These increases will come on top of those already expected as a result of a Trump administration rule passed in June, which increased the maximum percentages of income and raw dollar amounts that insurance plans could charge patients out-of-pocket for care.

According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, these changes "will make coverage less affordable for millions of people." The CBPP estimates that "a family of four making $85,000 will have to pay an additional $197 in premiums for coverage in 2026" while a "family of two or more people on the same plan could face an additional $900 in medical bills if a family member is seriously ill or injured in 2026, and an individual enrolled in self-only coverage could face an additional $450 in medical bills."

In all, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in May that as a result of these mounting costs, over 5 million people will no longer be able to afford their health insurance plans.

"The death star of American healthcare, the insurance companies are preparing to blow up the lives of millions of middle-class families," warned journalist David Sirota in a podcast for The Lever.

Republicans in Congress are facing mounting pressure to extend the tax credits and stave off the premium hikes. Last week, 11 Republicans in Congress signed onto a bill that would extend the credits through 2026, allowing them to avoid the issue until after the midterm elections.

A survey conducted in July by two of Trump's most trusted pollsters, Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward, found that for Republicans in the most competitive districts, "a 3-point deficit becomes a 15-point deficit" against the generic Democrat if they allow the healthcare premium tax credit to expire.

[TEXT]
Dura Medical, together with pending acquisitions of Neurospa TMS and Cohen & Associates, to provide contiguous coverage at more than 8 locations along Florida’s West Coast, with planned coverage throughout the Florida Peninsula

Dura delivers a full range of precision psychiatry services for severe depression and PTSD, including Ketamine Therapy and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), to Veterans and civilian patients

Stephen Durand, CRNA, a US Army Veteran and founder of Dura will serve as Director of Clinic Operations for HOPE Therapeutics in Florida

MIAMI, Sept. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HOPE Therapeutics™, Inc. ("HOPE"), a multi-site clinical care delivery organization and wholly-owned subsidiary of NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: NRXP), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced the closing of the previously announced acquisition of Dura Medical (Dura). Dura, together with the pending Neurospa TMS and Cohen and Associates acquisitions, are planned to provide a comprehensive service offering to patients at more than 8 locations along the West Coast of Florida. Dura is revenue generating and EBITDA positive.

Dura Medical, with existing locations in Naples and Ft. Myers, Florida, was founded in 2018 to offer a gold-standard, precision approach to treating depression, PTSD, and chronic pain on the West Coast of Florida. More than 13 million Americans contemplate suicide each year and an American dies from suicide every 11 minutes. Dura leverages the latest interventional psychiatry procedures, including Ketamine Infusion Therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Spravato® and Stellate Ganglion Blocks, augmented by traditional psychiatry and therapy to provide a full continuum of care for people with depression, suicidality, PTSD, anxiety, and related disorders.

A US Army Veteran, Mr. Durand and the medical staff at Dura are proud to participate in the Veterans Affairs Community Cares Network (VA CCN) under an agreement with the US Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that military veterans have full access to Dura’s interventional psychiatry programs, in addition to Traumatic Incident Reduction Therapy (TIR). Dura’s participation in these programs is critical at a time when 22 Veterans and Active Duty personnel die every day from suicidal depression and PTSD.

In conjunction with the planned acquisition, HOPE is proud to appoint Mr. Durand as Director of Florida Clinic Operations.

“The entire Dura family is excited to bring our mission to the HOPE Network and I look forward to helping lead HOPE’s expansion throughout Florida. Dura Medical was founded with the mission to reduce suicide in our community and we aim to treat more than 10,000 people by 2026. Combining with HOPE is a tremendous step toward achieving this goal,” said Stephen Durand, Founder of Dura Medical.

“Steve Durand is a pioneer in combining the use of psychedelic medications with TMS and other neuroplastic technologies for advancing the treatment of suicidal depression and PTSD in Southwest Florida. He has brought his experience as an Army veteran to building Dura’s tradition of excellence and commitment to patient care for civilians and veterans alike. His commitment and sense of purpose align perfectly with HOPE’s vision for our Florida network,” said Jonathan Javitt, MD MPH and Matthew Duffy, Co-CEOs of HOPE Therapeutics. “We look forward to Steve’s partnership as we continue to build our network throughout the State of Florida and beyond.”
