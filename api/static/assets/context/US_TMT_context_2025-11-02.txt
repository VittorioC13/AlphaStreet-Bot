GYEONGJU, South Korea -- Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia plans to supply hundreds of thousands of its graphics processing units for projects with South Korean businesses and the government to advance the country’s artificial intelligence infrastructure and technologies.

The plan was announced Friday by the government, Nvidia, and some of South Korea’s biggest companies, including chipmakers Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and auto giant Hyundai Motor, after President Lee Jae Myung met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.

At a news conference, Huang said he hopes to export Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips to China, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on loosening U.S. chip restrictions as the two leaders pledged to reduce trade tensions.

However, he acknowledged that it was up to Trump to decide, and said there were no current plans to sell the next generation Blackwell chips to China.

Huang has gotten rockstar treatment reminiscent of Apple’s Steve Jobs since arriving in South Korea on Thursday to attend meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Gyeongju. As APEC host, South Korea is using the gathering of world leaders to showcase its ambitions in AI.

According to Lee’s office and the companies, Nvidia will supply around 260,000 GPUs to support South Korea’s AI computing and manufacturing capabilities.

[TITLE]Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Says You Can ‘Tokenize Anything’ But You’ll Need ‘Thousands of Chips.’ That’s Good News for NVDA Stock.:
[TEXT]
Nvidia (NVDA) did something this week that many people, one or two years ago, thought would be impossible. The semiconductor company reached a $5 trillion valuation, becoming the first company to reach that mark. And it did so only 112 days after Nvidia became the first company to reach a $4 trillion valuation.

Clearly, Nvidia is achieving things that most companies can only dream of. And if you listen to CEO Jensen Huang, the future continues to be bright. “Our GPUs are everywhere,” he said Tuesday while attending Nvidia’s GTC D.C. conference in Washington, D.C. He described how Nvidia’s chips are used in AI models, telecommunications, manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, quantum computing, and more.

“This is all possible because Nvidia is everywhere.”

NVDA stock is up more than 51% this year and by an astounding 1,370% in the last three years. Taking a longer view: had you invested a scant $1,000 in Nvidia a decade ago, you’d be looking at a nest egg of $293,100. That’s life-changing money.

You might think that Nvidia’s best days are behind it, but this company still has a lot to offer—and more gains to provide its investors.

Around 50,000 GPUs will support public initiatives, including the development of domestic AI foundation models and a national AI data center. The remaining over 200,000 GPUs will go to companies such as Samsung, SK, Hyundai Motor Group, and Naver, driving AI-based manufacturing innovation and industry-specific AI model development.

Nvidia, Samsung team up on AI factory and AI-RAN for 6G

Samsung also announced plans to build an AI mega-factory in partnership with Nvidia, bringing AI into every stage of its manufacturing for semiconductors, mobile devices, and robotics. Using more than 50,000 Nvidia GPUs and the Omniverse platform, the facility will form an intelligent network capable of analyzing, predicting, and optimizing production in real time.

Samsung and Nvidia, partners for over 25 years, are now collaborating on HBM4, a next-generation memory designed to power future AI applications.

Nvidia will work with Samsung, three Korean telecom operators — SK Telecom, KT, and LG Uplus — and ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute) to co-develop AI-RAN, according to the Korean Ministry of Science and ICT.

AI-RAN combines mobile base stations with AI to boost performance and cut battery use, and under a new agreement, Nvidia and South Korea’s industry and research institutions will jointly develop next-generation AI-RAN and a global testbed, the Korean government stated.

In mid-October, Nvidia said Samsung Foundry will help make custom CPUs and XPUs, following its work with Intel to connect x86 CPUs directly to Nvidia platforms via NVLink Fusion.

Hyundai drives future mobility with AI factory

Meanwhile, Hyundai and Nvidia are joining forces to build AI infrastructure and advance technologies in physical AI. The partnership plans to focus on autonomous mobility, smart factories, and robotics, while collaborating on high-performance GPU supply and investment

According to Nvidia, the companies will use 50,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs for integrated AI model training, validation, and deployment, and will establish AI research centers in South Korea to strengthen the country’s physical AI industry.

“AI is revolutionizing every facet of every industry, and in transportation alone — from vehicle design and manufacturing to robotics and autonomous driving — Nvidia’s AI and computing platforms are transforming how the world moves,” said Huang. “Together with Hyundai Motor Group — Korea’s industrial powerhouse and one of the world’s top mobility solutions providers — we’re building intelligent cars and factories that will shape the future of the multitrillion-dollar mobility industry.”

SK builds AI cloud; Naver partners on physical AI

SK Group, parent of SK Hynix, is partnering with Nvidia to build Asia’s first enterprise-led manufacturing AI cloud, leveraging Nvidia’s simulation and digital twin platforms and opening access to the government, public institutions, and domestic startups.

Naver Cloud, the cloud arm of Korean search engine Naver, is collaborating with Nvidia to develop a next-generation “Physical AI” platform that connects the physical and digital worlds. The cloud company intends to deploy AI infrastructure across key industries, including semiconductors, shipbuilding, energy, and biotechnology, aiming to accelerate the adoption of AI solutions optimized for real-world industrial environments, according to Naver.

“Just as the automotive industry is transitioning to SDVs, the era of ‘Physical AI,’ where AI operates directly within real industrial sites and systems, is unfolding,” Hae-jin Lee, founder of Naver, said in Naver’s statement.

Nvidia’s collaborations with Korean Big Tech giants — from Samsung’s AI network initiatives to Hyundai’s software-defined vehicles, SK Group’s industrial AI applications, and Naver’s cloud and AI services — highlight a broader trend, which is the fusion of AI and hardware across industries. These partnerships show how global tech leaders are joining forces to shape the next generation of intelligent systems.

Earlier this week, the U.S. tech giant announced a wave of new partnerships with companies, including Eli Lilly, Palantir, Hyundai, Samsung, Uber, and Joby Aviation, along with the U.S. Department of Energy, as CEO Jensen Huang sought to downplay concerns about an AI bubble. The news sent its stock soaring, as Nvidia became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $5 trillion market capitalization.
