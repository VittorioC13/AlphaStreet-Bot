[TITLE]Phlow Corp. Congratulates the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Virginia Innovation Partnership Corporation on a Historic Investment to Create the Nation’s Largest Workforce Development Center for Adva:
[TEXT]
RICHMOND, Va, Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Phlow Corp., a leading American advanced pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), congratulates Governor Glenn Youngkin, the Virginia Innovation Partnership Corporation (VIPC), and several leading Virginia universities on the recent announcement of a $120 million investment from AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Company, and Merck to expand Virginia’s life sciences and advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing workforce development efforts by building the largest advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing training center in the Nation, creating thousands of high-quality jobs in Virginia.

The initiative is complementary to the work of the Alliance for Building Better Medicine, a nationally recognized industry cluster uniting business, government, academic, and nonprofit partners to strengthen America’s pharmaceutical supply chain through advanced manufacturing and workforce development.

As a founding member of the Alliance for Building Better Medicine and an early catalyst of the region’s pharmaceutical manufacturing ecosystem, Phlow celebrates this milestone as validation of Virginia’s national leadership in reshoring and modernizing medicine production, especially for active pharmaceutical ingredients.

“Five years ago, Phlow and a small group of committed partners set out to prove that advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing could thrive right here in Virginia. By building an industry-led training network across the Charlottesville–Richmond–Petersburg corridor and GMP-simulated, hands-on space graduating 2,000–2,500 professionals a year, Virginia is building thousands of high-quality jobs and a talent engine the nation can rely on,” said Robby Demeria, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer at Phlow Corp. and Founding Board Chair of the Alliance for Building Better Medicine. “The Alliance has helped transform early vision into a powerful economic engine for Virginia and a model for the nation.”

“From day one, Phlow believed Virginia could be the center for modern pharmaceutical development and manufacturing, and we are proud to be among the founding partners that helped spark the momentum we’re celebrating today,” said Eric Edwards, M.D., Ph.D., CEO of Phlow. “The Commonwealth’s investment, combined with leadership from industry, will expand opportunities for Virginians and strengthen our Nation’s medicine supply chain.”

[TITLE]ESNT Q3 Deep Dive: Mortgage Insurance Headwinds Offset by Capital Strength and Shareholder Returns:
[TEXT]
Mortgage insurance provider Essent Group (NYSE:ESNT) fell short of the markets revenue expectations in Q3 CY2025, with sales falling 1.5% year on year to $311.8 million. Its GAAP profit of $1.67 per share was 5.5% below analysts’ consensus estimates.

Is now the time to buy ESNT? Find out in our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members).

Essent Group (ESNT) Q3 CY2025 Highlights:

Revenue: $311.8 million vs analyst estimates of $317 million (1.5% year-on-year decline, 1.6% miss)

EPS (GAAP): $1.67 vs analyst expectations of $1.76 (5.5% miss)

Adjusted Operating Income: $199.2 million vs analyst estimates of $257.6 million (63.9% margin, 22.7% miss)

Operating Margin: 63.9%, down from 65.6% in the same quarter last year

Market Capitalization: $5.96 billion

StockStory’s Take

Essent Group’s third quarter saw revenue and earnings fall short of Wall Street’s expectations, with management attributing the shortfall primarily to higher loan default provisions and increased claim severity. CEO Mark Casale emphasized that the underlying credit quality of the company’s insurance portfolio remains strong, noting a weighted average FICO score of 746 and stable persistency rates. While the company faced a modest uptick in default rates due to normal seasonality, management maintained there were no concerning geographic or vintage trends impacting credit performance. Casale explained, “I think from a credit position, there’s nothing we’re really seeing that concerns us at the current time.”

Looking forward, Essent Group’s guidance is anchored in expectations of continued elevated persistency, steady investment yields, and a robust capital position that supports both organic growth and capital return initiatives. Management signaled that the current interest rate environment should help sustain high persistency in the insurance portfolio, while ongoing reinsurance strategies and disciplined underwriting provide flexibility to weather macroeconomic uncertainties. CFO David Weinstock cited the company’s ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and generate steady cash flows, stating, “We remain committed to a prudent and conservative capital strategy that allows us to maintain a strong balance sheet to navigate market volatility while preserving the flexibility to invest in strategic growth.”

Key Insights from Management’s Remarks

Essent Group’s management attributed the quarter’s results to higher provisions for loan defaults, stable premium rates, and the impact of recent capital return actions.

Oklahoma families face transportation barriers amid SNAP funding freeze

KOCO ^ | 11/6/25 | Olivia Hickey

Posted on by DallasBiff

As SNAP benefits remain frozen, many Oklahoma families struggle with transportation to access food pantries, while local charities offer some assistance.

Leveda Jordan Smith, a mother of three from southeast Oklahoma City, is among the over 600,000 residents who relied on SNAP benefits before the shutdown.

"Being a mother of 3, not receiving SNAP benefits has made it harder for us to figure out where our next meal is gonna come from, if we're gonna have enough to stretch by," Smith said.

Smith, who does not have a driver's license, depends on her significant other, friends, and family members for transportation. As a student on a tight budget, rideshares are not a viable option for her. The pantries in her area are typically open while she is in class or when her rides are at work. Currently, her family is stocked with canned and boxed goods, but fresh foods like meat, milk, and produce are out of reach.

[TITLE]Council approves plans for €63m Dalymount Park redevelopment - and construction could begin next year:
[TEXT]
DUBLIN CITY COUNCIL has approved plans to borrow €34 million to help fund the redevelopment of Dalymount Park.

The ground in Dublin’s Phibsborough, which is currently home to League of Ireland side Bohemians, was bought from the club for €3.4 million by the council in 2015.

The long-awaited redevelopment is anticipated to cost €63.7 million, well above the €40 million price tag put on the project a year ago.

The redevelopment project has already received around €25 million in central government funding via the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF).

According to the funding proposal, the loan of approximately €34.03 million will have a term of 30 years.

Loan repayments will cost the council €1.8m a year, which would be partly funded from rental income on the stadium from Bohemians, as well as match day revenue.

The council has also amended its planning application to incorporate some changes, which the local authority says will result in a saving of €3.5 million on the project.

These include alterations to the proposed roof, changes to the proposed basement and relocation of changing rooms.

The funding proposal will now be sent to Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage James Browne for approval.

The approval of the funding proposal has been welcomed by Bohemians, with the club saying the funding “will allow for the historic stadium to be fully redeveloped and serve the people of Dublin and beyond long into the future”.

Bohemian Football Club welcomes tonight’s unanimous decision by Dublin City Council to send a Dalymount Park funding proposal for final approval to Minister James Browne.

This is the final step in a process that began with DCC acquiring Dalymount exactly 10 years ago.

“Bohemian FC contributes to Irish society through sports, community engagement, significant economic impact both locally and further afield, and through progressive social policies – a redeveloped Dalymount Park will ensure we can continue to do so and build upon it.”

Redevelopment plans

It had been anticipated that construction on the project would begin in 2027.

However, at Dublin City Council’s monthly meeting this evening, CEO Richard Shakespeare indicated that construction could be underway by this time next year.

“We would hope to be on site this time next year,” Shakespeare told the meeting.

Lord Mayor Ray McAdam asked whether the selection of a contractor for the tender process would take place “imminently”, and would hopefully be selected by next summer.

“That would be the general gist, yeah,” Shakespeare said.

According to a report by the local authority, the council plans to demolish the existing stadium and structures on the site and to build a new stadium with 6,240 seats and capacity for another 1,794 people standing.

The pitch will be re-oriented to run north-south and get new sand-based grass, along with new changing rooms, match-day facilities for teams and officials and club offices.

There will also be a 585 sq.m space over two floors which will include a multifunctional community room and a gym. There is provision in the plans for 12 car parking spaces and 50 bicycle spaces within the site.

Councillors welcomed the plans at tonight’s meeting.

Green Party councillor Feljin Jose said the municipal stadium would also serve as a community hub for Phibsborough.

‘Hugh incentive’ for Phibsborough regeneration

Independent councillor Ciarán Perry, who said he is a Bohemians fan, said the gain for the community would be “exceptional”.

“This could regenerate the fantastic village of Phibsborough, which has really had a poor history. I believe this could be a huge incentive for the whole regeneration of the area.”

Perry also said the FAI not contributing any funding towards the project was “a bit of a disgrace”, with similar sentiments being expressed by several councillors.

[TITLE]Truist Bank Provides $97M Construction Financing for Portsmouth Multifamily Building – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Eastern Real Estate and The Kane Company have secured $96.8 million in construction financing to build Prescott Post, a 360-unit multifamily complex that broke ground last month in Portsmouth, N.H.

Truist Bank provided the loan, while a JLL Capital Markets’ team of Brett Paulsrud, Andrew Gray and Hugh Doherty arranged the transaction.

Paulsrud noted in a statement that the fundamentals of Portsmouth’s multifamily market are supported by the area’s recent population growth, which has increased 8 percent annually since 2010, as well as by severe supply constraints and high barriers to entry, as only 460 multifamily units have been added since 2014.

“The financing market recognized these compelling dynamics, and we were able to secure highly competitive terms that position the project for success,” he added.

Rebecca Cox, senior vice president at Truist National Real Estate, said the financing from her bank will “support high-quality housing in Portsmouth and further the region’s long-term growth.”

Located at 100 Durgin Lane on the site of a vacant retail center in the Seacoast region of southeast New Hampshire, Prescott Post is expected to deliver its first units in December 2026 and finish construction by late 2027.

The multifamily complex will feature several three- and four-story buildings set across 26 acres and include nearly 3 acres of green space and shared community areas. The complex will also include an indoor/outdoor fitness center, a pet wash, a dog run, and private parking garages for residents.

Toby Banta of Eastern Real Estate noted in a statement that the project took two years of planning and will deliver “a dynamic new residential and community hub” to greater Portsmouth.

“We could not have achieved this milestone without the partnership of the city and the dedication of our team of consultants and partners,” added Banta.

[TITLE]S3 Capital Supplies $81M Construction Loan for Greenpoint Condos:
[TEXT]
Brooklyn developer Investmates has sealed $81 million of construction financing to build a condominium project in Greenpoint, Commercial Observer can first report.

S3 Capital provided the loan for Investmates’ planned 68-unit condo development at 19-29 Clay Street, near the intersection with Commercial Street in northern Greenpoint. Investmates filed permits to construct the 14-story residential building with roughly 14,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space in September to replace a two-story structure built in 1931.

Shawn Safdie, managing director at S3, led origination efforts for the deal. S3 also provided a $12.15 million land loan for the Greenpoint development site in 2022.

“The 19-29 Clay Street loan reflects the strength of our deep relationships with seasoned local developers in highly desirable submarkets,” Safdie said in a statement.

The condo tower, which is slated for completion in fall 2027, will have a mix of one- to four-bedroom condos. Community amenities will include coworking space, a children’s playroom, and a pet spa.

Investmates co-founders Koby Telyas and Idan Shitrit said in a joint statement that

Greenpoint and Brooklyn overall has an “enduring appeal” and “continues to attract new residents and investment.”

Turkish Airlines reaches engine deal with GE Aerospace

ISTANBUL

Flag carrier Turkish Airlines has reached an agreement with GE Aerospace for the procurement of engines, spare engines and engine maintenance services for 75 Boeing airplanes.

In a filing with Borsa Istanbul on late Nov. 5, Turkish Airlines recalled that its board of directors had decided to purchase a total of 75 aircraft from Boeing, consisting of 50 firm and 25 option orders for B787-9 and B787-10 models with deliveries scheduled between 2029 and 2034.

“As a result of the tender held for the procurement of engines, spare engines and engine maintenance services for these aircraft, negotiations have been concluded and an agreement has been reached with GE Aerospace,” the carrier said in the statement.

In September, Turkish Airlines announced the purchase of 225 Boeing aircraft, consisting of 75 orders for the B787-9 and B787-10 models, and 150 for the 737-8 and 737-10 MAX models.

The airline also said at that time it finalized negotiations with Boeing for the purchase of 150 737-8 and 737-10 MAX aircraft, including 100 firm and 50 optional orders.

"Subject to the successful conclusion of ongoing discussions with engine manufacturer CFM International, orders for the 737-8/10 MAX aircraft will also be placed," it said in a statement in September.

Meanwhile, Ahmet Bolat, chairman of Turkish Airlines, said on Nov. 5 that the airline expected to meet with Boeing and CFM in the coming weeks.

“I hope that we are going to finalize there so that we don’t have to go back again and open the Airbus chapter in that part of the fleet,” Bolat told Bloomberg.

In October, Bolat said that Turkish Airlines may turn to Airbus if an agreement on engines cannot be reached.

The deal advances Firefly's portfolio with AI-enabled defense software in missile warning, space domain awareness, intelligence, surveillance, and autonomous command and control.

With the acquisition, Firefly gains classified infrastructure at six strategic locations and integrates additional data centers and mission operation centers. The company will deliver a suite of hardware and software for defense programs, including space-based interceptor missions, hypersonic tests, and Moon to Mars missions. Robust contracts and new service categories support intelligence and national security agencies alongside commercial clients.

Jim Lisowski, CEO of SciTec, explained, "We're proud to officially join the Firefly team and look forward to combining our software and hardware capabilities to bolster our existing services and create new industry-leading categories for space and defense customers.
