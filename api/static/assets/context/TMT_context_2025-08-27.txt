[TITLE]Vaxxas secures ~A$90 million in funding to:
[TEXT]
Total equity and debt raising of ~$90 million provides runway to 2H 2027

Strong support from existing and new investors including SPRIM Global Investments

Funds will be used to scale-up production of needle-free vaccination delivery technology

Founding CEO David Hoey will transition to Strategic Advisor

Company well-advanced in search for new CEO to accelerate commercialisation.

BRISBANE, Australia, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxxas Pty Ltd, the biotechnology company pioneering the high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) for needle-free vaccine delivery, today announced that it has secured ~$90 million in its latest financing round.

The financing is one of the largest financings for a private biotech company in Australia this year and includes $49.22 million in new Series D equity and $40 million in debt facilities, with additional commitments under discussion as the Company continues to attract investor interest.

The equity financing was led by SPRIM Global Investments, the venture arm of global life sciences firm SPRIM, with strong participation from new investor LGT Crestone as well as existing investors OneVentures and Brandon Capital-Hostplus.

The funding will enable Vaxxas to accelerate the development and scale-up of its HD-MAP technology towards market readiness, including installation of semi-automated manufacturing lines and later-stage clinical trial programs.

Vaxxas’ HD-MAP technology represents a major advance in vaccine delivery, enabling needle-free administration that reduces temperature control requirements for vaccine storage and creates opportunities for self-administration in the home. This could dramatically improve vaccine access and uptake worldwide.

Chair of Vaxxas, Sarah Meibusch, said the capital raising represented an excellent achievement in a very difficult market for biotech. “This result underscores the confidence that leading investors have in Vaxxas’ disruptive technology and the progress the team has made toward scaling-up and commercialisation. Coupled with our sharp focus on commercialisation, this funding provides Vaxxas with a runway into the second half of 2027 as we focus on bringing our technology to market.”

Michael Shleifer, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of SPRIM Global Investments, said: “SPRIM is proud to lead this financing and support Vaxxas at this exciting juncture. We believe the HD-MAP platform has the potential to fundamentally transform vaccine delivery globally – expanding access, reducing costs, and improving uptake. The commercial opportunity is enormous, and we look forward to partnering with the team as they advance toward market.”

In addition to the Series D equity, Vaxxas has entered into a US$25.2 million (A$40 million) debt facility with SPRIM Global Investments, which the company can draw down based on eligible R&D activity under the Australian Government’s R&D tax rebate scheme and in line with the Company’s R&D needs.

Leadership and Board transition

After 14 years as CEO, David Hoey will transition to a new role as Strategic Advisor. Having led Vaxxas since 2012, Mr Hoey and the Board believe that this transition provides a strategic opportunity to put leadership in place for the coming years, as the Company accelerates its commercialisation efforts to bring the HD-MAP to market.

Mr Hoey said: “I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved to bring the company and its technology to this point in its growth. We have successfully validated the revolutionary potential of this vaccination delivery platform for a spectrum of diseases in global markets and have strong traction in product and market development. I look forward to continuing to be a part of the Vaxxas journey, supporting the executive team and Board as they drive forward.”

Under Mr Hoey’s leadership, Vaxxas has established a world-class team, strategic relationships with global leaders in vaccination, and raised more than $300 million to support the programs, of which almost $160 million has been injected into the Australian economy, including more than $140 million in Queensland.

Sarah Meibusch said: “We are deeply grateful to David for his tireless work to get Vaxxas to this stage. David and the Vaxxas team have grown the company from a spinout from The University of Queensland into a company with strong technical and operational capabilities and established a world-class development and manufacturing facility. This transition reflects the Company’s evolution from a high-potential startup to a commercially focused biotech scaling for global impact. David’s continued involvement as advisor and committed shareholder will help ensure a smooth transition and continuity.”

A global search for a new CEO is well advanced.

Vaxxas Chair Paul Kelly, who has been on the Board since Vaxxas was founded in 2011, has retired from the Board. Fellow OneVentures representative Sarah Meibusch has been appointed Chair. Ms Meibusch, OneVentures Healthcare Partner, has been closely involved with Vaxxas for a number of years and has been an alternate director since 2020.

[TITLE]Thoma Bravo to buy Verint in $2 billion deal as software acquisitions ramp up:
[TEXT]
Thoma Bravo will acquire Verint Systems in a $2 billion deal, including debt, the customer engagement platform said on Monday, marking the latest software buyout as private equity firms increasingly bet on AI to navigate an uncertain economy.

Software companies have emerged as prime acquisition targets as adoption of artificial intelligence and recurring revenue prove to be resilient markers in an economy pressured by tariffs and volatile customer spending.

Under the agreement, Verint shareholders will receive $20.50 per share in cash. The offer represents a premium of 4.2 per cent to the stock's closing price on June 30, before the talks were first reported, and implies an equity deal value of $1.23 billion, according to Reuters calculations.

Shares of Verint — which provides an AI-powered platform to help enterprises organize, manage and improve customer interactions across various channels and digital operations — were down 1.2 per cent at $20.23.

The stock has lost 25 per cent of its value so far this year, pressured by strong competition and declining revenue in the past two quarters.

Still, some analysts expect Verint's focus on AI bots to result in higher demand as enterprise customers invest in automation and efficiency.

"We believe this was a strategic move for both entities as these organizations are closely aligned in terms of customer experience automation that leverages data and AI, with Thoma Bravo already heavily invested in this market," Wedbush analysts said in a note.

Thoma Bravo, which had about $184 billion in assets under management as of March 31, is among the largest software-focused investors globally. The private equity firm has acquired or invested in more than 530 software and technology companies.

Earlier this month, it had signed a $12 billion deal to acquire human resources software provider Dayforce.

The latest deal is expected to close before the end of Verint's current fiscal year.

[TITLE]Trump Embraces Socialism, Nationalizes Failing Chipmaker:
[TEXT]
Politicians can end up with strange bedfellows in this chaotic age, but certain economic tenets are virtually incontrovertible: calls to nationalize industry typically come from the left, while the right steadfastly opposes those efforts in favor of market-based solutions.

And yet, for some reason, the ever-chaotic president Donald Trump has directed the US government to acquire a 10 percent stake in the troubled chipmaker Intel — a bizarre and impractical move that's being decried across the ideological spectrum.

In a

[TITLE]Breitbart Business Digest: Trump’s Intel Investment Isn’t Socialism:
[TEXT]
The Intelligence of the Intel Equity Stake

The White House’s sudden decision to take a ten percent stake in Intel startled some observers as a surprising lurch to government overreach by a Republican administration. In truth, it looks less like a lurch and more like a pilot program for an idea economic nationalists have been refining for years.

Julius Krein, editor of American Affairs, has been arguing that America’s capital markets are structurally incapable of funding the industries the nation actually needs. Last week’s deal gave him a live-fire case study.

For decades, U.S. corporate strategy has been to maximize shareholder value, not profits, Krein has argued. The two overlap only sometimes. That’s why companies cling to hurdle rates of fifteen percent even when the true cost of capital is half that. A project that could return a solid seven or eight percent will be passed over, because it drags down return-on-assets ratios and puts the multiple at risk.

The result is chronic underinvestment in precisely the sectors that matter most: capital-intensive industries like chips, energy hardware, aerospace, and defense. Wall Street prefers “asset-light” software firms, where margins are fat and capital commitments small. Nikefication—separating design rents from the messy work of production—became the model. America congratulated itself on “tech dominance” even as it outsourced the industrial backbone to Asia.

The outcome is visible in the semiconductor market: Intel hollowed out, Taiwan’s TSMC in command. Conventional subsidies barely scratch the surface because the market structure itself tells executives not to invest no matter how much Congress appropriates.

Krein’s Fix: A Sovereign Wealth Fund

Krein’s answer is not just more grants but a new institution: a U.S. sovereign wealth fund or development bank, modeled on the “IFCUS” legislation Vice President Vance once championed. Instead of writing checks that vanish, such a vehicle would take loans, guarantees, or equity stakes in critical industries, recycle returns, and permanently crowd in private capital.

The logic is straightforward. A $50 billion appropriation, leveraged, could mobilize hundreds of billions. Unlike one-off grants, a portfolio fund adapts, experiments, and reinvests. It fills the “scale-up gap” where America excels at R&D only to watch commercialization flee overseas for lack of financing. In Krein’s words, “making America great again requires making investments in critical capital-intensive sectors attractive again.”

Intel’s deal looks improvised, but in substance it mirrors this template: convert CHIPS Act grants into equity, align taxpayer risk with taxpayer reward, and de-risk a scale-up stage that private markets won’t touch.

There Are Risks, But It Isn’t Socialism

That doesn’t make the Intel stake flawless. A bespoke, personality-driven negotiation is a poor substitute for a rules-based fund with a clear mandate. Left in Trump’s hands alone, it can mutate into deal capitalism—leaning on Apple to use Intel fabs before they’re competitive, jawboning CEOs in the Oval Office, distorting rather than strengthening the sector. In the hands of a left-wing president, the equity stake could be used to pressure a company into sacrificing production to lower carbon emissions or chase a DEI quota.

But it is worth noting this was already a risk with the pre-existing system of grants, loans, and tax-breaks. Government funding always comes with strings, and the Biden administration was not shy

[TITLE]After 10% Intel equity deal, President Trump says he’ll make deals like it ‘all day long’:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump on Monday supported America’s 10% stake in Intel, criticizing detractors of the deal in a morning post on Truth Social.

I PAID ZERO FOR INTEL, IT IS WORTH APPROXIMATELY 11 BILLION DOLLARS. All goes to the USA. Why are “stupid” people unhappy with that? I will make deals like that for our Country all day long. I will also help those companies that make such lucrative deals with the United States States. I love seeing their stock price go up, making the USA RICHER, AND RICHER. More jobs for America!!! Who would not want to make deals like that? – President Donald Trump, August 25, 2025

Suzanne O’Halloran for FOX Business:

‎

Intel shares have gained 28% this month, fueled by the deal to help shore up the struggling chipmaker and focus on American-made semiconductors. The Trump administration is considering more similar deals, according to White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett. “I’m sure that at some point there’ll be more transactions, if not in this industry, then other industries,” Hassett told CNBC. The $11 billion stake is a combination of common stock and grants from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. “The government intervention in the free-market economy happened when the CHIPS Act was passed. Remember, it was a grant. And what President Trump has done is turn that grant into an equity position,” Larry Lindsey, a former director of the National Economic Council, said on “Mornings With Maria.” “So I don’t think there’s any increase in socialism here. I think socialism was already committed when we started allocating capital the way we did back then.” Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said in a statement to FOX Business: “The CHIPS Act was a doomed Democrat led ploy for corporate welfare; it should be rescinded, not expanded into government acquisition of private companies.”

‎

MacDailyNews Take: Here’s more from Maria Bartiromo’s interview with Larry Lindsay this morning:

Maria, what’s unique about what just happened though, and different from just a willy-nilly purchasing of shares or ownership shares, is that the money had already been spent by the government, so Intel was sitting there with the money as a grant. Now, the government gets something in return for that grant. So, the intervention into the private sector happened when the CHIPS Act was passed.

The CHIPS Act was passed on July 27, 2022 and signed into law during the previous administration on August 9, 2022.

As we wrote last week:

Even if some bets don’t pan out, it’s better than just handing out taxpayers’ money to companies for free. Any grants that do generate revenue will return something instead of nothing for the investor, which is, in these cases, the American taxpayer. By just handing out taxpayers’ money with no strings attached, the American taxpayer foots the bill for each company involved with no hope of any returns ever. Why was it ever that way? Just an endless string of bad deals made by people who were supposed to be stewards of taxpayer’s money, yet thought of it as their own. Let us never forget this fundamental truth. The state has no source of money other than the money people earn themselves… There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers’ money. – Margaret Thatcher This way, if a company uses American taxpayers’ money to generate profits, the taxpayers get returns on their investments. That said, the United States of America isn’t communist China, so any stake the government takes on behalf of American taxpayers MUST ALWAYS be non-voting. Finally, some companies are too far gone and are just meant to die. Yes, we’re talking about Intel whose ex-CEO Paul Ottelini made a potentially fatal decision not to take up Steve Jobs on his offer to develop the microprocessor for the original iPhone. One big mistake like that can take down a company. Intel is an also-ran today. Propping up such companies with American taxpayers’ money only prolongs the inevitable. Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. – Steve Jobs

After considerable chatter, the Trump White House made official a decision that is earning praise while also ruffling some feathers. The United States government will have a 9.9% stake in Intel, which could spell good news not only for the company, but the United States, including Ohio.

The plan is especially integral to Ohio, given that plans for an Intel manufacturing plant being built in 2025 have been delayed until 2030 or 2031. Such delays raised concerns from Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted, R-Ohio, as well as state lawmakers, including Democrats.

[TITLE]Another artificial intelligence deal collapses — as Colorado lawmakers’ budget fixes near finish line:
[TEXT]
Colorado’s first-in-the-nation regulations on artificial intelligence may have to wait longer if the legislature approves a proposal advanced by the state Senate on Monday.

In a dramatic shift from Sunday night, when a deal on revamped regulations appeared within reach, Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez gutted the bill. The measure, proposed during a mostly budget-focused special session, had been aimed at regulating AI and increasing transparency around its use to make decisions affecting Coloradans.

Instead, the bill as amended would simply delay, by several months, the implementation of a law passed 2024 that is supposed to go into effect next February.

Under Rodriguez’s proposal, which still needs to pass the state House, those regulations would take effect at the end of June — giving the tech industry, lawmakers, and public-interest and consumer-protection groups another chance during the next regular session to nail down how to regulate the growing, affluent industry. The regular session convenes in mid-January.

“Overnight, the tech industry decided that they were so unhappy with the compromise that had been achieved by consumer-protection organizations, educators, labor and business that they would rather return to the (existing rules),” said Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat and driving figure on AI regulations in the state.

The legislature met for its latest special session chiefly to address a $783 million budget deficit brought on by tax cuts and spending changes made by the federal government in July. But the AI regulations, which drew the ire of an industry that argues they are unworkable, was also specifically designated for new consideration in Gov. Jared Polis’ recall of the legislature this month.

Most budget-related bills finished

By the end of the fifth day of the session on Monday, the Democratic majority had sent to Polis the bulk of the bills they hoped would bite into the deficit. The single biggest revenue-raising measure, however, still needed at least two more votes.

The bills that have passed the legislature are:

House Bill 1001, which makes permanent a limit on certain business income deductions for people making more than $500,000 per year.

House Bill 1002, which cracks down on the use of foreign tax havens and adds several countries to that label.

House Bill 1003, which ends a tax incentive for insurance companies that keep offices in the state.

House Bill 1005, which ends a state subsidy to businesses for collecting sales taxes.

In total, those measures are expected to raise about $150 million. The fifth measure, House Bill 1004, would allow certain entities to sell tax credits that can be reclaimed at a discount in future tax years. Lawmakers expect that to bring in another $100 million, for a total of just over $250 million.

"Right now, we need to ensure that the families and the small businesses that truly need our help are getting it," said Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Jefferson County Democrat.

The revenue-raisers amount to nearly a third of the total $783 million budget gap. Polis' staff is preparing to address as much as a third of the gap through spending cuts. His office is expected to reveal its planned reductions later this week, after the revenue part has been adopted.

The rest of the hole will be filled from the legislature's piggy bank. That'll happen last: Whatever's not raised or cut will be pulled from the state's reserves. The governor's office has suggested roughly $320 million, which would reduce the current reserve level -- about 15% of the general fund budget -- by 2 percentage points.

That would mean his office was planning to propose about $200 million in spending reductions.

Liability at issue on AI

On the AI front, Rodriguez’s bill was sent Monday over to the House, where members have already debated a competing AI measure -- one that had also been watered down to simply delaying the 2024 regulations, in that case until October 2026. The House planned to take up Rodriguez's bill in committee and potentially for an initial floor vote Monday night, which would make a final vote possible Tuesday.

How to assign liability for bias apparent in the use of AI to make decisions -- between entities that use AI for things like screening job and rental applications and the entities that developed the AI tools -- was a key part of Rodriguez's measure before its gutting.

But that has been a key sticking point between the dueling bills.

“A delay is the prudent thing to do,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat and sponsor of the House bill, said. “We need to figure out a way where school districts, hospitals and other deployers aren’t left holding the bag for these regulations. We need to ensure that all stakeholders involved in this legislation are held equally accountable when bad things happen.”
