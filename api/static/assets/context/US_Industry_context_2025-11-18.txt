[TITLE]Niveshaay leads ₹325 crore funding in Waaree Energy Storage to scale battery business:
[TEXT]
Investment firm Niveshaay on Tuesday said it has led a Rs 325 crore funding round in Waaree Energy Storage Systems to expand the Waaree Group's battery arm.

The fund will be used to enhance cell and pack manufacturing capacity, strengthen engineering and validation capabilities, and scale containerised Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) across India and select global markets.

Multiple fund vehicles

Niveshaay said it has cumulatively invested Rs 128 crore in the round through its Category II Niveshaay Sambhav Fund, Category III Niveshaay Hedgehogs Fund, and the newly launched one of India's first dedicated Collective Investment Vehicles (CIVs,) Niveshaay WESS Fund.

Other co-investors in the round include Vivek Jain (Managing Director, Action Tesa and GrowthSphere) and Saket Agarwal (former Director, Apollo Pipes Ltd and Apollo Tricoat), among others, Niveshaay, the SEBI-registered investment advisory and boutique asset management firm said.

"Battery storage will play a key role in India's clean energy growth… they expand a domestic storage platform with scale and technology depth," said Arvind Kothari, Founder at Niveshaay.

India’s storage outlook

India's storage market is growing with policy support through viability-gap funding for grid-scale storage, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for advanced cells, and the Energy Storage Obligation (ESO), the firm said.

Cumulative installations, according to Niveshaay, are expected to reach around 200 GWh by 2030 from 0.4 GWh in 2024.

As BESS systems evolve from short-duration buffers to multi-day storage and hybrid configurations, Waaree's vertically integrated model enables it to capture value across the manufacturing, integration, and long-term service layers, it said.

Waaree's existing solar manufacturing and EPC capabilities create strong alignment for battery integration, Kothari said.

The global energy transition is shifting focus from generation capacity to reliability, flexibility, and storage. Falling lithium-ion costs and supportive policy frameworks have made storage economically viable for utilities and commercial users alike, it said.

Worldwide, storage is the defining theme of the decade; India's trajectory now mirrors that of the US and Europe, where multi-hour battery systems underpin renewable integration, grid stability, and peak demand management, the company said.

Niveshaay investments across listed and unlisted equities and is known for its early-stage, high-conviction investments in India's manufacturing and energy-transition ecosystem.

[TITLE]Venture capital recovers in third quarter but early deals falter:
[TEXT]

Irish technology companies saw venture capital backing rise 8 per cent in the third quarter of the year, new data shows, as the impact of US tariffs on international investors faded.

But funding for the first nine months of the year was down 10 per cent year on year, data compiled by the Irish Venture Capital Association (IVCA) said, and early deals suffered.

A total of €207.9 million was ploughed into Irish small and medium-sized enterprises in the third quarter, according to the Irish Venture Capital Association Venture Pulse survey, published in association with William Fry.

That followed a “dismal” second quarter, when funding dropped to its lowest in 10 years, following the US announcement of Liberation Day tariff plans in April, shaking international investor confidence.

However, the latest data indicated investors had started to return to the market, with backing from overseas investors more than doubling to €146.7 million in the current quarter compared with €69.5 million in the second quarter.

“Hopefully we are starting to see some confidence and stability return to the market, but it remains a challenging time for early-stage companies,” said IVCA chairperson Caroline Gaynor.

Gaps also remained in some areas in the third quarter, with deals for seed funding and those under €1 million yielding less positive results. Year on year, seed rounds fell by 30 per cent to €23.4 million, and by 31 per cent for the first nine months of the year.

Total funding for the first nine months stood at €853.4 million, down from €945.3 million in 2024.

“The process for deploying the Government’s €250 million Enterprise Ireland Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2025-2029 is well under way,” said IVCA director general Sarah-Jane Larkin. “We are optimistic that the environment for very early stage Irish companies seeking first-round funding will pick up in the first half of next year.”

Deals in the €1 million to €5 million range accounted for 30 out of the 39 transactions in the quarter, with those in the €1 million to €3 million up 35 per cent year on year. Deals in the €3 million to €5 million range were up 18 per cent.

But funding in the €10 million to €30 million category was down by two-thirds, declining to €26 million, while deals up to €10 million were down by 74 per cent to €13.5 million.

In the €30 million and over category, standout deals included €62 million raised by ProVerum, while AI machine learning firm Nory raised €34 million.

Life sciences topped the list for funding this year to date, followed by cybersecurity, AI and machine learning, fintech and software.

[TITLE]Capital market and real estate business should be activated for economic revitalization: FM Khanal:
[TEXT]
Kathmandu, November 16: Finance Minister Rameshwar Prasad Khanal said that in order to revitalize the country’s overall economic sector, it is necessary to further activate the capital market and the real estate market.

Speaking at a discussion program on “Contemporary Economic Issues” organized today by the Nepal Chamber of Commerce, Minister Khanal said that the activeness of both markets is essential to expand economic activities. According to him, the government is internally discussing possible legal amendments through an ordinance to remove obstacles seen in real estate transactions.

“To make real estate transactions easier, the government can introduce certain provisions through an ordinance, or it can use its executive authority to carry out necessary reforms,” he said.

Minister Khanal clarified that the government cannot fulfill all demands of the private sector but emphasized that coordination and cooperation are crucial. “All demands of the private sector may not be fulfilled immediately, nor is it sensible to forcefully implement them—implementation itself becomes difficult. But on matters of improving the business environment, increasing production, and boosting employment, the private sector and the government must move together. Employment generation, expanding domestic businesses, and attracting investment are among the government’s top priorities,” he stated.

Minister Khanal informed that the Gen-Z protests that took place on September 8–9 caused massive damage in 514 local levels across 55 districts. The initial estimate shows that the private sector alone incurred losses of around Rs 36 billion. Combining both the public and private sectors, the total damage amounts to Rs 78.51 billion. Among this, insurance claims worth around Rs 23 billion have already been filed by the private sector, and more than 400 claims are currently under the payment process, he said.

Minister Khanal also stressed that rebuilding trust between the government and the private sector is crucial for economic recovery. “The role of the private sector is larger than the government’s when it comes to increasing employment and expanding production. The government’s role is facilitation and regulation,” he said.

Stating that economic activities cannot progress rapidly unless an environment of trust is established in the country, Minister Khanal said that reforms have begun in the customs system to reduce transaction costs. He expressed commitment to making customs clearance based on transaction value and scrapping the reference price book used in valuation.

Similarly, he warned that strict action would be taken against anyone involved in illegal activities such as unauthorized trade, black-marketing, excessive price hikes, and monopolistic practices. He said that business audits should be conducted solely on the basis of risk analysis and specific challenges.

He added that increasing the number of taxpayer service offices is a government priority. However, the government cannot immediately move forward with implementing multiple VAT rates, he clarified. Minister Khanal said that continuous discussions are being held between the Ministry of Finance and Nepal Rastra Bank regarding the implementation of working capital guidelines, among other issues. He assured that the government will continue providing policy support through monetary measures to make business and economic activities more convenient.

[TITLE]I sold equities with capital gains of Rs 25 lakh, can I save tax by reinvesting it in property?:
[TEXT]
These are a set of queries raised by ET Wealth readers, which have been answered by our panel of experts.Sudhir Kaushik Co-founder & CEO, TaxSpanner: Section 54F of the Income Tax Act offers relief on long-term capital gains (LTCG) when the net sale proceeds from equity mutual funds or shares are invested in a residential property. The investment must be made within one year before or two years after the transfer, or construction must be completed within three years. If the investment is not made before the due date for filing the income tax return (ITR), the unutilised amount should be deposited in the Capital Gains Account Scheme (CGAS) to retain the exemption. In the present case, the return of income has already been filed, and tax on the capital gains has been duly paid without any deposit into CGAS. Consequently, the statutory condition for availing the exemption has not been satisfied, and a revised return cannot be used to retrospectively claim the benefit. For clarity, short-term capital gains (STCG) on equity remain taxable at a flat rate of 20% and are outside the scope of this exemption.Shubham Agrawal Senior Taxation Adviser, TaxFile.in: Your capital gain from the sale of the house on 31 May will be `5.81 lakh using indexation for the purchase year 2008 and sale year 2005-06. Under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act, when a residential property is sold and the capital gain is reinvested in another residential property either bought 1 year before or within the next 2 years, the capital gain is exempt. Thus, you may seek exemption on that. As far as capital gain on mutual funds is concerned, that is governed by Section 54F, which mandates that not just capital gains but the entire sale proceeds of `15.78 lakh from these funds be reinvested in a residential property either 1 year before or within the next 2 years. As this is your case, your mutual fund transaction will also be exempt given that you should not own more than one house (apart from the one in which re-investment is made) on the date of sale of these mutual funds.Our panel of experts will answer questions related to any aspect of personal finance. If you have a query, mail it to us right away.

[TITLE]3650 Capital Provides $38M Construction Loan for Philadelphia Luxury Apartments – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Chatham Bay Group, a Delaware-based real estate firm, has secured $37.5 million in senior construction financing to build Viking Mill Apartments, a 177-unit, luxury multifamily complex in Philadelphia, Commercial Observer can first report.

3650 Capital provided the financing out of its Real Estate Credit Solutions (RECS) platform, which will complete the construction and ensure the project is secure through delivery and stabilization after lease-up.

Global Real Estate Advisors’ Christopher Garzone, Ken Wellar and George Johnson arranged the loan.

Jonathan Roth, 3650 Capital co-founder and managing partner, said in a statement that the Philadelphia submarket of East Kensington, where Viking Mill will be located, is a “high-growth” neighborhood that has seen an increased demand for “high-quality housing.”

He also noted that the finished Viking Mill will feature two buildings and blend the historic architecture of East Kensington with a more modern design by renovating a derelict 19th-century mill into loft-style apartments and building another residential building from scratch.

“We look forward to building a strong relationship with Chatham Bay Group and believe the property will yield strong results and provide the community with an exceptional residential experience,” Roth added.

Located at 2019-2055 East Boston Street, Viking Mill Apartments will feature 77 lofts in the redesigned mill and 100 units in the ground-up construction building. Construction will require two phases, and is expected to be finished initially in the first quarter of 2026 and then the rest in the fourth quarter.

The two-building apartment complex will feature 7,750 square feet of ground-floor retail and include a courtyard with 34 parking spaces for residents. Other amenities will include a sky deck, a rooftop pool, a hot tub, fire pits, a dog run and dog spa, a fitness center and a coworking lounge.

Patrick Duffy, founder and CEO of Chatham Bay, said in a statement that his firm actively sought out 3650 Capital as its lender on the transaction, despite not having borrowed from them before, due to the firm’s “relationship-driven” lending style.

“We have a long-standing respect for 3650, its founders and senior management team, and we’re excited to be working with them on a project as special as Viking Mill,” Duffy said.

[TITLE]Doroni Aerospace Launches a Reg CF Raise to Accelerate Commercial Production of H1-X Personal Aircraft:
[TEXT]
Coral Springs, USA, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FAA-Certified Aviation Startup Is Raising Capital to Deliver the First Generation of Personal eVTOL Aircraft in $1T+ Urban Air Mobility Market

Doroni Aerospace, the advanced air mobility company pioneering personal electric flight, has launched a new Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) raise to scale toward commercial production of its flagship personal eVTOL aircraft, the Doroni H1-X.

After eight years of R&D and rigorous flight testing, Doroni has developed a first-of-its-kind personal aircraft designed for everyday people. With intuitive controls and advanced safety systems, the H1-X is positioned to become a breakthrough in the $1 trillion Urban Air Mobility (UAM) sector.

With the H1-X showroom model nearly completed and set to debut early next year, this new capital raise supports Doroni’s transition from prototyping to production. FAA-certified and already approved for manned flight testing, Doroni is building for a future where short-distance air travel is safe, personal, and practical.

The H1-X is engineered for real-world use, built to fit in a two-car garage and takeoff and land directly from driveways. From there, it can reach top speeds of 120 mph, travel up to 100 miles on a single charge, and recharge in as little as 25 minutes. With enclosed ducted fans instead of exposed propellers, it offers increased safety and efficiency. And after just 25 hours of training, anyone can pilot this joystick-driven, user-friendly aircraft.

“While the industry races to build flying taxis, we are focused on something far more transformative: empowering individuals with the freedom of personal flight,” said Doron Merdinger, Founder & CEO of Doroni Aerospace. “We aren’t just creating a new vehicle; we are creating a new era of mobility where people take back control of their time and their travel.

Interest is already mounting. Doroni has received over 600 pre-orders, representing an estimated $175M+ in potential revenue, and is targeting first deliveries in 2028.

Regulatory advancements are now unlocking certification for personal eVTOL aircraft, making the dream of flying your own vehicle a reality. Doroni is a key player in this revolution, having successfully achieved one of the first-ever manned test flights in the U.S.

Doroni’s investment round is now open to the public. Learn more and invest at invest.doroni.io
