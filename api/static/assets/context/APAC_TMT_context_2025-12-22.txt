[TITLE]Arm China, AI start-up RabbitPre among mainland Chinese tech firms expanding in Hong Kong:
[TEXT]
A growing number of mainland Chinese tech firms are tapping Hong Kong for research talent and overseas expansion, as the Asian financial hub moves to attract Big Tech and start-ups to boost its technology sector.

Arm China, the Chinese unit of British semiconductor firm Arm Holdings, would establish a chip intellectual property research and development centre in Hong Kong in 2026 that would focus on artificial intelligence and robotics, Arm China senior technical director Zou Wei said last month.

The new centre would be located at the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, and aimed to recruit around 100 people within three years, according to Zou.

Not long ago, Hong Kong's share-sale market was a symbol of China's slowdown: Deal books were thin, investor sentiment was sour and bankers were fleeing the industry. This year, the script has flipped.Share sales nearly quadrupled to more than $73 billion through initial public offerings, placements and block trades. For the first time since 2013, that made Hong Kong the No. 1 fundraising spot in Asia, ranking just behind the US globally. The city has been at the front of a dealmaking boom across the continent that included a record year for IPOs in India, and strong markets in mainland China and Japan.In Hong Kong, Chinese companies fuelled the frenzy with gargantuan deals to power their global expansion plans. Battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology raised $5.3 billion in the world's second-largest listing in May. Electric-vehicle maker BYD Co. and EV-to-smartphones giant Xiaomi Corp. also raised more than $5 billion each in share placements. Deals even powered ahead as the US rolled out tariffs, and some faced pushback from US politicians."This year has exceeded expectations," said James Wang, head of equity capital markets for Asia excluding Japan at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. "We expect volumes to continue rising, albeit at a more measured pace."The upswing has been broad-based across Asia. Four of the world's five largest share-sale venues are in the continent, with India, mainland China and Japan trailing Hong Kong. For the first time, four Asian markets were among the top five in the world for share sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The Hong Kong IPO pipeline looks healthy as well, with

[TITLE]US$20bil photonic AI manufacturing city to be built in Nilai, says Aminuddin:
[TEXT]
SEREMBAN: An advanced photonic AI manufacturing city will be developed on a 1,200ha area in Nilai near here, says Datuk Seri Aminuddin Harun.

The Mentri Besar said the project, touted to be the first large-scale photonic computing and semiconductor initiative of its kind in the world, would involve an investment of some US$20bil over a five-year period.

"This will be one of the first large-scale photonic semiconductor manufacturing hubs in South- East Asia, and among the first globally, establishing Negri Sembilan as a leader in the future of advanced manufacturing.

"It is expected to deliver major benefits such as 40,000 high-paying skilled jobs, 20,000 indirect jobs across supporting industries and with a total of 60,000 long-term employment opportunities," he said in a statement.

Aminuddin said the project, which would position Malaysia at the forefront of the next global computing era, was a collaboration between Mehamood Hosein, founder of the Hosein Family Office, a United States-based deep-technology office and Gan Family Office led by Tan Sri Gan Kong Seng.

Gan is also Nilai Resources Group Bhd chairman.

"The Hosein Family Office brings the core photonic AI compute platform, long-term engineering and architectural leadership, engagement with international institutional investors and a development vision planned at a scale of approximately US$20bil over five years.

"Tan Sri Gan and his family office are contributing 1,200ha of prime land in Nilai, construction leadership and integrated infrastructure development and master planning for a world-class technology and industrial city.

"This ensures the Nilai Advanced Photonic AI Manufacturing City is developed on strong Malaysian foundations and built to international standards," he said, adding that the partnership will lead to Malaysia receiving world-class technology and global investment engagement to establish a sovereign photonic AI manufacturing capability.

Aminuddin said the development would include photonic chipset integration facilities, glass interposer and waveguide factories, AI compute system assembly lines, a national real-time AI and digital twin research centre, a deep-tech engineering and technology training academy and a modern integrated township to support industry and workforce growth.

"Photonic architecture is widely regarded as the next platform for semiconductor technology for the future, providing the performance, scale, and efficiency required to support advanced AI, national digital infrastructure, and next-generation industrial systems.

"This positions Malaysia among the first nations to build the semiconductor platform of the future," he added.

He added that the development will also position Malaysia as one of the few nations capable of producing the next generation of high-performance AI compute systems that will power future economies.

[TITLE]CNBC's The China Connection newsletter: Why Sam’s Club is in a sweet spot as China faces consumption worries:
[TEXT]
This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Sam's Club, the membership-based warehouse retail arm of Walmart, opened its new store in Beijing last month, followed by another one in Shanghai on Tuesday. They drew large crowds, snarling traffic for hours and keeping consumers in long queues.

American membership warehouse clubs are telling something more nuanced: they are finding success in drawing consumers who are willing to pay a hefty membership fee in exchange for premium goods at reasonable prices. On top of that, those stores provide no-frill "treasure-hunt" shopping experiences to sweeten the deal.

Latest data from China showed a key gauge on consumption falling to its weakest level in nearly three years. But it does not capture the full story.

YANGZHOU, CHINA - NOVEMBER 12, 2025 - Citizens shop at the first Sam's Club in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China on November 12, 2025.

Such warehouse stores have long been known as places to buy large quantities of household staples at cheaper prices.

Even though it's less typical in China, where grocery habits have historically skewed toward high-frequency, smaller-basket shopping, this retail model is starting to find its customers.

"Here they do buy it because of the value and niche products," said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidal Wave Solutions. He said residents in his compound often ask in group chats whether others want to split oversized packs.

Sam's Club has leaned into that proposition: a shopping experience and product lineup distinct from conventional supermarkets and online retailers, paired with annual membership fees ranging from 260 yuan to 680 yuan ($37-$97). Shoppers get modest discounts — but the bigger draw is access to curated merchandise that they can't find elsewhere.

"It's a membership model that consumers pay the membership fee upfront, and as a result, they get a full set of services," said Weiwen Han, a Hong Kong-based partner at Bain & Company.

Walmart's success

Walmart entered China in 1996 with its first hypermarket and Sam's Club warehouse chain in Shenzhen.

But the hypermarket format — which combines a supermarket and department store — has lost momentum as digital retail took off. Sprawling online marketplaces, such as Alibaba and JD.com , with their aggressive discounts and convenience, have squeezed out traditional grocers and foreign players such as France-based Carrefour.

Walmart has closed almost 150 hypermarkets in China since 2020, with just 279 stores operational as of July, down from 412 in 2020.

But Sam's Club has proven an enduring strength for the company. The chain has turned warehouses into both shopping destinations and e-commerce delivery hubs, while filling shelves with products consumers can't easily comparison-shop elsewhere, including exclusive items under its house brand Member's Mark and Marketside.

Beyond online grocery ordering and delivery, the clubs offer an offline experience where shoppers can browse and "treasure hunt" — something local e-commerce players struggle to replicate, Han said.

The bet is paying off. Sam's Club has become one of the China's fastest-growing foreign retailers, with 56 outlets nationwide, compared to Costco's seven stores in the country. The market also helped fuel Walmart's strongest net sales growth globally. In the third quarter, Walmart's net sales in China surged 21.9% year on year to $6.1 billion, exceeding the broader Walmart International segment's average growth rate of 10.8%.

'Let's go to Disney'

That blend of curated products and digital convenience helps explain why the model has gained traction with affluent shoppers — and why one store visit can translate into multiple online orders.

Many shoppers won't return often in person. They'll make one trip to browse, then rely on the mobile app for five to 10 deliveries from the same store, said Curtis Alan Ferguson, former president of Coca-Cola Greater China and Korea and now managing partner at Ventech China, a venture capital firm focused on consumer startups.

For some, the appeal is the outing itself — a well-designed, predictable version of discovery shopping. "It's more of a … 'let's go to Disney' here," Ferguson said.

Aside from the physical shopping experience, Walmart says speed is part of the stickiness. "Our team in China delivers extremely fast, with nearly 80% of digital orders delivered within one hour," Doug McMillon, Walmart's CEO, said on the company's third-quarter earnings call.

Ferguson said suppliers also like working with Sam's Club because the volumes can justify unique packaging or sizes. "People bend over backwards to give [Sam's Club] the quality they desire," he said. "If you have … Sam's or Costco pulling your brand … that gives you some other cachet."

Hard to copy — even with local muscle

Few local rivals have managed to seriously challenge Sam's Club and Costco in membership retail — and not for lack of trying.

Alibaba's Freshippo, the Chinese tech giant's grocery business, shuttered its last members-only store in August.

However, regional chain Pangdonglai, which started in Xuchang, a city in the heartland of Henan, is widely viewed as a standout success.

Pangdonglai's appeal is that it operates on a "people-first philosophy" where emotional value and trust matter more than scale, said Olivia Plotnick, founder of Shanghai-based marketing agency Wai Social.

But the Henan store has struggled to scale beyond its home base. Its distinctive culture and high operational standards can be difficult to replicate — and to defend — in larger, more competitive cities, said Plotnick.

"Consumers with real demand for premium value are still willing to pay, but those seeking rational, low-price essentials are shifting toward discount formats," Plotnick said.

As China's consumer slump drags on, the warehouse clubs that offer quality goods at reasonable prices, and provide a store experience that online competitors can't easily rival, are emerging as rare bright spots in the sector.
