[TITLE]Dixon meets Q2 revenue target, bets on components to fuel growth:
[TEXT]
Dixon Technologies Ltd’s revenue and profit rose in the September quarter as a growing volume of mobile phones and telecommunications products fuelled growth for India’s largest publicly listed electronics manufacturer.

Noida-headquartered company’s operating revenue rose 15.7% sequentially and 33% year-on-year to ₹14,855 crore in the second quarter of FY26, according to its filings. Dixon met the guidance of 15% revenue growth that Atul Lall, its vice-chairman and managing director, had given in the June quarter.

The company’s profitability rose 167% sequentially and 81% over a year earlier to ₹746 crore. However, this was largely due to Dixon selling goods manufactured in the past in the September quarter.

The change in the company’s inventory of finished goods led to a loss of ₹413 crore in the June quarter, while it sold ₹297 crore of unsold goods during in July-September, leading to a jump in profits.

While Lall did not offer guidance for future quarters during the post-earnings conference call with analysts, he expressed confidence in the company’s push to increase margins and navigate a slowdown in orders from Motorola, Dixon’s anchor client so far.

JVs, diversification plans

“Some of our components-linked joint ventures, such as with Q Tech for camera modules, are already leading to revenue realization since these are running factories. Others, such as display modules, will start adding revenue by the end of this fiscal or the first quarter of the next fiscal," Lall said.

“Overall, within the next two fiscals, we expect displays, mechanicals, power supplies and other components to represent a $12-billion net addressable industry in India with available margins of around 8%," he said. “Of these, Dixon’s revenue opportunity can be around $1.5 billion ( ₹13,000 crore) annually."

Lall further added that each of Dixon’s four joint ventures announced through the September quarter will start adding revenue by FY27 itself.

“Among component manufacturing, we expect component supplies for 60 million smartphones by volume to generate $600 million in annual revenue. Similarly, the revenue addition from laptops could be $100 million, and we expect to see a further $60 million from television display manufacturing and $140 million from automotive display manufacturing—all adding up to at least $900 million ( ₹8,000 crore) over the next two years," Lall said.

“All of this will add to our margin expansion process as we delve deeper into the electronics manufacturing ecosystem."

The diversification play is already playing out in parts. Revenue from telecom equipment such as Wi-Fi routers grew 116% sequentially to ₹3,045 crore in September. Lall said that the company will actively seek enterprise-grade networking product clients.

Risks and strategic moves

However, Dixon’s growth opportunity does not come without risks. Revenue from pure-play mobile phone manufacturing dropped 5% sequentially to ₹9,312 crore, even though mobile phone revenue received a 130% sequential boost from Dixon’s subsidiary Ismartu, which makes phones for China-based Transsion Holdings. This clearly reflected a slowdown in Dixon’s production of phones from China-owned consumer electronics brand Motorola.

Lall said that Vivo will be Dixon’s marquee client for the business. “That said, we do hope to have both Vivo and Motorola as two anchor clients for Dixon, and not just one."

The company also said that it is negotiating a deal with a large original design manufacturer (ODM) based in the US—details may be signed by the end of this fiscal.

Analysts have previously underlined the risk of Dixon’s dependency on singular large clients for a bulk of its revenue—Ismartu, for instance, alone accounted for 31% of Dixon’s quarterly revenue in Q2.

Through the September quarter, Dixon made four partnership announcements—a 51:49 JV with China’s Kunshan Q Tech Microelectronics for camera, display and fingerprint modules; a 74:26 JV with Chongqing Yuhai for precision components of laptops and mobile phones; a 50:50 JV with Signify Innovations (formerly Philips Lighting) for LED light and accessories manufacturing; and an entry into battery production via wholly owned subsidiary, Dixon Electrocorp.

“We're hearing the possibility of an export-target-based smartphone production incentive scheme in the works at the Centre. If such a plan plays out, this will work very well in Dixon's favour," said Harshit Kapadia, vice-president at Elara Capital.

“Its current short-term risk is that of Chinese smartphone brand Xiaomi's market share declining in India, which may impact Dixon's earnings from its biggest revenue-driving segment," said Kapadia. “However, apart from this, Dixon remains on a steady track despite its dependency on select brands."

[TITLE]Broadband forum cautions DoT against flawed parity between satcom and mobile services:
[TEXT]
Industry body Broadband India Forum (BIF) has asked the highest policy-making body of the Department of Telecommunications, the Digital Communications Commission (DCC), to reconsider its rules related to satellite communications (satcom) spectrum.

In a letter addressed to Dr. Neeraj Mittal, Chairman of DCC, the BIF argued that concerns around the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) satellite spectrum recommendations are influenced by “protectionist and anti-competitive mindsets” and violate free, fair and non-discriminatory treatment of new service providers.

Level playing field

Regarding reports of the DCC proposing satcom operators seek fresh permissions after crossing a certain number of subscribers, the BIF said such caps will constrain a satellite operator’s ability to scale, hurting investment incentives and increasing the service cost per user.

“The notion stems from the threat perception of the incumbents -- that satcom providers might amass large user bases and, thereby, cannibalise their existing markets, ostensibly without bearing equivalent regulatory burdens,” said T V Ramanchandran, Chairman of the BIF, warning of a ‘License Raj’ in case of such a cap.

The BIF also called the proposal for mid-term revision of satellite licences unfair, considering the renewal period is already set for five years as opposed to terrestrial broadband players, who have licences for 20 years. A mid-term renewal of licence would increase the capex costs for satcom players, as the entire cost would have to be amortised in a much shorter time.

Use of Bharat Nidhi

BIF supported TRAI’s recommendation of Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) for satellite user terminals and satcom services as “lawful” and “necessary,” given the high capex, steep terminal costs and lower revenues that satcom players are subject to in unserved and under-served geographies. BIF argued that should not be viewed as a subsidy, but as a national priority for bringing

[TITLE]Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market to 2030 Featuring Saudi Telecom Co, Mobily, Zain, Integrated Telecom Co, GO Telecom, Bayanat Al Oula, Detecon Al Saudia, and NourNet:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market, By Region, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market was valued at USD 18.72 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 24.05 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.26%. The Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services market encompasses a broad range of services including mobile voice and data, fixed-line broadband, satellite communication, and enterprise network solutions.

These services are delivered by key national operators such as STC, Zain KSA, and Mobily, and are vital to enabling both consumer connectivity and business operations across the Kingdom. With the highest population in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Saudi Arabia has emerged as a digitally active economy, with increasing demand for faster, more reliable telecommunications infrastructure.

The market is poised for significant growth driven by the expansion of 5G networks, fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) initiatives, and government-led smart city projects such as NEOM and The Line. These national efforts require high-capacity, low-latency connectivity to support technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology is actively driving digital infrastructure development, aiming to increase internet speed, coverage, and digital inclusion across urban and rural areas.

Growing demand for enterprise-level connectivity solutions in sectors like banking, logistics, and manufacturing is contributing to the telecom market's evolution. Enhanced regulatory frameworks, investment in ICT infrastructure, and strategic public-private partnerships are further accelerating sector development. As Saudi Arabia continues its digital transformation journey, the telecommunication services market will remain at the core, providing the foundational layer for future technological innovation and national economic diversification.

Key Market Drivers

Nationwide 5G Deployment and Infrastructure Modernization

Saudi Arabia is rapidly expanding its fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications network as part of its national digital transformation under Vision 2030. This rollout is not limited to major urban centers like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam but is extending to remote and underserved areas. Investments in 5G base stations, fiber backhaul, and spectrum acquisition are enabling the country to build one of the most advanced telecom infrastructures in the region.

This aggressive infrastructure development is improving connectivity speed, latency, and network capacity across all user categories. 5G enables use cases like smart manufacturing, autonomous transportation, and real-time healthcare diagnostics, increasing demand for advanced telecom services. The government, in collaboration with major telecom providers, is also offering incentives for private sector adoption of 5G, which in turn accelerates revenue generation for the sector and fosters innovation ecosystems across industries. As of early 2025, more than 65 percent of Saudi Arabia's population has access to 5G connectivity - up from just 23 percent in 2021. This rapid rise in coverage is driven by large-scale investments in nationwide base stations, spectrum rollout, and private-public collaboration to accelerate high-speed internet availability across both major cities and rural zones.

Key Market Challenges

Regulatory Complexity and Evolving Compliance Requirements

The regulatory environment for the telecommunication services market in Saudi Arabia is becoming increasingly complex due to the convergence of data protection, cybersecurity, localization, and international investment standards. While the Communications, Space and Technology Commission has implemented forward-looking frameworks to promote digital growth, the simultaneous application of multiple regulatory layers - especially concerning cross-border data transfer, 5G infrastructure sharing, and cloud services - creates compliance ambiguity for telecom operators. These overlapping mandates often slow down the introduction of new services or infrastructure deployments due to longer approval cycles and legal risk assessment periods.

The continuous revision of cybersecurity guidelines and national digital standards requires telecom companies to allocate substantial resources to legal, IT, and compliance functions. For smaller operators or new entrants, these burdens can restrict innovation and delay service expansion. Additionally, global technology vendors partnering with Saudi providers must also adjust to local legal frameworks, which can complicate integration timelines and strategic alliances. As the market matures and becomes more digitally interconnected, the need for unified, streamlined regulations that balance innovation with control will become increasingly vital to sustaining growth.

Key Market Trends

Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Network Optimization

Telecommunication service providers in Saudi Arabia are increasingly embedding artificial intelligence technologies across their operations to enhance network performance and customer service efficiency. Artificial intelligence-driven solutions are being used for predictive maintenance, automated network configuration, dynamic resource allocation, and anomaly detection. This has allowed operators to proactively resolve network issues, reduce service downtime, and deliver consistent, high-quality connectivity to a digitally demanding user base.

Moreover, customer experience management has benefited significantly from the application of artificial intelligence. Telecom operators are deploying virtual assistants, natural language processing systems, and intelligent analytics to personalize services, automate queries, and minimize human intervention in customer support. These tools help operators gain insights from large volumes of user data, enabling more agile decision-making. As Saudi Arabia accelerates its transition toward smart cities and digital governance, the role of artificial intelligence in automating and enhancing telecommunication services is expected to become more prominent and deeply embedded in network management strategies.
