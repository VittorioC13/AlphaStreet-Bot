[TITLE]Putin, Modi agree to expand and widen India-Russia trade, strengthen friendship:

Russian President Vladimir Putin offered India uninterrupted fuel supplies on Friday, eliciting a cautious response even as he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to expand trade and defence ties between countries with decades-old ties.

India, the world's top buyer of Russian arms and seaborne oil, has rolled out the red carpet for Putin during his two-day state visit, his first to New Delhi since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

But New Delhi is also in talks with the U.S. on a trade deal to cut punitive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on its goods over India's purchases of Russian oil. India's energy imports are expected to fall to a three-year-low this month following U.S. tariffs and sanctions. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Rick Switzer is still slated to travel to India on Monday, two U.S. officials said on Friday.

Russia has said it wants to import more Indian goods in an effort to grow trade to $100 billion by 2030.

Putin said Moscow was ready to continue ensuring "uninterrupted fuel supplies" to India, following up on comments on Thursday questioning U.S. pressure on India to curb oil purchases from Russia.

[TITLE]How Falling Energy Supplies Are Undermining Government Promises:
[TEXT]
The world is filled with financial promises, including loans, pensions, and even the market value of stocks. So far, the system seems to be working, but in a finite world, it is hard to believe that the system will work indefinitely. Governments can create money simply by adding more promises, but they cannot create goods and services in a similar fashion.

We know that actual physical materials are needed to make the goods and services that people depend upon. Energy supplies are particularly important in making goods and services because, according to the laws of physics, energy is required to produce physical goods and services. Forecasts that support current financial promises ignore the fact that we live in a finite world. Eventually, we will run short of easy-to-extract essential materials, including fossil fuels, uranium, lithium, and copper. Economic growth will need to be replaced by economic contraction.

In this post, I will try to explain the situation in more detail, together with some charts showing what is going wrong now, such as Figure 1. In some ways, we already seem to be reaching limits to growth.

Figure 1. Per capita energy growth rates are based on data from the 2025 Statistical Review of World Energy, published by the Energy Institute, with trend line and note.

[1] At first, added debt is helpful to an economy.

In some sense, added debt pulls an economy forward.

Figure 2. The author’s view of the analogy of a speeding upright bicycle and a speeding economy.

As long as there are plenty of inexpensively available resources and not too much interest to pay, added debt seems to make sense. It pulls the economy forward, in the direction that those resources are to be used. It “feels good” to the recipients of the goods and services made possible by the debt. People like the homes and cars that added debt makes possible.

Ordinary citizens have clear limits on their credit card debt. The limits on government promises seem to be hidden until they are actually reached.

As long as an economy is growing, that growth seems to hide many problems. Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff are two well-known US economists. In a 2008 working paper (p.15) examining 800 years of government debt defaults, they remarked, “It is notable that the non-defaulters, by and large, are all hugely successful growth stories.” Without “hugely successful economic growth,” it is impossible to keep adding debt and repaying it with interest. The growth allows debt to be paid back with interest. It allows the fiction that an economy will continue to grow, and this growth will provide the margin needed to repay the debt with interest.

While the world economy has been an amazingly successful growth story since the industrial revolution, we now seem to be running short of the inexpensively available fossil fuels that have made economic growth so far possible. With this change, the economy is likely to start a major shift from economic growth to economic contraction.

We don’t know exactly how this shift from economic growth to economic contraction will take place, but we can hypothesize that the economies that have recently been growing fastest might be farthest from contraction, and the economies that are already struggling with low growth might be the ones most likely to slip into contraction. The countries slipping into contraction can be expected to have special difficulty repaying debt with interest and meeting other financial promises. Some governments may even collapse, perhaps in the way the government of the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.

[2] Not too surprisingly, given the physics connection stated in the introduction, total world GDP and world energy consumption are highly correlated.

Figure 3. Energy based on data from the 2025 Statistical Review of World Energy, published by the Energy Institute; GDP in constant 2015 US$ is as published by the World Bank.

In fact, the growth rate of energy consumption and the growth rate of GDP are also correlated, as can be seen from the similar patterns on Figure 4.

Figure 4. Three-year average growth rates are used for stability. Energy growth rates are based on energy data from the 2025 Statistical Review of World Energy, published by the Energy Institute; GDP growth rates are based on GDP in constant 2015 US$ as published by the World Bank.

A scatter diagram of the X-Y data used in Figure 4 gives the result shown in Figure 5:

Figure 5. Three-year average growth rates are used for stability. Energy growth rates are based on energy data from the 2025 Statistical Review of World Energy, published by the Energy Institute; GDP growth rates are based on GDP in constant 2015 US$ as published by the World Bank.

[3] A major issue is the fact that the growth rate of world energy consumption is trending downward.

Figure 6. Energy growth rates are based on data from the 2025 Statistical Review of World Energy, published by the Energy Institute.

Figure 6 shows a big upward bump starting not long after the year 2000, driven by the addition of China’s inexpensive coal resources to the global energy supply. The low-cost portion of China’s coal resources is now mostly depleted. In addition, we don’t seem to have any other energy sources that will be available in large quantity in the near future. We have been adding wind and solar, but their impact has been small. Their impact is reflected in the total energy increases shown in Figure 6, and in the other charts above.

[4] Even worse, the rate of growth of world energy consumption per capita is trending downward. In fact, if the trend line were extended to 2025, it would seem to indicate contraction in per capita energy supplies.

Figure 7. Per capita energy growth rates are based on data from the 2025 Statistical Review of World Energy, published by the Energy Institute with trend line and note by Gail Tverberg. (Same as Figure 1.)

We know that it takes energy to make physical goods. Even services require some level of physical goods and energy, such as a building to perform these services, electricity to operate tools, and the materials needed to make any tools, such as computers or scissors.

On Figure 7, note that the trend line is dropping below 0% in 2024, and even farther below 0% in 2025. This means that a smaller energy supply is available, relative to the population. If less energy supply is available, fewer physical goods relative to the population are likely to be available, as well. No one announces this, but we see the impact in many ways. For example, we discover that our daily newspaper is no longer being delivered. Or we discover that the products we see in stores are becoming increasingly flimsy. Meanwhile, young people are becoming less able to afford cars, homes, and almost everything else.

Furthermore, with limited total energy supply, international fighting

[TITLE]Crude Finishes Higher on Short Covering:
[TEXT]
WTI closed above $60 as shaky Ukraine cease-fire talks kept a risk premium in the market.

Oil gained, finishing the week positive as investors assessed the murky outlook for a cease-fire in Ukraine and as the commodity pushed past an important technical level.

West Texas Intermediate rose 0.7% to settle above $60 a barrel, signaling that a risk premium persists as a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine remains elusive. Ukrainian negotiators continued talks with US officials in Florida for a second day, with Russia objecting to some of the points in a US-backed plan.

The market is watching for progress on a settlement that could lower prices by potentially easing sanctions and boosting Russian oil flows just as an expected oversupply in the market starts to materialize.

But an agreement appears distant: Ukraine took credit for an overnight attack on Russia's Syzran refinery and the Temryuk seaport. Meanwhile, Washington reportedly lobbied European countries in an effort to block a plan to use Moscow's frozen assets to back a massive loan for Ukraine.

Adding to bullish momentum, WTI on Friday settled above its 50-day moving average, a key level of support for the commodity. Prices have also received a boost from algorithmic traders covering some of their bearish positions in recent sessions — and analysts say more buying could materialize in coming weeks.

"This session should mark the first notable short covering program since algo selling activity exhausted itself, and the bar is low for subsequent CTA buying activity to hit the tapes over the coming week," said Dan Ghali, a commodity strategist at TD Securities.

Countering geopolitical risks, oversupply is putting downward pressure on prices globally. Saudi Aramco will reduce the price of its flagship Arab Light crude grade to the lowest level since 2021 for January, while Canadian oil has tumbled. And the number of crude oil rigs in the US rose by 6 over the past week, according to Baker Hughes.

[TITLE]Europe strikes a deal to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027:
[TEXT]
Brussels Reuters —

The European Union agreed Wednesday to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decade-long dependency on Russian energy.

Representatives for EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement in the early hours of Wednesday on proposals set out by the European Commission in June to end shipments from the EU’s former top gas supplier following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move toward a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.

“Today, we are stopping these imports permanently,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement. “By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

For short-term contracts concluded before June 17 this year, the prohibition will apply from April 25, 2026, for LNG and from June 17, 2026, for pipeline gas.

For long-term contracts concluded before June 17, the cut-off dates will be the start of 2027 and the start of October 2026, with a possible one-month extension for EU members facing difficulties reaching required storage levels.

As of October, Russia accounted for 12% of EU gas imports, down from 45% before its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Hungary, France and Belgium among the countries still receiving supplies.

The European Commission is also committed to phasing out remaining oil imports from Russia by the end of 2027, with a legislative proposal to be presented early next year.

Under Wednesday’s agreement, EU members will submit “national diversification plans” regarding oil and gas supplies to the commission by March 1, and will be required to notify the EU executive whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national bans in place.

The commission will issue recommendations based on this feedback.

[TITLE]Too much power, too little grid: Why Adani, NTPC and JSW are forced to cut solar power production:
[TEXT]
Top solar power producers in Rajasthan have dialled down production, after a congested grid prompted the regional regulator to step in. According to three people aware of the matter, Adani Group, NTPC Green, KKR-backed Serentica, EQT-backed Zelestra and JSW Group have had to curtail peak-hour production totalling 5GW in the second half of November alone, leading to potential losses and highlighting the slow pace of transmission capacity addition in the face of frenetic solar power growth.

On 14 November, the Northern Region Load Despatch Centre (NRLDC) cited concerns over grid security to curb the evacuation of power from the plants in Rajasthan. NRLDC said it was restricting a mandatory no-objection certificate due to "evacuation constraints" in Rajasthan, the Indian state with the highest solar power production. Out of the above 23GW capacity at five power pooling stations, with only 18.35GW is available for evacuation, the communication said. The state's total renewable energy capacity stands at over 40GW.

Queries sent to NRLDC and the power companies remained unanswered.

According to one of the three people cited above, there are similar issues at other pooling stations as well. "There is curtailing of up to 50-55% in peak solar hours in some instances," the person said.

At the heart of the matter is the frenetic pace of India's solar power production, while transmission capacity has lagged.

Rahul Mishra, senior vice-president and head of commercial and industrial business, BluPine Energy said: "Rajasthan’s challenge today is that of evacuation. Capacity is built, plants are operational, but the grid cannot absorb and transmit the power because key high-voltage corridors are delayed by 15-24 months." This has led to a spike in power curtailment, and it will likely remain elevated for the next one to two until new infrastructure comes up, he said.

Rajasthan has India's highest solar irradiation and maximum solar days, and curtailing production here casts a long shadow. However, other states aren't spared either. Latest data from Grid Controller of India showed that on 1 December, 4.78GW or

[TITLE]Eastern states driving clean energy transition:
[TEXT]
With rising industrial demand, evolving state policies and growing interest in competitive green power, the Eastern states are set to play a pivotal role in India’s clean-energy trajectory.

Eastern India has been witnessing rapid expansion of renewable infrastructure, supported by state initiatives such as grid strengthening, rooftop solar promotion and storage-ready planning.

Arun Goyal, former Secretary to Government and former member of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission said if India’s Eastern Region has to transform its renewables potential into reliable industrial power, the Government must not only build capacity, but also build connectivity.

Unless intrastate network bottlenecks are resolved and transmission infrastructure modernised with private participation, even the best-capacitated solar or wind projects cannot deliver for commercial and industrial consumers, he said at the event organised by FICCI and CRISIL on Renewable Energy Transition in the Eastern Region.

Pinaki Bhattacharyya, Co-Chair, FICCI Renewable Energy CEOs Committee and Founder, CEO & Managing Director, AMPIN Energy Transition said the eastern region hosts some of India’s biggest load centres and renewables are now among the most cost-effective energy sources for customers.

“With penetration still at 1–18 per cent, the growth opportunity is massive. Our ₹5,000 crore investment outlay across the eastern states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam and Bihar underscores our commitment to powering this transition and strengthening the region’s clean energy future,” said Bhattacharyya.

Arpan Gupta, Director, FICCI said the Eastern region is driving India’s clean energy transition, where technological innovation and industrial ambition are aligning with government vision.

With rising energy demand, expanding open access pathways, the emergence of gigafactories and a growing push for sustainability-led competitiveness, the Eastern region is poised to become one of India’s most dynamic renewable energy markets in the coming decade, he added.

These are quite low right now, but will rise to the level levied on conventional supplies by 2031 if the proposal is adopted. Currently, it is mostly coal-fired plants that step in with extra supplies to meet shortfalls. With the deviation leeway for renewable energy (RE) shortening, these plants will earn more for helping keep the system stable.

Company formally announces engagement of Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo to advise on strategic review focused on supporting positive outcomes for shareholders by potentially providing liquidity and long-term growth for the Company.

focused on supporting positive outcomes for shareholders by potentially providing liquidity and long-term growth for the Company. Greenbacker’s sustainable infrastructure assets contribute to more resilient and secure national energy system; since 2016, Company has generated 13.9 million MWh of energy,1 abated 9.3 million metric tons of carbon,2 conserved nearly 10 billion gallons of water,3 and supported thousands of energy-related jobs,4 while delivering power to communities and businesses across the U.S.

NEW YORK, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company, LLC (“Greenbacker” or the “Company”), an energy transition-focused investment manager and independent power producer (“IPP”), has announced financial results and operational updates for the third quarter of 2025.5

“Greenbacker’s performance this quarter underscores the strength of our core operating fleet and the resilience of our business model,” said Dan de Boer, CEO of Greenbacker. “Our teams not only drove revenue growth but also achieved critical milestones on flagship projects that will power communities for decades to come. These results reflect our commitment to accelerating the energy transition and creating long-term value for our shareholders.”

IPP generates total operating revenue of $52 million in the quarter, representing 3% year-over-year increase, driven by wind and solar PPA revenue of $41 million, as fleets produced 693,000 MWh of power.

Greenbacker generated total operating revenue of $52.2 million within its independent power producer (“IPP”) segment during the third quarter of 2025, as the Company’s wind and solar fleets produced approximately 693 million kWh of clean energy. This was driven by revenue from the long-term power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) in place across the Company’s wind and solar fleets, which generated a combined $40.7 million.

The $52.2 million revenue represents a year-over-year increase of 3%, or approximately $1.7 million of additional revenue in the quarter. This increase occurred despite a 2.3% year-over-year decrease in operating fleet capacity—as Greenbacker continued to advance its strategic focus on scaled clean energy projects via the sale of smaller non-core asset sales. The revenue increase reflects Greenbacker’s strategic timing around the sale of renewable energy credits (“RECs”) generated by its portfolio of renewable energy projects, as well as continued solid performance from the higher-impact assets across the Company’s core operating fleet.

Third-quarter net loss attributable to Greenbacker in 2025 was $(41.6) million, a favorable year-over-year change of 10%, driven by fewer impairment charges in the quarter compared with the prior year. Adjusted EBTIDA6 was $25.2 million, a year-over-year increase $23.2 million. This significant increase was largely the result of the termination and related non-recurring expenses associated with a module supply agreement incurred in 2024, as well as the Company’s ongoing cost reduction efforts, both of which contributed to the significant comparative increase on a year-over-year basis.

Operating Fleet 3Q25 3Q24 YoY Increase (total) YoY Increase (%) Clean power produced by solar assets (MWh) 464,590 471,684 (7,094) (1.5)% PPA revenue generated by solar assets ($M) $ 28.3 $ 28.7 $ (0.3) (1.2)% Clean power produced by wind assets (MWh) 228,003 241,533 (13,530) (5.6)% PPA revenue generated by wind assets ($M) $ 12.4 $ 12.7 $ (0.3) (2.6)% Total clean power generated by wind and solar assets (MWh) 692,511 713,217 (20,706) (2.9)% Total PPA operating revenue generated by wind and solar assets ($M) $ 40.7 $ 41.4 $ (0.7) (1.6)%

Some figures may not add to stated totals due to rounding. Total clean power generated does not include assets in which the Company holds a preferred equity position.

Greenbacker continues to advance review of strategic alternatives designed to support positive outcomes for shareholders and long-term growth for the Company.

As announced earlier this year, the Greenbacker Board of Directors (“Board”) is actively reviewing a full range of operational and financial alternatives aimed at aligning with shareholder interests—including potential liquidity options—and positioning the Company for sustained growth.

To assist with this review, Greenbacker has retained Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo as financial advisors. The strategic review remains ongoing, and the Board is committed to a disciplined, rigorous process focused on creating long-term value for shareholders.
