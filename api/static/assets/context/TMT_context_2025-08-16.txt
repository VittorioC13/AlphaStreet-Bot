[TITLE]Software firm MeridianLink to go private in $2 billion deal with Centerbridge:
[TEXT]
U.S. financial software provider MeridianLink said on Monday it would be acquired by investment firm Centerbridge Partners in a $2 billion deal, taking it private roughly four years after its New York debut.

Optimism around potential rate cuts and easing economic uncertainty amid progress on trade deals have laid the groundwork for a pickup in private-equity buyouts. Dealmaking appetite for software businesses has also remained robust this year.

MeridianLink shareholders will receive $20 apiece in cash for each share held, implying a 26 per cent premium to the stock's last close. Shares of the Irvine, California-based company, which powers digital lending and account opening for financial institutions, jumped 24 per cent in afternoon trading.

"Industry consolidation has been a key theme in fintech and we view the multiple as reasonable," said William Blair analyst Cristopher Kennedy.

"We have long held the belief that MerdianLink would represent an attractive asset as the company generates strong EBITDA margins at around 40 per cent."

The deal also highlights the growing trend of money managers seeking strategic control of technology companies driving digital transformation in financial services.

Centerbridge is also not new to the fintech space, having acquired bank tech firm CSI in a $1.6 billion deal in 2022.

"As the pace of change across the finance and tech sectors continues to accelerate, MeridianLink is uniquely positioned to help financial institutions enhance their digital lending and credit reporting capabilities," said Centerbridge's Jared Hendricks and Ben Jaffe.

Founded in 1998, MeridianLink caters to nearly 2,000 community financial institutions and reporting agencies. Its revenue rose 8 per cent to $84.6 million during the three months ended June 30, while net loss narrowed to $3 million.

Centerview Partners and J.P. Morgan are advisers to MeridianLink on the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Goldman Sachs is advising Centerbridge.

[TITLE]4 M&A trends keeping bankers busy this summer: JPMorgan:

Forget summer Fridays.

The notion of "summer lull" has been gone from Wall Street since the pandemic, said Anu Aiyengar, global head of advisory and M&A at JPMorgan Chase. And it's never been more true than now: M&A activity has been rebounding even amid fears that Trump's trade wars could slow the economy.

"The last week of May and June and early July have all been pretty active with a good cadence of deal announcements," Aiyengar told Business Insider. "And more importantly, our pipeline and conversations continue to be active as well."

The bank on Wednesday released a report showing that M&A in the first half of the year hit its highest levels since 2022, driven largely by large deals. Here are four of the top trends keeping bankers busy as we head into a not-so-sleepy August:

Bigger is better

JPMorgan said total deal volume soared 27% to $2.2 trillion in the first half of 2025, including a 57% increase in deals over $10 billion.

Deals over $1 billion rose 72% — a 20-year high, the bank said.

Sector by sector

The bank said 7 out of 9 sectors saw double-digit volume growth, including:

Financial institutions (+56%)

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

Media & communications (+51%)

Diversified Industries (+41%)

M&A volumes seemed to favor technology (23%) and diversified industries (22%), the bank said.

Pie chart JPMorgan

Private equity dealmaking

Private equity firms, known in M&A parlance as financial sponsors, have ramped up dealmaking, leading to $168 billion in take-private deals in the first half of 2025, the highest levels since 2022, the bank said.

Four mega-deals accounted for more than 50% of that volume—indicating a highly concentrated but aggressive deployment of capital.

Minority stakes

Sponsors increased their minority stake transactions, especially in high-growth sectors. Sponsor-led minority deals rose 34% year-over-year and were 9% above the 10-year average of $81 billion.

A substantial share—35% of these deals—were in technology, driven by investments in AI, compute infrastructure, and data center capabilities.

Millicom (Tigo) Reaches Strategic Agreement with EPM to facilitate Merger Process with ColTel

Luxembourg, August 14, 2025 – Millicom (Tigo) today announced a key agreement with Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM) that advances its acquisition strategy in Colombia and unlocks a path toward the integration of Tigo-UNE and Colombia Telecomunicaciones (ColTel).

Under the terms of the agreement:

Millicom has committed to present an offer in EPM’s Law 226 sale process, subject to the terms published by EPM on July 1, 2025, in which EPM set a minimum price of COP$418,741 per share of Tigo-UNE, representing a total consideration of approximately USD $520 million.

The agreement includes customary legal protections and EPM secured an extension of its existing exit rights if the Law 226 sale process does not succeed due to external factors.

Should EPM remain a shareholder of Tigo-UNE due to an unsuccessful Law 226 sale process, EPM has agreed to provide consent for the proposed future merger between Tigo-UNE and ColTel, subject to certain closing conditions.

As part of the transaction, Millicom will re-include Tigo-UNE in Millicom’s Restricted Group, reflecting the company’s renewed strategic commitment to the market.

“This agreement marks an important milestone for Millicom’s strategy in Colombia”, said Marcelo Benitez, CEO of Millicom. “We are moving decisively with our integration plans while reaffirming our commitment to long-term investment in Colombia’s digital ecosystem and infrastructure”

[TITLE]Actelis Networks Reports Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results and Operational Update:
[TEXT]
FREMONT, Calif., Aug. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Actelis Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASNS) ("Actelis" or the "Company"), a market leader in cyber-hardened, rapid deployment networking solutions for IoT and broadband applications, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.

"We navigated a dynamic market environment in the second quarter, while laying the groundwork for improved growth ahead, primarily in our Federal and Military verticals where we are awaiting sizeable business that was delayed in Q2 and is expected in Q3. In addition, we have accelerated and expanded our MDU market penetration efforts in more countries and more verticals,”, said Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. “We grew 31% in revenues sequentially vs. Q1 and we are executing multiple comprehensive growth initiatives. We secured several major wins that validate our long-term strategy, including our first major US telecommunications carrier customer for MDU solutions. We strengthened our sales leadership and focus on the US market and especially on the Federal/Military and Local Government markets with our new hire of Chief Revenue Officer for the Americas, Mark DeVol, and Director of US Federal Sales Jason Chasse.

“We are adopting a plan to restructure the company, with increased focus on the more valuable and fast-growing markets and geographies, contributing to profitable growth while building a more efficient, AI-enabled, automated organization. We will elaborate further on this plan here and in the next few weeks. With the significant deals in our pipeline, our new sales leadership talent and focus, the progress we are making in the MDU markets with customers and partners, and the restructuring of the company towards efficiency and growth, we are positioned for sustainable growth. "

Second Quarter and First Half 2025 Financial Highlights:

Sequential Revenue Growth: Revenues reached $0.94 million in Q2 2025, representing a 31% sequential increase from Q1 2025. For the first half of 2025, revenue was $1.7 million compared to $4.16 million in the prior year period. The decline is associated with a software and services renewal last year, which occurs every two years, and will be up for renewal in 2027, as well as a large deal to the City of Washington D.C. last year, while 2025 revenues are more backend loaded.

The temporary margin compression reflects the prior year software and services renewal not repeatable until 2027, and volume decline impacting fixed indirect costs as a percentage of revenues, while direct margin largely stayed the same.

Loss Per Share: Net loss per share for Q2-2025 was $(0.21) compared to $(0.01) in the prior year period, due primarily to lower revenues. Net loss per share decreased 16% to $(0.43) for the first half of 2025 compared to $(0.51) in the corresponding 2024 period, reflecting continued progress toward profitability.

Recent Business and Operational Highlights:

It is focused on enabling top-line growth and will take a 6-9 months to complete, encompassing automation, functional structure and personnel changes, AI integration, offshoring, and outsourcing.

Enhanced Treasury Strategy: Board approved cryptocurrency treasury management strategy in August 2025, authorizing strategic allocation to established digital assets as part of enhanced capital allocation framework for long-term shareholder value creation.

"We continue to strengthen our financial foundation through disciplined operational capital management," said Yoav Efron, Deputy CEO and CFO of Actelis. "We continue to keep our debt very low , I’m looking forward to seeing the restructuring plan we are starting to enable faster growth, and the associated 15-20% cost reduction will create sustainable operational leverage towards breaking even. Despite temporary margin pressures from the sales delays we maintained disciplined expense management resulting in operating costs essentially flat year-over-year when adjusted for currency impacts. The significant reduction in interest expenses reflects our improved debt situation and our new cryptocurrency treasury strategy may open additional financial flexibility. As we execute our restructuring plan over the next 6-9 months, we expect to emerge as a more efficient, scalable organization positioned to see significant growth in our target verticals."

Fiscal Second Quarter and First Half 2025 Financial Results:

Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2025, amounted to $941,000, compared to $3.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the first half of 2025, revenues totaled $1.7 million, compared to $4.2 million in the same period in 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in revenue from North America and the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region.

Cost of revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2025, amounted to $636,000 compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the first half of 2025, the cost of revenues was $1.1 million, compared to $2 million for the first half of 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decline in sales.

Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2025, amounted to $305,000 compared to $1.94 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the first half of 2025, gross profit is $556,000 compared to $2.16 million in the first half of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to increased indirect costs.

Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2025, amounted to $675,000 compared to $603,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the first half of 2025, R&D expenses were $1.36 million, compared to $1.25 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a rise in the utilization of professional services for our GL900 product line and exchange rate differences.

Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2025, amounted to $700,000 compared to $647,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the first half of 2025, these expenses totaled $1.37 million compared to $1.28 million in the first half of 2024. The increase was primarily due to payroll expenses and engaging consultants to expand market reach in different countries in Europe and Asia.

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2025, amounted to $703,000 compared to $790,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the first half of 2025, G&A expenses were $1.42 million, compared to $1.61 million for the same period last year. The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken.

Operating loss for the three months ended June 30, 2025, was $1.77 million, compared to an operating profit of $66,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the first half of 2025, the operating loss was $3.6 million compared to $1.8 million in the first half of 2024. The increase is due to the decline in sales, while operating expenditures remained consistent. The effects of exchange rate fluctuations and increased vacation expenses have contributed to the increase in operating loss.

Financial expenses and interest expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2025, were $128,000 (including $22,000 interest expenses) compared to $144,000 (including $137,000 interest expenses) for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the first half of 2025, financial expenses and interest expenses were $176,000 (including $56,000 interest expenses), compared to $259,000 (including $344,000 interest expenses) for the first half of 2024. The decrease is mainly due to repayment of loans, reducing interest expenses and other bank-related charges.

Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2025, was $1.9 million, compared to net loss of $78,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the first half of 2025, the net loss was $3.8 million, compared to a net loss of $2 million in the first half of 2024. The increase in net loss is due to lower sales and exchange rate effects.

Adjusted EBITDA loss, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance (reconciled below to Net Loss), for the three months ended June 30, 2025, was $1.7 million, compared to profit of $11,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the first half of 2025, non-GAAP EBITDA loss was $3.5 million compared to $1.8 million in the year ago period.

[TITLE]Netflix Closes 2025 Upfront With Ad Commitments More Than Doubling:
[TEXT]
Netflix has closed its 2025 upfront negotiations, with overall commitments more than doubling — in line with internal expectations. The company declined to provide hard numbers.

The streamer touted year-over-year growth in key categories such as retail, consumer packaged goods, telecommunications, health & wellness, entertainment and technology. Its 2025-26 slate includes the final season of “Stranger Things,” new seasons of “Bridgerton,” “Emily in Paris,” “Nobody Wants This” and “Running Point” and the untitled Will Ferrell-led golf series.

It also said it has sold out all available in-game inventory for its pair of NFL Christmas Day games and closed sponsorships for the event with partners including Accenture, FanDuel, Google and Verizon on in-game and broadcast features. Additionally, Netflix will partner with DoorDash as the presenting sponsor for the 2025-26 season of “WWE Raw.”

In May, Netflix revealed that its ad tier, which accounts for over 50% of new sign-ups in the 12 markets where its available, surpassed 94 million monthly active users. The company raised the price on the ad tier for the first time in January to $7.99 per month.

Netflix’s in-house ad-tech platform has also rolled out in all markets where the ad tier is available. Additionally, the company previously unveiled new interactive midroll and pause ad formats incorporating generative AI, which will be available by 2026 in all ad-supported markets, and inked partnerships with Yahoo DSP, iSpot, Australia’s OzTAM and Kantar IBOPE Media.

The company continues to expect that it will roughly double ads revenue in 2025 as it scales its ad-supported offering.

“We are committed to building a long-lasting ads business that not only drives impactful return on investment for our clients but also offers an entertaining and relevant experience for our members around the world,” Netflix ad president Amy Reinhard said in a statement. “As we head into our third year of business this fall, we can’t wait to continue to deliver a must-buy opportunity with leading technology centered around our must-watch Netflix series, films and live events.”

Netflix is the latest to close its upfront negotiations. TelevisaUnivision touted “historic” volume driven by its ViX streaming service, which recently surpassed 10 million subscribers globally. However, overall volume was flat compared with the previous year.

Disney, which touted increased sales in sports and streaming, also saw overall volume consistent with the previous year. Streaming accounted for over 40% of total upfront volume, while sports ad volume across linear and addressable hit nearly $4 billion.

Fox exceeded $2 billion in upfront revenue on core properties, excluding the World Cup, representing double-digit growth year-over-year. It also saw Tubi’s volume of upfront ad dollars committed grow by 35% year-over-year.

NBCUniversal saw a 15% increase in commitments across its broadcast offerings, including news, sports and entertainment, and touted its largest digital upfront and strongest sports upfront in history, though it offered no hard numbers.

Peacock saw an over 20% year-over-year increase, representing nearly a third of the media giant’s total upfront commitments. The company’s new 11-year media rights deal with the NBA contributed to a 20% increase in new clients compared to the 2024-25 season and a 45% year-over-year increase in volume. Over 25% of NBCUniversal’s NBA advertisers will be new to broadcast this year. Bravo represented nearly 20% of the company’s entire entertainment demand across broadcast and cable and Versant saw a nearly 10% increase in clients investing in its brands.

Forget summer Fridays.

The notion of "summer lull" has been gone from Wall Street since the pandemic, said Anu Aiyengar, global head of advisory and M&A at JPMorgan Chase. And it's never been more true than now: M&A activity has been rebounding even amid fears that Trump's trade wars could slow the economy.

"The last week of May and June and early July have all been pretty active with a good cadence of deal announcements," Aiyengar told Business Insider. "And more importantly, our pipeline and conversations continue to be active as well."

The bank on Wednesday released a report showing that M&A in the first half of the year hit its highest levels since 2022, driven largely by large deals. Here are four of the top trends keeping bankers busy as we head into a not-so-sleepy August:

Bigger is better

JPMorgan said total deal volume soared 27% to $2.2 trillion in the first half of 2025, including a 57% increase in deals over $10 billion.

Deals over $1 billion rose 72% — a 20-year high, the bank said.

Sector by sector

The bank said 7 out of 9 sectors saw double-digit volume growth, including:

Financial institutions (+56%)

M&A volumes seemed to favor technology (23%) and diversified industries (22%), the bank said.

Private equity dealmaking

Private equity firms, known in M&A parlance as financial sponsors, have ramped up dealmaking, leading to $168 billion in take-private deals in the first half of 2025, the highest levels since 2022, the bank said.

Four mega-deals accounted for more than 50% of that volume—indicating a highly concentrated but aggressive deployment of capital.

Minority stakes

Sponsors increased their minority stake transactions, especially in high-growth sectors. Sponsor-led minority deals rose 34% year-over-year and were 9% above the 10-year average of $81 billion.

A substantial share—35% of these deals—were in technology, driven by investments in AI, compute infrastructure, and data center capabilities.
