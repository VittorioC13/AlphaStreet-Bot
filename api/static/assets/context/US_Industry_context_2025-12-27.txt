[TITLE]Consumer goods play: Bharti, Warburg buy 49% stake in Haier India for $2 bn:
[TEXT]
For Chinese firms, there are very few opportunities in India to get a strategic partner in a financial investment capacity. "The last time we saw something this big happen was the MG-JSW deal," this person added. In March 2024, a clutch of Indian investors, led by billionaire Sajjan Jindal’s conglomerate, picked up 51% of MG Motor India to create JSW MG Motor India Pvt. Ltd. China’s SAIC Motor Corp. until then owned 100% in the maker of Hector and Windsor cars. Deal details were not disclosed then.

[TITLE]Samsung Biologics to Acquire First U.S. Drug Manufacturing Facility in $280M Deal – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
A South Korean biomanufacturing giant is set to purchase its first drug production facility in the U.S. for a sum worthy of its tech giant parent.

Samsung Biologics’ American subsidiary will pay $280 million to acquire biopharmaceutical company Human Genome Sciences from GSK, in a deal expected to close early next year. The deal secures Samsung Biologics’ first manufacturing base in the U.S., at a two-building campus in Rockville, Md., with a combined 60,000 liters of capacity.

Samsung Biologics is the world’s largest contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) by capacity, with 785,000 liters of current capacity across its two major biomanufacturing campuses in Incheon, South Korea. The company specializes in monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, mRNA therapies and next-generation treatments.

The Maryland industrial/life sciences campus at 9911 Belward Campus Drive will support the production of both clinical and commercial production of pharmaceuticals. Samsung Biologics is expected to retain 500 employees at the sites. The company also plans to further upgrade the facilities and bolster their production capacity.

“This landmark acquisition is a testament to our unwavering commitment to advancing global healthcare and bolstering our manufacturing capabilities in the U.S.,” John Rim, Samsung Biologics president and CEO, said in a statement. “The investment will enable us to deepen our collaboration with federal, state and local stakeholders to best serve our customers and partners while ensuring a reliable and stable supply of life-saving therapeutics.”

The Maryland Life Sciences Corridor, between Rockville, Gaithersburg and East Baltimore — as well as the DMV in general — is among the country’s largest hubs of biotechnology development. Frederick, Md.-based developer Matan Companies earlier this month, for example, secured a 161,500-square-foot lease with Montgomery County Public Schools at the landlord’s two-building industrial/life sciences complex in Gaithersburg. Though it wasn’t immediately clear how the school system plans to use the facility.

AstraZeneca in July meanwhile announced a $50 billion boost to its U.S. investments by 2030. Chief among the pharma giant’s plans is a new $4.5 billion manufacturing facility in Albemarle County, Va., its largest ever built. AstraZeneca will also use the funds to expand its already 1.3 million-square-foot life sciences campus in Gaithersburg, not far from the property owned by Matan. GSK made a similar, $30 billion investment pledge in September.

“Along with GSK’s recent commitment to invest $30 billion in R&D and manufacturing in the US over the next five years, the [Samsung Biologics] deal enables us to further focus on building the agility, capacity and capability needed in our manufacturing network to deliver the next generation of specialty medicines and vaccines. I am confident in a positive partnership and future for the Rockville site,” Regis Simard, GSK’s president of global supply chain, said in a statement.

MatX, PolyX, FFoodi, Spark Labs, ISG Intelligence, and Gilboa Nexus selected to lead accelerators under “Transition from Manufacturing to Development” program

JERUSALEM, ISRAEL, December 24, 2025 / EINPresswire.com / -- The Israel Innovation Authority announced today the selection of six winners through a competitive procedure for the establishment and operation of MOFET accelerators. These accelerators will assist in advancing breakthrough research and development in the manufacturing industry, under the new “Transition from Manufacturing to Development” program of the MOFET Fund.

The initiative, the first of its kind in Israel, is designed to drive structural transformation across Israeli industry by pairing advanced, market-oriented technological development with robust industrial manufacturing infrastructure. Through this combined approach, the program seeks to help manufacturing companies build advanced R&D capabilities and strengthen their competitiveness in global markets.

The selected accelerators will serve as dedicated professional support entities for manufacturing companies, providing complementary R&D infrastructure and hands-on guidance across the product development journey. Support will span market mapping, opportunity identification and ideation; techno-economic feasibility validation; prototype development and piloting; and the development of market-ready industrial products, including preparation for entry into international markets.

The Israel Innovation Authority’s total investment in the establishment and operation of the accelerators amounts to approximately NIS 30 million. The program is intended for manufacturing companies whose core activity is based on manufacturing in Israel and whose R&D investment is below 7% of annual turnover, enabling a meaningful shift toward R&D-oriented industrial activity.

A study conducted by the Israel Innovation Authority found that a key barrier to expanding R&D in these companies is the absence of a structured process for building product strategy, alongside insufficient dedicated R&D infrastructure. The MOFET accelerators are designed to close these gaps by providing both practical tools and sustained professional support throughout product development.

Dror Bin, CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, said: “The objective of the MOFET accelerators is to accelerate the transformation of manufacturing-oriented companies into companies that conduct R&D, namely, into high-tech companies, and to support them throughout all stages of this journey, from ideation to the development of a globally competitive innovative product. Over time, the ability of Israel’s manufacturing companies to compete with global industry leaders depends on technological innovation and the development of breakthrough products.”

Through the accelerators, participating companies will be exposed to innovative solutions and advanced technologies, including access to leading researchers and domain experts; physical infrastructure for experimentation and techno-economic feasibility testing; as well as comprehensive business support for company management during the development of technological products. The program will also help companies build in-house R&D capacity, train leadership and teams, and connect to strategic partnerships, investors, and additional stakeholders in Israel and globally.

The selected consortia include partnerships with leading strategic consulting firms, such as EY, Shaldor Consulting, Arieli Group, and Goldratt Group, as well as prominent investors including Dr. Shimon Eckhouse (founder of the Alon MedTech Ventures incubator and the global medical aesthetics companies Lumenis and Syneron), Shani Shenhav Group (supporting operations and investment activity with approximately 4,000 clients worldwide), Amir Zaidman (co-founder of The Kitchen Foodtech Hub incubator), and Dagan Eshel (co-founder of the Alpha Strauss initiative). The program also brings together R&D laboratories and academic institutions, including the Institute for Advanced Materials at the Technion, the Plastics and Rubber Center at Shenkar, Daron Laboratories, Taga, FoodLab, PlasticApp by Kafrit, and Gevasol Group.

Companies seeking to participate in the new “Transition from Manufacturing to Development” program may do so through three flexible and independent stages: Ideation, Techno-economic Feasibility, and Product Development. Companies are not required to complete all stages and may enter the program at any stage based on their business and technological needs, while receiving close professional support from the selected accelerators.

[TITLE]Private capital reshapes Chennai’s public bus services in three years: World Bank:
[TEXT]
Many new buses, including electric, are now plying on the Chennai roads. This is thanks to a three-stage blueprint - Plan, Contract, Leverage Private Sector Partners - embedded in the Chennai City Partnership Program launched in 2022. This was supported by the World Bank Group and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The approach created a bankable market for electric buses through structured contracts, said a World Bank blog.

Three years ago, Chennai’s commuters were moving away from public buses, and its transport authority was grappling with falling ridership, a shrinking fleet, and eroding public trust. However the blog said that currently the city has not only turned the situation around but has also won India’s top urban transport award from the Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs – the “City with the Best Public Transport System”. This is an accolade Chennai can be justly proud of.

The transformation wasn’t accidental. The city had the vision to reimagine public transport and the courage to challenge the status quo. Importantly, it attracted private investment, helping to transform the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) from a State-owned operator waiting for bailouts into a performance-driven service provider. MTC now carries 3.5 million passengers daily, tracks customer satisfaction, and MTC is in the process of deploying more than 1,000 privately financed electric buses, says the blog.

In 2021, the State government set a 10-year Business Plan launched in July 2023 with plans to double the fleet from 3,450 to 7,500 buses by 2032 (two-thirds electric); lift daily boardings from 2.8 million to 5.3 million, and track customer satisfaction through annual surveys and open data.

north star for reforms

This plan became the north star for reforms and was embedded in Chennai’s revised multimodal Comprehensive Mobility Plan (November 2025). It created a common language for government, MTC, financiers, and citizens - essential for attracting private investment, the blog said.

Chennai avoided that trap by signing India’s first Public Transport Service Contract (PTSC) in October 2023 - a five-year rolling agreement with performance-linked Viability Gap Funding (VGF) replacing ad-hoc subsidies, the blog said.

Chennai tackled its biggest challenge of increasing the number of buses in an affordable manner by with Gross Cost Contracts (GCC) that shifted capital responsibility to private operators while retaining public control over service design and fares.

Under GCC, private operators finance, procure, operate, and maintain buses, earning fixed per-km payments, while MTC retains fare policy and revenue collection—protecting affordability and social programs such as free travel for women.

As a result, $150 million in private capital mobilised under those contracts —one of South Asia’s largest urban e-bus procurements; 18–20 percent lower costs than in-house operations, locking in $620 million savings over 12 years, which can be reinvested in service expansion and passenger amenities.

The government procured 1,025 electric buses and associated services awarded through competitive bidding.

This was made possible with the State government adopted a bankable concession model, backed by payment security and predictable VGF flows under PTSC - giving investors confidence in a sector long deemed “unbankable,” the blog said.

The State government is also following an asset light model in procuring buses. Ashok Leyland’s subsidiary OHM Global Mobility in October 2024 won a contract to supply and operate 500 electric buses for Chennai’s Metropolitan Transport Corporation. The 12-year contract includes 400 non-AC and 100 AC buses.

Switch Mobility, another Ashok Leyland subsidiary, will manufacture the buses using its EiV12 model. OHM will handle operations and maintenance throughout the contract period.

Shenu Agarwal, MD & CEO, Ashok Leyland, which is a major player in supplying vehicles to MTC, said Chennai’s recognition as India’s best public transport system reflects a bold vision and inclusive approach to urban mobility that brings citizens, government and private partners together.

“As a proud homegrown brand, Ashok Leyland has been part of this journey, supplying reliable and sustainable buses that help transform public transport, support the electrification of fleets, and make daily commutes cleaner and more efficient. We remain committed to supporting cities across the country in building resilient, inclusive and future-ready public transport systems,” he told businessline.

[TITLE]NC economy looks steady, but worrying signs are under surface:
[TEXT]
As we close out the year and plan for 2026, North Carolina occupies an enviable space in the national economic landscape.

Job announcements continue. Consumers are still spending. Markets remain elevated. On the surface, the state looks steady, even strong. But beneath that stability are signals that deserve more careful attention — signals that help explain why confidence feels fragile even when the data looks fine.

I’ve spent much of this year speaking with economists, investors, and business leaders to better understand that disconnect. Two recent conversations stood out.

One was with Dr. Matthew Martin, regional executive at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The other was with Theodore Hicks, chief investment officer of Hicks & Associates Wealth Management and a board member of the John Locke Foundation. Together, their perspectives help translate national forces into what North Carolinians are actually experiencing.

Martin’s assessment of the broader economy was calm and grounded. Inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, but well below the post-pandemic highs. Unemployment sits near what economists consider full employment.

From a macro view, the economy is holding up. At the micro level, North Carolina consistently outperforms most of the country, benefiting from population growth, capital investment, and a seemingly never-ending pipeline of new jobs.

Yet Martin was equally clear that the labor market has changed over the past year. Employers are moderating hiring new people, but they aren’t laying people off in large numbers either. We’ve entered a low-hire, low-fire environment. Workers are staying put.

He described it as “job hugging” — people holding onto what they have rather than taking risks. That dynamic allows unemployment to remain low, but it also limits wage growth and economic mobility.

This also explains why consumer spending is resilient even as households feel stretched. Most household spending is tied to recurring obligations — rent/mortgage, transportation, food, utilities. As long as people are employed, that spending continues. But the strain shows up elsewhere.

Martin pointed to elevated delinquencies in credit cards and auto loans, particularly for vehicles purchased during the high-price period of 2021 and 2022. This isn’t a replay of 2008. Mortgage delinquencies remain relatively low. Still, it signals that many households are operating with less margin than the topline numbers suggest.

From the investment side, Hicks offered a complementary lens. His focus is not on narratives, but on evidence. Markets, he argues, often move ahead of fundamentals or in narrow ways that don’t reflect broad economic health.

[TITLE]Vingroup Signs Strategic Cooperation with The Government of Uzbekistan, Opening Large-Scale Investment Opportunities in Central Asia:
[TEXT]
HANOI, VIETNAM – Media OutReach Newswire – 25 December 2025 – Vingroup announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of Investment, Industry and Trade of the Republic of Uzbekistan to promote cooperation and implement multi-sector projects in Uzbekistan. The agreement marks the beginning of a long-term cooperation plan between the two sides across multiple key sectors, while opening large-scale investment opportunities for the Vietnamese corporation in Central Asia, contributing to the strengthening of economic and investment ties between Vietnam and Uzbekistan.

Under the MOU, the two parties agreed to jointly study and develop strategic cooperation opportunities in areas such as urban development, sustainable transportation, tourism and leisure infrastructure, as well as other investment projects aligned with Uzbekistan’s development orientation, affirming the scale and capabilities of Vietnamese enterprises on the global economic map.

Specifically, in the area of urban development, Uzbekistan is ready to allocate approximately 1,000 hectares of land in a prime location of the capital Tashkent for Vingroup to study, propose, and invest in the development of a large-scale, integrated urban complex. The project would include residential areas, living infrastructure, commercial and cultural facilities, and public infrastructure facilities. The development is envisioned to form a “Vietnam Town”, creating a modern and sustainable urban landmark while enhancing cultural exchange and economic cooperation between the two countries.

In the field of sustainable transportation, Vingroup has proposed studying the deployment of electric taxi and urban mobility services using VinFast electric vehicles in Uzbekistan, together with a charging infrastructure system and support services. The project is expected to contribute to the green transition, reduce emissions, and improve the quality of urban transportation services in major Uzbek cities.

In tourism and leisure infrastructure, the two sides will explore the potential development of integrated tourism and recreational center, including entertainment facilities, hotels, golf courses and related tourism infrastructure, aiming to unlock tourism potential and enhance Uzbekistan’s attractiveness to international visitors.

In addition, this strategic cooperation also establishes a framework for the two parties to identify, assess, and select other potential investment projects that align with the development strategies and long-term priorities of each side.

On the Uzbek government’s side, the Ministry of Investment, Industry and Trade committed to supporting Vingroup by providing information on the investment environment, legal framework, and incentive policies, as well as coordinating with relevant authorities and local governments in project preparation, including land allocation, licensing, and access to investment support mechanisms in accordance with legislation.

On Vingroup’s side, the Group will propose conceptual proposals, technical expertise and investment plans, participate in feasibility studies and project structuring, and mobilize member companies within the Vingroup ecosystem to implement suitable projects in Uzbekistan.

Mr. Kasimov Ilzat Ablaxatovich, Deputy Minister of Investment, Industry and Trade of Uzbekistan, stated: “We welcome Vingroup’s interest and commitment to cooperation in Uzbekistan. With its experience in urban development, sustainable transportation, and infrastructure projects, Vingroup is considered a strategic partner to jointly explore and implement investment initiatives aligned with Uzbekistan’s socio-economic development priorities in the coming period.”

Mr. Nguyen Viet Quang, Vice Chairman and CEO of Vingroup, shared: “Uzbekistan is a market with strong potential, supported by a clear development direction and an improving investment environment. Through this Memorandum of Understanding, Vingroup aims to gradually explore suitable cooperation opportunities and work alongside the Government of Uzbekistan in developing urban areas, sustainable transportation, and sectors that bring positive contributions to local communities.”

Uzbekistan holds a strategic position in Central Asia, with a growing economy and strong potential in urban development, infrastructure, tourism, and services. The Government of Uzbekistan is actively promoting reforms and attracting foreign investment to drive sustainable economic growth and international integration.

Vingroup is Vietnam’s leading private multi-sector corporation, operating across six core pillars: Industrials & Technology, Real Estate & Services, Infrastructure, Green Energy, Culture, and Social Enterprises, with the vision “To create a better life for people”. With its proven reputation, scale and capabilities, Vingroup is steadily expanding globally, contributing to elevate the global standing of Vietnamese enterprises.

[TITLE]Stardust Power Secures Financing To Advance Oklahoma Lithium Refinery Toward Construction:
[TEXT]
GREENWICH, Conn., Dec. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stardust Power Inc. (NASDAQ: SDST) (“Stardust Power” or “the Company”), an American developer of battery-grade lithium carbonate, today announced it has executed a Securities Purchase Agreement with a single institutional investor providing for up to $15.0 million in senior secured convertible debt financing to support early-stage construction activities at its lithium refinery project in Muskogee, Oklahoma.

The facility includes an initial $4.0 million drawdown and provides the Company with flexible capital to advance detailed engineering, infrastructure, and procurement activities as it progresses toward construction. The financing has a 24-month term, includes an initial repayment moratorium, and provides the Company with the option to repay the facility in cash or common stock. The facility is intended to support near-term development activities and may serve as bridge financing as the Company advances toward project-level construction financing.

“This facility marks an important step as we prepare for construction and provides optionality and meaningful flexibility as we execute the next phase of the Muskogee project,” said Roshan Pujari, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Stardust Power. “We are building a robust capital stack with flexibility and shareholder value in mind and are focused on keeping our capital structure aligned with upcoming project milestones.”

The Company plans to fund construction of its 50,000 metric ton per annum refinery through a combination of asset-level equity and asset-level debt financing, designed to minimize public equity dilution and maximize shareholder value, with early stage investor engagement reflecting interest in the project’s shovel-ready status.

[TITLE]BMO Capital Sees Impressive Guidance and Construction Cloud Momentum at Autodesk (ADSK):
[TEXT]
Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) is one of the best growth stocks to buy in 2026. On November 26, BMO Capital raised the firm’s price target on Autodesk to $343 from $333 and kept a Market Perform rating on the shares. Despite a difficult sales environment, Autodesk delivered strong Q3 2025 results marked by improving growth and impressive Q4 guidance. BMO Capital remains optimistic due to the continued success of Construction Cloud and the company’s ongoing efforts to unify siloed workflows for its industrial and construction clients.

A day before this rating, the company announced its Q3 2025 earnings results. Autodesk reported non-GAAP EPS of $2.67, which exceeded analyst expectations of $2.50. Total revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $1.85 billion. This performance was supported by a $124 million contribution from the company’s new transaction model; excluding this impact and currency fluctuations, underlying revenue growth remained a healthy 12%.

BMO Capital Sees Impressive Guidance and Construction Cloud Momentum at Autodesk (ADSK)

Strategic momentum at Autodesk was driven by the convergence of design and make workflows within the Autodesk Construction Cloud/ACC and the integration of AI-powered automations. In the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations/AECO segment, revenue remained strong as investments in data centers and infrastructure offset softness in commercial sectors. Management highlighted that AI adoption is yielding tangible productivity gains, noting that the acceptance rate for AI-powered auto-constraints in Fusion has surpassed 60%, with 90% of those sketches becoming fully constrained.

Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) provides 3D design, engineering, and entertainment technology solutions worldwide.

While we acknowledge the potential of ADSK as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
