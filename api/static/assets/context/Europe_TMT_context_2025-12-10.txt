[TITLE]Paramount rips Warner’s sale ‘process’ as it reveals 2-year-long pursuit before going hostile:
[TEXT]
Paramount Skydance’s tender offer for Warner Bros. Discovery emerged from months of fitful courtship, a shifting media landscape, and a high‑stakes bidding war that ultimately pitted the studio behind Top Gun: Maverick against streaming giant Netflix for control of one of Hollywood’s crown jewels. The company’s tender offer regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed hours after Paramount launched a hostile bid worth $108 billion (or $77.9 billion in equity), laid out a detailed chronology in which Paramount repeatedly tried to lure Warner Bros., to no avail. Netflix and Warner Bros. agreed to a deal worth nearly $83 billion ($72 billion in equity) on Friday.

The filing revealed Paramount CEO David Ellison’s last-ditch text message to WBD counterpart David Zaslav at roughly 4 p.m. ET on Dec. 4, the day before Netflix ultimately announced its deal, as previously reported by the Financial Times. “Daivd [sic], I appreciate you’re underwater today so I wanted to send you a quick text. Please note when you next meet as a board we wanted to offer you a package that addressed all of the issues you discussed we [sic] me,” Ellison wrote as he apparently felt his target slipping away.

“Also please know despite the noise of the last 24 hours I have nothing but respect and admiration for you and the company,” Ellison added. Referencing a meeting he and his father, the centibillionaire and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, had with Zaslav, he continued: “It would be the honor of a lifetime to be your partner and to be the owner of these iconic assets. If we have the privilege to work together you will see that my father and I are the people you had dinner with. We are always loyal and honorable to our partners and hope we have the opportunity to prove that to you. Best, David.” Later that day, Paramount sent Zaslav a letter criticizing a “tainted” sale process.

Paramount told investors today that it continued to believe its bid was never taken seriously. “During the entirety of the sale ‘process’ undertaken by the Warner Bros. board, representatives of Warner Bros. did not provide a single markup of a single transaction document, have a single meeting to go page-by-page through the documents, or engage in a ‘real time’ back-and-forth negotiation with Paramount or its advisors.”

Calls to Paramount, WBD, and Netflix to comment on the events as laid out in the filing were not immediately returned. We will update this post with any response.

Early outreach in 2023

[TITLE]Robinhood launches staking for Ethereum and Solana in ongoing crypto expansion:
[TEXT]
Robinhood is doubling down on crypto offerings. The trading app will launch staking for Ethereum and Solana in New York starting on Tuesday, according to the company, allowing customers to earn yield on cryptocurrency.

The company will let customers stake in New York and plans to expand across the country. “We’re proud of the momentum we’ve seen with staking and especially excited that staking is now available to customers in New York, which has one of the most rigorous regulatory frameworks in the country,” wrote Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto, in a note to Fortune.

Staking has been part of the crypto universe for nearly a decade, rewarding users who lock up a stash of tokens in order to help operate a blockchain network. But uncertainty over its legal status has meant it has been mostly experienced crypto users who have engaged in it using their own wallets.

In 2023, the exchange Kraken agreed to pay $30 million to settle allegations that it broke the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules by offering staking. Robinhood’s launching of crypto stakes reflects a looser regulatory environment under President Donald Trump’s administration.

“These crypto enhancements are strategic chess moves positioning Robinhood for the anticipated transformation of financial infrastructure through blockchain technology and tokenization—particularly with the regulatory clarity we expect under the current administration,” said Caydee Blankenship, senior equity research analyst at CFRA Research.

Robinhood also announced a push into global crypto markets. In Europe, it will add perpetual futures contracts on several coins, and it will also enter the Indonesian market, as it agreed to buy a brokerage and crypto platform in the country.

Robinhood is not new to crypto, as users on the platform have been able to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2018. However, the company has beefed up its crypto arm this year. In June, Robinhood completed a $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, the world’s longest-running crypto exchange. Crypto transactions accounted for more than 21% of the company’s revenue, as of last month’s earnings report.

Robinhood’s expansion of its digital assets could help it challenge other crypto exchanges, according to Romeo Alvarez, research analyst at William O’Neil. “Robinhood is stepping up its efforts to compete on a global basis with larger trading platforms like Coinbase, Binance, OKX, and Kraken,” he said.

The past few days have seen other big banks vie for staking. On Friday, BlackRock filed for a stake Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB). The Wall Street giant already has an Ethereum ETF (ETHA), but that one does not have staking components.

[TITLE]Mama’s Creations Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
Revenues Grow 50% YoY to $47.3 Million, Driven by Double-Digit Organic Sales Momentum and Integration of Crown 1 Asset Acquisition

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama’s Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025.

Financial Summary:

Three Months Ended

October 31, $ in millions 2025 2024 % Increase Revenues $ 47.3 $ 31.5 50.0 % Gross Profit $ 11.1 $ 7.1 56.6 % Operating Expenses $ 10.3 $ 6.6 57.5 % Net Income $ 0.5 $ 0.4 31.7 % Earnings per Share (Diluted) $ 0.01 $ 0.01 24.1 % Adj. EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 3.8 $ 1.7 118.0 %

Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 & Subsequent Operational Highlights:

Acquired the business of Crown I Enterprises (“Crown 1”), a full-service manufacturer of value-added proteins and ready-to-heat meals, from Sysco Corporation for $17.5 million. All-cash, accretive acquisition fully funded through a $20.0 million private placement, further supported by an amended $27.4 million long-term credit facility with M&T Bank. Adds $56.8 million in revenue (12 months ended June 28, 2025) with a recently upgraded and expanded 42k sq. ft. USDA facility ~10 miles from the Company’s existing Farmingdale, NY facility. Brings premium, incremental customers where the Company did not yet maintain a presence as well as meaningful cross-selling potential. Significant new operational capabilities, including incremental grill capacity and MAP technology, and potential manufacturing cost synergies.

Secured new tier-one national placements at Target and Food Lion. At Target, two branded sleeved items are to begin shipping in February with a staged rollout to 1,995 stores and additional items in the final set up stages for later distribution, with Food Lion shipments to 1,100 stores starting later this month.

The Company’s first ever National Costco Multi-Vendor Mailer (MVM) with branded Beef Meatballs is underway, driving a meaningful potential increase in sales and brand awareness.

Invited to attend leading investor conferences nationally, including the Lake Street 2025 BIG9 Conference, 16th Annual Craig-Hallum Alpha Select Conference, Stephens NASH25 Conference, and 14th Annual ROTH Deer Valley Event.

Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025 totaled $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025. The change in cash and cash equivalents was driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of Crown 1.

Management Commentary

Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations, said: “Our third quarter demonstrated meaningful momentum in scaling the business. With the integration of the business of Crown 1 underway, we delivered broad-based growth across our protein portfolio, deployed high-return trade and marketing investments, leveraging newly added retail doors and cross-selling. We also implemented targeted price increases across both our beef and chicken portfolios to help offset commodity headwinds, while improvements in chicken operations enhanced throughput and lowered overtime, helping us meet our margin objectives.

“With the acquisition of Crown 1’s assets, we began a straightforward integration supported by proximity and shared grill platforms. Crown’s initially lower gross margins weighed on the quarter, but we are executing a clear plan to lift the acquired Bay Shore facility’s margin performance through procurement scale, throughput and overhead efficiencies, shared services, and best-practice sharing – which we expect to lift consolidated corporate gross margins from the low-20% range to the mid-20% range over the next year.

“We continue to see strong sales momentum across the portfolio, with Crown opening access to hard-to-penetrate customers and creating new cross-sell channels using its premium product offerings, while expanding SKU penetration across its base remains a core priority. This traction is reinforced by new tier-one wins at Target and Food Lion; at Target, we expect first shipments to begin in February, while our products should hit Food Lion’s shelves this month. This, paired with our ongoing National Costco collaboration, positions us for significant growth in the coming quarters.

“As we look ahead, our strategic path toward becoming a $1 billion deli prepared foods company is becoming even clearer. We continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively and maintain strict discipline around capital allocation, prioritizing integration ahead of a new acquisition. With expanded capacity, access to premium retail accounts and ongoing grandma-quality innovation, we are well-positioned to drive sustained profitable growth and improved margins in the quarters to come,” concluded Michaels.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results

Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 50.0% to $47.3 million, as compared to $31.5 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to both the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as robust double-digit growth in the core business on a pre-acquisition basis.

Gross profit increased 56.6% to $11.1 million, or 23.6% of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $7.1 million, or 22.6% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily attributable to operational efficiency improvements across the organization and stabilized chicken commodity prices, partially offset by higher beef commodity prices as well as the addition of lower-margin Crown 1 sales, which the Company expects to bring in-line with the corporate average in the mid-20% range over the next year.

Operating expenses totaled $10.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $6.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased in the third quarter fiscal 2026 to 21.8% from 20.8%. Operating expenses in the third quarter were impacted by the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as $1.0 million in non-recurring professional fees and transaction expenses related to the acquisition. Excluding the aforementioned acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses remained below 20% of revenue.

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 31.7% to $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Third quarter net income totaled 1.1% of revenue, as compared to 1.3% in the same year-ago quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 118.0% to $3.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $1.7 million in the same year-ago quarter.

Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025, grew to $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025, primarily driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of the Crown 1 business. As of October 31, 2025, total debt stood at $6.4 million, as compared to $6.3 million as of October 31, 2024.

Trump says Netflix-Warner Bros. deal could be a 'problem' and he will be involved in approval

NBC ^ | Ddc 7, 2025 | Steve Kopack

Posted on by CondoleezzaProtege

President Donald Trump said Sunday that the proposed $72 billion merger between Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery "could be a problem" because of the amount of market share the resulting company would have.

The value of the deal balloons to more than $82 billion when debt is accounted for.

Netflix said Friday it would purchase Warner Bros. Discovery's film studio, HBO and the streaming service HBO Max. If the deal is approved, Netflix would also get access to decades of films and shows in the Warner Bros. Pictures archive.

The deal would not include cable networks owned by Warner Bros.

Trump expressed some skepticism Sunday

[TITLE]Hungry Hippo Fairing Successfully Qualified: Rocket Lab Clears Significant Milestone on Path to First Neutron Launch:
[TEXT]
LONG BEACH, Calif., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the Neutron launch vehicle’s innovative “Hungry Hippo” captive fairing has successfully completed qualification testing and is enroute to Virginia for Neutron’s first launch.

Dubbed the Hungry Hippo, Neutron’s fairing halves remain attached to the rocket’s first stage throughout launch and landing back to Earth – a world-first for a reusable commercial rocket. Whereas typical rockets’ fairing halves fall away during launch and are disposable or require collection at sea for reuse, Neutron’s fairing halves open to release the rocket’s second stage and mission payload before closing again to return Neutron to Earth as a single reusable vehicle – enabling rapid and cost-effective reuse and streamlining operations for a high-cadence launch service for commercial, civil, and national security missions.

The qualification is a key moment in the development of the reusable Neutron rocket, the world’s largest carbon composite launch vehicle with a lift capacity of up to 13,000kg (33,000 pounds). With the design, structure, and operations of Neutron’s innovative fairing now qualified for flight, Hungry Hippo is enroute to Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 3 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia ahead of Neutron’s first launch. Development of Neutron began in late 2021 and with the first launch scheduled for liftoff in 2026, it remains on track to be one of the fastest commercially developed rockets in history.

Rocket Lab Vice President – Neutron, Shaun D’Mello, says: “A rocket like Neutron has never been built before, and we’re doing it at a pace and price point that’s going to bring the innovation and competition needed in today’s industry. Building, qualifying, and shipping Hungry Hippo is a fantastic marker of progress toward Neutron’s first launch, and I’m proud of the team for their attention to detail and pulling off this significant milestone.”

Hungry Hippo Qualification Program

To qualify the Hungry Hippo fairing for Neutron’s first launch, Rocket Lab completed an intensive qualification and acceptance testing campaign that validated the structure’s expected performance during the intense aerodynamic pressure of launch and re-entry featuring full-scale tests as well as a series of sub-component tests.

Tests have included (but are not limited to):

275,000 pounds of force distributed across the Hungry Hippo’s carbon composite structure to simulate the load experienced during Max Q, the stage of flight where the rocket experiences maximum aerodynamic pressure.

Opening and closing the fairing halves under flight-like conditions in 1.5 seconds, less than half the time required for a successful stage separation and vehicle reorientation for descent.

Flight-like operations combining flight software, avionics, GNC systems, and more, controlling both the canard actuation and fairing actuation systems, and using flight hardware for all avionics, harnessing, and mechanical systems.

Combined torque and bending loads introduced at the canard hubs where the vehicle’s aerodynamic control surfaces, or canards, are integrated to Neutron’s fairing structure. These tests exceeded 125% of the load expected through all phases of flight.

Exceedance of the handling loads that Hungry Hippo will experience throughout Neutron’s full lifecycle: from integration of the Stage 2 that is attached to the interior of the rocket through to the full assembly Neutron and integration of the launch vehicle onto the launch mount, as well as recovery of the launch vehicle from its landing barge named ‘Return On Investment’.

Once Hungry Hippo arrives in Virginia, the fairing structure will be integrated to Neutron’s first stage in final flight configuration to undergo pre-launch testing, including static fires and a Wet Dress Rehearsal, at Launch Complex 3 ahead of first launch.

[TITLE]Mint Interview: Speed of value creation in India will be much faster next decade, says Peak XV’s Mohit Bhatnagar:
[TEXT]
MUMBAI : Fresh from its success of recent initial public offers of Pinelabs and Groww and the soon-to-be-listed Meesho, their funder and one of India's top venture capital fund Peak XV believes the speed of value creation in India will be much faster in the coming decade than it was in the past, its managing director Mohit Bhatnagar said in an interview.

The firm wants to double down on bets in consumer, fintech and software sectors even while scouting for opportunities in sunrise sectors such as space tech, precision manufacturing, and semiconductors.

The venture capital firm which re-branded itself Peak XV in 2023—it was called Sequoia India earlier—has to its credit the bets it made investing in Zomato, Razorpay, Just Dial, Truecaller, Citrus Payment, Freshworks, Equitas, and Lal Path Labs, to name some successful exits it made. Mount Everest was called Peak XV before it was renamed in 1865.

Since its started investing in India in 2006, it has over $8 billion in assets under management, among the highest in the Indian venture capital space.

“I will be surprised if the pace of value creation in not faster in the coming decade," Bhatnagar told Mint. The firm holds 11.3% stake in soon-to-be-listed e-commerce challenger Meesho potentially sitting on a near-26 times return, valuing its stake at over ₹5,340 crore. Meesho is scheduled to list on Wednesday.

The firm first invested in the company in 2018 when it led Meesho’s Series B round of $11.5 million following it up with a round in 2019. “Each time, we did not just participate but led these rounds, showing our conviction in what the company was building," Bhatnagar said. It co-invested in Meesho in 2024.

He said what attracted Peak XV to Meesho was the unique choices that its founders, Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal, had made. "The first one was they had decided to run a zero-inventory platform with the third-party logistics model, which was very unique versus all the incumbents that were battling it out [with] then, burning billions of dollars to compete with each other," Bhatnagar said.

The Peak XV MD feels Meesho has turned out to be a little David amongst many Goliaths that built a frugal business. “But these guys had found a wonderful way to enter into these hard-to-reach households without burning tons of capital because they were aggregating demand with these resellers. So, zero inventory platform, very low customer acquisition cost (CAC) was the original reason that we really wanted to invest into this company," he added.

And this the reason why the ten-year-old company saw its ₹5,421.2 crore initial public offer being subscribed 79.03 times by the final day of the bidding on Friday, 5 December.

Much larger outcomes in future

Such outsized outcomes, says Bhatnagar will be replicated for the firm over the next decade as well.

“The next founder who's getting started is looking at how does he become a $50 billion or $100 billion company? We tend to own 10 to 15% of these companies when they go public… 10 to 15% of a $10 billion company is maybe a billion dollars outcome, but when that outcome goes 5x of course, our businesses will only deliver more, so both in terms of the speed with which we can deliver value as well as the size of the outcomes, I'd be disappointed if they're not much larger in the future," Bhatnagar, who calls himself an India bull, an optimist, said.

He named exports as one segment of the Indian economy that hasn't delivered the way it was envisioned by investors a decade back. “With all the geopolitical changes that we saw, there was an opportunity for India to play a much larger role in many businesses where the world is dependent just on one country [China]. We haven't seen that play out completely. The current tariffs don't help that," he said.

Asked if there is worry about software as a service, or Saas, companies seeing an unprecedented slowdown, Bhatnagar said that the pendulum seems to swing wildly when it comes to investor sentiment. “There's no way an industry that everybody thought was so important just two years back, suddenly just doesn't exist. That just doesn't make logical sense. What has happened right now is with the advent of AI (artificial intelligence)… because AI thoroughly disrupts so many businesses, the easy, softer, easier parts of software are being automated away by AI," he said.

“…there will be a need for many, many companies… vertical companies that will have to work and create these software solutions and use benefits of AI where they can in order to sort of deliver the value. So don't write off anything, is the way I would say," Bhatnagar said, adding that it's very hard to raise money today as a founder unless you have an AI in your roadmap.

[TITLE]Google raises AI stakes as OpenAI struggles to stay on top – DW – 12:
[TEXT]
Google's new Gemini 3 model challenges OpenAI's dominance in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race. As rivals invest billions and competition grows, OpenAI faces pressure to innovate — and finally turn a profit.

According to media reports, OpenAI plans to unveil a new artificial-intelligence reasoning model this week that is reportedly surpassing Google's latest, most advanced family of AI models, Gemini 3.

Online tech magazine The Decoder cites industry insiders who claim the launch is intended to counter Google's recent advances in state-of-the-art reasoning, deep multimodal understanding of text, images and video, as well as Gemini 3's powerful coding capabilities.

Google's parent company Alphabet introduced Gemini 3 in November, boasting benchmark results that surpassed OpenAI's flagship model ChatGPT in key categories.

The outcome rattled OpenAI, which has been viewed as the industry front-runner since ChatGPT's debut in 2022 transformed public awareness of generative AI and briefly left competitors scrambling.

Now, OpenAI's lead is no longer assured.

A 'code red' moment for OpenAI

The reaction inside OpenAI has been urgent, with CEO Sam Altman reportedly declaring a "code red" in an internal message, instructing teams to focus on improving the quality of ChatGPT and delaying other products as a result, according to the memo cited by the US business newspaper The Wall Street Journal.

[TITLE]European Tech Sovereignty Requires Digital Leverage, Not Self-Sufficiency:
[TEXT]
The European Union cannot reduce its digital dependence by investing in infrastructure that leaves underlying power relationships intact. Real power comes from controlling the parts of the value chain that shape decision-making, govern data flows, and set the standards that structure digital markets.

BERLIN – On November 18, Berlin hosted the first Summit on European Digital Sovereignty. France and Germany used the occasion to unveil a set of new initiatives aimed at strengthening data protection, developing cloud markets, and advancing so-called frontier AI, alongside €12 billion ($13.9 billion) in promised private investment. But despite its ambitious agenda, the summit still mischaracterized sovereignty as a question of capacity – how much infrastructure Europe can build – rather than control.

While European policymakers continue to insist that digital sovereignty is

[TITLE]AI UltraProd Announces U.S. Market Entry with Strategic Focus on High-Growth ADU Sector:
[TEXT]
SecureTech Backing Enables AI UltraProd’s U.S. Accessory Dwelling Unit Beachhead; 2026 Rollout and Expansion Strategy

Roseville, Minnesota, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AI UltraProd, Inc. ("Ai UltraProd", AIUP", or "the Company"), a global leader in AI-driven industrial solutions specializing in robotic 3D printing and advanced intelligent manufacturing systems, and a wholly owned subsidiary of SecureTech Innovations, Inc. (“SecureTech”) (OTCQB: SCTH), today announced its official entry into the United States market, beginning with a focused strategy centered on the rapidly expanding Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) sector.

The decision follows extensive market analysis, emerging regulatory alignment, and growing nationwide demand for faster, more sustainable, and more affordable residential construction solutions. This groundwork was led by the SecureTech executive and consultancy team, whose research, strategic modeling, and capital-planning framework identified the ADU sector as a credible, viable, and fastest path for AI UltraProd to establish its U.S. beachhead and generate early cashflow from market entry endeavors. The U.S. ADU market, valued across multiple studies at between $20–30 billion by 2034 with annual growth projections ranging from 9% to 19%, presents what management describes as an ‘immediate, scalable, and velocity-driven opportunity’ for AI-powered construction technology.

AI UltraProd’s U.S. "beachhead" strategy is built on its proprietary blend of deep-integration AI, multi-domain construction robotics, and patented high-performance materials such as Geo Mix and Geo Add . Together, these technologies enable printing of vertical wall systems for a 2,000 sq. ft. home in just days. This can reduce labor needs by up to 70%; cutting material waste by up to 80% and significantly shrinking project timelines impacted by traditional permitting and labor bottlenecks.

The company aims to address the nation’s mobility, affordability, and housing shortages by first demonstrating its capabilities through the ADU marketplace, which offer fast deployment cycles and lower permitting friction in forward-thinking states such as California, Oregon, and Washington.

“Our entry into the United States begins with a clear and highly intentional focus: the ADU market,” said Xing YunZhu, Director of AI UltraProd. “We believe that ADUs are the perfect proving ground for our robotic construction technology. They are high-demand, high-velocity projects that allow us to demonstrate tangible advantages—speed, cost efficiency, design intelligence, and sustainability—while building trust with developers, municipalities, and communities. This is the first step in a long-term plan that we firmly believe will scale into multiple sectors across the U.S.”

The company is already generating revenue (just over $3.7M during the three months ended September 30) and is positively contributing to SecureTech’s financials (as reported). Anticipated to reach roughly eight figures by the close of 2025 and likely to exceed this in 2026, management is executing what they believe to be a sharp, multi-layered market entry and rollout strategy. Management presumes that in this way, the Company would be on path to unlocking its ability to efficiently build emergency medical facilities, disaster relief housing, critical infrastructure, and even off-planet construction in the most viable, reliable and expedient way.

Mr. J. Scott Sitra, President and CEO of SecureTech Innovations, Inc., added, “AI UltraProd’s technology represents a transformational shift in how construction can be executed at scale. The U.S. housing market has reached a critical point where traditional methods cannot keep up—creating a perfect environment for AI-driven manufacturing and 3D printing. Beginning with ADUs gives us a strategic foundation to expand into larger residential, commercial, and industrial applications in the coming phases.”

A Strategic Launch with Future Milestones Planned

Today's announcement marks the first in a series of milestones related to AI UltraProd’s U.S. market entry and expansion. The company, with the support of SecureTech’s executive and consultancy team, is already in the process of developing its first U.S.-based “Lighthouse Project” (a compact, high-impact deployment designed to showcase the full capabilities of its AI-integrated robotic construction system in a real-world American environment). Details on the Lighthouse Project, partnerships, and deployment locations will be released in upcoming communications.

Sitt noted that rising investment in AI and data centers has a positive trickle-down effect and, looking to the future, concluded “… New York City tends to be one of the greatest beneficiaries of good business cycles.”

Turning to politics, Sitt reiterated his long-standing support for Mayor Eric Adams, acknowledging the importance of stability for business, public safety, and economic development. Addressing the city’s incoming leadership, he expressed optimism that Mayor-elect Mamdani will gain a rapid understanding of the realities facing New York. Sitt highlighted his decades of work and philanthropy in the Middle East, and expressed hope that his global perspective could serve as a constructive voice during the transition for the incoming administration. He also noted that New York must work to keep businesses and talent from relocating to new markets. Sitt praised continuity in key leadership roles citing their importance to both the business community and public safety, and ended his segment by emphasizing that the world, and the real estate sector, is in a period of major transformation.
