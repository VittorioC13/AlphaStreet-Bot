[TITLE]Iraq and BP Forge $25 Billion Kirkuk Oil Deal:
[TEXT]
This agreement aligns with Iraq's plan to raise its oil production capacity and is expected to increase Kirkuk's output by 50,000 to 100,000 barrels per day in the coming years.

The deal, finalized in March, aims to boost production and improve efficiencies in oil and gas extraction, with an initial phase targeting over 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent.

BP engineers have started initial assessments at four strategic oilfields in Kirkuk, Iraq, as part of a $25-billion agreement to redevelop the region's oil and gas infrastructure.

BP engineers have arrived in Kirkuk and have launched initial assessments at four strategic oilfields in the northern Iraqi province as part of the supermajor’s $25-billion deal with Iraq to redevelop Kirkuk fields, Iraqi industry sources told Shafaq News on Wednesday.

BP’s experts have started work to develop the infrastructure and production facilities of Iraq’s state-owned North Oil Company (NOC) and North Gas Company (NGC) in Kirkuk, sources from both companies told the Iraqi news outlet.

The assessment process at the Kirkuk fields will be followed by a long-term development plan aimed at boosting production and improving efficiencies in oil and gas extraction, according to the Iraqi sources.

In March this year, BP and Iraq finalized the agreement, which entails total investment of an estimated $25 billion, after the federal Iraqi government ratified the contract.

The redevelopment of several giant oil fields in Kirkuk will be carried out under a contract between NOC, NGC, and BP and includes the rehabilitation and redevelopment of the fields, spanning oil, gas, power, and water with potential for investment in exploration.

The agreement is for an initial phase that includes oil and gas production of more than 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent, BP has said. It includes the Baba and Avanah domes of the Kirkuk oil field and three adjacent fields in Federal Iraq – Bai Hassan, Jambur and Khabbaz – all of which are currently operated by the NOC.

The wider resource opportunity across the contract and surrounding area is believed to include up to 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to the British supermajor.

“This is an enormous opportunity as we grow bp’s oil and gas business and fully aligned with our strategy of strengthening our upstream portfolio,” BP’s chief executive officer Murray Auchincloss said in March.

For Iraq, the agreement is aligned with its plan to raise its oil production capacity to above 6 million bpd by 2029, up from about 4.5 million bpd now.

Production from Kirkuk oilfields is currently between 285,000 bpd and 330,000 bpd, most of which is for domestic consumption, with limited exports to Jordan, per official Iraqi data quoted by Shafaq News. The deal with BP is expected to raise Kirkuk production by between 50,000 bpd and 100,000 bpd in the coming years.

[TITLE]Indian Oil Corporation lines up ₹1.66 lakh cr investment over next 5 years to grow business:
[TEXT]
Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country's largest oil firm, plans to invest ₹1.66 lakh crore over the next five years to expand its core operations in oil refining and fuel marketing, along with ventures in petrochemicals, natural gas and renewable energy, its chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney said on Saturday.

The firm is scaling up its capacity to refine crude oil into fuels like petrol and diesel from the current 80.75 million tonnes per annum to 98.4 million tonnes by 2028, with major expansions at Panipat, Gujarat and Barauni, he said at the company's annual shareholder meeting.

To move this energy swiftly and sustainably, IOC is expanding its pipeline network - the country's most extensive - to 22,000 km with 21 projects under execution. These include pipeline extensions and new storage facilities in Nepal.

Alongside refining and pipelines, IOC is targeting petrochemicals as the next growth engine, expanding capacity from the current 4.3 million tonnes per annum to over 13 million tonnes capacity by 2030, with a sharp focus on specialty chemicals to reduce import dependence and enhance margins.

The firm will continue to expand its 40,000-plus fuel retailing network, adding new-age sources such as EV chargers, battery-swapping stations and CNG and LNG dispensing outlets.

Alongside core business, IOC is investing ₹2.5 lakh crore in energy transition that will help it achieve net zero operational emissions by 2046, he said, adding the firm is investing in green hydrogen production, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and expanding renewable electricity portfolio from 1 GW to 18 GW within three years.

"Looking ahead, your company has committed around ₹1.66 lakh crore over the next five years, with a sharp focus on petrochemicals, natural gas and renewable energy - balancing India's rising auto-fuel demand with the global energy transition," he said.

Giving details of initiatives to expand operational base, he said IOC is sharpening focus on per-pump throughput, non-fuel retail (NFR) and high-potential segments such as bitumen and bunkering. At the same time, it is seeding future-ready platforms such as LNG bunkering, coastal infrastructure, integrated shipping and data transmission services - ventures that leverage the firm's adjacencies to capture emerging opportunities in a rapidly evolving energy ecosystem.

With a market leadership share of 45 per cent in the LPG, IOC has launched BIS-certified Chhotu Master - a compact 5 kg cylinder and cooktop combo - with the first 'Chhotu Shopee' in Ahmedabad.

For industrial customers, innovative offerings like XtraBoost-high fuel-efficient nano-additized AutoLPG and Propane Plus - advanced propane with cleaner combustion and higher heat output - deliver cleaner, more efficient fuels.

While its Servo lubricants have expanded its global footprint to 45 countries, IOC retained market leadership with a 54.5 per cent share in aviation fuel, commissioning new aviation fuel stations at Srinagar and Rewa.

Its natural gas business surged 20 per cent to 7.9 million tonnes per annum, supported by new sourcing agreements with global majors. Its city gas distribution footprint has spread to 49 geographical areas across 21 states, covering 21 per cent of India's population.

Beyond energy, in the explosives business, a new plant at Neyveli has been commissioned, with greenfield projects in Telangana and Maharashtra underway. In Cryogenics, IOC has secured government contracts alongside export orders, while a new unit at Dindori will further strengthen domestic manufacturing capacity.

"All of this is backed by strict capital discipline, ensuring that every investment creates long-term value and keeps IndianOil future-ready," he said.

He said the year gone by reminded us that energy is never just about markets and molecules - it is shaped by the pulse of geopolitics.

"The Russia-Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continued to cast a long shadow on global stability. As the months progressed, new fault lines emerged in the Middle East. Disruptions in the Red Sea and heightened tensions around the Strait of Hormuz unsettled vital energy corridors, forcing global trade to recalibrate. Towards the close of the year, tariff hikes announced by the United States brought fresh headwinds, shaking investor confidence and adding a new layer of uncertainty to global flows."

Against this backdrop, oil and gas markets remained under pressure, with the accelerating pace of the energy transition amplifying volatility.

IOC, he said, delivered a resilient performance during 2024-25. Sales volumes crossed the historic 100 million tonne mark, 20,000 km pipeline network ensured seamless movement of hydrocarbons, over 40,000 fuel stations energised over 3.2 crore customers every day and Indane LPG fuelled 15 crore kitchens.

Alongside, IOC retained a strong presence in petrochemicals, natural gas and exploration and production, further reinforcing its diversified energy footprint.

[TITLE]Colombia's 2025 natural gas investment seen up 35% to $1.1 billion, Naturgas association:
[TEXT]
BOGOTA (Reuters) -Investment in Colombia's natural gas industry is expected to increase by 34.6% to $1.1 billion in 2025, driven by exploration and production efforts to reduce the fuel deficit, association president Luz Stella Murgas said on Tuesday.

Investments in natural gas in the Latin American country reached $817 million in 2024.

Of the $1.1 billion projected for 2025, $1.007 billion will be allocated to exploration and production — a 37% year-on-year increase — while $50 million will focus on distribution and marketing, Murgas said.

"The investment amount is consistent with the need to increase the country's gas supply," the Naturgas president added, noting 11 projects have been identified.

The association forecasts a gas deficit of around 5% this year, rising to 20% by 2026, due to reduced exploration linked to President Gustavo Petro's energy transition policies aimed at cutting fossil fuel dependence.
