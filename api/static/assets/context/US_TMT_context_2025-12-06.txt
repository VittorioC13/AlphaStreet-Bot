The Celestial deal would allow Marvell to tap into the startup's work on photonics, which uses light rather than electrical signals to create connections between AI chips and memory chips, an area in which it competes with Broadcom and the world's most valuable company, Nvidia.

Marvell CEO Matt Murphy told Reuters that the Celestial AI technology will be used in Marvell's next-generation photonics-related infrastructure products, which will contribute to a new market for the company at the tune of

[TITLE]Alphabet’s AI Chips Are a Potential $900 Billion ‘Secret Sauce’:
[TEXT]
Alphabet Inc. investors are growing increasingly confident that the company’s semiconductors could represent a significant driver of future revenue for Google’s parent.

The success of Alphabet’s tensor processing unit, or TPU, chips is a primary reason for the stock’s 30% fourth-quarter rally, putting it among the best performers in the S&P 500 Index. The TPUs were always seen as a major strength internally, accelerating growth for the company’s cloud-computing business. But there’s rising optimism that Alphabet could start selling the chips to third parties, creating a new revenue stream in a business that could ultimately be worth almost a trillion dollars.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Shares were down 1% on Thursday.

“If companies want to diversify away from Nvidia, TPUs are a good way to do it, and that means there’s a lot of reason to be optimistic,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at DA Davidson. “The chip business could ultimately be worth more than Google Cloud. But even if it never sells a chip externally, the better chip means a better, more efficient cloud.”

[TITLE]Why Analysts Say ASML Is the Top Semiconductor Pick Heading Into 2026:
[TEXT]
ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the AI Stocks in Focus This Week. On December 1, Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock with a €1,000.00 price target. The firm is optimistic on the stock driven by positive momentum for lithography demand.

Analysts have labeled ASML as its Top Pick in European semiconductors as demand strengthens across memory and logic, and new EUV tool cycles and DRAM transitions signal healthier margins heading into 2026.

DRAM cycle and foundry spending are anticipated to support ASML’s order book and sales through fiscal years 2026 and 2027. A recent Asia trip by the firm has further reinforced its belief regarding a memory supercycle and likely near-term upside for ASML’s orders.

Analysts have also highlighted "unprecedented memory demand" with limited DDR5 inventory visibility and DDR4 tightness. ASML is well-positioned to benefit from continued DRAM demand, including commodity DRAM, strong memory pricing, and DRAM technology transitions to HBM4.

It has also been confirmed that TSMC will add 3nm capacity in Taiwan instead of Japan. This implies increased foundry spending and is likely to translate into more 3600d shipments in fiscal year 2026 and provide near-term EUV sales upside for ASML.

ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) develops and sells advanced semiconductor equipment, including lithography, metrology, and inspection systems for chip manufacturing.

While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

India’s public-sector banks may be facing a sharp bout of selling, but the investment case remains intact, says Rajiv Batra , Head of Asia & Co-Head of Global Emerging Markets Equity Strategy at JPMorgan . In a conversation with ET Now, Batra said the sudden slide in PSU bank stocks reflects the market “digesting” the government’s signal that FDI limits may not be raised—an event many investors had priced in.Batra argued that even without the FDI catalyst, PSU lenders stand to benefit from three structural drivers:He noted that major PSU banks continue to gain deposit share, maintain low cost of capital, and will benefit if credit growth sustains. “If loan growth accelerates, it will be music to the ears of PSU banks,” he said.Batra expects valuation rerating in the coming three years as digital adoption improves, loan growth broadens and deregulation—such as RBI’s discussion on M&A financing—opens new revenue streams for state-owned lenders.On foreign flows, Batra said FIIs are navigating global volatility triggered by the US Fed’s shifting rate-cut expectations, Japan’s bond-market moves and the lack of policy easing in November. This has prompted broad EM profit-booking—not just in India.However, FIIs may be re-evaluating their stance, he said. India has underperformed emerging markets this year by nearly 20%, and most global funds are underweight India. With earnings turning around—Q2 earnings grew 8–9%—and GDP momentum holding strong, Batra believes global investors may move back into India as they rebuild portfolios in early 2026.Batra listed two key triggers:India’s shift from twin policy tightening to twin policy easing over the last 12–14 months is already showing up in stronger credit growth, auto sales and agriculture output, he said.Batra expects nominal GDP to rebound from ~7.7% this year to 9–9.5% next year, potentially even touching double digits if capex continues across semiconductors, data centres and EVs. That, he said, would support stronger corporate earnings.JPMorgan is forecasting 13% earnings growth in H2 FY26 and 14% in FY27, slightly below consensus due to expected headwinds in sectors like pharma and technology.Batra said JPMorgan remains neutral across large-, mid- and small-caps. While midcaps trade at a premium, he argued the segment’s 25–29% earnings growth in recent quarters justifies current valuations.Using PEG analysis, he noted that midcaps remain within an acceptable band. “If earnings momentum holds, valuations are justified. But any disruption in cost structure or policy could challenge this premium,” he cautioned.For now, he believes midcaps can continue to perform, provided they maintain strong earnings trajectories.

[TITLE]Starlink on Track to Receive $661 Million From Federal Broadband Program:
[TEXT]
SpaceX’s Starlink is poised to receive $661 million in government funds as all 50 states move forward with their plans to expand high-speed internet in underserved regions.

California submitted its final proposal for a cut of the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program this week, the last US state to do so. So, we now have a better understanding of how the US will allocate the funds, which are already being distributed.

Wes Robinson, a director at Texas-based Eastex Telephone Cooperative, has been tracking the numbers from each state’s BEAD proposal and found that close to $1 billion will go to satellite services, including Starlink and its upcoming competitor Amazon Leo.

(Credit: Wes Robinson)

The proposed $660.6 million for Starlink will be used to deliver satellite internet to 478,073 locations across the US. Amazon Leo, formerly Project Kuiper, is set to receive $302.4 million to deliver satellite broadband to 415,479 locations.

This means the two satellite providers will serve over 893,000 locations, or about 22.5% of all the underserved locations covered by the BEAD program. However, the majority of funds—or 63%—will go to faster but more expensive fiber connections; the remaining will be for fixed wireless and hybrid fiber-coaxial.

(Credit: Wes Robinson)

California, Colorado, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, and Wyoming picked satellite internet to serve 40% or more of their locations. Montana is the highest at 65%.

California will spend the most money at $164 million. In the Golden State, SpaceX is set to receive $63 million to serve close to 46,000 locations, while Amazon is on track to get nearly $101 million for over 92,000 locations.

The funding is a win for SpaceX and Amazon. It gives them a way to reach more US users, even though Amazon’s satellite internet service hasn't launched yet. It comes after the Trump administration overhauled the BEAD program in June to prioritize “technology neutrality,” in an effort to reduce costs and allow satellite providers to capture a larger share of the funding, rather than just fiber networks.

But some criticized Trump’s revamp, arguing that fiber can offer faster gigabit speeds than Starlink without any network congestion issues. Others have questioned why federal funding should go toward Starlink, which is already available across the US to any interested user.

(Credit: Brian Westover/PCMag)

Under BEAD, SpaceX and Amazon are only required to provide a free satellite dish to underserved areas and reserve network capacity. It's unclear if they will offer cheaper plans, although SpaceX just announced a $40-per-month Residential 100Mbps plan. In addition, both companies are working to provide gigabit speeds through their orbiting satellites.

SpaceX had also lobbied some US states, complaining that too much of their BEAD funding is going toward fiber rather than cheaper satellite internet. The BEAD proposals show that some fiber installations can cost $10,000 or more per location. In contrast, states plan on paying an average of $724 and $1,381 to Amazon and SpaceX per location, respectively.

The BEAD proposals also demonstrate that the Trump administration achieved its goal of reducing the costs of broadband deployments. According to Robinson's numbers, about half of the BEAD funds, at $21 billion, remained unspent.

On Tuesday, a US official overseeing the BEAD program, Arielle Roth, also touted the $21 billion savings. “We haven’t made any decisions yet, but stay tuned,” she said on how the remaining funds will be used. “We’ll have much more to share in early 2026.”

Robinson noted his numbers only track the finalized BEAD proposal from the US states, not potential tweaks the Commerce Department might make to each plan before final approval. So, it’s possible the overall funding amounts could change, although it might only be a little, as Texas’s BEAD approval shows.

So far, Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration has approved 29 BEAD proposals. It’s then up to the National Institute of Standards and Technology to approve the budget and issue the award amendment, which has already occurred for Louisiana.

Although all 50 states have submitted their final proposals to the BEAD program, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands have yet to do so.

[TITLE]Telecom on the Fast Track: How Custom Training Keeps Telecom Projects on Time and on Budget:
[TEXT]
ALPHARETTA, Ga., Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

A Costly Delay in Texas

In rural Texas, a cooperative’s fiber expansion project hit a snag. Crews used decades-old gear and outdated methods. Technicians resisted new equipment and skipped training, but legacy connectors didn’t work with modern fiber lines. The result was costly rework, repeat visits, and a delay of 4–6 weeks.

A Widespread Industry Problem

This problem isn’t unique. From 5G deployments to rural broadband, outdated tools and skill gaps create serious setbacksi. The solution is clear: proactive field training and planning before work begins.

Training That Changes Outcomes

Upfront training, audits, and quick assessments deliver real results. In the Texas co-op’s case, project managers brought in StruXur. The team did an informal site assessment and flagged compatibility issues. Old infrastructure clashed with modern fiber gear, and crews struggled. So StruXur arranged a hands-on “lunch-and-learn.” Technicians handled new equipment and learned updated installation techniques. They saw custom connector parts that bridged the gap between old and new systems. The training didn’t stop there. StruXur followed up and confirmed the solutions worked in practice. They also verified that the new equipment had been ordered and installed correctly.

Results That Speak for Themselves

The results were dramatic. Crews eliminated rework and clawed back lost time. One project recovered six weeks just by preventing errors. And industry surveys confirm the pattern: poor training leads to delays, but certification prevents costly downtimeii.

How Contractors Are Adapting

Contractors are changing their approach. Training is now integrated into project lifecycles, rather than being left until problems arise. Programs range from toolbox talks and quick video refreshers to vendor-led certification courses. Some manufacturers even offer free in-person classes, allowing crews to practice with the exact tools they’ll use.

StruXur has made proactive training a core part of its service. They often conduct on-site audits before projects ramp up. In one case, a broadband provider that purchased 15 fiber blowers participated in StruXur-led demos and training sessions, eliminating past issues with downtime and costly delays.

A Leadership Perspective

“The right training turns problems around fast,” said Shawn Offenbacher, President of StruXur. “We worked with a contractor who was six weeks behind. Once they had proper guidance and better tools, they caught up entirely. That’s why early investment in training pays off—it avoids mistakes and protects the bottom line.”

Why Training Is Essential Now

This proactive approach is no longer optional. The telecom industry is racing to expand fiber and 5G networks. Government funding and competition drive projects, but a shortage of skilled crews and the right solutions hinders their progress. Programs like the U.S. BEAD initiative highlight this shortage, and demand continues to rise.

So trained hands matter as much as cables or splicers. Companies that build a learning culture will outperform competitors. The fastest way to keep projects on time isn’t more gear or budget. It’s better-prepared crews.

The Bottom Line

Success depends not just on what you build, but on how you prepare people. And the best preparation is training—done early, done often, and done before the first fiber is laid.

[TITLE]Cochlear plugs AI into its global contact centre operations:
[TEXT]
Cochlear is starting to make use of the AI capabilities in its Amazon Connect contact centre platform, automating its evaluation of agents and calls against a set of quality and compliance objectives.

Cochlear's Andy McLaughlin at AWS re:Invent.

The Sydney-headquartered maker of implantable hearing technology re-platformed its global contact centre operations in 14 countries to run on Amazon Connect two-and-a-half years ago.

Cochlear's contact centres support a range of functions, IT networks and telecommunications director Andy McLaughlin told the AWS re:Invent summit in Las Vegas.

“We have business-to-business services, business-to-customer services such as device support, orders and insurance, a ‘pro’ care team which is for clinical support, and sales,” McLaughlin said.

“Customer experience is critical for how we operate.

“Interestingly, being a company that deals with the hearing impaired, the voice channel is our most popular channel and the way that most of our customers get through to us, and also how we deal with a lot of our business-to-business work as well.”

The project standardised call centre technology and configurations around call queues, and improving reliability and visibility of support services.

Multi-language support made Amazon Connect suitable for Cochlear’s global operations.

The platform also introduced call transcription – a critical underpinning for the company’s automation and AI work now taking place – which is integrated with Cochlear’s Salesforce CRM.

“The dialler is now within the Salesforce CRM,” McLaughlin said.

“Not only that, we have screen pops, so depending on the customer's calling number, we're able to immediately pop up that customer's details, so it allows our agents to get to our customers' information a lot more quickly.”

Since then, and particularly in 2025, Cochlear's focus has switched to enhancing Connect-powered support services and decreasing its reliance non-Amazon tools.

“When we rolled out [Connect], we had a workforce management product that was not an Amazon product, we had quality management that was also another product, we had a lot of BI tools, [and] our dashboards used a third [party] product as well,” McLaughlin said.

“We were sending a lot of our data to multiple systems, which our privacy team wasn't that keen on. So we made the move in June this year to go to Amazon's unlimited AI.”

Amazon Connect with unlimited AI is much as it sounds: a suite of AI tools that customers can use as little or as much of as they want.

Cochlear is already using AI and machine learning to streamline its reporting, evaluations of agents and calls against set metrics.

In the future, it will also be use it as part of an adoption of forecasting, capacity planning, and scheduling – FCS – features in Amazon Connect, which will allow Cochlear to transform its contact centre workforce management.

Agent and call evaluations

Cochlear has traditionally been constrained in its ability to evaluate contact centre agents or calls.

“Even when we first moved to Amazon Connect, we were only able to evaluate the calls in which the supervisor would be able to listen – three calls per agent per month, randomly selected, and our quality team would listen to another two,” McLaughlin said.

“So, our agents were only getting around five, what we called scorecards, per month done.”

Automated evaluations, using unlimited AI and transcriptions in Amazon Connect, have materially changed this.

“I looked at what happened in October when I was pulling this [presentation] together and we'd gone from about 1000 evaluations per month to 22,000 now.

“We're not running this across all teams – we're still trying a bunch of different use cases for it – but it really has been a game changer and I can't stress enough that the reason why we can do that is because of the transcription accuracy.”

The automation is both rule and category-based, or generative AI-based.

Rule-based automation is designed to look for a semantic or exact match for specific words or phrases in a call – such as brand terminology or profanity.

“These are really good for compliance checks, such as if you've got specific regulatory regulatory compliance requirements and explicit policy violations, because of the exact nature of the text that is being searched for there,” McLaughlin said.

Generative AI automations, meanwhile, can look at whether an agent shows empathy or other soft skills, and uses reasoning for determining quality scores.

“It does provide an AI reasoning and some words [as to] why it's come up with that particular score as well. These are great for quality assessments and soft skill evaluations,” McLaughlin said.

“Really, the benefit of all this is that because you can score every agent and all their calls, you can now target the actual issues or problems, such as where there's a common question that might not be being answered correctly by an agent.

“You can target those by looking at the reporting and then use that to have much more targeted training for your agents as well.

“So it's a very good thing to have so much more automation and be able to score so much more [contact centre activity].”

Workforce management

Workforce management using FCS - forecasting, capacity planning and scheduling - is now a key focus in the contact centre.

McLaughlin said that as Cochlear had two years of historic data already in Amazon Connect, it was well-prepared to begin using machine learning in the workforce management space.

This is about accurately forecasting call volumes, ensuring the right number of contact centre agents are rostered to work at the right times, and that break management and agent schedule adherence metrics are met.

AI agents answering calls

Further into the future, Cochlear is interested in exploring whether AI agents might be able to answer voice calls.

“We started playing with interactive voice response using an AI agent to answer calls,” McLaughlin said.

“We plugged in a bunch of knowledge base articles – just threw them into an S3 bucket, pointed Amazon Connect at that S3 bucket for its knowledge base and we had a play with this in our IT help desk.”

McLaughlin said that the AI agent’s responses were “pretty decent”, but that productionising the use case would require additional work.

“We had all of this working in a pilot that we ran for our helpdesk a month or two ago, but we have some challenges with our ITSM tool,” he said.

“That's why we haven't implemented that fully, but it is something that we've [spent] a lot of time [on] to really get to understand how AI agents work.”

[TITLE]AI startup Cohere CEO says US holds edge over China in AI race:
[TEXT]
By Deborah Mary Sophia, Juby Babu and Krystal Hu

Dec 4 (Reuters) - Canadian tech startup Cohere's CEO Aidan Gomez said on Thursday the U.S. and Canada hold an "incredible position" to partner with economies adopting AI around the ​world, putting the countries in the lead against China in the global AI race.

Speaking in an interview at ‌the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, Gomez noted China has put out extremely high-performing AI models, narrowing the gap between some of the best closed-source large ‌language models, such as OpenAI's.

But "the thing that actually matters is who is the primary service provider of this technology - it's not who gets the technology first, but who commercializes it at scale. The U.S. and Canada sit in an incredible position to be the world's partner in adopting this technology," Gomez said.

"I think we will win against China."

The AI arms race between the U.S. and China has ⁠heated up this year after Chinese AI ‌startup DeepSeek surged to popularity early in January. Since then, tech giants in China including Alibaba and Baidu have been racing to roll out new models and upgrades to AI products more frequently.

To fuel ‍America's ambitious goals of being an AI frontrunner, Big Tech and AI companies in the U.S. have poured billions of dollars to boost computing capacity and their AI infrastructures.

Gomez's comments are a complete contrast to recent ones from AI chipmaker Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who warned China was "nanoseconds ​behind America in AI" and was "going to win the AI race." China’s access to advanced AI chips, particularly those produced by ‌Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company by market capitalization, remains a flashpoint in its tech rivalry with the United States.

LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES NOT WILLING TO USE CHINESE TECHNOLOGY

Gomez added that liberal democracies around the world tend not to be very willing to use Chinese technology as critical infrastructure in their economies: "If you're going to pick a partner to rely on to transform your entire economy, I think you will pick a liberal democracy."

Toronto-based Cohere builds enterprise-specific AI models.

"Spending an incremental $10 billion a year to improve your model ⁠does not deliver the return on investment on the technology itself to ​justify that ... over the past few years, since there's been all of this ​scaling, we're seeing a slowdown in the improvement of the models," Gomez said.

The comments come at a time when tech investors are increasingly demanding companies like Microsoft and Alphabet's Google show better returns on ‍the hundreds of billions of dollars ⁠they have collectively spent on AI.

[TITLE]Microsoft plans bigger data centre investment in India beyond 2026, to keep hiring AI talent:
[TEXT]
NEW DELHI: Microsoft will keep investing in artificial intelligence-ready data centre infrastructure in India beyond 2026, and continue hiring artificial intelligence (AI) engineers to build value-added solutions, the company’s top India executive said.

“As part of our $3 billion investment plan through this year and the next, our Hyderabad data centre—one of the largest in the region—is set to go live by June 2026. This will add to our data centre hubs in Mumbai, Pune and Chennai, as well as two Jio-Azure regions (with Reliance Industries) in Maharashtra and Gujarat," said Puneet Chandok, president of Microsoft India and South Asia. “All our data centres are AI-ready, and this is where we’ve invested so far. But, our investments are not episodic—they are structural. We’ll continue to invest more, and we’ll dive deeper into these investments next week."

Chandok spoke exclusively to Mint ahead of Microsoft’s global chief executive and chairman, Satya Nadella’s India tour from 10-12 December. Nadella is expected to make key announcements around AI infrastructure during his visit.

On 14 October, Google, in partnership with domestic conglomerate Adani Group and telecom major Airtel, announced a $15 billion investment to build a 1 gigawatt (GW) AI data centre in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.

Chandok declined to comment on Microsoft’s direct competitors.

He also does not expect the influx of AI to reduce Microsoft’s net hiring in India. “We already have 22,000 AI engineers in India, and we continue to hire more. Of course, as we hire people, we constantly look for AI skills, and we also skill people—where we dedicate one day of each month to focus on skilling."

At the time of writing, Microsoft India had 420 job openings. Nearly 92%, or 385, of the roles listed on Microsoft’s India careers page required AI skills across engineering, sales, and other operations.

“It’s not that jobs will all disappear. As we get multi-agent coordination in our workflow, we’ll see mundane jobs being replaced by the value-added ones. This shift is already happening, and we’re seeing the rise of new educational methods, such as micro-degrees in AI, to make this happen," Chandok added.

Microsoft’s India arm reported ₹28,754.77 crore ($3.18 billion) in operating revenue in FY25, with a net profit of ₹1,245.18 crore ($138 million). Overall, Microsoft’s India revenue rose 27% year-on-year, while net profit grew 39%. The company continues its long-term partnership with OpenAI, offering the latter’s generative AI applications through Azure and Copilot.

Chandok said Microsoft is already seeing meaningful, at-scale use of its AI services in India.

“We now have over 1,000 customers using Microsoft Azure OpenAI in India," he said, adding that these are no longer experimental deployments. According to him, enterprises such as Apollo Healthcare, the State Bank of India and Physics Wallah are scaling Copilot-based solutions across their operations—from clinical assistance and customer query handling to AI tutoring for millions of students. These, he said, reflect deep adoption rather than pilot-stage activity.

But despite the momentum, Azure has remained second behind Amazon Web Services in global and Indian cloud market share. Data from Synergy Research last month showed AWS at 29% of the Indian cloud services market, followed by Microsoft Azure at 21%.

Analysts said Microsoft continues to play a central role in India’s AI adoption due to its long-standing local presence and extensive cloud footprint.

“Microsoft has a deep-seated presence in India, and is typically seen by enterprises as one of the safest tech companies to work with in terms of compliance and security. The company's AI journey especially in the past one year has been mixed, as it went with partnering OpenAI rather than developing its own foundational capabilities. But today, Microsoft stands as a company that will get a large volume of business, as enterprises start adopting AI at scale," said Kashyap Kompella, veteran AI analyst and founder of RPA2AI Research.

Kompella added that Microsoft's significant cloud presence in India means that they will likely also continue to invest in AI infrastructure in the country, and the value they'll derive through longstanding partnerships with tech outsourcing companies will prove to be beneficial, as the industry matures.

Service integrators are working along similar lines. In June, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest tech outsourcing firm, extended its partnership with Microsoft to offer enterprise AI services to clients.

Chandok concurred, adding that such partnerships are critical in the long run. “Our partnership with TCS is a very deep one, and a long-standing one as well. We don’t see their AI advances as a rival, but as a valuable partner. We continue to work together closely, and this is what is leading to the rise of AI adoption across India. In future, we’ll see more of these, at even larger scales."
