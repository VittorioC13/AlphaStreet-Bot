[TITLE]Nscale raises the largest Series B in European history, at $1.1 billion, to accelerate its global AI infrastructure and GPU deployment rollout:
[TEXT]
LONDON, UK, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

The financing was led by Aker ASA, with continued support from existing shareholders, including Sandton Capital, and participation from Blue Owl, Dell, Fidelity Management & Research Company, G Squared, Nokia, NVIDIA, Point72, and T.Capital.

The oversubscribed funding round will accelerate Nscale’s growth across Europe, North America, and the Middle East.

The raise follows recent announcements of Nscale’s UK AI infrastructure commitment with Microsoft, NVIDIA, and OpenAI, as well as the Nscale Aker ASA joint venture, which includes Stargate Norway and a multi-billion-dollar agreement with Microsoft.

Nscale, the hyperscaler engineered for AI, today announced it has raised the largest Series B in UK and European history, at USD $1.1 billion. The financing was led by Aker ASA, with continued support from existing shareholders, including Sandton Capital, and participation from Blue Owl Managed Funds, Dell, Fidelity Management & Research Company, G Squared, Nokia, NVIDIA, Point72, and T.Capital.

Headquartered in the UK and operating globally, Nscale is an AI-native infrastructure platform, providing vertically integrated computer, networking, storage, managed software, and AI services delivered in Nscale-owned and collocated data centers.

It directly addresses the surging enterprise demand for GPUs – the engines driving AI in one of the fastest-growing infrastructure markets. Anchored in Europe, its strategically located data centers harness some of the lowest-cost renewable energy in the world, allowing Nscale to pass these significant savings directly to customers while meeting stringent regulatory requirements. From large-scale hubs in Norway to smaller metro clusters designed for latency-sensitive workloads, its next-generation facilities can be delivered more quickly and at a lower cost than the industry benchmarks.

The new funding will be used to further Nscale’s deployment of large-scale AI infrastructure across Europe, North America and the Middle East, enabling the rapid rollout of the company’s “AI factory” data centers for projects like Stargate UK and Stargate Norway, and the expansion of its vertically integrated AI cloud platform. This capital will accelerate the expansion of its engineering and operations teams and strengthen delivery for enterprise and government customers worldwide.

“We are building the AI-native Infrastructure platform of tomorrow,” said Josh Payne, CEO of Nscale. “AI is reshaping industries, economies, and national strategies – but it cannot happen without the physical backbone: the data centers, the GPUs and the software to orchestrate them. We are building a vertically integrated, AI-engineered foundation designed to power the next generation of technological change, enabling industries and innovators across the globe to achieve what today feels impossible.

“We are creating one of the largest global platforms of its kind – purpose-built to meet surging demand and unlock breakthroughs at unprecedented scale. This allows Nscale to provide our customers access to scarce, and highly sought after, compute capacity and rapidly accelerate the build-out of secure, compliant and energy-efficient AI infrastructure.

“Europe needs a Hyperscaler, and Nscale is rising to the challenge.”

Backed by a seasoned leadership team that has built over 50 data centers, developed leading supercomputing platforms, negotiated large-scale technology contracts and scaled multi-billion-dollar infrastructure businesses, Nscale combines one of the world’s largest GPU pipelines with the proven expertise to deliver at global scale.

In parallel to the delivery of physical AI infrastructure, Nscale is accelerating product innovation across the AI stack: launching a fine-tuning service, advanced inference APIs, an AI Studio, robust orchestration tools and private cloud enhancements.

The raise follows the recent announcement of Nscale’s UK AI infrastructure commitment. Together with Microsoft, it announced its plans to develop the UK’s largest AI supercomputer on Nscale’s AI Campus in Loughton. Separately, Nscale, OpenAI and NVIDIA announced they are together establishing Stargate UK, an overarching infrastructure platform designed to deploy OpenAI’s technology in the UK, with a particular focus on sovereign workloads.

In July, Nscale announced the launch of Stargate Norway, its landmark partnership with Aker ASA and OpenAI to launch Europe’s first hyperscale AI with a target to deliver 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs by the end of 2026. Two months later, the Nscale-Aker joint venture deepened this momentum with a multi-billion-dollar agreement with Microsoft to deliver AI infrastructure in Narvik, Norway. Looking ahead, Nscale will expand its relationship with Dell Technologies, using Dell AI infrastructure to further support sovereign AI efforts in Europe.

“AI is reshaping the global economy and redefining the value of renewable energy. With Nscale, we’re backing infrastructure that’s sovereign, scalable and purpose-built to accelerate this transformation. Nscale’s full-stack, GPU-first model gives it a real edge in execution. The scale and quality of this Series B round are a testament to Nscale’s vision and momentum – and to the strength of our collaboration. Through both our Series B investment and joint venture, we’re making a significant, long-term commitment to building industrial relevance in the age of AI.” - Øyvind Eriksen, President & CEO, Aker ASA

“Over just a few months, Nscale has moved with focus and velocity – turning ambitious plans into production capacity and becoming meaningfully relevant, fast. The team is building massive-scale, sovereign infrastructure that enterprises and nations can actually consume – reliable, efficient, and close to their data. We’re excited to support Josh and the Nscale team as they scale with discipline, equip builders with infrastructure, and establish a strategic foundation for national AI leadership.” - Larry Aschebrook, Founder & Managing Partner, G Squared

“Demand for the build-out of secure, scalable AI infrastructure in Europe and across the world continues to accelerate. Nokia is participating in Nscale’s investment round and announcing a partnership with Nscale to combine our expertise in IP and optical networking with their leading infrastructure platform, enabling the innovation needed for the future of AI infrastructure.” Justin Hotard, President and CEO, Nokia

"The future of AI hinges on empowering every nation to innovate securely, independently and on its own terms. We help transform sovereign ambition into global impact by delivering the foundational infrastructure and services needed to realize this vision. Through Dell's strategic investment and the power of our AI solutions, Nscale is building tailored platforms that drive meaningful progress for citizens and industries worldwide." - Adrian McDonald, President, EMEA, Dell Technologies

“The success of UK-founded companies like Nscale shows how our country can be at the cutting edge of AI. By attracting global expertise and investment, it is building the essential infrastructure for the UK to compete internationally, drive growth, and create jobs across the country.” - UK AI Minister, Kanishka Narayan

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC acted as exclusive placement agent for Nscale in connection with this capital raise.

[TITLE]Indonesia: Palm oil sellers fear new barriers after EU deal – DW – 09:
[TEXT]
After nearly a decade of negotiations between Jakarta and Brussels, a new free trade pact will let Indonesia sell its palm oil in the EU with zero tariffs. But other obstacles are looming.

The European Union and Indonesia opened "an exciting new chapter" in trade this week, with the Indonesia-EU Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IEU-CEPA) being signed in Bali following years of diplomatic wrangling.

Palm oil exports have proven to be the most contentious issue during the talks. EU officials point out that producing palm oil is a major driver of deforestation and pollution. The trade dispute spilled into the arena of diplomacy and chilled ties between Jakarta and Brussels.

Recent global trade uncertainty, combined with US tariffs on countries in Europe and Asia, seem to have finally pushed the talks across the finish line. Brussels and Jakarta now hope to see the accord go into effect by 2027, allowing around 80% of Indonesia's exports to enter the EU tariff-free.

An app for more ethical palm oil To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

Although the new IEU-CEPA framework allows the European Union to buy Indonesia's palm oil at zero tariffs, this deal alone is not enough to guarantee smooth exports to Europe.

What's next after Indonesia's zero-tariffs deal with EU?

Starting in December, the European Union will demand palm oil imports to comply with the bloc's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), a new legal framework aimed at fighting deforestation worldwide.

Exporters, including those in Indonesia, will be required to carry out due diligence and provide documentation proving that their palm oil did not come from recently deforested areas.

Though major companies may be able to deliver the necessary export certificates, smallholders — who control over 42% of Indonesia's palm oil plantations — are likely to struggle, risking exclusion from supply chains. Without proper support, this imbalance could leave independent farmers marginalized and likely weakened in any land conflicts with big corporations.

Small palm farmers likely to bear the brunt

Eddy Martono, chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI), praised the IEU-CEPA deal as a vital gateway to global markets, but told DW that there would be further obstacles related to the EUDR.

"For large companies, especially GAPKI members, EUDR is not a major problem. The real challenge lies with smallholders, as the government has yet to provide clear rules regarding their land cultivation," Eddy said.

Eddy also called for a national traceability system in Indonesia, which would also be recognized by the EU, as a tool to minimize export rejection.

"When tariff barriers are gone but nontariff rules like EUDR are unmet, the zero-tariff facility becomes meaningless," he said.

Global markets 'wide open' with IEU-CEPA

Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), also warned that the EUDR could emerge as a significant barrier.

"What companies see as additional costs, European consumers view as necessities," Bhima told DW Indonesia.

"In tariff terms, Indonesia can now compete more strongly with other vegetable oil producers. But environmental standards must not be seen as obstacles. With IEU-CEPA, the door to global markets is already wide open — certification and due diligence must follow quickly," he said.

EU tracks Indonesia's environmental protection

Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto has told the Antara News Agency that Indonesian palm oil would enjoy zero-tariff access as soon as the agreement takes effect, with no long transition period.

The minister said the deal could lead to greater acceptance for crude palm oil and its derivatives in the European Union, despite lingering stigma over deforestation and regulatory barriers.

The European Union is keeping a close watch on environmental protections in Indonesia. This means exports will face tighter scrutiny, including traceability of plantation origins, and pressure on European importers to prove due diligence.

Danger of 'greenwashing' to hide deforestation

Civil society groups in Indonesia have concerns of their own. WALHI (Friends of the Earth Indonesia) — the country's largest and oldest environmental advocacy organization — and Indonesia for Global Justice (IGJ) have both warned that sustainability certification schemes could simply turn into tools of greenwashing, allowing companies to project a "green" image without making meaningful changes on the ground.

The danger is that Indonesian palm oil may pass administrative checks while still leaving behind deforestation, destroying biodiversity, and violating the rights of Indigenous peoples. In other words: palm oil could pass on paper, but continue to damage ecosystems in practice.

IEU-CEPA is more than a trade deal: It is also seen as a test of Indonesia's overall narrative on palm oil.

"If EUDR standards are not met, Indonesia risks being trapped in the negative stigma of palm oil as cheap but environmentally destructive," said Bhima, from the CELIOS think-thank.

Failure, he added, could mean losing access to premium markets, which would in turn force Indonesia to rely on more price-sensitive, lower-value destinations outside the European Union.

Indonesia far behind Malaysia on palm yields

Even with these challenges, the new EU deal gives Indonesia an edge over other ASEAN palm oil exporters, especially Malaysia, which is still negotiating a free-trade deal of its own.

This edge in trade does not automatically translate into market dominance. The Indonesian Ombudsman, an independent state institution that oversees public services, reported that average national palm oil productivity is just 12.8 tons of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) per hectare (around 2.5 acres). This is far below Malaysia's 19 tons per hectare under its Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification, mounting to billions of dollars in loses for Indonesia.

Malaysia also leads in certification standards and logistics efficiency. Yet Bhima pointed out that all ASEAN producers face the same EUDR hurdle.

"Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines must all prove their palm oil is deforestation-free — but, unlike Indonesia, they don't have the incentive of zero tariffs," he said.

Moving beyond palm oil

Expanding Indonesia's exports of crude palm oil will likely provide opportunities for exports of related products such as biodiesel, palm-based cosmetics and chemicals derived from palm oil. However, experts like Bhima warn that the benefits of the EU deal would only be maximized if Jakarta steps up regarding regulation.

"EUDR remains the ultimate test: Without credible sustainability compliance and a trusted traceability system, zero tariffs will be difficult to utilize," Bhima said.

In the end, IEU-CEPA could be a global springboard for Indonesia's palm oil — or a trap that exposes the industry's unresolved environmental and social weaknesses.

[TITLE]Russia-Ukraine War: Trump’s Shift on Kyiv Leaves Europe Feeling on the Hook:
[TEXT]
As Ukraine and its allies absorbed the surprise from Donald Trump ’s newly upbeat view of Kyiv’s prospects in its war against Russia’s invasion, there were signs of a familiar move by the US president — upping the pressure not on Russia but on Europe.

Trump’s social-media post Tuesday reversed his past claims that Ukraine had “no cards to play” in the fight. But he didn’t offer any new US steps to support Kyiv, leaving that up to allies in Europe. The post made no mention of new moves to tighten sanctions on Russia, either.

[TITLE]How Russia's mounting economic woes could force Putin's hand – DW – 09:
[TEXT]
The Russian economy is in trouble. Growth has stalled, energy revenues have plunged, and the budget deficit is growing. If the EU and US step up sanctions, things could get more serious still.

The pressures of the war in Ukraine are starting to bite for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his policymakers in the Kremlin, with Moscow planning tax hikes and spending cuts to deal with its growing budget deficit.

The draft budget for 2026 is expected to be submitted to parliament on September 29. Only minor changes are likely from that point, with Putin having agreed to the main details by then.

On Wednesday (September 25), the government announced plans to raise value added tax to 22% from 20% in a bid to curb the deficit, reneging on a pledge Putin previously made not to raise taxes before 2030.

There is also growing expectation that nondefense spending, including some social spending, will be cut to deal with the mounting pressures caused, largely, by plunging oil revenues.

Russia's budget deficit has grown to around 4.2 trillion rubles ($50 billion, €42.7 billion). That's around 1.9% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) — almost four times the original target of 0.5% for 2025. The finance ministry expects the deficit to reach 5.7 trillion rubles by the end of the year.

However, Elina Ribakova, an expert on the Russian economy with the Kyiv School of Economics, expects Moscow to continue what she says is an established pattern of maintaining high military spending by making cuts elsewhere.

"The consequences are the same as we have seen since 2014," she told DW. "That is: everything else gets cut, the military spending expands. So, education, health care, social spending, environmental protection, all of that gets cut severely."

Russia's massive defense spending hike has put pressure on its budget Image: Russian Defence Ministry/AFP

Chris Weafer, a Moscow-based financial analyst with the consulting firm Macro-Advisory, told DW that budget cuts have been in the offing since Putin signaled them last December.

"We've had a deliberate slowdown in government spending in nonessential areas, which essentially means nonessential military and maybe nonessential social areas," he said.

Flashing red

Russia's economy has been flashing red for a while, a fact seized upon by US President Donald Trump in his social media post of September 24, which expressed strong support for Ukraine.

"Putin and Russia are in big economic trouble and this is the time for Ukraine to act," he wrote on Truth Social.

He also referenced Russia's ongoing fuel crisis. Ukraine's successful drone attacks on Russian energy infrastructure such as refineries and export terminals have led to shortages of multiple fuel grades, rising prices, and long queues.

Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries have contributed to a fuel crisis Image: Russian Emergency Ministry Press Service/AP Photo/picture alliance

A major cause of the overall economic difficulty is the ongoing fall in oil and gas revenues. Soaring oil prices and enthusiastic new buyers in China and India meant Russian energy revenues soared in 2022 and stayed strong in 2023, despite Western sanctions and the EU reducing its dependence.

However, a falling oil price, a stronger ruble, the attacks on refineries and the continued impact of sanctions have all chipped away at the Kremlin's key revenue source. State oil and gas revenues are set to fall by around 23% year-on-year in September, pointing to a darkened economic outlook.

In July, GDP grew by 0.4% year-on-year, indicating a significant cooling. Official forecasts predict growth of 1% this year, well down from 2.5% forecast. This time last year, soaring inflation pointed to an overheating economy, pumped up by massive budget increases on defense spending.

Defense spending has more than quadrupled since 2021, and totalled around 16 trillion roubles in the year to June 2025.

Chris Weafer says the official narrative is that what is happening is a "managed cooling," with the central bank having raised interest rates to curb inflation and reduce soaring consumer spending — a move which has largely worked.

Budget cuts

However, he says the budget is "unsustainably high" and that if it is not significantly pulled back in the next few years — including military spending — it threatens to "destroy this whole narrative of how stable Russia is, and how the economy is fine, and people's lives are unaffected, and everything is grand."

"You would destroy the economy," said Weafer, who believes Putin and the Kremlin are increasingly open to the idea of a peace deal being struck soon because of the growing economic pressure.

"Domestic budget pressure relative to the need to maintain stability is a significant factor, and one that adds to the weight of feeling this has got to end sooner than later," he said.

Why sanctions won't stop Russia To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

Ribakova is not as optimistic. "When they went into the 2022 invasion, they were conscious of the economic costs. They calculated them, and at the political level, they decided it's acceptable," she said.

Secondary sanctions

Given the strains faced by the Russian economy, pressure is growing on the EU and US to significantly strengthen existing sanctions in pursuit of a successful peace negotiation.

Trump has recently called on Europe to do more to completely end its purchases of Russian gas, mostly via liquefied natural gas (LNG). The bloc still purchases Russian oil too, via refined products.

The US has also mulled placing secondary sanctions on countries like India and China, which buy large quantities of Russian oil. Such a move could seriously add to Moscow's economic challenges.

Ribakova thinks now is the time to ramp up pressure on Moscow with more sanctions, as it is clear the economy is as vulnerable as it has been for quite a while.

However, she points to the fact that the heavily sanctioned regimes in Venezuela, North Korea, and Iran remain in power despite economic calamity as evidence that sanctions alone will not save Ukraine.

"Sanctions can fix part of the problems, but they cannot solve all," Ribakova said.

However, Chris Weafer thinks secondary sanctions in particular could force Moscow quickly to the table.

If the US were to put secondary sanctions on the buyers of Russian oil, then that would be very important, he argues.

"If you were to take, say, another 20-30% hit to oil export revenues, then that would tip the budget into unsustainable territory and could force massive changes to the domestic dynamics."

[TITLE]Mars Invests Billions in European Renewable Energy:
[TEXT]
Mars Inc. announced Tuesday that its ten Mars Snacking factories across Europe are now operating entirely on renewable energy sources. The move is a significant step in the company's broader sustainability and decarbonization efforts, which aim for net-zero emissions by 2050.

The shift to renewable power follows a decade of investments in the company's European manufacturing facilities. According to the company, these investments include over $1.6 billion (€1.5 billion) spent over the past five years. The company's strategy involved both direct investments in energy reduction and conversion, as well as the purchase of Guarantees of Origin (GO) certificates to cover remaining electricity and natural gas consumption.

The ten factories are located in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom. These facilities collectively produce approximately 900,000 metric tons of popular confectionery brands annually, including SNICKERS, TWIX, and M&M'S. Around 85% of this production is distributed for consumption within the European region.

This transition comes amid a wider push across the food and beverage industry to reduce its carbon footprint and address consumer demand for more sustainable practices. Many companies are facing pressure from investors and regulators to align their operations with global climate goals. The sourcing of renewable energy, either through direct investment in projects like wind farms or through the purchase of energy certificates, has become a common strategy for corporations to lower their operational emissions.

"At Mars, we believe that the world we want tomorrow starts with how we do business today," said Marc Carena, Regional President for Mars Wrigley. "Therefore, we measure our success not only by financial results, but also by the positive impact we have on people, the planet, and society. Sustainability makes good business sense and is at the heart of our strategy."

The company stated that this development is a key part of its global strategy to achieve its net-zero target by 2050. Mars plans to invest an additional $1.1 billion (€1 billion) in its European manufacturing operations by the end of 2026. This investment is aimed at supporting innovation, economic growth, and the development of modern, energy-efficient infrastructure.
