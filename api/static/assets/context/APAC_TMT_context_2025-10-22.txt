NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. stock market is steadying on Friday, as banks recover some of their sharp losses from the day before, and Wall Street is cruising toward the finish of a winning week.

The S&P 500 rose 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 298 points, or 0.6%, as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% higher.

This week is shaping up to be the best for the S&P 500 since the first of August, but it’s been a roller-coaster ride. Indexes careened through several jarring swings as worries built

While tensions flare with the U.S., China is charting its course for the next five years.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and the country's top leaders, known as the Central Committee, will meet next week from Monday to Thursday for a planning meeting called the "Fourth Plenum."

The gathering reminds the U.S. government, on the verge of possibly its longest shutdown in history, that China is a big believer in planning. Beijing has held the strategy-setting meeting twice every decade since the 1950s to rally the country around specific social and economic goals.

This year, China has promoted its achievements under the "14th five-year plan" despite U.S. pressure on tech and trade.

The upcoming "15th five-year plan" is particularly critical as China has laid out even longer-term ambitions for 2035, said Zong Liang, former chief researcher at the Bank of China. By then, China aims to boost per capita gross domestic product to the mid-range of developed countries, while achieving "major breakthroughs" in core technologies.

But that's getting ahead of the immediate challenges that policymakers will discuss next week: navigating increased U.S. tech restrictions, the possibility of a 100% tariff hike and lackluster domestic demand.

Rather than announce sweeping changes, Beijing is likely to double down on "reforms" to boost domestic demand — from reducing regional business barriers within China to expanding visa access, Zong said.

Following a recent ramp-up of support for high-tech industries, Beijing will likely pledge more support for homegrown semiconductors, artificial intelligence and humanoid robots. Full details aren't expected until the annual parliamentary meeting in March 2026, although a readout of next week's meeting should offer an early look at the exact priorities.

"The technology part of the [plan] should focus on two things: AI, where the adoption rate in key areas is required to reach 90% by 2030; and basic scientific research, which remains some way off the official target," Tianchen Xu, senior economist for Asia for the Economist Intelligence Unit, said in a note.

At a time when the U.S. is scaling back on its climate commitments, China has the next five years to make good on its pledge to start reducing carbon emissions after 2030.

So far, China is falling behind in its aim to reduce its emissions rate, Xu said. "We think that achieving this goal is still possible, but would require more concerted efforts on power market reform, and the weeding out of emission-intensive industries."

[TITLE]Hong Kong exchange sees further growth ahead for record-setting ETF market:
[TEXT]
Bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) expects its exchange-traded fund (ETF) market to continue growing after hitting record turnover and new listings this year, according to a senior executive.

Average daily turnover in ETFs doubled to a record HK$37.8 billion (US$4.8 billion) in the first nine months, as the exchange's 225 ETFs drew an increasing number of investors from mainland China, Asia, the Middle East and Europe.

ETFs are listed index funds that track the performance of stocks or bonds, often providing investors with a basket of assets. They differ from mutual funds in that they trade throughout the day like a stock, whereas mutual funds only trade once a day after the market closes.

Indian stocks rebounded into positive territory on Friday after a weak start, as losses in IT stocks, led by Infosys and Wipro on margin concerns, weighed on early trade. The Sensex and Nifty extended their rally into a third consecutive session, supported by optimism over a recovery in corporate earnings and steady foreign fund inflows.The S&P BSE Sensex rose 102.37 points, or 0.12%, to 83,617.74 in early trade, while the NSE Nifty 50 gained 42.66 points, or 0.16%, to 25,628.85.On the 30-share Sensex, Eternal HCL Technologies , Infosys, Power Grid , and Tech Mahindra were among the top laggards, slipping between 1% and 4%.Broader markets were mixed, with the midcap index down 0.3%, while small-cap shares edged up 0.1%.Among sectors, IT stocks led the decline, with the Nifty IT index falling 1.2% as Wipro and Infosys weighed on sentiment.Wipro fell 4.4% after its second-quarter results missed Street expectations. Infosys dropped nearly 2% even as the company reported a 13% year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 7,364 crore for the September quarter.Eternal shares sank 4% after the food delivery platform reported a 63% decline in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended September.Dr. V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said the market remains “resilient and technically strong,” with price action in leading stocks indicating short covering, noting that “even now there are big shorts in the system and the strength in the market might keep the bears on the back foot, facilitating further short covering.”Vijayakumar said that strong quarterly results from major banks such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank could lend “fundamental support” to the market. “If RIL , which has been a laggard for some time now, also joins the rally, the market can sustain the momentum for some more time,” he said, adding that Muhurat trading and festive sentiment could further “add to the bullish spirits.”However, Vijayakumar cautioned that certain global risks persist. “China has been imposing restrictions on exports of rare earth metals and magnets in recent days,” he said. “China’s weaponisation of rare earths, in which it has around 90% global market share, is in response to Trump’s weaponisation of tariffs. Unfortunately, if this lingers, it will hurt all nations, including India.”Asian stocks fell on Friday, tracking overnight losses on Wall Street as signs of credit stress among U.S. regional banks rattled investor sentiment. Bonds extended their rally, while gold surged to a fresh record high as investors sought safety.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 0.9%, turning lower for the week. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1%, weighed down by a sharp decline in banking stocks.Taiwan’s benchmark slipped 0.9% despite a record quarterly profit and upbeat spending outlook from chipmaker TSMC on artificial intelligence.Chinese blue chips and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index both fell 1.4%, adding to the region’s risk-off tone.Gold touched an all-time high of $4,378 per ounce before easing on profit-taking, though it remains on track for a 7.6% weekly gain—its strongest since early 2020. Silver also climbed to a new record.On the institutional front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their buying spree on October 16, purchasing equities worth a little over Rs 997 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) were net buyers to the tune of Rs 4,076 crore.Oil prices slipped in early trade on Friday, on track for a weekly decline amid uncertainty over global supply dynamics after U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to meet in Hungary to discuss a possible resolution to the war in Ukraine.Brent crude futures dipped 8 cents, or 0.13%, to $60.98 a barrel at 0030 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures eased 9 cents, or 0.16%, to $57.37.The Indian rupee strengthened 21 paise to 87.75 against the U.S. dollar in early trade on Friday, buoyed by what traders described as heavy intervention from the central bank. The dollar index slipped to 98.22, tracking a decline in U.S. Treasury yields.
