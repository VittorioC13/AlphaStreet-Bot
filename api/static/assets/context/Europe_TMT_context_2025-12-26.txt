[TEXT]
UK Law Enforcement Pushed Hard To Maintain Access To Deeply Flawed Facial Recognition Tech

from the but-the-good-stuff-works-too-well! dept

While each iteration presents a chance to improve, there are some very real reasons why facial recognition tech will do a bit of stagnating. And that reason is the biggest market for this tech: law enforcement agencies.

In 2019, the US National Institute for Science and Technology studied 189 different facial recognition algorithms. The results were conclusive: every single one of them performed worse when asked to “recognize” anything other than white male faces. Asians and African Americans were more than 100 times more likely to be misidentified by the tech. While some were a little bit better, the average across the board was bad news for people who’ve already been subjected to decades of biased policing.

Adding tech to existing biases only allows them to compound the inequities faster. That’s something that was pointed out less than a year later to the EU Parliament. Allowing cops to control both the input and the output just means the systems will generate plausible deniability for racist policing, rather than create a playing field that’s a bit more level.

Not only does facial recognition tech have a built-in bias problem, it also seems to have a problem with recognizing faces, no matter what color those faces are. Police forces in the UK have seen this happen repeatedly, racking up alarming false positive rates during tech rollouts. Despite these failures (and the unacknowledged flip side of false positives: false negatives), the UK government has continued to expand facial recognition programs.

The UK’s version of the NIST, the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), performed its own examination of tech currently being used by UK law enforcement. Its conclusions were just as unsurprising:

UK forces use the police national database (PND) to conduct retrospective facial recognition searches, whereby a “probe image” of a suspect is compared to a database of more than 19 million custody photos for potential matches. The Home Office admitted last week that the technology was biased, after a review by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) found it misidentified Black and Asian people and women at significantly higher rates than white men, and said it “had acted on the findings”.

These findings were passed on to law enforcement by the Home Office last September. The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) responded

[TITLE]Yearender: From Green ambition to caution: EU recalibrates climate strategy amid economic headwinds:
[TEXT]
BRUSSELS, Dec. 24 (Xinhua) -- While 2019 marked the European Union's "man on the moon" pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, 2025 may be remembered as the year that ambition slowed. Economic pressure and a renewed emphasis on competitiveness have driven a policy shift that keeps the climate goal enshrined in law but delays, weakens or reshapes the measures meant to deliver it.

According to the Brussels-based Institute for European Environmental Policy, the EU's political language has changed markedly over the past two years, with concepts such as "sustainability" and "just transition" giving way to new priorities including "simplification, flexibility, competitiveness and security."

As a result, the bloc has increasingly focused over the past year on addressing short-term industrial concerns rather than sustaining the pace of its long-term climate transition.

YEAR OF GREEN RETREAT

The EU's flagship Green Deal, designed to transform the bloc's economy, energy and transport systems, has been steadily eroded by exemptions and delays.

Earlier this month, the EU agreed to further postpone the Deforestation Regulation, a landmark law intended to ensure that products sold in the bloc, including coffee, soy, cocoa and rubber, are not linked to forest destruction.

The delay angered major corporations such as Nestle and Ferrero, which had already invested millions of euros to overhaul their supply chains in anticipation of the rules.

Pierre-Jean Sol Brasier, strategic communications adviser at environmental group Fern, described the move as "a caricature of incompetent EU policymaking," warning that it injects uncertainty into markets the regulation was meant to stabilize.

In the automotive sector, pressure from major car-producing countries, notably Germany and Italy, led the European Commission in April to propose a one-time flexibility measure allowing car and van makers to average carbon dioxide emissions over the 2025-2027 period rather than meet annual targets.

The Commission went further last week by scaling back its original plan to effectively ban new combustion-engine cars by 2035. Under the revised proposal, automakers would be required to cut tailpipe emissions by 90 percent from 2021 levels instead of eliminating them entirely, allowing limited sales of internal combustion vehicles, including plug-in hybrids and range extenders, under specific conditions. The Commission also lowered the interim 2030 emissions-reduction target for vans from 50 percent to 40 percent.

COMPETITIVENESS PANIC

To understand why the Green agenda was rolled back, one must look beyond the corridors of the Berlaymont to the balance sheets of Europe's industrial titans. Analysts widely agree that the driving force in 2025 was not climate skepticism, but profound economic anxiety.

As outlined in a report by former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on the future of European competitiveness, Europe is suffering from an innovation agony and is being suffocated by high energy costs, a diagnosis that has since become a central tenet of the European Commission's thinking.

Europe's growth has long depended on energy-intensive industries, but disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict drove energy prices sharply higher. Although prices have eased since their 2022 peak, industrial electricity costs in Europe remain well above those in the United States, continuing to strain manufacturers, particularly in the automotive and industrial machinery sectors.

High energy costs have also raised the price of producing and operating electric vehicles. Automakers including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen have reported declining operating profits over the first three quarters of this year, while

From an uncertain geopolitical environment that created an atmosphere of fear and fragility to the constantly evolving belligerent posture of the world’s two largest economies—the US and China—Indian businesses had to navigate a complex global landscape not only to stay resilient but also to find avenues for growth amid mounting challenges.India Inc had moments of caution, but it also made the most of the situation by recalibrating strategy and approach, choosing to invest time and energy in long-term growth rather than short-term gains. Many of these moves may not appear significant at the moment, as they are unlikely to yield immediate results, but over the longer run, they are expected to prove effective and bear fruit.One of the foremost challenges for India in 2025 was managing its approach towards China. In April, when China halted the supply of critical rare earth metals, essential for chips, weapons, electric vehicles and several other applications — India Inc, particularly automobile giants, knocked on the government’s door to secure supplies. Without intervention, the disruption threatened to derail India’s ambitious electric vehicle adoption plans.As industry flagged concerns, the government swiftly doubled down on diplomatic channels while simultaneously fast-tracking domestic measures. This included accelerated execution of the National Critical Mineral Mission , aimed at reducing regulatory bottlenecks and opening doors for private firms to scale up exploration and processing of rare earths. India also partnered with countries such as Australia, Japan and the US to explore alternative supply-chain routes.Although China partially eased the curbs later, the episode delivered a sharp jolt. It pushed India to prepare for future shocks, and crucial groundwork was laid to strengthen long-term resilience.Despite geopolitical headwinds and global uncertainty, India emerged as the world’s fourth-largest economy in 2025 in terms of GDP. India’s resilience stemmed largely from strong domestic consumption. As a consumption-driven economy, India was less vulnerable to the damage caused by Trump’s tariff war, which hit export-dependent economies like China harder. Manufacturing expansion — particularly in defence exports and a robust digital services sector also boosted investor confidence.GDP growth remained mostly in the 6–7% range, supported by public capital expenditure, services exports and sustained government spending on roads, transport and renewable energy. While corporate capex stayed relatively muted, India Inc’s balance sheets remained healthy.The 2025 Budget marked a decisive shift in India’s tax architecture, with a clear focus on simplifying compliance and boosting consumption. The government recalibrated income-tax slabs under the new regime to broaden the base, simplify compliance and put more disposable income in consumers’ hands.At the same time, the GST framework was streamlined, reducing multiple slabs to just two key rates — 5% and 18%. This not only eased the compliance burden for businesses but also strengthened digitisation and helped sustain business momentum across sectors.Investor confidence in India’s growth story was clearly reflected in a steady pipeline of IPOs on Dalal Street in 2025. From ICICI Prudential AMC — the country’s largest asset management company — to JSW Cement , manufacturing-linked firms such as Saatvik Green Energy and Manas Polymers, and niche industrial SME listings like Bai Kakaji Polymers and Admach, the market saw wide participation.Several marquee IPOs were oversubscribed multiple times, while many delivered healthy listing gains, reinforcing confidence in India’s long-term growth narrative.India witnessed a flurry of announcements and policy action aimed at building a manufacturing ecosystem focused on value addition and supply-chain resilience. Semiconductors gained priority, and incentives expanded under the PLI framework. Auto and EV companies scrambled to secure rare earth supplies from alternative sources, while defence manufacturing received a major boost as export order books swelled.India also sharpened its positioning from ‘Make in India’ to ‘Make in India, for the World’, projecting itself as a credible manufacturing hub capable of challenging China’s dominance. Manufacturing currently contributes about 17% to India’s GDP, but the government has set an ambitious target of raising this share to 25% by 2047. Decisions taken in 2025 — through initiatives such as PLI schemes, Make in India and support for sunrise sectors — are expected to be critical stepping stones.In 2025, trade policy emerged as a core economic tool. India concluded multiple trade agreements to diversify markets and counter tariff pressures. A landmark Free Trade Agreement with the UK was signed mid-year, followed by the finalisation of an FTA with New Zealand in December. India also concluded negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman in August, improving access to Gulf markets.Simultaneously, talks continued with the US, the EU and key Indo-Pacific partners, while ensuring protection for sensitive domestic sectors.As India heads into 2026, the questions are no longer about growth potential but about execution — whether the country can build deep manufacturing ecosystems, secure critical minerals, and strengthen technological capabilities for the long haul.

[TITLE]How Trump's 'crony capitalism' has shaken up U.S. business:
[TEXT]
How Trump's 'crony capitalism' has shaken up U.S. business

toggle caption Pool/Getty Images North America

State capitalism. MAGA Marxism. Crony capitalism.

Those are just some of the terms business and political commentators have used this year to describe how President Trump's policies are reshaping U.S. free-market capitalism. There are some differences in definition — but all of these terms underline how dramatically Trump has blurred the boundaries between business and government, to an extent that could have long-term consequences for the U.S. economy and the country's global standing.

"When the American government appears to favor a company over rival companies, that distorts the marketplace," says Ann Lipton, a veteran business law expert and professor at University of Colorado's law school.

"It means that other firms have less incentive to compete on innovation, which is sort of the opposite of how a free market is supposed to operate," she adds. "It's just bad for the economy."

There's ample evidence this year of Trump actively favoring some U.S. companies and investors, while threatening others. In August, he publicly called for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan — until Tan came to the White House to meet with him, and agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in the tech company.

Sponsor Message

Several other tech CEOs also spent the year appearing to personally court Trump. Take Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who runs the world's most valuable company and is among the donors funding Trump's controversial plans to build a White House ballroom. This month, Trump said the U.S. would grant Nvidia permission to sell one of its more advanced semiconductor chips in China — as long as the U.S. government gets a 25% cut of sales.

Lipton calls this capitalism by "schmoozing," and warns that it could seriously damage the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, thus hurting the overall economy in the long term.

"We're not going to get the best innovations. We're not going to get the best products," she says. "If [businesses] are competing on their ability to schmooze, then that's bad for everybody."

Intel did not respond to an NPR request for comment. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Nvidia said, "In our discussions, President Trump focuses on his desire for America to win as a nation and his efforts to protect national security, American prosperity and technology leadership."

China-style 'state capitalism'

Business leaders have always spent some amount of time trying to cozy up to the White House, no matter its occupant. But Lipton and business insiders across the political spectrum say that Trump's direct influence over private companies this year — and the degree to which some of those companies and their leaders have sought to appeal to him personally — is pushing the U.S. economy away from free-market or "rules-based" capitalism.

Sponsor Message

This system, traditionally embraced by both businesses and Republicans, has helped make the United States into the dominant global economy.

But now, these business insiders say, Trump's policies are creating a government-controlled style of "state capitalism," in which the government — rather than competition between private businesses — shapes the economy. Some go so far as to call it "crony capitalism," meaning that the U.S. government picks winners and losers based on the president's personal relationships.

"We are seeing a shift away from the type of rules-based capitalism that has made America's economy so robust for so long. And there's a lot of risk in that," says Daniella Ballou-Aares, who co-founded the consulting firm Dalberg and served in President Obama's State Department. She now runs the Leadership Now Project, a coalition of business leaders that has endorsed candidates from both political parties.

In October, her group and The Harris Poll surveyed business leaders across the political spectrum — and found that 84% are worried "

[TITLE]AI-linked IPOs in China are exploding. But it's not easy for foreigners to join the party:
[TEXT]
China's hottest artificial-intelligence listings are delivering eye-popping gains.

Shares of chipmaker MetaX Integrated Circuits skyrocketed almost 700% in their Shanghai market debut last week, while Moore Threads soared over 400% on its first day of trading earlier this month.

While domestic investors scramble for exposure to promising Chinese tech listings, overseas investors are largely left out from partaking in such blockbuster offerings.

Foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs: "It's not even possible. Unless they open up an account with a Chinese broker," said Chris Zhang, executive director at Chinese financial services firm China Fortune Securities Company.

Opening an onshore brokerage account with a Chinese securities firm requires a linked Chinese bank account, which generally requires a proof of residence in China, or a Chinese visa with sufficient validity. Foreigners also need to already hold other mainland-listed shares before being eligible to participate in an IPO lottery.

Most foreign banks do not have the necessary arrangements with Chinese brokers to support account openings, Zhang said, making the process unworkable for the vast majority of overseas retail investors.

Official guidance from Shanghai's city government states that only a narrow set of foreign individuals can directly open brokerage accounts for A-shares — stocks listed in mainland China. For example, foreigners with permanent resident status, workers in China, or foreigners working abroad with equity incentive plans in A-share listed companies.

For many global investors, Stock Connect, a program that allows Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges mutual access to each other's stocks, is the most convenient way to gain exposure to Chinese equities.

It allows overseas investors to buy A-shares through their Hong Kong brokers without needing an onshore account, or special licenses— but the scheme offers little help when it comes to IPOs, or even freshly listed stocks. Access also depends on Hong Kong brokers' eligibility requirements, such as minimum account balances and risk disclosures.

"Stock Connect does not work because newly listed stocks are not included in Stock Connect as yet. Usually it takes a few weeks to months should the stocks qualify," said Theodore Shou, chief investment officer at Skybound Capital.

Inclusion of companies in the Stock Connect scheme depends on whether a stock meets the eligibility rules such as sufficient trading activity and market value, which often requires a period of trading and data history for qualifying.

[TITLE]Britain’s Top CEOs Predict the Biggest Challenges of 2026:
[TEXT]
The bosses of some of Britain’s biggest companies predict a fresh wave of challenges next year, as they absorb the impact Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves’ tax-raising budget in November.

Chief executive officers in sectors including finance, housing, gambling and hospitality told Bloomberg they’re bracing for artificial intelligence trust issues, more cyberattacks and pressure to build on Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government. Cost cuts will also be on the agenda, according to one.

“The cyberattacks that crippled companies like Marks & Spencer Group Plc and Jaguar Land Rover in 2025 will ‘inspire cyber criminals to go even further in the coming year,'” according to Adrian Cox, CEO of Beazley Plc.

Having contended with a year of higher taxes, a stagnating domestic economy, US tariffs and fears of an AI bubble, here’s what they think 2026 has in store:

Richard Oldfield, Schroders Plc

Next year will be when people stop talking and start doing when it comes to adopting artificial intelligence to boost businesses, the asset management firm’s CEO said. “If we don’t see increasing productivity and increasing profits because of that change, then you’ve really got to question actually whether it’s enabling the transformation that everyone’s talking about.”

Oldfield called for the UK to invest in itself and support the stock exchange so it can attract more foreign capital. While more listings next year — following a disappointing 2025 — would be “phenomenal,” investors need to actively allocate in those initial public offerings.

“We can give up or we can come out fighting and we, great British companies, are going to come out fighting,” he said.

Tim Martin, JD Wetherspoon Plc

“Survival” will be a key theme next year, according to the pub chain’s chairman, as hospitality companies grapple with increased costs including from a rise in employer taxes. “Any hiccup in sales will lead to real problems,” said Martin, who is a regular critic of the government in his stock exchange statements.

Given “there is a lot of disenchantment” around the government’s approach to business, Martin predicted a push in 2026 to persuade Labour to “change tack and to understand the benefits of a pro-enterprise philosophy.”

Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone Group Plc

Next year will see AI make “real impacts to customer experience,” the telecommunications group’s CEO predicted. With chatbots becoming fully-fledged customer agents, human staff will then be left to resolve more complex or delicate issues.

“The most successful UK companies will be those that not only invest in high-quality AI technology, but at the same time focus on their ability to deliver excellent human, personalized care when it matters most,” she said.

Adrian Blair, Trustpilot Group Plc

Sticking with that theme, the rise of AI means “trust will be harder to earn” in 2026, the head of the reviews site predicted.

Still, after two decades working in the internet sector, he’s confident AI isn’t a bubble and will bring “far-reaching and generally positive consequences.”

“The elements of the AI jigsaw puzzle, they’re all going to get better at once: chips, data models, the tooling,” he said. “People underestimate how much impact it’s going to have if you put all of this together.”

Adrian Cox, Beazley Plc

The cyberattacks that crippled companies like Marks & Spencer Group Plc and Jaguar Land Rover in 2025 will “inspire cyber criminals to go even further in the coming year,” according to the boss of the insurer.

Businesses need a “mindset shift from panic to resilience,” making them better prepared to respond to what has morphed from a basic IT challenge to a “board-level imperative,” Cox said.

Stella David, Entain Plc

Less than a year into David’s role as boss of Ladbrokes’ parent company, betting companies were hit with higher taxes in Reeves’ budget.

This poses “real risks which threaten high-street jobs and investment, and create conditions where the black market will thrive at the expense of responsible operators,” she said. Operators have already warned of job cuts and store closures, while William Hill owner Evoke Plc is considering a potential sale.

Still, David is optimistic, in part because of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Gambling companies will likely reap benefits from the football tournament in Mexico, Canada and the US, where operators have grown in recent years.

Eduardo Landin, Hochschild Mining Plc

The CEO of the gold and silver miner expects a continued rally in precious metals prices, which was spurred by supply shortages and growing demand as investors sought safe-haven assets in a geopolitically turbulent year.

For the mining sector, companies will focus on boosting margins to capitalize on this as much as possible. “It’s very good in terms of prices, but it gives us a lot of pressure in terms of reducing costs,” Landin said. “Otherwise, you’re not taking the opportunity the prices are giving you.”

Richard Houston, Deloitte UK

Cost cuts will continue to dominate businesses’ attention in the new year, according to the UK CEO of the professional services company. The emergence of steady economic growth and policy stability should revive confidence in the second half of 2026, he said.

Volatility in global trade will however persist, Houston said. He urged the UK to forge stronger links with Europe to spur growth and create jobs, as the country marks a decade from its vote to exit the EU.

Jennie Daly, Taylor Wimpey Plc

The housebuilder’s boss predicted continued momentum in planning reform, kickstarted this year by Labour. But she’d like to see see better support for first-time buyers.

“The cumulative regulatory burden and the deposit barrier remain key blockers to housing delivery and demand,” Daly said.

[TITLE]Sama X to commence operations in Jordan with Starlink services:
[TEXT]
Concluding a strong year for the Elon Musk-led satellite operator, recently authorised Starlink global reseller Sama X has secured licensing from Jordan’s Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) to resell the Space X firm’s satellite internet services across the Kingdom, in a bid to simplify access to high-speed internet.

Launched earlier in 2025 and backed by Kuwaiti conglomerate Alghanim, the reseller’s stated mission is to bring “innovative” satellite connectivity solutions to businesses “right where they are” across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

The company said it specialises in delivering high-speed, low-latency satellite internet and connectivity services “designed to overcome digital barriers and ensure seamless connectivity” and that its partnership with Starlink enables it to take advantage of the latter’s low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, providing “world-class” connectivity to a diverse range of markets and enterprises.

Sama X also offers turnkey solutions – from customer consultation to rapid installation and activation – as well as local support, including a 24/7 call centre in English and Arabic.

The deal will see Sama X serve professionals, enterprises and public sector organisations across Jordan, addressing critical connectivity needs in remote regions of the Kingdom, from providing non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with dependable internet in camps, to expanding digital government services to rural communities. The LEO satellite solutions will look to enable reliable primary or backup connectivity across the nation, allowing businesses and communities to operate more effectively and with confidence.

“Jordan, with its diverse economy and terrain, presents unique opportunities for latest-generation satellite broadband solutions that combine Starlink’s LEO constellation with our local market expertise and value-add. Whether it is a classroom in Tafileh, a logistics convoy near Ma’an, or a refugee clinic in Mafraq, everyone can benefit from the same high-speed internet enjoyed in the capital, Amman,” said Sama X CEO Amit Somani, commenting on the move.

“We are thankful to Jordan’s Telecommunications Regulatory Commission for establishing a conducive environment that allows companies like Sama X to operate effectively. We look forward to collaborating with local stakeholders to advance the Kingdom’s Economic Modernisation Vision through ubiquitous and reliable connectivity.”

The Sama X deal comes just days after research found that Starlink connectivity doubled in 2025, including traffic from more than 20 new countries and regions. The study analysed aggregate request traffic volumes associated with Starlink’s primary autonomous system (AS14593) to track the growth in usage of the service throughout the past 12 months. The request volume shown in the study found traffic from Starlink continued to see consistent growth throughout 2025, with total request volume up 2.3 times across the year. The data also suggested Starlink tended to see rapid traffic growth when its service became available in a country or region, and that trend continued in 2025.

The satellite provider also enjoyed a range of contract wins in 2025 with airlines across the world to provide in-flight connectivity. These wins include Qatar Airways and Emirates. The former claims to be the operator of the largest number of Starlink-equipped widebody aircraft and the only carrier in the MENA region currently offering Starlink in-flight connectivity.

Not to be outdone, Emirates announced in November 2025 that it would deploy Starlink Wi-Fi across its entire in-service fleet, in a move that will bring fast connectivity to 232 Boeing 777 and Airbus A380 aircraft.

[TITLE]Regulators Question How Big Tech Uses AI to Shape Markets:
[TEXT]
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly embedding itself into the core decision-making systems of modern businesses, from pricing and marketing to supply chain management and customer targeting. As AI tools move from experimental add-ons to operational infrastructure, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are focusing on how algorithmic decision-making could reshape competition, sometimes in ways that bypass traditional antitrust guardrails. The concern is no longer limited to whether companies explicitly collude, but whether AI systems themselves can produce market outcomes that look and feel anticompetitive.

Those risks are outlined in a recent analysis by Steptoe, which examines how the expanded use of AI is widening the aperture of antitrust exposure beyond the well-worn debate over algorithmic price fixing. While U.S. and EU regulators have spent years scrutinizing whether shared pricing tools could facilitate unlawful coordination, the firm argues that AI’s competitive impact extends far further into areas such as market allocation, personalized pricing, predatory strategies and data-driven monopolization .

The post points to recent enforcement actions as early signals of how regulators are thinking

[TITLE]Georgia Regulators Approve Huge Electric Generation Increase for Data Centers:
[TEXT]
Georgia’s only private electric utility plans to increase power capacity by 50% after state regulators on Friday agreed 5-0 that the plan is needed to meet projected demand from data centers.

It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence. The construction cost would be $16.3 billion, but staff members say customers will pay $50 billion to $60 billion over coming decades, including interest costs and guaranteed profit for the monopoly utility.

Georgia Power Co. and the Public Service Commission pledge large users will more than pay for their costs, and that spreading fixed costs over more customers, could help significantly cut residents’ power bills beginning in 2029.

“Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that’s a great result for Georgians,” Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said in a statement after the vote.

But opponents say the five elected Republicans on the commission are greenlighting a risky bet by the utility to chase data center customers with existing ratepayers left holding the bag if demand doesn’t materialize.

“The need for 10,000 megawatts of new capacity resources on the system in the next six years isn’t here,” said Bob Sherrier, a lawyer representing some opponents. “It just isn’t, and it may never be.”

The approval came less than two months after voters rebuked GOP leadership, ousting two incumbent Republicans on the commission in favor of Democrats by overwhelming margins. Those two Democrats won in campaigns that centered on six Georgia Power rate increases commissioners have allowed in recent years, even though the company agreed to a three-year rate freeze in July.

Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson — the Democrats who will take office Jan. 1 — opposed Friday’s vote. But current commissioners refused to delay.

Electric bills have emerged as a potent political issue in Georgia and nationwide, with grassroots opposition to data centers partly based on fears that other customers will subsidize power demands of technology behemoths.

Georgia Power is the largest unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. It says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity — enough to power 4 million Georgia homes — with 80% of that flowing to data centers. The company has 2.7 million customers today, including homes, businesses and industries.

Whether the company’s projections of a huge increase in demand will pan out has been the central argument. Georgia Power and commission staff agreed Dec. 9 to allow the company to build or acquire all the desired capacity, despite staff earlier saying the company’s forecast included too much speculative construction.

In return, the company agreed that after the current rate freeze ends in 2028, it would use revenue from new customers to place “downward pressure” on rates through 2031. That would amount to at least $8.50 a month, or $102 a year, for a typical residential customer. That customer currently pays more than $175 a month, including taxes.

“So we’re taking advantage of the upsides from this additional revenue, but allow it to shift the downside and the risk over to the company. And I’m real proud of that,” Commission Chairman Jason Shaw said after the vote.

But “downward pressure” doesn’t guarantee a rate decrease.

“It doesn’t mean your bills are going down,” said Liz Coyle, executive director of consumer group Georgia Watch. “It means that maybe they’re not going up as fast.”

Existing customers would pay for part of the construction program that doesn’t serve data centers. More importantly, opponents fear Georgia Power’s pledge of rate relief can’t be enforced, or won’t hold up over the 40-plus years needed to pay off new natural-gas fired power plants.

In a Monday news conference, Hubbard likened it to a mortgage “to build a massive addition to your home for a new roommate, big tech.”

“If in 10 years, the AI bubble bursts or the data centers move to a cheaper state, then the roommate moves out, but the mortgage doesn’t go away,” he said.

Staff members say the commission must watch demand closely and that if data centers don’t use as much power as projected, Georgia Power must drop agreements to purchase wholesale power, close its least efficient generating plants and seek additional customers.

Many opponents oppose any new generation fueled by natural gas, warning carbon emissions will worsen climate change. Some opponents were escorted out of the commission meeting by police after they began chanting “Nay! Nay! Nay! The people say nay!”

“Increased natural gas output for the sake of these silicon billionaire kings seems like a lose-lose,” opponent Zak Norton told commissioners Friday.
