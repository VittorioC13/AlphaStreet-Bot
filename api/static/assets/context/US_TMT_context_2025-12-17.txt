[TITLE]Nvidia buys AI software provider SchedMD to expand open-source AI push:
[TEXT]
Dec 15 (Reuters) - Nvidia said on Monday it acquired AI software firm SchedMD, as the chip designer doubles down on open-source technology ​and steps up investments in the artificial intelligence ecosystem to fend off ‌rising competition.

The chip designer built its reputation on speedy chips, but it also offers a range ‌of its own AI models, from physics simulations to self-driving vehicles, as open-source software that researchers and companies can use.

Its proprietary CUDA software, a standard among most developers, is a major selling point for its chips, making software key to ⁠maintaining its dominance in the ‌AI industry.

Nvidia shares were up 1.35% after the news and an earlier announcement of new open-source AI models.

SchedMD provides software ‍that helps schedule large computing jobs that can occupy a big share of a data center's server capacity.

Its technology, called Slurm, is open source, meaning developers and firms can ​access it for free, while the company sells engineering and maintenance support.

Financial terms ‌of the deal were not disclosed. Nvidia said it would continue to distribute SchedMD's software on an open-source basis.

"Slurm, which is supported on the latest Nvidia hardware, is also part of the critical infrastructure needed for generative AI, used by foundation model developers and AI builders to manage model training and inference ⁠needs," Nvidia said in a blog post.

Earlier ​on Monday, Nvidia unveiled a new family of ​open-source AI models that it says will be faster, cheaper and smarter than its previous offerings, as it faces a growing wave ‍of rival open-source ⁠models from Chinese AI labs.

SchedMD was founded in 2010 by Slurm software developers Morris "Moe" Jette and Danny Auble in Livermore, California, and the company ⁠currently employs 40 people, according to its website.

Its customers include cloud infrastructure firm CoreWeave and ‌the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, among others.

[TITLE]Goldman Sachs leads investment in software delivery startup Harness at $5.5 billion valuation:
[TEXT]
Jyoti Bansal, co-founder and CEO of Harness, speaks at the company's Unscripted conference in London on Sept. 25, 2025.

Almost nine years ago, Jyoti Bansal sold AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion just as the software startup was set to go public.

Bansal's latest venture, Harness, is now worth substantially more than that, after raking in $200 million in fresh capital at a $5.5 billion valuation in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs .

Harness' technology helps companies manage and monitor code that's produced with the help of artificial intelligence, making sure it doesn't break, create security vulnerabilities or trigger cost overruns. It's a compliment to the so-called vibe coding trend that's taken off with the boom in generative AI.

In recent months, venture capitalists have poured money into startups such as Cursor, Lovable and most recently Kilo Code that sell subscriptions for tools for directing AI models to write and update software. Harness' software draws on models from Anthropic and OpenAI.

Earlier this year, Bansal bolstered Harness' cybersecurity chops by merging the startup with Traceable, another company he co-founded. The combined company, based in San Francisco, has a total of about 1,300 employees.

Harness is on track to exceed its goal of more than $250 million in annualized revenue, growing more than 50% year over year, Bansal said. That makes it larger than AppDynamics at the time it was acquired by Cisco.

Bansal is aiming for a different outcome this time.

"I'm a believer that at the right market timing, we want to operate as a public company, so we can build for the long term," Bansal said.

In addition to the funding round, Harness is also planning a $40 million tender offer to provide some liquidity to long-standing employees.

[TITLE]Exclusive-AI software startup Harness valued at $5.5 billion in latest financing round:
[TEXT]
Dec 11 : Harness, an AI software development startup, has raised $200 million in a Goldman Sachs-led fundraising round that values it at $5.5 billion, the company said on Thursday.

The financing marks a 49 per cent jump in the firm's valuation nearly four years after a Series-D round valued it at $3.7 billion.

Private market investors continue to plough into artificial intelligence as the nascent technology promises to universally automate structured and repetitive corporate and tech tasks.

Harness is also planning a $40 million tender offer with participation from existing investors IVP, Menlo Ventures and Unusual Ventures.

"We were not looking to actively raise capital right now," Harness Cofounder and CEO Jyoti Bansal told Reuters in an interview.

"But we had a lot of investor interest. So a lot of people were coming and reaching out to us, and that's what kind of created this financing," he said.

As boardrooms look to use AI to aid, and sometimes to replace, expensive software engineers, the velocity and volume of code being written has dramatically accelerated.

Harness has been benefiting from this shift, as it offers workflow AI tools that develop written code into practical use cases.

Its customers include National Australia Bank, Morningstar and United Airlines, whose deployment times accelerated by 75 per cent after using its tools, Harness said.

Major U.S. lenders JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have been vocal about AI-fueled productivity gains, are not only customers but also investors in Harness.

The blurring lines between client and owner labels across AI startups have led to comparisons with dotcom-era financing structures.

"We have very strong collaborative partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and AWS," Bansal said.

[TITLE]AI infrastructure selloff continues on Wall Street as Broadcom, Oracle shares slide:
[TEXT]
In at least one corner of the artificial intelligence market, sentiment has turned decidedly negative.

Broadcom , CoreWeave and Oracle , three companies intimately tied to the AI infrastructure buildout, all had another rough day on Wall Street on Monday after selling off sharply last week.

While the three stocks are all still solidly up for the year — CoreWeave held its market debut in March — the most recent trend suggests that investors are concerned about whether the returns on investment will ever justify the level of spending taking place.

"It definitely requires the ROI to be there to keep funding this AI investment," Matt Witheiler, head of late-stage growth at Wellington Management, told CNBC's "Money Movers" on Monday. "From what we've seen so far that ROI is there."

Witheiler said the bullish side of the story is that, "every single AI company on the planet is saying if you give me more compute I can make more revenue."

Still, the market was displeased last week with quarterly earnings reports from chipmaker Broadcom and cloud infrastructure supplier Oracle, even though both companies beat on revenue and issued forecasts showing that AI demand is soaring.

[TITLE]Top IT predictions in APAC in 2026:
[TEXT]
Much of the technology developments in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region in 2026 are expected to be shaped by the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI). For example, instead of adopting one-size-fits-all cloud and AI strategies, enterprises will prioritise sovereign architectures where data residency is a competitive advantage rather than a compliance box-ticking exercise.

Cyber security will also come under the spotlight, with enterprises getting ready for next-generation cyber threats enabled by AI, such as vibe hacking, where AI-crafted messages mimic the tone and trust of executives in the organisation. They will also be gearing up to secure AI agents through governance practices built for autonomous systems, rather than retrofitting human-centric models.

In this round-up, we review the key IT trends, including AI and other developments, that are likely to play out across APAC in 2026.

From Singapore’s digital sovereignty framework to India’s Data Protection Act, cloud sovereignty has become a focus for countries that want greater control over their technology future. Analyst Forrester expects that by 2026,

[TITLE]Mint Explainer | Trai proposes a cut in microwave spectrum charges: What it means for telecom firms:
[TEXT]
Last week, India’s telecom regulator proposed cutting the charges operators pay to use a set of airwaves known as microwave spectrum. These airwaves are not used by consumers directly. Instead, they serve as backhaul—connecting mobile towers to the core network so calls, data, video streaming and messaging work seamlessly.

The proposal by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) seeks to rationalise how this backhaul spectrum is priced and assigned, arguing that operators have long been paying disproportionately high charges for what is essentially enabling infrastructure. If accepted by the department of telecommunications (DoT), the changes would lower network rollout costs and offer limited but meaningful financial relief to telecom companies.

Mint breaks down the development.

Why microwave backhaul matters

Every video call or movie stream depends on an invisible network backbone. Microwave backhaul spectrum forms a critical part of that backbone, particularly in India, where fibre connectivity remains uneven. In areas with patchy or unviable optical fibre coverage, microwave backhaul allows operators to rollout out 4G and 5G, expand rural broadband, and support public Wi-Fi networks.

The scale of the problem is evident in government data. As of March, only 46.09% of India’s mobile towers were connected to the core network through optical fibre, a process known as tower fibreisation. As data traffic rises sharply, this gap has made backhaul spectrum indispensable for handling higher network loads.

Despite its importance, policy around backhaul spectrum has remained unclear. There was no settled framework on whether it should be auctioned, administratively assigned or delicensed. In practice, spectrum was allotted provisionally, but at charges operators say were too high to justify widespread use.

What Trai has recommended

On 10 December, Trai submitted recommendations to the DoT on how microwave backhaul spectrum should be assigned and priced. These cover traditional backhaul bands—6 GHz (lower), 7 GHz, 13 GHz, 15 GHz, 18 GHz and 21 GHz—as well as higher-frequency E-band and V-band spectrum.

The regulator’s aim is to create a simplified, affordable and flexible framework to support rapid mobile network expansion, particularly after the launch of 5G in October 2022. Since then, mobile data traffic has grown by 75%, sharply increasing demand for backhaul capacity.

In many cases, microwave backhaul has become the preferred option for connecting new base stations where laying fibre is difficult or uneconomical.

Taking reference from the Telecommunications Act, 2023, Trai has recommended that backhaul spectrum be assigned without auction. The most significant change is a reduction in spectrum usage charges (SUC) by up to 55% in certain microwave bands. Trai has proposed a uniform SUC of 0.1% per carrier, replacing what it described as a non-linear pricing structure that was “simply not justified".

The regulator’s reasoning is straightforward: backhaul spectrum does not generate revenue on its own. It is an enabling input, not a consumer-facing asset. Pricing it like access spectrum, Trai argued, distorts network economics and inflates rollout costs.

Trai has also recommended that there be no rollout obligations attached to backhaul spectrum assignments across traditional bands, E-band or V-band. The spectrum would be assigned for five years, with a possible extension of up to two years. To improve transparency, Trai has proposed an online portal for assignment and renewal, with a comprehensive database of all block-based and link-based spectrum allocations.

How much telecom operators could gain

If the DoT accepts Trai’s recommendations, telecom operators are expected to see modest financial benefits. Analysts at IIFL Capital estimate that the potential Ebitda uplift would be less than 1% for Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, while Vodafone Idea could see an upgrade of around 1.5%. The improvement would come from annual savings on spectrum usage charges.

The numbers underscore the limited but tangible nature of the relief. In FY25, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and Reliance Jio together paid ₹4,068 crore in SUC to the government. Of this, ₹3,051 crore was for backhaul spectrum alone. Had Trai’s proposal been in place, operators would have saved

Midsize Indian IT companies reported their fastest market share gains in the first half of this fiscal year, when their large rivals lost some ground as the pricing environment among service providers becomes increasingly competitive, according to industry analysts.Brokerage BNP Paribas in a report said key mid- and small-cap firms’ market share grew by 22 basis points (0.22 percentage point) from a year earlier in the first half when the top six India-based IT services companies lost an aggregate 40 bps.According to ICICI Securities, the market share gains for midcaps were likely to improve, given their ability to enter and disrupt services, leveraging generative artificial intelligence and agentic AI and the potential in providing better client engagement to the top 10–20 clients that account for 40–60% of revenue.“Midcaps initially focused on select verticals, acquired good customers and clocked their growth. Now they have good cash balances and have moved to acquisitions. They have also increased their geographical presence and added new verticals,” said Sumit Pokharna, vice president of fundamental research at Kotak Securities. “These small changes have helped them sustain growth.”The larger base of clients that global or Indian IT service giants operate in makes it hard for them to grow at a fast pace in the current environment, where geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties are weighing on discretionary spending, he said. “So even as deal wins grow, they also need to be executed and converted into revenue.”IT service contracts have had their prices discounted around 20% this year, with companies being pushed to give outcome-based pricing to factor in efficiency gains from AI-led services, further pressuring the market share of the top companies.“Midsized companies focus on the mid-market segment or smaller firms (clients), which is growing faster than the large-company segment. Their proactive chief executives and specialised service offerings ensure their win,” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, executive chairman of the US-based consultancy firm Everest Group.Companies in the midcap segment, such as Coforge , Persistent Systems, LTIMindtree and Mphasis , recorded 2-6% year-on-year growth in incremental revenue in the first half of FY26, according to ICICI Securities, faster than their share gain seen between FY20 and FY25.Accenture and Cognizant are outliers in the top-tier pack, posting 48% and 26% growth, respectively.“We have the breadth of a big company and the agility of a small one. That is helping us to win, because clients want to work with companies that actually have cutting-edge investment into the future,” Cognizant chief executive Ravi Kumar S told ET during a recent interaction, referring to the company winning market share.Meanwhile, Infosys and HCLTech's incremental revenue grew by 14% and 13%, respectively, ICICI Securities said in a report. Sector leader Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro posted a 10% and 3% fall in incremental revenue, respectively, while it was stagnant for Tech Mahindra

[TITLE]Tech giants offload AI boom risks to smaller companies:
[TEXT]
Meta is investing billions of dollars in new data centres, such as the one (above) being constructed in Eagle Mountain, Utah.

– This autumn , Microsoft announced a series of deals , totalling tens of billions of dollars, to lease computer power for its artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions. Meta secured almost US$30 billion (S$38.7 billion) in financing to build a massive data centre in Louisiana without taking on the debt itself. Google also committed to renting computing power from a small company and then selling some of it to OpenAI.

Those deals had one thing in common: They allowed companies that make massive quarterly profits to reduce their financial exposure to the frenetic, global build-up of data centres.
