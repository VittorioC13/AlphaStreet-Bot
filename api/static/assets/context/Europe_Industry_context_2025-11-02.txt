[TITLE]GlobalFoundries Plans Billion-Euro Investment to Expand Chip Manufacturing in Germany:
[TEXT]
GlobalFoundries (GF) today announced plans to invest €1.1 billion to expand its manufacturing capabilities at its Dresden, Germany site. The investment will enable a production capacity increase to more than one million wafers per year by the end of 2028, making it the largest site of its kind in Europe.The expansion, known as project SPRINT, is expected to be supported by the German federal government and the State of Saxony under the framework of the European Chips Act, with EU approval for the full program expected later this year. This investment underscores Saxony's role as a critical hub for semiconductor manufacturing and innovation and reinforces Europe's strategic goal of supply chain resilience.As a part of the project, the facility will be upgraded to offer end-to-end European processes and data flows for critical semiconductor security requirements.Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as part of his visit to GF Dresden on 28 October, welcomed the planned investments in Germany: "The SPRINT project is a commitment to Germany as an industrial and innovation location - and above all to the sovereignty of our country and Europe. The investment in chip manufacturing in Dresden sends a signal that Germany wants to play an active role in shaping the development of the global semiconductor market. Germany already plays a leading role in microelectronics in Europe. With its national microelectronics strategy, the federal government is setting the course for further expanding this strength."Saxony's Minister President Michael Kretschmer adds: "The further expansion of semiconductor manufacturing here at GlobalFoundries is a clear commitment to a unique location. The billion-euro investment is more good news for Silicon Saxony, Europe's most important microelectronics location, and demonstrates the attractiveness and dynamism of the cluster that has grown here. This will not only strengthen the Saxon economy—Germany and Europe will also benefit. After all, more chips manufactured here also means more German and European sovereignty and technological independence in this key industry. Germany's economic vulnerability due to excessive dependencies is currently being demonstrated by the example of chip manufacturer Nexperia."The new manufacturing capacity will focus on GF's highly differentiated technologies - with critical performance features including low power, embedded secure memory, and wireless connectivity - all essential for meeting Europe's chip demand for automotive, internet of things (IoT), defense and critical infrastructure applications. These sectors are being rapidly transformed by the rise of physical AI technologies for which GF's semiconductors are essential. The investment will also support continued innovation in next-generation compute architectures and quantum technologies as they scale into the next decade."Recent disruptions in the automotive sector underscore just how vulnerable global chip supply chains truly are. Our planned expansion in Dresden is yet another step in GF's strategy to address these challenges head-on and deliver on our commitment to support Europe's need for secure supply chains and differentiated technologies," said Tim Breen, CEO of GlobalFoundries. "By scaling our manufacturing footprint in Europe, in the U.S. and around the world, GF is reinforcing its role as a resilient and trusted partner to customers in critical industries and building a foundation for the next wave of innovation as physical AI becomes reality."Dr. Manfred Horstmann, senior vice president and general manager European fabs at GlobalFoundries, adds: "With this planned investment, we are deepening our commitment to Germany and Europe. Expanding cleanroom capacity is not just

[TITLE]Development Finance Must Shift Away from Aid:
[TEXT]
As traditional donors slash foreign-aid budgets, developing countries must mobilize a broader range of financing sources. National development banks, sovereign wealth funds, debt swaps, and public-private partnerships can foster sustainable investment and help reduce energy poverty.

BEIJING – Traditional donors have sharply scaled back their aid commitments to developing countries over the past year. Some, like the United States, have virtually eliminated their aid programs. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), official development assistance (ODA) from member countries declined by 7.1% in 2024, its first annual drop in six years.

This trend was not limited to a few major donors. Of the 33 members of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC), 22 slashed their aid budgets, and only four countries met the United Nations’ target of allocating 0.7% of gross national income to ODA.

The outlook for the coming year offers little hope for improvement, as major DAC donors have announced additional cuts. Most notably, US President Donald Trump’s administration has suspended most foreign aid and dismantled the Agency for International Development (USAID), which dispersed most US government aid dollars.

Meanwhile, the United Kingdom plans to reduce aid spending from 0.5% of GNI to 0.3% by 2027. Similar retrenchment across Europe and North America is reshaping international assistance, disrupting humanitarian and climate-related programs, and creating financing gaps in critical sectors such as health, education, and clean energy.

In our 2017 book Going Beyond Aid, we urged developing-country governments to reduce their dependence on foreign aid, not only because it was becoming an unreliable source of funding, but also because other, better ways of financing development were becoming more available. That message is more urgent than ever.

As reliance on aid becomes untenable, the international community must mobilize a broader array of financing sources to advance green and sustainable growth. This includes national development banks, industrial investment funds, sovereign wealth funds, and institutional investment in public markets, as well as innovative mechanisms such as debt swaps and public-private partnerships (PPPs). These tools can unlock domestic resources, attract long-term investors, and create synergies between public goals and private capital.

Equity investment offers a promising avenue for engaging non-traditional development partners while reducing developing countries’ dependence on debt. Government investment funds, public and private financial institutions, and other private actors can participate by taking equity stakes in public enterprises, financing infrastructure projects, or joining PPPs. Such participation not only alleviates debt burdens but also improves the performance and management of public assets.

As government-funded, mission-driven institutions, public development banks (PDBs) have the potential to provide patient capital for green and sustainable investment in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs). Building on the pioneering database of public development and financial institutions created by the Institute of New Structural Economics at Peking University, future research can identify effective ways to harness these institutions to fuel low-carbon growth.

Responding to growing demand from the economies of the Global South, development partners have increasingly adopted an “entire value chain” approach to the green transition in recent years. This strategy facilitates transfers of low-carbon technologies, diffusion of digital innovations (including trade in services), and industrial modernization, enabling countries included in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to accelerate their shift toward sustainable development.

Empirical research supports this approach. An analysis covering 139 countries finds that, following policy directives to incorporate green and low-carbon principles into the BRI, carbon intensity (CO ₂ emissions per unit of GDP) among participating countries declined significantly between 2013 and 2022. These findings are consistent with another recent study showing how China’s solar-energy expansion has helped transform Africa’s power sector.

Investment in infrastructure and industrial development can also generate positive spillover effects. Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa shows that the presence of at least one Chinese-financed infrastructure project in a second-order administrative region (comparable to a municipality) is associated with a 5% increase in nighttime luminosity – a widely used proxy for economic activity. Neighboring regions experienced a 10-15% rise in luminosity, indicating that the benefits of such projects extend well beyond the immediate investment site.

These outcomes underscore the critical role of infrastructure investment, particularly in energy and transportation projects. By improving electricity access, affordability, and connectivity, they reduce energy poverty, bolster public services, and stimulate economic activity in underserved areas.

To meet the evolving challenges of development finance, both traditional and non-traditional donors and creditors should move beyond aid and adopt multidimensional strategies that combine trade, investment, infrastructure, green technology, and digital connectivity, including fintech solutions, to support EMDEs. Importantly, such collaborations should be viewed as a mutual learning process in which partners assume complementary roles and shared responsibilities.

[TITLE]CH Robinson (CHRW) Touches Fresh Record on Double-Digit Profit Gain, Bullish Outlook:
[TEXT]
We recently published 10 Stocks with Outstanding Gains; 9 on Record Highs. CH Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) is one of the best-performing stocks on Thursday.

CH Robinson surged to a fresh record high on Thursday, as investor sentiment was bolstered by a double-digit surge in net profits and a higher growth outlook for full-year 2026.

At intra-day trading, the stock soared to its highest price of $158.70 before paring gains to end the day just up by 19.71 percent at $154.88 apiece.

In an updated report, CH Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) said that it was able to grow its net income by 68 percent to $163 million from $97 million in the same period last year, on the back of a higher operating income due to a decrease in operating expenses.

Revenues, on the other hand, dropped by 10.9 percent to $4.1 billion from $4.6 billion year-on-year, primarily due to lower pricing in both truckload and ocean services, coupled with a decline in the latter’s volume, as well as the divestment of its Europe Surface Transportation business.

CH Robinson (CHRW) Touches Fresh Record on Double-Digit Profit Gain, Bullish Outlook

[TITLE]AI Energy Crunch: Hyperscalers Turn to Small Nuclear Reactors:
[TEXT]
Despite global momentum and policy support, the SMR revolution faces substantial execution risks, including cost control, supply chain maturity, regulatory bottlenecks, and the need for robust financing structures to ensure timely and on-budget delivery.

Key industry players such as NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy are moving SMRs from conceptual designs to billion-dollar commercial projects, with notable advancements in deployment programs, industrial heat applications, and corporate energy strategies.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are experiencing a significant comeback, driven by their scalability, siting flexibility, and ability to provide carbon-free baseload power, crucial for rising AI energy demands and industrial decarbonization.

After decades of stagnation, nuclear energy is staging a comeback — and it’s no longer the gigawatt-scale reactors of the past leading the charge. Small modular reactors, once dismissed as niche or speculative, have moved to the center of a global energy and geopolitical pivot. Their appeal lies in scalability, siting flexibility, and the promise of dedicated, carbon-free baseload power—a vital ingredient in an era defined by the AI energy demand surge and industrial decarbonization.

The shift from ambitious blueprints to billion-dollar commercial projects is officially underway, driven by key industry announcements throughout 2025. Some of the leading stakeholders include NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy.

NuScale Power: From De-Risking To Gigawatt-Scale Deployment

NuScale Power has cemented its role as the bellwether of the SMR movement, but its commercial success will depend on disciplined financing. In early September 2025, the company announced a landmark collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority and ENTRA1 Energy to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of its SMR technology within the TVA service region — the largest SMR commitment in U.S. history.

The structure of this deal is as important as its scale. Rather than placing the full “first-of-a-kind” financial and regulatory burden on TVA, ENTRA1 will reportedly finance, own, and operate the facilities, selling power back to TVA through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement. This off-balance-sheet approach could prove pivotal, unlocking institutional investment and moving SMRs from demonstration projects into a bankable, utility-scale asset class.

[TITLE]Long Plain First Nation agrees to lead Sio Silica sand mine environmental review:
[TEXT]
A Manitoba First Nation has agreed to an environmental assessment of a proposed silica sand mining project, which the First Nation's chief suggests won't move beyond a review if it uncovers any serious risks to the land or drinking water.

Long Plain First Nation signed a memorandum of understanding with Alberta-based Sio Silica to lead an environmental review and consultation over a possible series of sand wells that would be drilled in southeastern Manitoba, according to Chief David Meeches.

"We're simply at this point looking at an environmental review process. We've already been engaging with those that potentially will do our review," Meeches said in a Friday interview.

"I am not looking beyond that. I am looking at the environmental review and ... if it is such that it is negative, we will walk away."

The memorandum isn't meant as an endorsement of the project proposal, according to a news release from Long Plain Friday.

Meeches said Long Plain is in talks with Ogema Services
