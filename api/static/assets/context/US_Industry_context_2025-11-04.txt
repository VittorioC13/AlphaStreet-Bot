A robust, globally competitive, and technologically advanced manufacturing sector is required to push up its contribution to the GDP to 25 per cent and generate over 100 million jobs, NITI Aayog said on Wednesday.At present, the manufacturing sector contributes 15-17 per cent to the country's gross domestic product (GDP), it said.The Aayog, in a report titled 'Reimagining Manufacturing: India's Roadmap to Global Leadership in Advanced Manufacturing', further cautioned if India were to sustain the current levels of growth in manufacturing, there would be a significant gap of USD 5.1 trillion by 2047 against the targeted point of arrival."A robust, globally competitive, and technologically advanced manufacturing sector is required to achieve the vision of a 25 per cent contribution from manufacturing to the GDP and evolve into a high-value-added, innovation-led industrial powerhouse, integrated deeply into global value chains," it said.Historically, manufacturing has contributed 15- 17 per cent to India's GDP, a figure significantly lower than that of East Asian economies like China and South Korea, where manufacturing accounted for over 25- 30 per cent during their peak development phases."For India to achieve the vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047, elevating the share of manufacturing to 25 per cent of GDP is crucial not only for sustaining high economic growth but also for creating quality employment at scale," it said.The report said while India has made significant strides in simplifying business processes, advanced manufacturing presents new regulatory demands.Sectors emerging in the new advanced manufacturing era will require streamlined approval mechanisms for modern technology applications, clear IP regimes, especially for cross-border collaborations in high-tech joint ventures or R&D-led investments and cost-effective access to energy especially green and reliable energy, industrial infrastructure with ready access to high-speed data, utilities, and modern logistics hubs, it said.The Aayog is of the view that India's manufacturing sector is constrained by gaps when compared with those in peer nations, including inadequate infrastructure in industrial corridors, shortage of highly skilled talent, low investment in research and development, and fragmented supply chains that limit scale and efficiency.The Aayog said it has identified Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Advanced Materials, Digital Twins and Robotics as high-impact enablers to create a world-class manufacturing ecosystem in India.Releasing the report, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, "If India has to achieve exponential growth, it cannot come from business-as-usual. Frontier tech is the marriage of science and technology, and when this Union enters manufacturing, it drives automation, efficiency, and global competitiveness."Fadnavis added that Maharashtra will be the first state to fully align with the National Mission on Manufacturing and become the global hub for advanced manufacturing.NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam said, "India's economic ascent inextricably hinges the strength of our manufacturing sector, but incremental change will not suffice.He added that this roadmap sets a decisive, time-bound course to become an advanced manufacturing powerhouse by 2035, integrating frontier technologies to build precision, resilience, and sustainability into our manufacturing DNA, creating globally competitive 'Made in India' identity.

[TITLE]WULF Raising $500M Via Convertible Debt:
[TEXT]
TeraWulf (WULF) is planning to raise up to $575 million through a private sale of convertible senior notes, as it continues shifting focus from bitcoin mining to powering artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The company Wednesday announced it plans to sell $500 million in convertible senior notes due 2032, with an option for buyers to tack on an additional $75 million. The offering is limited to qualified institutional investors.

Shares are lower by 5% in premarket trading, following yesterday's 17% surge.

The proceeds will help fund construction of a data center in Abernathy, Texas. The move is likely part of a recently announced $9.5 billion joint venture with cloud compute firm Fluidstack for both firms to build out a 168-megawatt data center at TeraWulf’s Texas campus.

Google (GOOG) is backing $1.3 billion of Fluidstack’s long-term lease obligations, giving the project’s lenders more confidence given the tech giant’s balance sheet.

The convertible notes will not pay regular interest and can be converted into cash, stock, or a combination of both, depending on company election. Maturity is set for May 1, 2032.

The company two months ago similarly raised $850 million tied to its data center expansion.

[TITLE]Can Tariffs Spur Higher Factory Floor Utilization?:
[TEXT]
October 31, 2025

Can Tariffs Spur Higher Factory Floor Utilization?

Robin Braun, Ryan Decker, and Fariha Kamal

Raising America's industrial output is a key goal of the recent increases in U.S. import tariffs. Domestic output could rise if positive effects of reduced foreign competition outweigh negative effects of increased policy uncertainty and complexity, higher costs of imported inputs, and retaliatory trade policy in export markets. Higher output via the opening of new factories could take considerable time to materialize, but an immediate possibility is that output can rise through higher utilization of existing factories' production capacity.

In this note, we examine how industries' spare capacity—as of late 2024, just before tariffs rose—correlates with industries' measured increase in tariff protection from foreign competition. We document considerable spare capacity for the manufacturing sector as a whole (figure 1, left panel). However, looking across industries, we find only a small positive correlation between pre-tariff spare capacity and new import protection, suggesting that aggregate spare capacity is not particularly driven by those industries gaining the most tariff support. A counterfactual exercise indicates that increased production in industries with both high spare capacity and high new import protection from the 2025 tariffs could modestly boost aggregate manufacturing output.

Figure 1. Capacity utilization has been subdued

That said, looking at 2025 so far, we find no correlation between utilization trends and new import protection. This lack of correlation could reflect the effects of policy uncertainty, tariffs on inputs, or export retaliation. But we also show that businesses in industries receiving more new import protection have tended to mention soft demand and insufficient labor supply as factors holding down utilization. Moreover, with tariff policy changes still recent, we provide limited, though suggestive, evidence that the relationship between recent utilization growth and new import protection may depend on industries' time intensity, that is, average period of production. We conclude by considering some key limitations of our narrowly focused exercises.

As shown on figure 1 (left panel), capacity utilization in manufacturing averaged around 77 percent during 2024, prior to this year's tariff increases; even with a recent uptick, the series is still below its post-pandemic peak of 80 percent and well below its 1990s average of just over 81 percent.1 The difference between recent utilization and historical rates may be thought of as a measure of "spare capacity." The manufacturing sector overall does have considerable spare capacity at present.

For example, utilization in light vehicle manufacturing—shown in black on the right panel—entered 2025 at a rate well below historical highs. And indeed, this year some automakers have already raised domestic assemblies of some models at existing plants, such as Chevrolet's Silverado plant in Indiana, in response to changing trade policy (Hall 2025). This may occur more widely as foreign-assembled vehicles become more expensive or disappear from the domestic market entirely.2 If automaker utilization were to increase from its 2024 average to its 1990s average, annual light vehicle production would increase by roughly 1.7 million units, or more than 15 percent.3

Another industry with subdued but growing utilization is iron and steel products, shown in red. With utilization still well below its pre-pandemic peak, domestic iron and steel output could rise substantially even with no new factories. Higher steel utilization has been cited as one key objective of the 2025 tariffs (The White House 2025). And this industry has gained considerable new protection this year, with tariff rates on steel—including steel embedded in derivative products—increasing by 50 percentage points in 2025. But tariff rates alone are not sufficient for measuring the amount of new protection enjoyed by an industry; meaningful protection arises not only from higher tariffs but also from ample opportunity to replace domestic purchases of foreign-produced goods with domestically produced goods.

Measuring exposure to new import protection

We follow Flaaen and Pierce (2024) in measuring "new import protection" as the change in tariff rates for comparable products sourced from abroad scaled by the import share of domestic purchases:

$$$$\mathrm{New\ import\ protection}_i=\frac{\sum_{pc\in\Omega^I}{\Delta\tau_{ipc}\ imp_{ipc}}}{Q_i+imp_i\ -\ \ exp_i},$$$$

where $$Q_i$$, $$exp_i$$, $$imp_i$$ measure total shipments, exports, and imports of industry $$i$$, respectively, in 2022.4 The denominator, $$Q_i+imp_i-{exp}_i$$, is commonly referred to as "domestic absorption" as it measures total domestic purchases of the industry's goods. $$\Omega^I$$ is the list of U.S. imported product-country pairs ($$pc$$) newly subject to the 2025 tariff changes ($$\Delta\tau_{ipc}$$) effective as of August 27, 2025, measured in percentage points. We construct these measures at the level of industry detail available in the capacity utilization data, which leaves us with 52 manufacturing industries (most of them available at 4-digit NAICS level).

This measure of new import protection is an indicator of the scope for domestic production in an industry to replace imports. In particular, all else equal, new import protection is higher for those industries seeing larger tariff increases. But new import protection is also increasing in the share of domestic absorption that is accounted for by imports. An industry in which imports are negligible will gain minimal import protection even from very high tariff rates, as domestic purchases are already largely supplied by domestic production.5 That is, variation in import protection arises from variation in both tariff rates and the share of domestic purchases supplied by imports.

Table 1 displays the top 10 manufacturing industries in terms of new import protection from the 2025 tariffs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list includes alumina and aluminum production and processing (NAICS 3313) and iron and steel products (NAICS 3311,2), for which imported products face tariff rate increases of 50 percentage points under Section 232 tariffs. Notably, though, the aluminum industry has much higher import protection than iron and steel because aluminum features a higher share of imports in domestic purchases and, therefore, has gained more scope for substitution toward domestic production. Other industries that enjoy significantly increased import protection are household appliance manufacturing (NAICS 3352) and a series of industries where the import share of domestic purchases is above 90 percent (leather and allied products, computer and peripheral equipment, and apparel).

Table 1: Top 10 industries by new import protection

Industry NAICS New import protection Import share of domestic purchases Leather and Allied Product Manufacturing 316 0.21 0.96 Alumina and Aluminum Production and Processing 3313 0.21 0.37 Apparel Manufacturing 315 0.2 0.94 Household Appliance Manufacturing 3352 0.2 0.66 Other Miscellaneous Manufacturing 3399 0.2 0.73 Computer and Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing 3341 0.17 0.99 Textile Product Mills 314 0.16 0.57 Iron, Steel, Ferralloy/Cutlery, Handtool 3311,2 0.12 0.25 Nonferrous Metal Production and Processing 3314 0.12 0.78 Agriculture, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing 3331 0.11 0.36

Do industries gaining import protection have spare capacity?

We next compare industry-level import protection and spare capacity. We must first construct measures of spare capacity; we consider two alternative approaches. First, we define spare capacity as an industry's 2024:Q4 average utilization rate compared to its peak rate observed over the last ten years (2014:Q4-2024:Q4). This is our preferred measure. Additionally, we compare the industry's 2024:Q4 average to the average rate recorded in the 1990s (1990:Q1-1999:Q4), a historical episode of generally high utilization rates. In both alternatives, we simply subtract utilization in 2024:Q4 from the respective historical average.6

Figure 2 plots spare capacity (vertical axes) against new import protection (horizontal axes), with spare capacity measured relative to the last 10 years on the left panel and the 1990s on the right panel. The size of the dots indicates the value-added weight within manufacturing. The figure shows fairly wide distributions of both spare capacity and new import protection across industries. The results are similar, though not identical, across the two measures of spare capacity; for the rest of the note, we will focus on the comparison to the recent 10-year peak.7

Figure 2. Spare capacity and import protection

We observe limited spare capacity (around 5 percent or less) in notable industries like food (NAICS 311), petroleum and coal products (NAICS 3241), and basic chemicals (NAICS 3254); some such industries are often referred to as "continuous processors," as they tend to operate at relatively high utilization rates, and their utilization has not fallen significantly over time. On the other hand, large upside potential (around 10 percent or more) can be seen for tobacco (NAICS 3122), apparel (NAICS 315), iron and steel (NAICS 3311,2), and household appliances (NAICS 3352).

As shown by the (weighted) regression lines on figure 2, the relationship between spare capacity and import protection is positive, though it is not statistically significant. That is, there may be a modestly positive, but fairly limited, relationship between import protection and spare capacity, indicating that the spare capacity in manufacturing as a whole is not particularly driven by industries gaining the most new import protection. In unreported exercises, we find similar results when defining spare capacity literally, that is, relative to 100 percent utilization.

The positive slope observed on figure 2 is consistent with new tariffs yielding some modest upside potential for aggregate output through higher utilization of existing factories.8 Indeed, some industries with large new import protection from the 2025 tariffs have significant room for utilizing existing capacity. For example, industries with at least 10 percent spare capacity and above-median new import protection account for roughly 15 percent of manufacturing value added. In concrete (if highly approximate) terms, if each of these industries were to eliminate half of their spare capacity through higher output in existing plants, aggregate manufacturing production would rise by roughly 1-1/2 percent. This suggests modest, though nontrivial, upside potential. By comparison, manufacturing production fell by 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively, on a Q4-to-Q4 basis. Whether these industries will actually raise output has yet to be seen, though, and will depend in part on demand conditions and availability of inputs, as we discuss below.

Importantly, we have made no attempt at causal inference in these exercises, nor should our calculations be treated as a forecast for manufacturing production. Rather, the descriptive analysis simply characterizes the joint distribution of spare capacity—as we have defined it—and import protection.

Have newly tariff-protected industries raised their utilization rates?

Until now, we have studied capacity utilization as of 2024:Q4, just before the 2025 tariff increases began. But capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector has increased by

[TITLE]TCS says $6.5 bn data-centre bet will lag IT business on profitability:
[TEXT]
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s management has admitted that the profitability of its $6.5-billion pivot towards data centres will be lower than that of its mainstay information technology (IT) services business.

“Yes, it (data centre business) won't get the same RoEs (return on equity) as you would expect from the TCS business, but we are confident we'll be able to maintain industry-leading return ratios," said chief financial officer Samir Seksaria in a fireside chat between the company's management and Kotak Institutional Equities.

RoE, a measure of profitability, shows how effectively a company uses shareholder investments to generate earnings.

[TITLE]Trump’s $8.5 Billion Effort to Secure a Rare Earths Supply Chain:
[TEXT]
The United States is looking to develop new rare earth minerals supply chains to reduce China’s dominance of the sector. In October, President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese met at the White House to sign an agreement for the strengthening of the critical minerals and rare earths supply chain, with $8.5 billion in projects outlined.

Rare earths are critical minerals that are used in a variety of applications, including the production of magnets for weapons platforms, semiconductor manufacturing, robotics, and electric vehicles. Currently, China is the largest producer of rare earth metals, dominating the global supply chain. China holds around 70 percent of the world’s rare earth metals, or 44 million metric tonnes of reserves, followed by Brazil with 21 million tonnes, India with 6.9 million tonnes, and Australia with 5.7 million tonnes.

As an ally with the United States, Australia is well-positioned to develop its rare earths market, with financial support from the North American country to help counter Chinese dominance. Following the meeting, Albanese said there would be three groups of joint projects between Australia and the U.S., including companies such as the U.S. aluminium firm Alcoa.

The deal reportedly includes an investment of $3 billion from the U.S. for mining and processing projects and outlines a price floor for critical minerals. The White House announced that it plans to invest in the construction of a gallium refinery in Western Australia with a capacity of 100 metric tonnes per year. It said that U.S. investments in Australia were expected to unlock deposits of critical minerals worth $53 billion.

President Trump told reporters, “In

[TITLE]British Businesses to Save over £400m a Year as Government Slashes Electricity Costs:
[TEXT]
Government slashes electricity costs to save British businesses over £400m a year from April 2026 through landmark support under the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy.

UK industry including steel, chemicals, cement, glass and paper employing around 400,000 people to benefit from 90% discount on their electricity network charges.

Unprecedented support brings UK industrial energy costs in line with European competitors to protect jobs and attract new investment, helping drive growth and deliver Plan for Change.

Around 500 of the UK’s most energy-intensive businesses are set to save up to £420 million per year on their electricity bills from next April, as the Government takes decisive action to slash industrial energy costs.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle has today (31 October) announced that government will power ahead with plans to increase the discount on electricity network charges for businesses in sectors like steel, cement, glass, and chemicals, which employ around 400,000 people in total across the UK, from 60 percent to 90 percent.

Some of these businesses currently pay the highest industrial electricity prices in the G7, making it harder to stay competitive on the international stage, which is why the Government has taken decisive action to deliver this relief and level the playing field for industry.

The landmark support, which is being delivered at no extra cost to taxpayers, fulfils a crucial promise in the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy launched in June, and follows a four-week consultation on the plans for the increased discount which ran between July and August this year.

The increased discount will also slash costs for a range of businesses across Scotland and Wales to help them support local jobs and deliver growth, including Tata Steel at Port Talbot and INEOS in Grangemouth, ensuring the benefits are felt right across the country.

It comes on top of the Government’s landmark British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme announced in the modern Industrial Strategy, which will slash energy costs by 25 percent for over 7,000 businesses from 2027 in sectors like aerospace, automotive and chemicals, supporting hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs in these industries.

The Supercharger and British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will be funded through reforms to the energy system. The Government is reducing costs within the system to free up funding without raising household bills or taxes.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

British industry deserves a level playing field – and this government is delivering it. We’ve heard businesses loud and clear, and this landmark support will help them stay competitive on the global stage so they can invest and grow here in the UK. This is our Modern Industrial Strategy in action: practical, targeted support that secures jobs, attracts investment and drives our economy forward, as part of our Plan for Change.

Encirc Glass Managing Director Sean Murphy said:

This will be a major boost for our industry and will help British glass manufacturers compete with cheaper imports from regions that do not bear the same level of cost and regulation. By cutting the costs of energy in this way, the government is helping our industry to support thousands of jobs across the country whilst we make the transition to renewable sources of power. We welcomed the opportunity to engage with the Minister on the pressing challenges facing our sector. Continued government support for vital industries like glass manufacturing is essential to safeguarding jobs and unlocking investment across all regions of the UK.

Ben Martin, Policy Manager at the British Chambers of Commerce said:

Our research shows energy costs remain a major concern, forcing many businesses who are struggling to pay their bills to raise prices. Energy is a business essential not a luxury. The promise of cheaper bills for hundreds of energy-intensive firms through increasing the discount on electricity network charges is welcome.

Community Union Assistant General Secretary Alasdair McDiarmid said:

We welcome the government’s determination to reduce the industrial energy costs which are such a huge burden on energy-intensive industries like steel. Whilst there is still more to do, the decision to increase the level of compensation for network charging costs from 60% to 90% is a huge step in the right direction. This will help avert carbon leakage, and will go some way towards boosting the competitiveness of our steel producers in line with European counterparts. After long years of neglect, our members in the steel sector know that they now have a government which is on their side.

The increased discount under the Network Charging Compensation (NCC) Scheme will bring down electricity bills for businesses by slashing the prices they pay to access the UK’s electricity network.
