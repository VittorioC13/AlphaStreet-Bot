Charter Medical Group is planning to invest €85m in a new capital plan that will include a €50m investment in its Mullingar private hospital facility and a new ambulatory surgery centre to be located in central Dublin.

The private healthcare group expects the new plan will see current group revenues – at €50m in 2025, up from €41m in 2024 – double on foot of the investment. Overall group jobs numbers are expected to grow from 370 to 700 with the expansion, it said.

The healthcare provider said it is planning a €50m investment over two years in Charter Medical Private Hospital at Ballinderry in Mullingar and this would be “a transformative step in expanding healthcare capacity in the Midlands”.

“The hospital in Mullingar plays a significant role in supporting the public hospitals in the Midlands region where it serves to reduce pressure on the health system and deliver ease of access to services that are in critical demand,” said the group in a statement.

The two-year plan for the Westmeath hospital will create 100 new jobs in 2026 followed by another 100 roles in 2027, adding to the hospital’s current workforce of over 300, it said.

Commencing in January 2026, the capital plan for the hospital comprises new theatres, new endoscopy suites, additional surgical and medical beds and an investment in what the group said would be “leading-edge technology to enhance patient care”.

The plan will also include investment in its existing facilities in Dublin, as well as the new central Dublin surgery centre, details of which would be announced in early 2026.

Charter Medical Group’s facilities currently treat 80,000 patients a year and it is the second-largest provider to the National Treatment Fund (NTPF) nationally.

'The hospital in Mullingar plays a significant role in supporting the public hospitals in the Midlands region' the group said

“Charter Medical Group is entering an exciting phase of growth,” said Charter Medical Group chairman Tom Byrne.

“Our €85m capital programme for 2026 and 2027 will see the addition of a third facility in central Dublin, complementing our existing sites in Dublin and Westmeath.

This expansion underscores our commitment to delivering world-class care to more patients and supporting the national healthcare system at scale.”

The group said in a statement that the new roles it plans to create would include nursing staff and clinical nursing specialists, health and social care specialists, pharmacists, occupational therapists, specialist medical and surgical registrars, respiratory physiologists and a clinical innovation team to develop new services and integrate new technologies.

It also plans to create new senior managerial and administration roles, it said.

[TITLE]Check out the exclusive pitch deck Valerie Health used to raise $30 million from Redpoint Ventures to automate healthcare faxes:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

When Valerie Health CEO Peter Shalek demos his product to clinicians, he has an unusual pitch: "This is a weird demo, because you'll never have to use this software."

Valerie Health, which Shalek cofounded alongside Uber Health founder Nitin Joshi, aims to fully automate time-consuming front-office tasks in healthcare, such as referrals and patient scheduling.

It's taking over those tasks for independent provider groups, a focus that's helping the startup rack up new revenue — and new venture funding.

Valerie Health just raised $30 million in Series A funding led by Redpoint Ventures, the company said Tuesday. The raise brings Valerie Health's total funding to $39 million since its 2024 founding.

Shalek said Valerie Health is already working with several of the nation's largest independent provider groups, in areas ranging from urology and podiatry to cardiology.

Across specialties, the front-office challenges for provider groups are often the same, Shalek said: juggling patient intakes and follow-ups against a backlog of referrals.

Those administrative burdens and related financial pressures can lead provider groups to be acquired by hospitals or consolidated by private equity firms. But those deals can mean higher costs for patients and lower satisfaction for the clinicians impacted. Shalek wants Valerie Health to help providers thrive independently.

"I think that there's an opportunity to make it so that independent practice is the easiest, the highest quality, the most profitable place to deliver care, which is really the core mission we have," he said.

Valerie Health takes over tasks for healthcare front offices with its own employees in the loop to review the software's autonomous actions.

Shalek said Valerie Health helps practices grow, too, by processing new and existing patients faster to increase the volume of patients coming in by 5% to 7% on average.

The startup has plenty of competition. More companies are setting out to automate administrative tasks for hospitals and healthcare practices, such as the Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup Tennr, which raised $101 million in Series C funding in June at a $605 million valuation to focus on automating patient referrals.

Shalek said Valerie Health is bringing in business through its singular focus on independent provider groups and its ability to automate tasks without healthcare practices lifting a finger.

"It takes a lot of work from our side, but it allows us to just solve these problems for our customers without saying, here's another piece of software for you to train your staff on. That's the last thing these practices want. They just want us to do the work," he said.

Valerie Health wants to move fast as the market fills. Shalek said the startup is focused on grabbing more customers next year while continuing to build front-office solutions, such as voice AI agents for patient follow-ups. Valerie Health started selling its tech earlier this year; its revenue tripled last quarter from the previous quarter alone, and given the customers already in its pipeline plus the demand it's seeing in the market, Shalek said he expects revenue to grow six to seven times next year.

The startup is also hiring across its teams, including engineering, product, and sales. Joshi also spent two years as an engineering manager at fintech startup Stripe, so Shalek said Valerie Health has been able to bring over talent from both Stripe and Uber as it expands.

[TITLE]Google lines up collaborations, pledges funding for AI push in healthcare, agriculture:
[TEXT]
Google on Tuesday announced funding support of $8 million to India's AI Centers of Excellence for health, agriculture, education, and sustainable cities, and committed $4,00,000 to support development of India's health foundation model.

Google - - the architect of AI models, including Gemini and Gemma that are integrated for search enhancements, cloud services, and enterprise tools - - is also supporting Gnani.AI, CoRover.AI, and BharatGen with $50,000 grants each for building models serving Indic language solutions.

Google said it is providing Wadhwani AI with $4.5 million in funding to support multilingual AI-powered applications for health and agriculture, according to a release.

The announcements mark a slew of new collaborations and funding commitments by Google to bolster India's AI ecosystem, the company said.

"Google announced funding of $4,00,000 to support new collaborations that will leverage 'MedGemma' to build India's Health Foundation Models," the company said in a release.

Such models aim to raise the efficiency of healthcare providers and improve patient outcomes across India.

Google said Ajna Lens will work with experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to build models that will support India-specific use cases in Dermatology and OPD Triaging.

The resulting models, it said, will contribute to India's Digital Public Infrastructure and their outcomes will be made accessible to the ecosystem.

Additionally, researchers, AI experts, and clinicians from IISc will explore using AI models for broader clinical applications.

To push its inclusive AI agenda, Google announced a $2 million founding contribution to establish the new Indic Language Technologies Research Hub at IIT Bombay. The initiative aims to ensure global advancements serve India's linguistic diversity, Google said.

[TITLE]Cycle Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Applied Therapeutics:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: APLT; “Applied”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to creating transformative treatments for rare diseases, today announced a definitive agreement for Cycle Group Holdings Limited (“Cycle”) to acquire Applied Therapeutics.

Applied Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the development of novel drug candidates against validated molecular targets in rare diseases. Applied’s lead drug candidate, govorestat, is a novel central nervous system (CNS) penetrant Aldose Reductase Inhibitor (ARI) for the treatment of CNS rare metabolic diseases, including Classic Galactosemia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Sorbitol Dehydrogenase Deficiency (CMT-SORD) and phosphomannomutase 2 congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG).

“We are confident that Cycle has the resources and capabilities to move govorestat forward towards the ultimate goal of bringing a life-changing treatment to the patients suffering from Classic Galactosemia, CMT-SORD and PMM2-CDG, who have always been at the center of everything we do at Applied,” said Les Funtleyder, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Applied. “I want to thank the entire Applied team for their perseverance and commitment. We are also grateful to the investigators and patients who have contributed to the development of govorestat.”

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cycle will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock for a per share price of $0.088 per share in cash payable at closing plus one non-transferrable contingent value right (CVR) that entitles the holder to receive potential additional payments.

The CVR provides payments based on the following:

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for any galactosemia indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for the CMT-SORD indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.20 per CVR in cash payable upon the first achievement of worldwide net sales of any product covered by the CVR by Cycle, its affiliates or licensees equal to or exceeding $200 million dollars in any four-quarter fiscal period prior to the tenth anniversary of closing.

Each CVR holder will also be entitled to receive their pro rata share of any cash of Applied in excess of $500,000 at closing (capped at $1.5 million) (“Closing Cash Payment”).

Each such CVR and Closing Cash Payment will be paid only once, if at all.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions contained in the merger agreement that will be filed with the SEC, including the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock. The merger agreement does not include a financing condition. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions. If the tender offer closes, then Cycle would acquire untendered shares of Applied through a second-step merger for the same consideration.

Applied also issued a Promissory Note (the “Promissory Note”) to Cycle. The Promissory Note is unsecured and enables Applied to receive loans aggregating up to $8.5 million from Cycle, to fund Applied’s working capital needs under an approved budget. Cycle’s funding obligations cease, and amounts borrowed immediately becomes repayable, if the transaction is terminated for certain reasons. Absent funds provided by Cycle under the Promissory Note or from another source, Applied would be unable to continue to fund its activities for more than a limited number of days and Applied would anticipate proceeding to wind down operations.

The transaction was unanimously approved by the Applied Board of Directors following an extensive evaluation of strategic alternatives. This evaluation process included numerous discussions with potential counterparties. The Applied Board of Directors determined that entering into the merger agreement with Cycle represented the path that best advanced the interests of Applied and its stockholders.

For Cycle, Goodwin Procter LLP is acting as legal counsel. For Applied, Aquilo Partners, L.P. provided a fairness opinion, and Ropes & Gray LLP is acting as legal counsel.

The price target hike follows the company’s agreement to acquire Bluejay Therapeutics for $620 million in cash. With the acquisition, the company gains worldwide rights to brelovitug, a monoclonal antibody under development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis D, a rare and aggressive liver condition.

“This acquisition fits squarely with what we do best—advancing high-impact medicines for patients with rare diseases through disciplined development, regulatory innovation, and commercial excellence,” Mirum CEO Chris Peetz said in the release.

The acquisition of Brelovitug comes on the heels of 100% HDV RNA response in Phase 2 clinical trials, with Phase 3 results expected in the second half of next year.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley have also reiterated an Overweight rating on Mirum Pharmaceuticals with an $81 price target. The investment bank views the deal as a smart strategic move for Mirum, saying it bolsters the company’s position in rare liver diseases while offering clear synergies with its current commercial setup. The firm also projects that the enlarged pipeline could generate more than $4 billion in peak sales.

Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MIRM) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering treatments for rare and debilitating liver diseases, especially those affecting children, by transforming scientific discoveries into therapies such as their key drug LIVMARLI (maralixibat) for cholestatic pruritus in Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC).

While we acknowledge the potential of MIRM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
