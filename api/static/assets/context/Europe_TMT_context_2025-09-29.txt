[TITLE]Moldova at a Crossroads: Russia’s “all in” against Chișinău’s European Future:
[TEXT]
While Russia has militarily invaded Ukraine, Moldova is facing an unprecedented hybrid war orchestrated by the Kremlin. Experts believe that Moscow is likely to invest significantly in efforts to manipulate the country’s upcoming parliamentary elections, attempting to win the “hearts and minds” of Moldovans through extensive cyberattacks and traditional tactics such as co-opting local politicians who have long been connected to illicit Russian funding.

For Russia, the stakes in the 28 September general election are incredibly high. If it loses the political contest for Moldova, that would be detrimental to its greater strategy. After all, it is to be expected that another four-year term of a pro-European government would set Moldova’s EU accession in motion by around 2030. If Moldova stays on the European path with a completely pro-European majority in power, this would increase the pace of the reforms that have been already initiated; if the future governing coalition turns out to be a mix of pro-European and some more skeptical groups, this could obstruct or even sabotage progress; and in the worst-case scenario of pro-Russian forces coming to power, the reforms could be completely abandoned, with Moldova returning to oligarchic rule and being governed by people in the orbit of the Kremlin’s interests.

In light of these factors, Russia is likely to go “all in”. Authorities in Chișinău estimate that Moscow is willing to invest

[TITLE]Founders are using creative accounting to boost lofty ‘ARR’—the hottest startup metric in Silicon Valley:
[TEXT]
The numbers are eye-popping.

Beginning in 2024, a stream of ‘holy shit’ growth metrics from VC-backed startups began to pop up on X [formerly Twitter]. In less than three years, Midjourney’s ARR went from zero to $200 million. In 20 months, ElevenLabs, a voice AI startup, saw its ARR soar from zero to near $100 million. In three months, vibe coding darling Lovable went from zero to $17 million in ARR, this summer hitting $100 million in ARR. In its first six months, Decagon hit “seven figures” in ARR, the company reported. The most famous example: AI coding tool Cursor went from nada to $100 million in ARR in a year. But who needs a year, anyway? Two VCs Fortune spoke to highlighted the claim made by Andreessen Horowitz-backed AI “cheat on everything” tool Cluely, which claimed over the summer to have doubled ARR to $7 million over a week.

“There is all this pressure from companies like Decagon, Cursor, and Cognition that are just crushing it,” said one VC. “There’s so much pressure to be the company that went from zero to 100 million in X days.”

All the examples have one thing in common: ARR, or “annual recurring revenue.” The metric came to be a favorite of VCs and startups through the software-as-a-service (SaaS) wave starting in the 2000s, when it was widely accepted as a trusted proxy for a stable startup, with a reliable source of revenue and a reasonably shored up future.

But as billions flowed across the venture capital ecosystem into AI startups, some mere months old, the vaunted, trusted ARR metric has morphed into something much harder to recognize. There’s now a massive amount of pressure on AI-focused founders, at earlier stages than ever before: If you’re not generating revenue immediately, what are you even doing? Founders—in an effort to keep up with the Joneses—are counting all sorts of things as “long-term revenue” that are, to be blunt, nothing your Accounting 101 professor would recognize as legitimate.

Exacerbating the pressure is the fact that more VCs than ever are trying to funnel capital into possible winners, at a time where there’s no certainty

[TITLE]EU, Japan trust they have secured limits to US drug tariffs:
[TEXT]
By Philip Blenkinsop

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union and Japan expressed confidence on Friday that they had secured limits on U.S. tariffs on pharmaceuticals, which President Donald Trump said he would impose next week at a rate of 100%.

The European Commission referred to a joint statement agreed with the U.S. following its end-July trade deal, which states that the tariff for pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber would not exceed 15%.

"This clear all-inclusive 15% tariff ceiling for EU exports represents an insurance policy that no higher tariffs will emerge for European economic operators," a Commission spokesperson said.

CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM THAT CAP WILL APPLY

European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, speaking in Hanoi, said he expected the commitment to be respected, noting that Washington had followed through in lowering car tariffs.

Japan also referred to its joint statement with Washington, which said that U.S. tariff rates on Japanese semiconductors and pharmaceuticals would not exceed those applied to others such as the EU.

A lobbyist for a major drugmaker with large European exports to the United States said Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on branded drug imports was worrying, but the industry hoped the 15% rate agreed under the U.S.-EU trade deal would apply.

"Nothing is clear yet but we hope the EU-U.S. deal stands," the lobbyist said.

The EU's pharma lobby group, EFPIA, said it was working on the assumption that the EU-U.S. deal applied and that it was still pushing on exemptions for medicines.

Europe and the U.S. have tightly linked medicine supply chains, with Ireland, Switzerland and Germany among top exporters.

EU medicinal and pharmaceutical exports to the United States totalled 119.7 billion euros ($134.0 billion) in 2024, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat, some 37% worth from Ireland.

In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump announced a fresh round of tariffs that also covered trucks at 25% and furniture at 30-50%.

Trump said the pharmaceutical tariff of 100% would apply to branded or patented drugs unless a given pharmaceutical company was building a manufacturing plant in the United States.

A source at a large European drugmaker said the company was quietly optimistic it would avoid 100% tariffs given the major U.S. investments it has pledged this year.

Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar said on Friday it was uncertain how the 100% tariff decision aligned with the EU-U.S. trade deal. The Danish maker of weight-loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic said it exported more active pharmaceutical ingredients from the U.S. than it imported.

The EU's trade deal with the United States shields the bloc's drug exports from tariffs higher than 15 percent, Brussels said Friday, after US President Donald Trump announced new levies on pharmaceuticals.The July agreement capped tariffs on pharmaceutical products and other goods at 15 percent. Trump has now said he will impose a 100-percent tariff on drugs but Brussels dismissed concerns that the deal was under threat.The EU pointed to the joint statement under which the United States agreed to ensure the tariff rate on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber does not exceed 15 percent."This clear all-inclusive 15 percent tariff ceiling for EU exports represents an insurance policy that no higher tariffs will emerge for European economic operators," said EU trade spokesman Olof Gill."The EU and US continue engaging towards implementing the joint statement commitments, while exploring further areas for tariff exemptions as well as wider cooperation," Gill said.It was not immediately made clear by the US side whether the EU was indeed exempt from the higher new pharmaceutical levies.The United States this week cut tariffs on auto imports from the EU to 15 percent as part of the agreement, down from 27.5 percent.The European Commission , which leads trade policy for the 27-country bloc, is working hard to secure carve-outs for other sectors including drinks.Gill had said Thursday EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic continued to push for cutting tariffs on wine and it remained a "top priority" for Brussels.

[TITLE]Just using open source isn't radical any more, Europe:
[TEXT]
Feature It is 2025. Linux will turn 34 and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) 40. For the EU and Europe at large, which is famously experimental with government deployments of open source tech, behind initiatives to promote open licensing, and whose governments promote equal opportunity for FOSS vendors in public tendering, it's a crunch point.

While Russia has militarily invaded Ukraine, Moldova is facing an unprecedented hybrid war orchestrated by the Kremlin. Experts believe that Moscow is likely to invest significantly in efforts to manipulate the country’s upcoming parliamentary elections, attempting to win the “hearts and minds” of Moldovans through extensive cyberattacks and traditional tactics such as co-opting local politicians who have long been connected to illicit Russian funding.

[TITLE]Mitsotakis: “Greece is a force of stability and a reliable partner — the domestic voices of ‘no to everything’ do not want a strong country”:
[TEXT]
Newsroom September 28 11:17

In his weekly post, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis described the past week as “eventful,” due to his presence in New York for the 80th United Nations General Assembly.

As he emphasized, in his meetings with leaders, investors, and opinion makers, “the common thread was the recognition of Greece as a force of stability in Southeastern Europe and the Mediterranean, as an attractive investment destination, and as a reliable partner.”

Mr. Mitsotakis defended Greece’s defense procurement program, highlighting that “we have already received 42 upgraded F-16s, 24 Rafales, while we expect the first FDI frigates in the coming months and the first F-35s in 2028.”

Referring to international developments, he stressed that “the way forward is dialogue, not the language of weapons,” calling on Turkey to withdraw its casus belli. Regarding Gaza, he stated: “There is no justification for the continuation of the war,” expressing support for a two-state solution. Concerning Ukraine, he declared that “we cannot accept under any circumstances the violent redrawing of borders by any revisionist power.”

He also made an important reference to protecting children’s mental health from social media, noting that Greece “is leading the way in setting a minimum age for digital adulthood.”

Regarding P. Routsis’s hunger strike, he stated that “the state must stand with sensitivity beside those who are in pain, even when they challenge it,” while also emphasizing respect for the decisions of the judiciary.

The Prime Minister presented detailed government actions:
