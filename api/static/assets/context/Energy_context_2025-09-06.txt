Forget summer Fridays.

The notion of "summer lull" has been gone from Wall Street since the pandemic, said Anu Aiyengar, global head of advisory and M&A at JPMorgan Chase. And it's never been more true than now: M&A activity has been rebounding even amid fears that Trump's trade wars could slow the economy.

"The last week of May and June and early July have all been pretty active with a good cadence of deal announcements," Aiyengar told Business Insider. "And more importantly, our pipeline and conversations continue to be active as well."

The bank on Wednesday released a report showing that M&A in the first half of the year hit its highest levels since 2022, driven largely by large deals. Here are four of the top trends keeping bankers busy as we head into a not-so-sleepy August:

Bigger is better

JPMorgan said total deal volume soared 27% to $2.2 trillion in the first half of 2025, including a 57% increase in deals over $10 billion.

Deals over $1 billion rose 72% — a 20-year high, the bank said.

Sector by sector

The bank said 7 out of 9 sectors saw double-digit volume growth, including:

Financial institutions (+56%)

Media & communications (+51%)

Diversified Industries (+41%)

M&A volumes seemed to favor technology (23%) and diversified industries (22%), the bank said.

Private equity dealmaking

Private equity firms, known in M&A parlance as financial sponsors, have ramped up dealmaking, leading to $168 billion in take-private deals in the first half of 2025, the highest levels since 2022, the bank said.

Four mega-deals accounted for more than 50% of that volume—indicating a highly concentrated but aggressive deployment of capital.

Minority stakes

Sponsors increased their minority stake transactions, especially in high-growth sectors. Sponsor-led minority deals rose 34% year-over-year and were 9% above the 10-year average of $81 billion.

A substantial share—35% of these deals—were in technology, driven by investments in AI, compute infrastructure, and data center capabilities.

[TITLE]Russia’s Rosneft Signs Deal to Supply More Crude Oil to China:
[TEXT]
Russia’s top oil producer, state-controlled Rosneft, has signed a deal to supply additional pipeline volumes of crude to China via Kazakhstan during Vladimir Putin’s visit to Beijing earlier this week, Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev said on Thursday.

“Rosneft also signed an agreement with Chinese partners on an additional supply of 2.5 million tonnes of oil via Kazakhstan,” Russian news agency Interfax quoted Tsivilev as saying in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.

Last year, the crude flows from Russia to China via Kazakhstan stood at 10.2 million tons, equal to

[TITLE]Iraq and BP Forge $25 Billion Kirkuk Oil Deal:
[TEXT]
This agreement aligns with Iraq's plan to raise its oil production capacity and is expected to increase Kirkuk's output by 50,000 to 100,000 barrels per day in the coming years.

The deal, finalized in March, aims to boost production and improve efficiencies in oil and gas extraction, with an initial phase targeting over 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent.

BP engineers have started initial assessments at four strategic oilfields in Kirkuk, Iraq, as part of a $25-billion agreement to redevelop the region's oil and gas infrastructure.

BP engineers have arrived in Kirkuk and have launched initial assessments at four strategic oilfields in the northern Iraqi province as part of the supermajor’s $25-billion deal with Iraq to redevelop Kirkuk fields, Iraqi industry sources told Shafaq News on Wednesday.

BP’s experts have started work to develop the infrastructure and production facilities of Iraq’s state-owned North Oil Company (NOC) and North Gas Company (NGC) in Kirkuk, sources from both companies told the Iraqi news outlet.

The assessment process at the Kirkuk fields will be followed by a long-term development plan aimed at boosting production and improving efficiencies in oil and gas extraction, according to the Iraqi sources.

In March this year, BP and Iraq finalized the agreement, which entails total investment of an estimated $25 billion, after the federal Iraqi government ratified the contract.

The redevelopment of several giant oil fields in Kirkuk will be carried out under a contract between NOC, NGC, and BP and includes the rehabilitation and redevelopment of the fields, spanning oil, gas, power, and water with potential for investment in exploration.

The agreement is for an initial phase that includes oil and gas production of more than 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent, BP has said. It includes the Baba and Avanah domes of the Kirkuk oil field and three adjacent fields in Federal Iraq – Bai Hassan, Jambur and Khabbaz – all of which are currently operated by the NOC.

The wider resource opportunity across the contract and surrounding area is believed to include up to 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to the British supermajor.

“This is an enormous opportunity as we grow bp’s oil and gas business and fully aligned with our strategy of strengthening our upstream portfolio,” BP’s chief executive officer Murray Auchincloss said in March.

For Iraq, the agreement is aligned with its plan to raise its oil production capacity to above 6 million bpd by 2029, up from about 4.5 million bpd now.

Production from Kirkuk oilfields is currently between 285,000 bpd and 330,000 bpd, most of which is for domestic consumption, with limited exports to Jordan, per official Iraqi data quoted by Shafaq News. The deal with BP is expected to raise Kirkuk production by between 50,000 bpd and 100,000 bpd in the coming years.
