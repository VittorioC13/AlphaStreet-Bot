Nations Trust Bank (NTB) has received the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) approval for its previously announced acquisition of the Retail Banking operations of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Sri Lanka (HSBC Sri Lanka).

In September this year, HSBC Sri Lanka signed a binding agreement to transfer its Retail Banking operations to NTB.

The acquisition would provide NTB with around 200,000 HSBC Sri Lanka customer accounts, including premium banking clients, retail loans and credit cards.

It is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026.

Upon closing, HSBC’s corporate and institutional banking operations in Sri Lanka will remain unchanged, continuing to serve international corporate clients and offering cross-border trade and investment services.

NTB said that the acquisition would strengthen its position in the premium retail banking segment and support its long-term growth objectives.

Nations Trust Bank director and CEO Hemantha Gunetilleke said “The approval from CBSL gives us the go-ahead to move forward with the acquisition process, which is currently progressing very well. We are now able to move into the next phase of the project with confidence.”

The sale of its retail banking business is part of HSBC Group’s simplification plan announced in October last year.

The decision follows a strategic review that determined divestment of the retail unit was the preferred course for the group and its stakeholders.

HSBC, at that time, said the reorganisation allows it to concentrate on areas where it has a competitive focus and growth prospects.

HSBC Sri Lanka CEO Mark Surgenor said: “Our priority during this period is to uphold the highest service levels for our customers and ensure that our colleagues are well supported during the transition into NTB.

“We are working closely with NTB towards a seamless transfer of banking services upon completion of the transaction.”

[TITLE]JP Morgan Chase Buys Miami Beach Retail Branch:
[TEXT]
J.P. Morgan Chase bought back its retail banking branch in Miami Beach, paying a threefold premium since its sale 11 years ago.

The finance giant paid $23.5 million for the 25,030-square-foot building at 1801 Alton Road in the Sunset Harbour neighborhood, property records show. The two-story property sits on a 1-acre site, facing Dade Boulevard.

J.P. Morgan Chase purchased the property for $4 million in 2010. Four years later, the current sellers, a Coral Gables-based entity managed by Dominic Cavagnuolo, acquired the building for $8 million.

A representative for the sellers could not be reached, while a spokesperson for J.P. Morgan Chase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, J.P. Morgan Chase’s competitor, Wells Fargo, sold its 6,654-square-foot retail branch next door at 1901 Alton Road for $15 million to the family office of developer Russell Galbut. The developer obtained a $54 million construction loan for a Whole Foods-anchored development, where Wells Fargo will operate a 4,000-square-foot retail location.

J.P. Morgan Chase’s acquisition is also another example of retailers buying the properties they lease. Last year, nearby on Lincoln Road, Alo Yoga paid $17 million for a retail condo, where it plans to open a store and private gym. The activewear brand also bought its boutique in the Miami Design District for $22 million the year prior.

Since 2024, grocer Publix has spent about $345 million buying seven retail centers it anchors in South Florida.

[TITLE]‘When I’m young and going out a lot, I don’t want to worry about putting on weight’:
[TEXT]
Everyone knows that alcohol can cause weight gain, particularly beer, sugary cocktails and creamy liqueurs. But while the most likely action for anyone trying to lose a few pounds would be to cut down on the amount of alcoholic drinks they consume, some people are doing the opposite and are cutting down their food intake in order to increase their “alcohol allowance”. This practice appears to be particularly prevalent among students and young adults.

Two students, Sarah and Aisling, are no strangers to food restricted alcohol consumption (FRAC), and say most of their friends do it as a means of staying slim and “not having to worry

[TITLE]Mom Buys Special Snacks For Her Kid With Food Allergies, But Dad Keeps Eating Them Even Though He Knows The Kid Can’t Have Anything Else:
[TEXT]
Many kids have food allergies and it can mean that restrictions on what suitable snacks you can buy them.

Without alternatives, kids miss out. See why this mom doesn’t think her husband gets this.

AITAH for being mad at my husband for eating allergy-friendly food I bought for my kids I have two sons: DS1 is a teenager, and DS2 is a pre-teen. DS1 has had multiple food allergies since he was a baby. There aren’t a lot of prepackaged foods DS1 can eat due to his list of allergies. DS2 doesn’t have any serious allergies like his older brother, but he’s been having stomach issues for a few months and he feels better eating a healthier diet with less dairy.

So there aren’t a lot of options.

I find it stressful to keep them fed and full, especially on busy days when I’ve been gone most of the day. I can’t just get takeout or do pizza or pbj sandwiches. So, I like to stock up on “healthy” allergy-friendly prepackaged foods at Whole Foods whenever I’m in the large city that is an hour and a half from our home. We have had conflicts in the past over DH eating dairy-free popsicles or allergy-friendly muffins that were purchased at Whole Foods for our son. DH doesn’t think it’s a big deal because we can buy more, but it makes me mad when the items are only available at Whole Foods because I only go there

[TITLE]Cause Marketing: Everything You Need to Know:
[TEXT]
For a long time, retail store owners and online retailers alike had only one goal in mind: profit.

But today, they’re evolving beyond that point. Companies are looking to give back, to help others, and to think beyond their bottom lines.

That’s where “cause marketing” comes in.

What is cause marketing?

Cause marketing is a dual-purpose concept with the potential to help brands increase profitability while bettering society. It’s a win-win model, wherein companies can reach their business goals while supporting causes that matter.

By definition, cause marketing is a type of corporate social responsibility (CSR), where businesses and nonprofits team up for a mutual benefit.

But how does cause marketing work like in practice? Let’s look at an example.

Solstice Sunglasses is a luxury boutique that created a special kit to support the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

For every Solstice Cleaning Kit sold, it donated $1 to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. At the end of the campaign, it also matched the funds raised.

This is an excellent example of how companies can thrive and give back by supporting nonprofit organizations via cause marketing.

The best part: Cause marketing can be implemented as an omnichannel approach. It’s viable for in-store and online shoppers alike. Regardless of the retail touchpoint, the end goal is the same—you empower your customers to give back and feel good

[TITLE]Jim Cramer Says American Eagle’s Latest Results Show Its Strength:
[TEXT]
American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (NYSE:AEO) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer commented on along with the recent macro rally. Cramer noted that people thought that the previous good quarter of the company was anomalous, but it was not the case, as he remarked:

“Lots of people thought that the last quarter from American Eagle was aberrant. It was so great, a flash in the pan. The terrific numbers this morning put the lie to that notion.”

American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (NYSE:AEO) sells apparel, accessories, and personal care products under its brands. During the October 3 episode, a caller asked whether the company’s stock was a buy, sell, or hold. Cramer responded:

“My instinct is to ring the register. Why? Because we had the event, the event occurred, and now we’re getting away from the event. And there are a lot of people who say, wait a second, the company isn’t doing well away from that. I’d like to see [you] get a bit of a win here. Take some off the table.”

While we acknowledge the potential of AEO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]India’s e-commerce growth continues to outpace global market: Elara Capital:
[TEXT]
India’s e-commerce continued to outperform global markets in the September quarter, according to analysis by Elara Capital. It noted that while US online sales grew by about 5-6 per cent year-on-year while Indian online sales continued to grow double-digit.

Karan Taurani, Executive Vice-President, Elara Capital noted in a sector update report, “India’s digital commerce flywheel continues to outperform global markets, with e-commerce and quick commerce growing faster than in the US. While US online sales rose ~5-6 per cent YoY, India continues in double digits with robust trajectory fuelled by quick commerce channel driving user expansion and regional penetration.

He added that advertising is also shifting in India to digital mediums as brands chase high-ROI performance channels, directly benefiting ad-tech players such as Affle, with direct customer relations.

“Despite solid momentum, India’s category penetration is far below US levels, offering one of the largest multi-year growth runways globally across apparel, electronics, GM and beauty,” he added.

Taurani added that India’s e-commerce maturity curve trails the US and China by 10–12 years. “ This offers a compelling long-term growth as these mature markets growth plateaus. In the near term, India’s e-commerce expansion will be driven by the rise of quick commerce and mass-commerce,” he added.

Global e-commerce was steady in the third quarter of CY25, with US online sales being 5 per cent year-on-year with penetration at about 16-17 per cent, the report noted.
