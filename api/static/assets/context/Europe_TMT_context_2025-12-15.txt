[TITLE]ASML Receives "Top Pick" Designation from BofA, Citi Reaffirms Buy Rating:
[TEXT]
ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has drawn significant attention from analysts tracking the AI and semiconductor sectors. On December 10, Bank of America designated ASML as a Top Pick, highlighting it as one of the leading investment ideas for 2026.

The bank emphasized that ASML is included in their 25 stocks for 2026 and listed on the Europe 1 top ideas. With the stock currently trading at 20.6x EV/EBITDA for 2027, analysts anticipate a positive revaluation as the company approaches a pivotal growth phase.

On the same day, Citi analyst Andrew Gardiner reaffirmed a Buy rating on ASML, setting a price target of 1,200.00. This affirmation reflects Citis outlook for the European semiconductor equipment sector in 2026.

Analysts point to AI-driven demand as a key factor likely to support strong growth for ASML, along with upward revisions to earnings estimates.

However, the company faces emerging geopolitical scrutiny. A report by Dutch television program Nieuwsuur indicated that at least one ASML customer has connections to the Chinese military. The report specifically mentioned sales to a subsidiary of China Electronics Technology Group, a state-owned entity that is a major supplier to Chinas armed forces.

ASML develops and supplies advanced semiconductor equipment, including lithography, metrology, and inspection systems used in chip manufacturing.

[TITLE]Updates on the AGI Debate, Humanoid Bots and Karpathy Insight:
[TEXT]
Tim Dettmers Argues AGI Will Not Happen

Dettmers claims GPU performance-per-cost peaked around 2018. Post-2018 gains from one-off architectural tricks now exhausted and facing diminishing returns.

Transformers are near physically optimal for local computation versus global attention.

Scaling laws demand exponential resources for linear gains. Only 1–2 years of viable scaling left before costs outpace benefits.

His conclusion is AGI and superintelligence are fantasies that ignore physical compute constraints.

Counterpoints and Debate

Critics say this view conflicts with hardware vendors (Nvidia, AMD, Intel) roadmaps and the thousands of experts working to continue to improve.

CPU architectures hit limits and the workarounds persisted to give improvements for CPUs and then CPUs are mostly displaced by GPUs.

Nate Jones says Dettmer could be mostly correct on issues and problems with GPU details. He is wrong on big picture which is my prior point

Texas A&M’s Real 12th Man: $100M+ Yearly From Foreign Students, Including China And India

Dallas Express ^ | 12/13/2025 | Kellen McGovern Jones

Posted on by DFG

Texas A&M University generates nearly $1 billion in tuition and fee revenue each year while educating thousands of international students, including those from adversarial or strategically competitive nations such as China, Iran, Russia, and India.

This information comes from an analysis of the university’s FY 2025 Executive Budget Summary and newly obtained public records from a Texas Public Information Act request filed by The Dallas Express.

A&M’s FY 2025 budget shows the university collects $981,724,000 in tuition and fee revenue, and its public records response confirms that foreign students constitute a significant revenue stream.

In 2024–2025 alone, international students generated $106.7 million in tuition and fees. For fall 2025, foreign students had already generated nearly $48 million, with spring numbers still pending.

The university’s Student Enrollment Distribution Map — current through October 21, 2025 — shows that Texas A&M has approximately 81,000 students, including several thousand foreign nationals from nearly every country in Europe and Asia. Around 70,000 students are reported to be Texans.

While A&M hosts some students from friendly or allied countries, it also educates significant numbers from hostile or high-risk nations, raising concerns

[TITLE]China Prepares as Much as $70 Billion in Chip Sector Incentives:
[TEXT]
China is considering a package of incentives worth as much as $70 billion to bankroll and support its chipmaking industry, pouring more state money into a sector it deems pivotal to its technological conflict with the US.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Officials are deliberating proposals to earmark a package of subsidies and other financing support in the range of 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) to 500 billion yuan, people familiar with the matter said, asking to remain anonymous to discuss private talks. The final details of those incentives, exact amounts and target companies are still getting worked out, the people added.

The scale of the effort — which on the lower end begins to approach the amount of capital Washington set aside for the Chips Act — underscores Beijing’s resolve to reduce its reliance on foreign chipmakers such as Nvidia Corp. It suggests the government will continue to support the likes of Huawei Technologies Co. and Cambricon Technologies Corp. even after the Trump administration approved the sale of Nvidia chips such as the more powerful H200 into China.

At the maximum end, the proposal translates into the largest-ever state-backed semiconductor incentives program conceived, at a time nations from Europe to the Middle East are seeking to ensure local production and supply of a component considered critical to AI and national security.

Explainer: How World Powers Are Vying for Chip Supremacy

The Chinese program will function separately from existing government funding plans such as the $50 billion Big Fund III equity-investment vehicle, the people added. Representatives for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which oversees the Big Fund and helps administer support measures, didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment.

Data as of 2024.

China is pouring resources into the world’s largest semiconductor arena at a critical time, geopolitically.

President Xi Jinping has pledged to build up the country’s semiconductor capabilities with a “whole-nation” approach — harnessing the entire country’s resources. Beijing is concerned about the unpredictability of access to US technology given clampdowns on exports by three different administrations, starting with Donald Trump’s first term.

That mandate has manifested itself on several fronts over the years. And as Beijing prioritizes the development of semiconductors and AI, firms throughout the supply chain have enjoyed a surge in fortunes.

[TITLE]Connect Everyone Coalition enlists groups to modernize space development policy:
[TEXT]
Twenty organizations, working under the aegis of The Connect Everyone Coalition, have called on nine federal agencies to modernize and reduce bureaucracy in policy related to the commercial space industry.

While parts of the space development policy letter called for general changes and updates, the focus is on low-earth orbit (LEO) technology. The letter cited four current areas of redundancy and inefficiency: fragmented multi-agency approvals, redundant environmental reviews, redundant range safety determinations, and lack of transparency regarding scheduling and delays.

“New space-based innovations like low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites have the potential to finally give every American access to reliable, affordable, high-speed broadband and the 21st-century opportunities that it unlocks,” CEC executive director Richard Cullen said in a

[TITLE]SEC chair moves to boost IPO momentum: ‘Make it cool to be a public company’:
[TEXT]
Good morning. At the AICPA conference earlier this week in Washington, D.C., U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins told an audience of accountants, auditors, and financial preparers that it’s time to make going public more accessible.

Atkins noted that over the past 30 years, there has been a significant net decline in the total number of publicly traded companies, due in part to mergers and bankruptcies outpacing IPOs. His goal, he said, is to “make it cool to be a public company” again—something he believes has “taken a hit over time.”

Atkins outlined three obstacles he believes are holding issuers back. The first is what he described as expensive, overly long disclosures that impose an unnecessary burden on issuers. The second is the threat of securities litigation. Atkins reiterated his support for allowing companies—where state law permits—to adopt bylaws mandating arbitration and applying “loser pays” fee-shifting provisions, and said the SEC staff will no longer block an IPO solely because such measures are included. “If the state allows it, then that will be fine with us,” he said.

His third concern centers on what he characterized as “politicized shareholder activists” who can influence corporate governance battles. Atkins expects any related policy proposals to take most of next year to move through the regulatory process.

IPO momentum returns in 2025

After a significant downturn, the IPO market has been gaining momentum. In my conversation with Lynn Martin, president of the New York Stock Exchange, during the recent Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit, she said: “The IPO market is really, really strong. We’ve had a great year so far across all sectors.”

According to S&P Global research, the first half of 2025 was the strongest start for U.S. IPO issuance since 2021, with 102 IPOs versus 78 in the same period of 2024. Deal activity accelerated through the period, with 59 IPOs raising

[TITLE]Telcos set for steady sales, earnings growth in 2026 – Moody’s:
[TEXT]
The corporate finance group of major credit rating agency Moody’s reckons the global telecom operator sector is set for stable revenue and core earnings growth in 2026, although expectations for the different geographic regions vary quite markedly, with Latin America set for the strongest growth.

During the ratings agency’s recent Global Telecommunications Market Update 2026, Carlos Winzer, associate managing director of the corporate finance group, said average organic revenue growth for the global telco sector is projected at 2.3% and organic earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) growth at 2.9% for the largest operators globally.

“This stability is supported by price increases, which continue to gain traction, the phasing out of the legacy copper networks, which are being substituted with fibre, and the integration of GenAI [generative AI] to drive efficiency. Industry consolidation is expected to further strengthen the sector’s foundations,” Winzer said.

In terms of the different regions, North America is expected to see the lowest revenue growth of 1.3%, while Latin America (LatAm) will see the highest at 3.7%. LatAm also leads with the highest expected EBITDA growth of 5.2%, while Asia Pacific (APAC) brings up the rear with 2.2% (see map, above).

Although macroeconomic conditions are challenging and risks remain, Winzer said telecom service providers “continue to evolve their business models in a period of transformation marked by rising data consumption and expanding broadband access”.

M&A on the cards in Europe

Telcos in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are expected to see revenue and EBITDA growth of 3.6% and 4% respectively owing to growing data demand, higher broadband penetration and streamlining at an operational level, said Winzer.

At the same time, he noted that major European telcos “are positioned for a wave of mergers and acquisitions in 2026, with consolidation talks intensifying across several markets”, such as in France, Italy and Spain.

“All these developments suggest that 2026 could be a pivotal year for European telecom M&A as operators seek scale and efficiency in an increasingly competitive market,” said Winzer.

Telcos in Europe also continue to hold significant amounts of debt, and will “need to navigate a challenging funding environment, balancing investment demands with prudent financial management to ensure continued access to liquidity and support for future growth”, he added.

Turning to North America, Emile El-Nems, VP and senior credit officer at Moody’s, said the outlook for the US is stable because of underlying dynamics, such as a more supportive regulatory environment, limited pricing power, “operating leverage” owing to acquisitions, and modest subscriber growth.

“We are expecting seven to eight million subscribers [net adds] in wireless… and

[TITLE]Updates on the AGI Debate, Humanoid Bots and Karpathy Insight:
[TEXT]
Tim Dettmers Argues AGI Will Not Happen

Dettmers claims GPU performance-per-cost peaked around 2018. Post-2018 gains from one-off architectural tricks now exhausted and facing diminishing returns.

Transformers are near physically optimal for local computation versus global attention.

Scaling laws demand exponential resources for linear gains. Only 1–2 years of viable scaling left before costs outpace benefits.

His conclusion is AGI and superintelligence are fantasies that ignore physical compute constraints.

Counterpoints and Debate

Critics say this view conflicts with hardware vendors (Nvidia, AMD, Intel) roadmaps and the thousands of experts working to continue to improve.

CPU architectures hit limits and the workarounds persisted to give improvements for CPUs and then CPUs are mostly displaced by GPUs.

Nate Jones says Dettmer could be mostly correct on issues and problems with GPU details. He is wrong on big picture which is my prior point
