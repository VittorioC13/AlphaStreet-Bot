[TITLE]Apple announces new European renewable energy projects:
[TEXT]
Tech giant Apple has announced an expansion of its clean energy projects across Europe with new large-scale solar and wind farms now in development in Greece, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Romania.

Together with a newly operational solar array in Spain, Apple said the projects will add 650 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to electrical grids across Europe in the coming years.

"This will generate over 1 million megawatt-hours of clean electricity on behalf of Apple users by 2030," the company said

Product use, the energy it takes to charge and power Apple devices, accounted for about 29% of the company's overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2024.

"By 2030, we want our users to know that all the energy it takes to charge their iPhone or power their Mac is matched with clean electricity," said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives.

"Our new projects in Europe will help us achieve our ambitious Apple 2030 goal, while contributing to healthy communities, thriving economies, and secure energy sources across the continent," Ms Jackson said.

Environmental groups have expressed growing concerns about the high energy consumption of the tech sector, particularly when it comes to data centres.

There are more than 80 data centres in Ireland and they consume around 22% of the country's electricity, a figure that is set to rise over the coming years.

In 2018, Apple announced it would not be proceeding with a planned €850m data centre in Athenry, Co Galway after protracted legal challenges delayed its start.

[TITLE]US ready to tariff China over Russian oil buys, but Europe must follow, Bessent says:
[TEXT]
The United States is ready to impose tariffs on China over its purchases of Russian oil, but Washington's European allies must be willing to take part in such action, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a news conference on Wednesday.

"It is the purchase of Russian oil by China that fuels the Russian war machines. China buys 60%, six zero percent, of Russian energy. They buy 90 per cent of Iranian energy," he said.

The U.S. would produce photographs supplied by the Ukrainian government that showed Chinese parts were used in Russian drones operating in Ukraine, Bessent said through a spokesperson.

[TITLE]Russia's Ban On Energy Exports Exposes Central Asia's Dependence On Moscow:
[TEXT]
Russia's Ban On Energy Exports Exposes Central Asia's Dependence On Moscow

By Farangis Najibullah and RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service October 15, 2025

Summary

Russia faces fuel shortages and price hikes after Ukrainian attacks on oil refineries, prompting export restrictions on gasoline and diesel.

Central Asian countries like Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan are heavily impacted, with Tajikistan hit hardest due to its reliance on Russian imports.

Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan remain relatively stable, leveraging their energy reserves and refining capabilities to mitigate disruptions.

Russia is grappling with fuel shortages and price hikes after a string of Ukrainian attacks on its oil refineries.

To protect supplies in Russia, where long lines at gas stations have been reported in some regions, Moscow has banned or restricted the export of gasoline and diesel.

The move has triggered fuel shortages and price rises in some of the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, which are heavily reliant on Russian energy.

Tajikistan Among Hardest Hit

Tajikistan, which imports almost all its fuel -- mostly from Russia, has been among the hardest hit.

A strategic partner and close ally of Moscow, Tajikistan still receives Russian fuel under bilateral import agreements.

But prices in Central Asia's poorest country have increased sharply since Russia first imposed restrictions on energy exports during the summer. A liter of regular gasoline in Tajikistan currently costs up to $1.30, the highest in the region.

Uncertainty over Russia's exports has forced Tajikistan to diversify its energy consumption model. Many taxis and public transportation vehicles in Dushanbe have switched to liquefied natural gas or electric power, moving away from gasoline.

Still, Dushanbe says its annual gasoline imports from Russia by the end of the year will reach 500,000 tons, a significant rise from 451,000 tons in 2024.

Kyrgyzstan Is Vulnerable

Kyrgyzstan imports more than 90 percent of the gasoline and diesel it consumes from Russia.

As a member of the Moscow-led Eurasian Economic Union, Kyrgyzstan has been shielded from Russia's export ban.

Even so, Kyrgyzstan has faced price hikes, supply delays, and temporary fuel shortages since the summer.

Experts say Kyrgyzstan is vulnerable because of its almost complete dependence on Russian imports.

"There are few real alternatives to Russian supplies in the short term," economist Nurgul Akimova told RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service. "All these alternatives will require significant investment in infrastructure and will be more expensive than current Russian supplies."

Uzbekistan Turns To Other Suppliers

Uzbekistan still imports Russian gasoline and diesel as part of government-brokered contracts with Russian companies.

But wary of its overreliance on Russia, Central Asia's most populous country has increased its fuel imports from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan -- Central Asia's two largest exporters.

Uzbekistan has large oil reserves but lacks the infrastructure to boost production. In 2024, its output was only around 63,000 barrels per day.

Tashkent is planning to boost its oil production by upgrading its aging energy infrastructure and attracting foreign investment.

Kazakhstan Largely Self-Sufficient

Unlike many of its neighbors, Kazakhstan is mostly self-sufficient in energy. The country has large energy reserves and possesses the technology to refine its oil.

Kazakhstan annually produces

[TITLE]Billionaire bidders must show the money in Jaypee insolvency face-off:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: The Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) is set to review and seek details of how bidders, including Vedanta and Adani, intend to finance the acquisition of the debt-laden company. The resolution plans would be put to vote in November, two people aware of the development said.

This marks a key milestone in one of the longest-running corporate insolvency proceedings of the country.

The five bidders in fray are billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd, billionaire Gautam Adani-led Adani Enterprises, billionaire Naveen Jindal-backed Jindal Power Ltd, Puneet Dalmia’s Dalmia Bharat and PNC Infratech Ltd.

“There are more processes to be followed and approvals to be taken before any acquisition is finalized," said the first of the two persons cited earlier, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The lenders are expected to seek proof of funds or a letter of comfort from the winning bidder, once the final resolution plan is approved by the CoC, this person told Mint.

A proof of funds is a documentation that verifies the liquid assets the acquirer has to complete a transaction or meet a financial obligation. On the other hand, a letter of comfort is a non-binding document from a third party, like a parent company or auditor, that provides assurance to a lender or investor

Government vows to create 400,000 jobs in energy sector

1 day ago Share Save Pritti Mistry Business reporter Share Save

Ed Miliband says 400,000 jobs is "not a target, it's what we need"

The government has announced plans to train and recruit more workers for the UK's clean energy sector, promising to create 400,000 extra jobs by 2030. Plumbers, electricians and welders are among 31 priority occupations that are "particularly in demand", with employment in renewable, wind, solar and nuclear expected to double to 860,000 in five years, ministers have said. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said thousands of jobs were needed to develop Britain's clean energy sector to "get bills down for good". Welcoming the proposals, Unite the union said: "Well-paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition."

As part of the government's strategy, five "technical excellence colleges" will be set up to train workers with clean energy skills, with £2.5m in funding going towards pilot schemes in Cheshire, Lincolnshire, and Pembrokeshire, according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). A new programme is to be launched to match veterans with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories and nuclear power stations, while oil and gas workers could benefit from up to £20m from the UK and Scottish governments for bespoke careers training in clean energy roles.

PA Media The Siemens wind turbine factory in Hull, where hundreds are employed, is "booming", a minister has said

There would be also be tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed. He said 10,000 extra jobs would be needed to support the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk and described how the Siemen's wind turbine factory in Hull was "booming". Miliband also told the BBC he stood by his pledge to reduce energy bills by £300 by 2030, after bills went up by 2% for millions across the UK under Ofgem's latest price cap, which sets the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity for millions of households in England, Scotland and Wales. The increase for October to the end of December means a household using a typical amount of energy will pay £1,755 a year, up £35 a year.

[TITLE]Clean energy jobs boom to bring thousands of new jobs:
[TEXT]
Government publishes first ever national plan to recruit workers needed for clean energy mission, with over 400,000 extra jobs by 2030

31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians and welders are particularly in demand

5 new clean energy Technical Excellence Colleges to train next generation of workers, as part of government’s drive for two-thirds of young people to be in higher-level learning

Energy Secretary to set out measures ensuring companies receiving public grants and contracts need to deliver good jobs across the clean energy sector

A generation of young people across Britain will benefit from the good jobs and high wages that the booming clean energy economy can bring, under new plans announced by the government today as part of the clean energy superpower mission

Backed by record government and private sector investment in clean energy such as renewables and nuclear, the clean energy economy is sparking a boom in demand for good industrial jobs in all regions and nations of the UK – with 31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians, and welders particularly in demand.

For the first time, government will today (Sunday 19 October) publish a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030, ensuring jobs are high quality and well paid.

Setting clear workforce estimates for the first time will galvanise industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how this government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70% in the mid 90’s to around 30% today. Recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen. Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders. This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden, said:

We’re giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry - and will drive growth across the nation. Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country’s future, as part of our Plan for Change.

The government’s clean energy mission is already delivering for the UK, with the certainty and stability of the government’s mission having galvanised over £50 billion of private investment since last July.

The government has also given Sizewell C the green light, which will support 10,000 jobs at peak construction, announced Rolls Royce as the preferred bidder for the small modular reactor programme to support up to 3,000 jobs, and kickstarted the Acorn and the Viking projects in Scotland and the North East that is estimated to support a combined 35,000 jobs, including 1,000 apprenticeships. This builds on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay- with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23% more than the same occupations in other sectors.

Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

New initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers - 5 new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans - Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades

Upskill existing workers - Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world class pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and Great British Energy

It comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50% today.

With at least 1 in 6 ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.

The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 60,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

Wales’s growing clean energy industry is delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future. Projects right across the country from Pembrokeshire to Flintshire are creating opportunities for hundreds of our young people and will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.

Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC , said:

After years of previous governments starving British industry of investment, this represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy - as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.

Crucially, it puts decent work at the heart of our energy system. And it shows that when government makes a plan with unions and workers, the whole country can benefit. Whether it’s welders in Wrexham or pipefitters on Teesside, the firm commitment to clean energy jobs being good union jobs is one which will improve working lives the country over. We now look forward to government delivering a similarly robust and funded plan for the North Sea transition, which safeguards jobs and livelihoods.

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, National Officer at the GMB, said:

GMB has long campaigned for a jobs first transition. The government is listening and having a jobs plan to underpin the industrial strategy is exactly what this country needs. GMB welcomes this roadmap for clean energy jobs and the cast iron expectation unions and their members will be at the heart of this. We need fair work agreements and taxpayers’ cash has to be spend where good jobs are going to be created. Today’s plan not only sets out that expectation but crucially, how good jobs can be measured.

Eddie Dempsey, General Secretary of the RMT , said:

RMT welcomes the government’s commitment to closing loopholes in maritime and offshore employment law, which should in turn create domestic opportunities in coastal communities that support the entirety of the offshore wind supply chain. This plan has the potential to create hundreds of thousands of good jobs across the UK, offering real opportunities for those wishing to transition from oil and gas and for a new generation of workers in their own communities.

Christina McAnea, General Secretary of UNISON said:

Clean, homegrown energy is essential in tackling climate change and delivering economic growth. This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs. Extra investment for retraining will mean experienced staff already employed in the sector are able to take on new roles. Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future.

Alasdair McDiarmid, Assistant General Secretary of Community, said

After long years of managed decline and neglect under previous governments, we now have an ambitious government which is serious

[TITLE]Europe’s Aging Grids Buckle Under Renewable Energy Demands:
[TEXT]
The world’s power grids need a major upgrade to keep pace with growing rates of electrification and the ever-increasing energy demands of big data. A cleaner energy landscape means a whole lot more electricity demand, as we switch from gas-powered vehicles and appliances to newer, cleaner models that need to plug into the grid to charge. This means that expanding grid capacity and making our aging grids smarter and more flexible will be essential to maintaining energy security for the future – but grid infrastructure remains woefully neglected, and we’re already starting to see some of the fallout.

“To achieve countries’ national energy and climate goals, the world’s electricity use needs to grow 20% faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one,” states a 2023 report from the International Energy Agency. As a result, grids need to expand at an unprecedented rate. “Reaching national goals also means adding or refurbishing a total of over 80 million kilometres of grids by 2040, the equivalent of the entire existing global grid,” the report goes on to say.

Failure to prioritize investing in grid modernization and expansion poses a major threat to the clean energy transition and to energy security as grids become increasingly reliant on renewable energy sources. Solar and wind energy are variable, meaning that their production levels wax and wane according to factors that have nothing to do with demand trends. Plus, energy production is increasingly dispersed, especially so thanks to the proliferation of residential solar panels. These factors introduce an extra level of complexity for grids that were designed with just a few major utilities in mind, and with only one direction of energy flow.

All of this is already leading to some hiccups for grid stability. In Europe, where renewable expansion and EV adoption have soared, critical grid congestion and catastrophic blackouts have become an increasing issue. At the end of April, cascading grid failures in Spain and Portugal resulted in the worst blackout in European history, and highlighted how woefully insufficient grid investment has been to date. At the time, Eurelectric reported that the “extraordinary event” in Iberia served as “a stark reminder that the grid is the backbone of our society. With electricity playing an increasingly important role in our society, we need to create all the conditions to enable a secure electricity supply.”

Unfortunately, many countries are now facing the consequences of failing to create all of those conditions. In the Netherlands, massive success with clean energy capacity installation and EV adoption without commensurate grid infrastructure expansion has resulted in a new norm of power cuts and energy consumption austerity measures. And it’s going to take a lot of money and time to fix the issue.

"They have a grid crisis because they haven't invested enough in their distribution networks, in their transmission networks, so they are facing bottlenecks everywhere, and it will take years and billions of dollars to solve this," Damien Ernst, professor of electrical engineering at Belgium's Liege University, recently told the BBC. The problem is causing ripples throughout the Netherlands economy. New housing, for example, is now facing long waiting lists in order to connect to grids that are already operating over maximum capacity.

But the issue is not limited to the Netherlands. Much of Europe has neglected to properly invest in grid infrastructure as a part of national clean energy planning. "We have an enormous amount of solar panels being installed, and they are installed at a rate that is much, much too high for the grid to be able to accommodate," Ernst went on to say.

In the Netherlands, massive success with clean energy capacity installation and EV adoption without commensurate grid infrastructure expansion has resulted in a new norm of power cuts and energy consumption austerity measures. And it’s going to take a lot of money and time to fix the issue.

"They have a grid crisis because they haven't invested enough in their distribution networks, in their transmission networks, so they are facing bottlenecks everywhere, and it will take years and billions of dollars to solve this," Damien Ernst, professor of electrical engineering at Belgium's Liege University, recently told the BBC. The problem is causing ripples throughout the Netherlands economy. New housing, for example, is now facing long waiting lists in order to connect to grids that are already operating over maximum capacity.

But the issue is not limited to the Netherlands. Much of Europe has neglected to properly invest in grid infrastructure as a part of national clean energy planning. "We have an enormous amount of solar panels being installed, and they are installed at a rate that is much, much too high for the grid to be able to accommodate," Ernst went on to say.
