[TITLE]Flanders Eliminates Belgium’s First Contemporary Art Museum, Raising Controversy:
[TEXT]
A proposal by the Flemish government to close Belgium’s oldest museum dedicated to contemporary art has spurred widespread controversy in the Belgian art scene.

Earlier this week, the Flemish government, which manages the mostly Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, said it had “decided to thoroughly reform the landscape of its own museums and the visual arts sector in Flanders.” The decision came after a recent assessment of the region’s museum landscape, with the aim of providing a “more logical distribution” of the region’s public collections.

As part of this change, which will begin next year and be completed by 2028, S.M.A.K. in Ghent will become the Flemish Museum of Contemporary and Current Art. The collection of the Antwerp-based M HKA (an acronym for the Museum of Contemporary Art Antwerp, in Dutch) will be transferred to that new museum, and its holdings will be moved to Ghent.

Founded in 1985, the M HKA is the oldest contemporary art museum in Belgium, predating S.M.A.K. by more than a decade. Its collection now numbers around 8,000 objects, and it is known for its closely watched exhibition program, featuring a mix of single-artist surveys and group exhibitions. Recent shows include solos for Nástio Mosquito (in 2024), Dorothy Iannone (2023), and Anthea Hamilton (2022), as well as the 2024 exhibition “The Lives of Animals.” The museum is currently hosting the Kyiv Biennial 2025 and a survey of Pauline Curnier Jardin, with a major Nicola L. retrospective planned for 2026.

S.M.A.K., which has a collection of some 3,000 works from the postwar era to today, will also take over M HKA’s mission to present contemporary art, while M HKA’s current building will be transformed into an arts center that will stage exhibitions, as well as host studios, residencies, and other programming—seemingly adopting the Kunsthalle model that is prominent in several other European countries. Similarly, the Centre for Art Archives Flanders, which is housed at M HKA, “will also be repositioned in the field,” according to the release.

On Tuesday, the day after the new museum plan was announced, M HKA’s board chairman Herman De Bode resigned after eight years. According to a report by Art Dependence Magazine, he said, “the decision taken by the Flemish government to behead the M HKA, at the suggestion of the Minister of Culture, is too crazy for words. This happened without any participation from anyone on our side. I think that’s criminal. I have no other words for it.”

Bode said that what makes M HKA unique as an institution is “tied to our history. You can relocate some works of art, but you don’t really move anything with that. You cannot export the avant-garde to Ghent. It’s Antwerp.”

“Flemish museums can be proud of their collections,” Flemish culture minister Caroline Gennez told Belga New Agency. “But in order to get more out of those collections and realise the ambitions of scaling up and internationalisation, more cooperation is needed.”

These decisions seem to have been made without input from the respective institutions. The M HKA has published an open letter, written by its employees and addressed to Gennez,

[TITLE]Nearly 7,000 new UK jobs to be created as a result of Prime Minister's trip to India:
[TEXT]
64 Indian companies will invest over £1 billion into the UK, creating 6,900 jobs spread across every region

Deals signed and sealed during the Prime Minister’s trade mission to India, where he has promised to open doors for British business and drive growth at home – delivering on the Plan for Change

Investments are another vote of confidence in the UK economy and cement its reputation as one of the best places in the world to do business

Nearly 7,000 brand new jobs will be created in the United Kingdom thanks to a raft of major new deals secured by the Prime Minister during his visit to India this week.

64 Indian investors have confirmed their confidence in the UK as a business destination by collectively investing £1.3 billion into some of Britain’s most thriving businesses - demonstrating the impact the UK-India trade deal is already having on investor confidence.

As a result, Indian investment will flow into range of UK sectors including engineering, technology and the creative industries, driving growth and creating jobs across every region of the country - from Basingstoke to Birmingham.

The Prime Minister believes the UK-India trade deal is a launchpad for turbocharged domestic growth – with these figures proving it is already bearing fruit, despite only being signed three months ago.

From next-generation electric motorbikes, semi-conductor development and agricultural innovation – the investments will benefit some of the UK’s most exciting industries and cement the UK-India economic partnership.

It comes off the back of a two-day trade mission by the Prime Minister to Mumbai, where he met with Indian business leaders and directly sealed the deals that will result in growth and jobs that will put money directly into the pockets of hardworking British people.

The UK-India trade deal will reduce tariffs on imports from the UK to India and vice versa, and it has created a burst of momentum for UK-India trade.

India is already the UK’s second largest investor and more than 1,000 Indian companies operate in the UK, supporting millions of UK jobs.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:

“These investments are a powerful endorsement of the UK’s global standing and economic potential. Nearly 7,000 new jobs spread across every region of our country will mean more opportunities, more innovation, and make working people better off.

“From electric vehicles in Solihull to cutting-edge Agri-tech in Somerset, these deals show that our Plan for Change is delivering real results. The UK-India trade deal is already unlocking growth, and today’s announcements mark the beginning of a new era of collaboration between our two nations.”

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

“India is now the fourth-biggest economy in the world, and by investing billions of pounds to back thousands of jobs from sectors as diverse as AI, education, and financial services shows the scale of opportunity this presents for British businesses.

“Their success in India will only grow as our new trade deal galvanises economic partnership, brings our two countries even closer together, and ultimately delivers economic growth right across the UK.”

Key announcements include:

Advanced manufacturing company TVS Motor will invest £250 million in Solihull to expand its Norton Motorcycles operations and develop next-generation electric vehicles, creating 300 high-quality jobs and collaborating with UK research institutions such as the University of Warwick – showcasing the best of Britain.

Engineering company Cyient is investing £100 million to boost innovation in semiconductors, geospatial tech, mobility, clean energy, and digital domains - creating 300 UK jobs and strengthening its long-standing presence in the country.

In Somerset, tech firm Atul–Date Palm Developments is investing £11 million in sustainable and innovative Agri-tech, establishing advanced R&D that will create 44 highly-skilled jobs and support global climate resilience.

Mastek, a global digital engineering firm, is investing £2 million to open a new AI and Experience Centre in London and Leeds office, generating 200 skilled roles including 75 apprenticeships.

NeoCeltic Global Ltd is investing £5 million to deliver advanced orthopaedic and rehabilitation solutions, creating 85 jobs across London and Cardiff.

Meanwhile, Alcor Logistics is expanding into Liverpool and London with a £4 million investment to establish UK operations as a non-vessel operator, creating 250 jobs and enhancing global freight and supply chain capabilities.

Sudarshan Venu, Chairman and Managing Director, TVS Motor Company said:

“TVS Motor has had a long association with the UK and over the years new facets have been added - engineering & technology, academia partnerships & scholarships, and e-Bikes. Now Norton Motorcycles, the storied British marque, is poised to open a new chapter of resurgence and global expansion with TVS Motor’s backing. We are excited

[TITLE]Central Asia to Defy Global Headwinds With Robust Economic Growth:
[TEXT]
A new survey published by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development offers a strong near-term economic outlook for Central Asian states. But the bank adds that the region is prone to fluctuations in commodity prices, reliance on remittances, and dependence on Russian and Chinese markets.

The EBRD’s Regional Economic Prospects 2025 edition projects regional growth this year to reach 6.1 percent, and slow to 5.2 percent in 2026.

“Central Asia Central Asian economies continued to post solid growth in the first half of 2025, supported by robust domestic demand, rising real wages and strong remittance inflows. Industrial output remained overall resilient, but volatility in commodity prices affected mining outputs and exports of countries in this region,” the report states.

“Inflation trends diverged: while inflation eased from its peaks in Turkmenistan, Mongolia and Uzbekistan, it accelerated in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, driven by fiscal stimulus, rising food prices and utility tariff adjustments,” the report adds.

Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are widely viewed as being the largest and most innovative economies in the region, but the EBRD anoints Kyrgyzstan as Central Asia’s economic “pacesetter.” Bishkek is projected to record 9 percent annual growth this year, falling to 6 percent in 2026.

“Strong public investment and buoyant domestic demand have supported growth, fueled by rising wages and continued increases in remittances,” according to the report. “The manufacturing, trade and construction sectors were the leading growth engines, while the tourism and hospitality sector maintained strong growth.”

A variety of factors, including expanded oil production from the Tengiz field, major state investments in infrastructure projects and an increase in household spending, are helping drive Kazakhstan’s economy. GDP growth is estimated to reach 5.7 percent in 2025, and ease to 4.5 percent next year. The report identifies several downside risks, in particular “an over-reliance on Russian infrastructure for oil transit, and commodity price volatility.”

Related: The Slow Demise of Russian Oil Production

Uzbekistan is expected to maintain a relatively steady growth pace, with the EBRD estimating a 6.7 percent increase in 2025 and 6 percent next year. Growth is “underpinned by robust domestic consumption and investments, as well as by sustained expansion in diversified manufacturing, bolstered by continued foreign investment,” the report states. Tashkent is also benefiting from high prices paid for its gold exports and strong growth in the volume of remittances sent home by labor migrants.

Tajikistan’s economy is heavily dependent on remittances, which have proven robust so far this year. The mining sector, along with the agricultural and transport sectors, are also performing well, according to the EBRD report, which additionally cites “strong” household consumption. Such an assertion seems at odds with reports that indicate high inflation is making it difficult to afford essential food items and other necessities. The EBRD projects Tajikistan to see GDP growth of 7.5 percent in 2025, slipping to 5.7 percent next year. “A potential decline in remittance inflows remains a downside risk,” the report notes.

The opaque nature of Turkmenistan’s political system invariably complicates efforts to estimate economic activity in the country. The EBRD report accepts official Turkmen government data as accurate, projecting economic growth over the next two years to remain at a steady 6.3 percent, propelled by “ongoing investments in energy, infrastructure, agriculture and food processing.”

The EBRD includes Mongolia in its grouping of Central Asian states, projecting Ulaanbaatar to maintain a consistent growth rate of 5.8 percent in 2025, followed by a 5.5 percent rate next year. The EBRD report states that a rebounding agricultural sector, combined with the expansion of the services sector, is offsetting “weaker mining-sector activity and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment.” Challenges over the near-term may arise from weakening Chinese demand and commodity price volatility, the report adds.

In sharp contrast to Central Asia, the EBRD is predicting a significant decline in the Caucasus region’s economic performance. Georgia, which over the past year has made a geopolitical pivot away from the European Union back towards Russia, seems to be in an economic free-fall, according to the EBRD. GDP growth in 2024 stood at 9.4 percent, but is expected to plunge to a 5 percent growth rate in 2026. Azerbaijan is projected to follow a similar trajectory, falling from a 4.1 percent growth rate in 2024 to a 2.5 percent rate in 2026. Armenia stands to see the least decline, going from a 5.9 percent growth rate in 2024 to 4.5 percent in 2026.

[TITLE]German police given new powers to shoot down drones:
[TEXT]

Germany’s police force will be given new and far-reaching powers to shoot down rogue drones in a swift response to last week’s incursions that grounded thousands of flights at Munich airport.

Amid recent disruption from suspected Russian drones across Europe at arms factories, hospitals and critical infrastructure, the anti-drone draft Bill approved on Wednesday by the cabinet of Chancellor Friedrich Merz now goes to parliament.

The chancellor said Germany would not allow “drone incidents threaten our safety”.

“We are strengthening the powers of the federal police so that drones can be detected and intercepted more quickly in future,” he said.

So far this year, 129 untraceable drone flights have disrupted air travel in Germany, up one third on the same period last year. The draft Bill clarifies the circumstances in which drones can be intercepted and by whom.

Federal interior minister Alexander Dobrint said the federal police – already responsible for security at German airports – will be responsible for smaller drones at airports, large public events, government buildings and train stations and lines.

“This gives the federal police the opportunity to have the latest technology to tackle drones,” he said of the Bill, which will see Berlin invest €90 million annually in anti-drone technology – most likely from Ukraine and Israel.

On the minister’s shopping list: laser devices, GPS blockers and other electronic jamming devices. In addition Germany will spend €25 million to buy its own drone patrol fleet and has vowed to become a world leader in drone-building.

Meanwhile, the Bill opens the door to allow the military deployment to tackle larger drones and other aircraft, though legal questions remain given a German ban on military domestic deployment.

The new German anti-drone Bill follows similar measures adopted in the UK, France and Lithuania but neighbouring Denmark has gone a step further.

Plagued by drones of unknown origin, on Tuesday Denmark’s defence minister signed a memorandum of understanding with his Kyiv counterpart to allow Ukrainian defence companies set up joint ventures in the Nordic country.

Danish defence minister Lund Poulsen admitted his country was “not well prepared” for rogue drones while Ukrainian defence minister Denys Shmyhal described the deal as a “major step towards forming a new security system in Europe”.

A series of high-profile drone incursions, in particular over Copenhagen airport, dominated Danish headlines for weeks.

Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that a “hybrid war” is already under way in Europe creating “the most difficult and dangerous situation since the end of the second World War”.

As in other European countries, Denmark has not been able to identify the origin of the drones, but Ms Frederiksen said “there is only one country willing to threaten us and it is Russia, so we need a strong response”.

Last week Russian president Vladimir Putin denied any Russian involvement and accused Europe of “whipping up hysteria” over the recent drone wave.

Denmark’s Defence Intelligence Service (DDIS) has warned that Moscow is combining rogue drone activity at Nordic airports with so-called “grey zone” fleet activity in the Danish Straits – strategic waters linking the Baltic Sea to other Nato waters.

Similar to Berlin, Copenhapen is in talks to Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) about purchasing one of its state-of-the-art Barak MX air defence systems.

IAI has received at least €1.4 million in EU science and research funding for developing its products, as have rival anti-aircraft system-makers in Israel.

Amid a new anti-drone push, Nato has unveiled new European command structures, with new logistics and ground command centres in Sweden and Finland, respectively.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK is scrutinising the potential acquisition of the helicopter leasing arm of Macquarie Group by a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation.

The regulatory body is examining the implications of the deal if it could lead to lessening of competition within any market or markets within the region.

It has called for comments from parties with an interest in the industry.

These submissions are to be made by the deadline of 21 October.

CMA’s initial assessment is scheduled to be announced by 3 December.

Earlier this year, a joint venture (JV) between Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasing Corporation (SMFL) and Lease Corporation International (LCI) disclosed its agreement to purchase Macquarie Rotorcraft (MRL).
