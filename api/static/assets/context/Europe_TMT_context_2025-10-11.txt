[TITLE]The State of AI Competition in Advanced Economies:
[TEXT]
October 06, 2025

The State of AI Competition in Advanced Economies

Alex Haag

Global competition in artificial intelligence (AI) has intensified in recent years. Some assessments emphasize US exceptionalism, while others argue that China is eroding US dominance. By contrast, the progress of other advanced foreign economies (AFEs) receives far less attention. Existing cross-country comparisons rely largely on composite indices that, while useful as benchmarks, are subject to weighting and aggregation biases that may obscure important dimensions of AI capacity. A clearer understanding of cross-country AI capabilities can help better contextualize global AI competition.

This note brings together international comparisons on key metrics to assess countries' relative preparedness and performance in AI. The analysis shows that the United States retains important advantages in infrastructure (with the exception of electricity-related infrastructure), compute capacity, and investment conditions. AFEs face greater challenges in scaling compute resources and attracting investment. China has achieved rapid gains in research output and adoption, though its position in enabling infrastructure is less clear.1 Taken together, these comparisons suggest a global landscape in which, despite increased competition in research and applied domains, US strengths in core AI enablers remain durable.

1. Cross-Country Comparisons Using AI Indices

We start with several widely cited indices of AI capacity and preparedness to provide an initial view of the global landscape (Table 1).2 The United States consistently ranks at or near the top, with the United Kingdom close behind and Italy lowest among G7 members. China's ranking varies from just below the United States on some indices (e.g., GII, Stanford) to significantly lower than most AFEs on others (e.g., IMF, Oxford).

These indices are a useful starting point but have limitations. Methodological approaches, such as indicator selection, weighting, and aggregation, can potentially obscure core metrics of AI performance and penalize diverse national AI strategies (Greco et al., 2018). Still, these indices highlight key areas for comparison: physical and digital infrastructure, investment and firm dynamics, and adoption across the economy. The rest of this note delves deeper into these dimensions, focusing on key metrics to provide a clearer picture of global AI capabilities.

2. Physical and Digital Infrastructure

Physical and digital infrastructure form the foundation for AI adoption. Physical infrastructure includes data centers and high-performance computing hardware, supported by reliable energy, telecommunications, and manufacturing capabilities. Digital infrastructure adds cloud computing, data access, and other tools for widespread model deployment.

As shown in Figure 1, the United States made early, outsized investments in computing, software, and databases, with annual real investment in these areas growing over tenfold from 1995 to 2021, far outpacing AFE peers, whose growth was two- to fourfold. These early investments provided the computing power, networks, and hardware that positioned the United States to lead early in AI-related innovation and diffusion.

Figure 1. Investment in AI-Related Physical and Digital Infrastructure

Compute, the processing power and network resources used for AI training and inference, is the clearest measure of a country's ability to develop and deploy AI. Data centers, processors (CPUs and GPUs), and broader computing systems support the growing demands of modern AI workloads.

Data center construction in the United States surged over the past decade.3 The United States hosted an estimated 4,049 data centers as of 2024, far more than the EU (~2,250), the UK (484), and China (379).4 In 2024 alone, the United States added 5.8 gigawatts (GW) of data center capacity, compared with 1.6 GW in the EU and 0.2 GW in the United Kingdom.5 On a per capita basis, the US server base stands at 99.9 per 1,000 people, far surpassing other advanced foreign economies and China (Figure 2A).

Figure 2. Compute Capacity Indicators

High-end computing, particularly AI supercomputers, is particularly critical for large-scale model training and more recently inference-based tasks. The United States dominates cumulative AI supercomputer capacity, controlling an estimated 74 percent of global high-end AI compute, while China holds 14 percent and the EU 4.8 percent (Figure 2B).

3. Energy Infrastructure Risks

The rapid growth of AI workloads is driving a substantial increase in data center power demand, highlighting the importance of electricity generation and transmission capacity in supporting AI infrastructure. RAND estimates that AI could require 117 GW globally by 2028, while the IEA projects that global electricity consumption from data centers will more than double by 2030, with the United States and China accounting for 80 percent of the growth.6

China outstripped the United States in electricity generation capacity more than a decade ago (Figure 3), with roughly 3,200 GW of installed capacity compared with 1,293 GW in the United States and 1,125 GW in the EU. China added 429 GW of net electric generation capacity in 2024 alone, over 15 times the net capacity added by the United States (Chan et al., 2025).

Figure 3. Installed Electric Generation Capacity

It remains unclear whether US power generation and transmission capacity will keep pace with rapidly growing data center demand. Installed data centers currently account for
