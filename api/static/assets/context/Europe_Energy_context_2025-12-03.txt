[TITLE]Enugu, EU deepen partnership to boost education, energy, infrastructure:
[TEXT]
The Enugu State Government and the European Union have renewed commitments to deepen cooperation across key sectors of the state’s economy, including education, energy, infrastructure, and youth development.

This followed a courtesy visit to Governor Peter Mbah at Government House, Enugu, by a high-powered EU delegation led by the EU Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Mr Gautier Mignot, according to a statement released by the governor’s media office on Saturday.

The team also included the Belgian Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Pieter Leenknegt; the Portuguese Ambassador, Mr Paulos Martins dos Santos; and several senior European diplomats.

Speaking during the meeting, Ambassador Mignot said the EU was eager to expand a partnership that aligns directly with the transformational policies of the Mbah administration.

“The purpose of our visit is to meet you, pay our respects, and discuss how to strengthen the partnership between the European Union and Enugu State. We are very interested in areas where our projects meet your administration’s expectations and long-term vision,” he said.

Mignot highlighted ongoing collaborations in the education and energy sectors, describing Enugu as one of the EU’s key beneficiary states.

“In the energy sector, the Solar for Health project is already under implementation. Under this programme, Enugu will receive technical assistance and funding for 20 solar microgrids to power 20 primary healthcare centres and 124 small and medium-sized enterprises,” he explained.

He also noted that the Small Hydro Power for Agro-industrial Sectors Project, implemented by UNIDO, and the Nigeria Energy Support Programme of GIZ were supporting electrification efforts, investment advisory services, and capacity building.

“Three interconnected minigrids of up to 1 MW capacity will also be funded to electrify at least 1,000 beneficiaries,” Mignot added.

On education, he announced that Enugu had been selected as one of the states to benefit from the Education and Youth Empowerment in Nigeria (EISS) programme implemented by UNESCO.

“The programme will train teachers in Smart Green Schools until June 2028. Building resilience and capacity among teachers is central to our goals,” the EU envoy said.

He also referenced the EU’s support for the Eastern Nigeria International Film Festival (ENIFF), describing it as a key platform for creative and cultural exchange.

“The 2025 edition in Enugu provided training for aspiring filmmakers and awarded grants for short film projects. We value this growing partnership with the creative industry,” Mignot noted.

Belgian Ambassador Pieter Leenknegt pointed to Belgium’s long-standing economic footprint in Enugu, particularly through Emenite Limited — a joint venture established in 1961.

“Emenite has over 300 employees from this region. It remains a shining example of Belgian–Nigerian cooperation. We want to continue strengthening this relationship,” he said.

Portuguese Ambassador Paulos Martins dos Santos emphasised Portugal’s wide-ranging interest in Nigeria’s energy, agricultural, and infrastructure sectors.

“The footprint of the European Union in this country is huge and multidimensional. Portugal looks forward to enhancing its contribution to this partnership, especially in areas that complement Enugu’s development plans,” he stressed.

In his remarks, Governor Mbah praised the EU for aligning its programmes with his administration’s development priorities.

“I see a strong synergy between our vision in Enugu and the EU’s programmes across Africa. Our investment of over 33 per cent of our total budget in education is deliberate. If we fail to equip our children today, we will pay ten times more in the future,” he said.

He also invited EU member states to explore emerging investment opportunities in Enugu’s aviation, natural gas, and energy sectors.

“We have launched Enugu Air, and the international wing of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport will soon become operational. We encourage you to speak to your home carriers to begin to consider direct flights to Enugu,” the governor announced.

On the state’s gas infrastructure ambitions, Mbah added: “We are working with the Federal Government to expand the gas pipeline infrastructure. This will unlock enormous economic opportunities in the gas subsector. Enugu is open for business, and we will do everything necessary to ensure investments succeed.”

The visit ended with both parties reaffirming their commitment to sustained collaboration aimed at accelerating development and improving livelihoods across Enugu State.

[TITLE]Nigeria launches oil blocks bid round, eyes $10bn investment:
[TEXT]
The Federal Government, through the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, has unveiled an ambitious plan to attract $10bn in new investments and unlock up to two billion barrels of crude oil reserves through the newly commenced Nigeria 2025 Petroleum Licensing Round.

Unveiling the bid round in Abuja on Monday, the Chief Executive, NUPRC, Gbenga Komolafe, said the exercise, covering 50 oil and gas blocks across onshore, shallow-water, frontier, and deepwater terrains, would help reverse declining exploration activity, expand reserves, and boost national production.

Komolafe said the round marks a major step in the country’s push to revitalise exploration and boost long-term production capacity. He said the commission had unveiled detailed guidelines on its portal, br2025.nuprc.gov.ng, and adopted a two-stage bidding process designed to ensure credibility, investor confidence, and fairness, as prescribed by Section 73 of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.

He said, “The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission is proud to formally announce the commencement of the Nigeria 2025 licensing round and the launch of the licensing round online portal br2025.nuprc.gov.ng.

“This announcement is in line with Section 73 of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021, which prescribes a fair, transparent, and competitive bidding process. Further to this, the NUPRC, following the gracious approval of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, has listed 50 oil and gas blocks across onshore, swamp/shallow water, and offshore terrains spanning diverse basins.”

Of these 50 blocks, 15 are onshore assets; shallow water 19; frontier 15, and 1 deep water asset. According to the NUPRC, the 2025 round is expected to significantly deepen upstream activity over the next decade, with projections indicating that the awarded blocks could collectively deliver up to 400,000 barrels per day upon full operationalisation.

“The Nigeria 2025 licensing round is therefore expected to attract

TotalEnergies EP Nigeria has signed a farmout agreement with Chevron’s Star Deep Water Petroleum to sell a 40% stake in the PPL 2000 and PPL 2001 offshore licences.

Located in the West Delta basin in Nigeria, the two exploration licences cover approximately 2,000km².

The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission awarded the licences to a consortium comprising TotalEnergies and South Atlantic Petroleum during the 2024 Exploration Round.

Under the terms of the agreement, TotalEnergies will have a 40% participation stake and continue as operator, while Chevron will hold another 40% stake in the licences.

South Atlantic Petroleum will have the remaining 20% interest.

The closing of the farmout transaction remains subject to customary conditions including regulatory approvals.

In June, TotalEnergies acquired a 25% working interest in a portfolio of offshore US exploration leases, comprising 40 blocks operated by Chevron.

This new agreement is said to further strengthen TotalEnergies’ global offshore exploration collaboration with Chevron.

TotalEnergies exploration senior vice-president Nicola Mavilla said: “After launching our joint venture [JV] in US offshore exploration in June, we are delighted to now expand our collaboration to Nigeria to unlock new resources in the West Delta basin.

“This new JV aims at de-risking and developing new opportunities in Nigeria, in line with the objectives of the country.”

Last week, the French oil and gas company completed the sale of its non-operated stake in the Bonga deep-water oilfield offshore Nigeria.

TotalEnergies transferred its stake to Shell subsidiary Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company and Eni’s subsidiary Nigerian Agip Exploration.

The sale resulted in changes to the Bonga deep-water field ownership structure within the oil mining lease 118 production sharing contract.

Last month, Chevron forecast more than 10% growth in its annual adjusted free cash flow and annual earnings per share through 2030, assuming Brent crude prices of $70 per barrel.

The company reduced its capital expenditure guidance range to $18bn–21bn per year.

Scope: This TWTW begins with a discussion of saturation physics by William Happer. TWTW then presents more evidence that this Solar Cycle may be hazardous for some types of electronic equipment. It then presents evidence that the UN COP movement may be unraveling. TWTW then presents comments by Roger Caiazza that the New York State plans for electricity may be unfeasible. TWTW concludes with a discussion of asbestos which was found in wind turbines in Australia.

Saturation Physics: The October 11, TWTW discussed that many writers on the effects of CO2 on temperatures misunderstand the relationship between increasing CO2 and increasing temperatures. On November 3, William Happer filed a comment to the EPA on reconsidering the greenhouse gas reporting program. It has a more complete discussion on saturation than TWTW has presented before.

A. Saturation Physics

Carbon dioxide and other GHGs rapidly lose their capacity to warm the planet as their concentration in the atmosphere increases. In radiation transfer physics, this widely observed effect is called “saturation.”

The saturation effect of CO2 is shown in Fig.1 below. Increasing concentrations of other GHGs like methane, CH4 or nitrous oxide, N2O cause only a small fraction of the warming from CO2. For CO2 concentrations greater than

[TITLE]Lelantos Holdings Announces Expansion Into New Resource-Focused Market Verticals:

[TITLE]CARE Ratings reaffirms Tata Chemicals amid market challenges:
[TEXT]
CARE Ratings assigned a stable outlook to Tata Chemicals (TCL) on Monday, reaffirming the company's credit ratings despite ongoing challenges in the global soda ash market. This reaffirmation highlights TCL's robust business model and financial resilience, supported by its leadership position in the global soda ash industry and strategic importance within the Tata Group, the ratings agency said in an official statement.

CARE has reaffirmed TCL's long-term bank facilities at ₹1,300 crore with a CARE AA+; Stable rating and short-term bank facilities at ₹2,000 crore with a CARE A1+ rating. Additionally, non-convertible debentures totaling ₹1,700 crore were reaffirmed at CARE AA+; Stable, while a new issuance of ₹1,500 crore in non-convertible debentures received the same rating. These ratings underscore TCL's strong financial flexibility and refinancing capabilities, supported by Tata Sons Private Limited (TSPL), which holds a substantial stake in the company.

TCL's strengths lie in its diversified operations across India, North America, Europe, and Africa, along with a comprehensive product portfolio that includes both basic chemistry and specialty products. As the world's third-largest producer of soda ash, TCL boasts an annual production capacity of 3.98 million metric tonnes, with two-thirds derived from natural soda ash operations, ensuring cost-efficient production.

Challenging FY25 Despite a challenging FY25, marked by a decline in total operating income and profitability due to global oversupply and margin pressures, TCL's operational performance remained stable, CARE said in its official note. The first half of FY26 also saw subdued demand, but operational efficiencies led to improved margins. The soda ash business is inherently cyclical, with prices and demand closely tied to global economic conditions and industries such as glass, detergents, and lithium for electric vehicle batteries.

TCL's resilience is evident in its strong demand in key markets like India and China, high-capacity utilization, and efficiency initiatives. The company's total operating income for FY25 was ₹14,892 crore, down from ₹15,421 crore the previous year, with a contraction in the profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation, and taxation (PBILDT) margin. However, TCL showed resilience with a PBILDT margin improvement to 18.14% in H1FY26, driven by softer coal prices and disciplined cost control, the ratings agency noted.

The company's liquidity remains robust, with consolidated cash and liquid investments of ₹1,136 crore as of the end of H1FY26. TCL's moderate working capital utilization provides ample liquidity headroom, and its strategic importance within the Tata Group enhances its financial flexibility, allowing it to meet upcoming debt obligations through internal accruals and stable operating cash flows.

TCL is also committed to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, aiming to reduce its carbon footprint by 30% by 2030. The company is investing in green chemistry and waste management practices, including 100% recycling of plastic waste. In FY25, TCL spent ₹22.54 crore on corporate social responsibility initiatives, focusing on socio-economic improvements, health, and education.

Despite the challenges in the global soda ash market, TCL's strong operational and financial foundation, strategic importance within the Tata Group, and commitment to sustainability position it well for future growth. The reaffirmation of its credit ratings by CARE Ratings reflects confidence in TCL's ability to navigate market volatility and maintain its industry leadership.

[TITLE]Alpine Income Property Trust Announces Year-To-Date 2025 Transaction Activity & Preferred Equity Offering:
[TEXT]
WINTER PARK, Fla., Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE: PINE) (the “Company”), an owner and operator of single tenant net leased commercial income properties, today announced its investment and disposition activities for the fourth quarter through December 1, 2025 and year-to-date 2025, and its capital markets activity in the fourth quarter.

Transaction Activity

During the fourth quarter 2025 through December 1, 2025, the Company has completed the following transactions:

Acquisitions: Acquired eight properties, all of which were previously announced, for an aggregate purchase price of $39.8 million representing a weighted average going-in cash cap rate of 6.9% and a weighted average remaining lease term at the time of acquisition of 4.4 years. The acquisitions include: A 131,039 square foot property leased to Sam’s Club, a subsidiary of Walmart (AA credit rating), in Houston, Texas. A four-property portfolio: two properties leased to Hardee’s, one to Jiffy Lube and one to Burger King. A three-property portfolio in Richmond, Virginia: one property ground leased to a 116,425 square foot Walmart Supercenter (AA credit rating), a four-tenant, triple-net-leased building anchored by TJ Maxx (A credit rating) and an additional ground leased outparcel. Walmart is now the Company’s fourth largest tenant, joining a portfolio led by investment grade-rated tenants Lowe’s (BBB+ credit rating) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (BBB credit rating).

Structured Investments: Originated three new structured investments totaling $47.5 million in loan commitments at a weighted average initial cash yield of 16.1% (including accrued interest). The Company recently originated a $4.5 million first mortgage loan with an 11.0% initial cash yield, secured by a Costco-anchored mixed-use development project in Gwinnett County, Georgia. Two of the structured investments were previously announced – a first mortgage commitment to a luxury residential development, where the $29.5 million phase 1 commitment is now fully funded following the borrower’s draw of the remaining $15.4 million, and a $13.5 million commitment for a first mortgage investment secured by a mixed-use development in Lake Toxaway, North Carolina. Amended and upsized an existing investment, Cornerstone Exchange, which is secured by a retail land development in Daytona Beach, Florida, as previously announced. The amendment upsized the loan commitment by $21.3 million for a total commitment of $23.9 million with an initial yield of 10.0%, and the maturity has been extended to April 2027.

Dispositions: Sold a $10.0 million A-1 participation interest in its fully funded $29.5 million phase 1 loan commitment to the luxury residential development located in the Austin, Texas metropolitan area. As part of the transaction, the Company had the loan rated by an independent rating agency whereby the loan received a BBB- rating. The A-1 participation interest will be repaid on a priority basis with proceeds from any sale of collateral lots. After adjusting for the A-1 participation sale and recent funding of the remaining portion of the phase 1 commitment, the Company’s remaining investment in the phase 1 commitment is approximately $19.5 million at an initial yield of 20.9%, including 4.0% accrued interest. Between October 22, 2025 and November 26, 2025, the Company sold four net lease properties for an aggregate sale price of $23.2 million representing a weighted average exit cash cap rate of 7.5%. The properties are leased to Kohl’s, Circle K, Tractor Supply Company and Walgreens. Walgreens has now decreased to the Company’s fifth largest tenant based on annualized base rent, with seven properties leased to Walgreens remaining in the Company’s portfolio.

Year-to-date 2025, the Company’s total investment activity includes $244.2 million of acquisition and structured investment transactions at a weighted average initial cash yield of 10.1%. Year-to-date disposition activity includes $52.2 million of income-producing asset sales representing a weighted average exit cash cap rate of 8.0%. Additionally, the Company has sold $5.3 million of vacant properties year-to-date and one $10.0 million structured investment participation interest (as described above).

As of December 1, 2025, the Company’s property portfolio was 99.4% occupied, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.4 years, and with 50% of annualized base rent attributable to investment grade rated tenants.

Preferred Equity Offering

On November 5, 2025, the Company announced the pricing of a public offering of 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s 8.00% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a public offering price of $25.00 per share. The security is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “PINE-PA”. On November 12, 2025, the Company closed the offering and received gross proceeds of $50,000,000 before deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses.

[TITLE]Shareholder Frustration Kills Massive UK Renewable Infrastructure Fund Merger:
[TEXT]
HICL's portfolio includes UK infrastructure like the High Speed 1 rail link, while TRIG specializes in renewable assets across Britain and Europe, with both boards remaining convinced of the strategic rationale for the combination.

The deal was called off because HICL's board determined it could not proceed without substantial support from its own investors, who were reportedly frustrated with the terms.

HICL Infrastructure and The Renewables Infrastructure Group (TRIG) have abandoned their planned merger, which would have created the UK's largest infrastructure investment firm.

A plan to merge two FTSE-listed funds to form the UK’s largest infrastructure investment firm has been abandoned after shareholders expressed frustration with the terms of the deal.

HICL Infrastructure said it will no longer be proceeding with its planned merger with The Renewables Infrastructure Group (TRIG) after its board “determined that it cannot progress the transaction without a substantial majority of support from its own investors”.

“Both boards remain convinced of the strategic rationale for the combination,” HICL added.

As part of the terms of the deal, TRIG shareholders would have had the option of a partial cash exit of up to £250m in aggregate, representing approximately 11 per cent of TRIG’s share capital.

Assuming full take-up of the partial cash option, HICL shareholders were expected to hold 56 per cent, and TRIG shareholders 44 per cent, of the combined company.

But the deal, first announced on 17 November, attracted significant pushback from shareholders.

“We see multiple reasons for TRIG shareholders to be excited by the proposal, but fewer for HICL shareholders, where a liquidity opportunity is lacking despite a material shift in strategy and portfolio,” analysts at Peel Hunt said.

“Whilst we applaud the boards of both companies for working on a transformative transaction, we are concerned by the balance of incentives for each set of shareholders.”

TRIG shares fell 3.8 per cent to 71p following the announcement, while HICL shares rose 4.2 per cent to 118p.

Government and energy assets

HICL was listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange in 2006 and was originally set up to invest in infrastructure projects developed under the UK’s private finance initiative (PFI).

HICL’s portfolio includes a host of UK infrastructure assets such as the High Speed 1 rail link, the Westminster headquarters of the Home Office, The Northwood headquarters of the Ministry of Defence and Lewisham hospital.

TRIG, which was formed in 2013 to specialise in renewable infrastructure, operates a portfolio comprising stakes in several dozen wind and solar projects across Britain as well as further afield in Germany, France and Spain.

[TITLE]Private Equity Pours $1.45 Billion Into UK Renewable Energy:
[TEXT]
UK energy company Low Carbon has raised as much as $1.45 billion (£1.1 billion) from CVC Capital Partners and other investors as private equity firms are increasingly backing renewables operations.

CVC Capital Partners and Low Carbon’s existing shareholder Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company participated in the funding, which will see CVC Capital Partners become the majority owner of Low Carbon, a company developing and operating solar, wind, and energy storage projects in the UK and Europe.

“As a private markets company, we’re clearly looking for attractive risk returns through cycles,” Caine Bouwmeester, partner and head of renewable energy at CVC DIF, told Bloomberg in an interview published on Monday.

“From our perspective, it’s quite an attractive entry point in the market,” said the head of renewable energy at CVC’s infrastructure arm.

The CVC deal with Low Carbon is the latest in a series of major deals that private equity has struck with renewable project developers in recent months.

In early November, Apollo-managed funds agreed to invest $6.5 billion to buy a 50% stake in the Hornsea 3 offshore wind farm of Ørsted, the world’s largest offshore wind developer. The $6.5 billion investment includes the acquisition price for a 50% interest in the joint venture holding Hornsea 3, the world’s largest offshore wind project, and a commitment to fund 50% of the project’s remaining construction costs.

Hornsea 3 is Ørsted’s third gigawatt-scale project in the North Sea’s Hornsea zone and upon completion it will have a capacity of 2.9 GW – enough power to generate low-cost, renewable electricity for more than 3 million UK households.

Ørsted has embarked on a partnership and divestment program, a cornerstone of its business plan, as it seeks to turn around its offshore wind business that has been hit by regulatory changes, cost inflation, and high interest rates. Ørsted earlier this year turned to its existing shareholders to raise capital to cover immediate financing needs, manage risks from regulatory uncertainty in the U.S., and strengthen its capital structure.

The company’s pipeline and near-term projects span Africa, India, Europe, Australia, and South America, as well as North America — including emerging markets that tend to be forgotten — with project values from $5 million to over $500 million.

The Series B capital will fund:

Scaling of 247Solar’s energy-as-a-service model to de-risk projects for both investors and customers (build-own-operate, with long-term PPAs)

Driving cost reductions and mass production of core technologies

Bringing a new industrial thermal battery to market, to deliver both clean heat and electricity from PV, wind or the grid.

Advanced development of a new, larger 3.5 MW solution (versus the current 400 kW module), to be fully engineered by mid-2026 and ready for deployment in 2027

Expanding the company’s business development and commercial team to enter new markets

247Solar anticipates its industrial heat-plus-power technology to rapidly expand as the PV solar, battery energy storage, and wind energy markets have before.

A decisive moment for industrial energy capacity

“247Solar exists to close the industrial clean energy gap—by delivering reliability, cost-savings, and round-the-clock performance that PV solar alone can’t match,” said CEO Bruce Anderson. “With this Series B, we’re scaling what we believe will become the industry standard for decarbonizing the world’s toughest energy loads.”

[TITLE]Challenges and Prospects in the Global Power Rental Market, 2025-2030: Data Centers and Grid Instability Drive Growth:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Power Rental Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Power Rental Market, valued at USD 22.83 Billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.39% to reach USD 37.02 Billion by 2030. Growth is primarily driven by rapid industrialization, ongoing global infrastructure development, rising energy demand across multiple sectors, and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that necessitate emergency power.

Key Market Drivers

The increasing need for continuous and reliable power supply is a crucial driver of the global power rental market, as industries rely on uninterrupted energy to maintain productivity and prevent financial losses. Data centers, for example, require consistent power beyond what traditional grids can reliably provide. The International Energy Agency's March 2024 Electricity 2024 report indicates that global electricity consumption from data centers is expected to more than double, rising from 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh by 2026.

Simultaneously, grid instability caused by aging infrastructure, extreme weather, and integration challenges with renewable energy sources drives demand for temporary power solutions. According to NERC's June 2024 State of Reliability report, wind resources experienced forced outage rates of 18.9% in 2023, up from 18.1% in 2022, contributing to grid unreliability. Strong industry performance reflects this demand: Aggreko reported annual sales of USD 2.85 billion for the year ending December 28, 2024, a 14% increase over 2023, as noted by International Rental News in April 2025.

Key Market Challenges

A major challenge to the global power rental market lies in the substantial capital expenditure required to procure, maintain, and upgrade fleets of power generation and distribution assets. These investments significantly strain profitability and can restrict the competitive capabilities of smaller firms. The high capital intensity creates barriers to entry and inherently favors large, established players with stronger financial capacity.

According to the European Rental Association, equipment investment across the European rental market was expected to remain flat in 2023 following a 4.2% increase in 2022, illustrating the constraining financial environment. These conditions limit innovation and expansion opportunities, ultimately slowing broader market growth.

Key Market Trends

Growing Adoption of Hybrid and Renewable Energy Solutions is a pivotal trend shaping the global power rental market. Companies increasingly deploy hybrid systems that combine conventional generators with battery storage or solar power, driven by stricter environmental regulations and rising corporate sustainability goals.

Aggreko invested over USD 140 million across 2023 and 2024 to expand its Greener Upgrades fleet, including battery systems designed to reduce emissions and optimize fuel consumption. This shift is reinforced by declining renewable energy costs; according to IRENA's 2025 Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2024 report, total installed costs for most renewable power technologies fell by more than 10% from 2023 to 2024.

[TITLE]Why an ASEAN power grid is key to tapping Southeast Asia’s green potential:
[TEXT]
The International Energy Agency reports that energy demand across Southeast Asia rose at twice the global average rate in 2024 and finds that consumption is set to double by 2050. To maintain rising living standards, economies across the region are pushing into higher-value and more energy-intense industries, data centres being one obvious example.

That creates a problem.

The ASEAN nations enjoy vast but as yet largely untapped potential for renewable energy, especially PV solar, and onshore and offshore wind. The IEA puts potential supply at 20 terawatts, roughly 55 times the region’s present generation capacity. And this energy would be cheap. But the increase in overall demand is for now far outpacing new supply from renewables. Until that changes, ASEAN nations remain dependent on rising fossil fuel imports that expose them to price risk, potential supply disruptions, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

Asian corporate executives have focused recently on coping with tariffs and trade restrictions, potential supply chain disruptions and geopolitical insecurity—rather than energy and power. In the latest EY-Parthenon Global CEO Outlook survey, Asia-Pacific CEOs expressed greater unease than their peers in Europe and the Americas
