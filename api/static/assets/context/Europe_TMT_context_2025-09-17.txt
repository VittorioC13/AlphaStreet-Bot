[TITLE]Nothing Rewards Loyal Users with £300 Phone 3 Discount and Future Perks:
[TEXT]
Nothing slashes £300 off its Phone 3 for existing customers. The London tech brand's unprecedented loyalty discount targets Phone 1 and Phone 2 owners exclusively, offering the new flagship at just £499 instead of £799. This limited-time campaign coincides with the Phone 1's transition out of major software updates, strategically keeping early adopters within Nothing's ecosystem rather than letting them drift to competitors.

Major Discount for Early Adopters: Phone 3 Offer Details

Eligible owners across the UK, US, and India can secure dramatic savings on Nothing's latest device. The 12GB RAM/256GB storage variant drops to £499. The premium 16GB RAM/512GB model costs £599. Both represent £300 reductions from standard retail pricing. Nothing extends the same value as store credit to customers who already purchased the Phone 3 before this campaign launched, ensuring no early supporter feels penalized for their timing.

Major Discount for Early Adopters: Phone 3 Offer Details (continued)

Regional sales events amplify the discount's impact. India's Flipkart Big Billion Days provides additional exposure to loyal fans. Both black and white hardware variants qualify for the promotion, though stock levels and discount availability vary by region and face potential time constraints. The offer reflects Nothing's commitment to rewarding loyalty over acquisition, a relatively uncommon approach in today's smartphone market.

How to Claim Your Discount: Eligibility and Verification Steps

Verification happens through IMEI number entry. Phone 1 or Phone 2 users access the official Nothing upgrade portal or, in India, navigate through Flipkart's platform. The system generates a discount code after confirming device ownership. This streamlined process keeps loyal users within Nothing's ecosystem while simplifying their upgrade journey, removing typical barriers that might drive customers toward competing brands.

How to Claim Your Discount: Eligibility and Verification Steps (continued)

Customer service handles existing Phone 3 owners differently. These early adopters can contact Nothing Support to claim equivalent store credit for future purchases. The retroactive approach ensures fairness across all timing scenarios. No loyal customer gets left behind. This comprehensive coverage demonstrates Nothing's attention to community feedback and commitment to treating all supporters equitably, regardless of when they made their purchasing decisions.

Phone 1 reaches its software update endpoint with this transition. Android 16 and Nothing OS 4.0 will not arrive on the original device, which has completed its three major OS update cycle. Security patches continue through 2026, maintaining device safety without new features. This timeline aligns with standard Android industry practices, though major manufacturers like Google and Samsung now extend support windows significantly longer, creating competitive pressure for smaller brands.

A Strategic Loyalty Move in a Competitive Android Market

Most Android manufacturers prioritize switchers over existing customers. Trade-in bonuses and new-customer incentives dominate industry retention strategies. Nothing bucks this trend entirely. The brand treats its core fanbase as valued contributors rather than mere consumers, acknowledging their role in building the company's foundation during its early, uncertain phases.

A Strategic Loyalty Move in a Competitive Android Market (continued)

Apple leverages ecosystem lock-in and trade-in programs for retention. Samsung balances loyalty perks with aggressive customer acquisition campaigns. Nothing's pronounced focus on existing customers stands out dramatically in today's Android marketplace. The approach suggests long-term relationship building over short-term sales volume, potentially establishing trust as the brand continues maturing in an increasingly crowded smartphone landscape.

What This Means for the Nothing Brand and Its Community

Community-driven transparency becomes Nothing's defining characteristic through this initiative. Honoring early adopters while maintaining security update promises differentiates the brand from larger OEMs focused primarily on market share expansion. The loyalty program could establish a new template for how emerging smartphone brands compete against established giants. Current users gain tangible value for their brand commitment, while Nothing builds sustainable competitive advantages through customer satisfaction rather than purely promotional tactics.

Nothing's timing proves strategically sound as the Phone 1 exits active development and Phone 3 assumes flagship status. The loyalty campaign demonstrates both appreciation and business acumen, potentially inspiring larger manufacturers to reconsider their upgrade and retention approaches. Android enthusiasts receive genuine value for supporting an upstart brand, while Nothing establishes what authentic loyalty rewards should deliver in practice.

[TITLE]China accuses Nvidia of breaching competition rules as trade talks with US heat up in Madrid:
[TEXT]

Chinese regulators ruled on Monday that Nvidia breached competition rules, raising the stakes as the United States and China entered a second day of trade negotiations in Madrid. The move came amid a raft of gloomy economic statistics from Beijing, suggesting that the slowdown in the world’s second biggest economy is worsening.

China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said on Monday that Nvidia failed to fulfil undertakings made when it acquired Mellanox Technologies, a networking equipment manufacturer, five years ago. These included a commitment to continue supplying its chips to Chinese companies. Washington has blocked the sale of the most advanced semiconductors to China since 2022.

Beijing initiated the investigation last December, after the Biden administration tightened export controls on semiconductors. Monday’s ruling comes as Chinese negotiators in Madrid are pressing their American counterparts for an easing of restrictions on the sale of chips and other high-tech products.

The latest round of talks come in advance of an expected meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping next month. Mr Xi has invited Mr Trump to visit Beijing but the two men could meet instead on the margins of an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea at the end of October.

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said in Madrid on Monday that the two sides were close to a deal on TikTok, which Washington has threatened to shut down on Wednesday if its Chinese owner, ByteDance, does not sell it. US legislators allege that Chinese ownership of the algorithm that runs the short video app is a threat to national security.

“Our Chinese counterparts have come with a very aggressive ask,” Mr Bessent told reporters. “We will see if we can get there at present. We are not willing to sacrifice national security for a social media app.”

Tariffs, Chinese export controls of rare earth minerals and US demands that Beijing should do more to stop the flow of chemicals that make the drug fentanyl are among the other issues under discussion in Madrid.

China’s commerce ministry on Monday condemned Washington’s call for the European Union and other western allies to impose tariffs on China on account of its purchases of Russian oil.

“This is a typical act of unilateral bullying and economic coercion, a serious violation of the consensus reached by the Chinese and US heads of state in their phone call, and could severely impact global trade as well as the stability of industrial and supply chains,” a spokesperson said.

China’s economic troubles deepened in August with retail sales growth slowing down and the worst performance in industrial output for 12 months. Investment slowed sharply, export growth weakened, the slump in the housing market worsened and the jobless number increased.

Production at Chinese factories and mines grew by 5.2 per cent last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. This was the smallest increase since August 2024 and was below most market analysts’ expectations.

Retail sales also disappointed expectations, growing by 3.4 per cent year on year, down from 3.7 per cent in July. Fixed asset investment grew by just 0.5 per cent in the first eight months of 2025, compared with a 1.6 per cent increase in the first seven months of the year.

The four-year contraction in the property market shows no sign of ending and new home prices fell by 0.3 per cent in August compared to July, a 2.5 per cent drop since August last year. Resale home values fell by 0.58 per cent compared to the previous month, with the price of existing properties in Beijing falling by 1.2 per cent.

[TITLE]UK and US to sign massive tech trade deals worth billions during Trump and Big Tech tour:
[TEXT]
President Trump is visiting the UK to secure tech trade deals

Big Tech leaders including OpenAI’s Sam Altman are also visiting

AI, quantum computing, semiconductors and more will likely be covered

A new US-UK tech pact is to be signed during President Trump’s visit to London this week, focusing on emerging technologies like AI and quantum computing as well as semiconductors, telecommunications and space.

The change is set to come not only as the US President visits the UK, but also key influencers in Big Tech, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman.

Although the scale of the deal is yet to be confirmed, it’s believed it will be positioned as an effort to outpace China in the geopolitically influenced ongoing tech and trade wars.

US and UK to strike up tech deal

The UK Parliament described the deal’s goal as ending sectoral uncertainty, securing supply chains and driving US investment into the UK.

At the moment, the US is the UK’s largest single trading partner, accounting for 18% of UK trade (estimated at £315 billion in 2024). The UK exports an estimated £196 billion to the US, accounting for around 2% of total national income, with mutual trade investments totalling £1.2 trillion.

Today’s Economic Prosperity Deal is a non-binding agreement whereby the UK secured tariff reductions, however some trade deals are still worse than pre-Trump era deals and even some EU deals.

For example, although automotive tariffs had been cut from 25% to 10%, there is a 100,000-vehicle quota in place.

[TITLE]US, China reach 'framework' deal on TikTok ownership:
[TEXT]
This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said US-China ties remain 'still very good at the highest levels' even if no TikTok deal is reached.

The United States and China announced a "framework" deal on Monday to resolve their dispute over TikTok that calls for the Chinese-owned app to pass to US-controlled ownership.

In a social media post, US President Donald Trump said—without directly naming the social media giant—that a deal was reached with a "certain company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy!"

Trump added on his Truth Social network that he would speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.

A senior Chinese official said the two sides "reached a basic framework consensus on resolving issues related to TikTok through cooperation, reducing investment barriers and promoting relevant economic and trade cooperation."

"China will firmly safeguard the national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises," Xinhua quoted Vice Minister of Commerce Li Chenggang as saying.

The deal came after a second day of talks between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Madrid, which also includes discussions about the wider US-China trade dispute.

Bessent confirmed the framework deal, but declined to give further details, saying Trump and Xi will speak on Friday to "complete" the agreement.

TikTok—which boasts almost two billion global users—is owned by China-based internet company ByteDance.

A federal law requiring TikTok's sale or ban on national security grounds was due to take effect the day before US President Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20.

But the Republican, whose 2024 election campaign relied heavily on social media and who has said he is fond of TikTok, put the ban on pause.

In mid-June Trump extended a deadline for the popular video-sharing app by another 90 days to find a non-Chinese buyer or be banned in the United States. That extension is due to expire on Wednesday.

'Questions unanswered'

While Trump had long supported a ban or divestment, he reversed his position and vowed to defend the platform after coming to believe it helped him win young voters' support in the November election.

Sarah Kreps of Cornell University's Tech Policy Institute warned "national security questions remain unanswered," noting the deal leaves data and algorithm safeguards unclear.

The talks in Madrid also cover Trump's threat of steep tariffs on Chinese imports.

In his Truth Social post on Monday, Trump said the meeting in Europe "has gone VERY WELL!" and added, "The relationship remains a very strong one!!!"

Trade tensions escalated sharply earlier this year, with tit-for-tat tariffs reaching triple digits and snarling supply chains.

Both governments later agreed to lower their punitive tariffs, with the United States imposing 30% duties on imports of Chinese goods and China hitting US products with a 10% levy, but the temporary truce expires in November.

The US-China trade truce has been an uneasy one, with Washington accusing Beijing of violating their agreement and slow-walking export license approvals for rare earths, key materials for the automotive, electronics and defense industries.

Nvidia probe

China on Saturday launched two investigations into the US semiconductor sector.

Beijing opened an anti-dumping probe into some highly specialized chips originating from the United States, its commerce ministry said.

The ministry also said in a separate statement it will launch an investigation into whether the United States had discriminated against the Chinese chip sector.

And on Monday China said an investigation found US chip giant Nvidia had run afoul of the country's antitrust rules, and vowed an additional probe.

The statement did not provide further details about Nvidia's alleged legal violations or the further probe.

Top diplomats and defense chiefs from both nations held back-to-back phone calls last week, which analysts said could mark a step toward a meeting between Trump and Xi.

[TITLE]US and China reach framework deal on TikTok:
[TEXT]
The US and China have reached a framework agreement to switch short-video app TikTok to US-controlled ownership, top US officials said today, with President Donald Trump set to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced the agreement after a meeting between senior US and Chinese officials in Madrid, but declined to give any of the commercial terms of the agreement.

Bessent told reporters that further details would wait to be determined in a call on Friday between Trump and Xi.

Trump said today that trade talks with China had gone very well and hinted that a deal had been reached to resolve issues the U.S. has over TikTok ownership.

"The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly," Trump wrote on his TruthSocial platform.

"A deal was also reached on a "certain" company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!"

Earlier, a US official with knowledge of the negotiations had said that the US would press ahead with a ban on TikTok if China did not drop its demands for reduced tariffs and technological restrictions as part of a divestiture deal.

US and China delegations met to discuss the divestment from TikTok by Chinese owner Bytedance as part of a round of broader talks on tariffs and economic policy taking place in Madrid. TikTok faces being shut down as early as September 17 in the US unless it moves to US ownership.

Speaking to reporters earlier, Bessent and Greer said China wanted concessions on trade and technology in exchange for agreeing to divest from the popular social media app.

"Our Chinese counterparts have come with a very aggressive ask," Bessent said, adding: "We are not willing to sacrifice national security for a social media app."

The US-China negotiations at the Spanish foreign ministry's baroque Palacio de Santa Cruz, which began on Sunday, were the fourth round of talks in four months to address strained trade ties and a looming divestiture deadline for TikTok.

They took place as Washington demands that its allies place tariffs on imports from China over Chinese purchases of Russian oil, which Beijing said was an attempt at coercion.

Beijing separately announced today that a preliminary investigation of Nvidia had found the US chip giant had violated its anti-monopoly law. Bessent said the announcement on Nvidia was poor timing.

The probe is widely seen as a retaliatory shot against Washington's curbs on the Chinese chip sector.

[TITLE]What could a secure 6G network look like?:
[TEXT]
The official standards for 6G are set to be announced by the end of 2029. While the industry is moving towards consensus around how the 6G network will be built, it also needs to anticipate how it will be compromised and make sure to build it with a secure-by-design approach.

Telecom industry leaders need to anticipate novel vulnerabilities and attacks specific for 6G. Unlike the previous generation of wireless, 6G will expand to even more connected technologies, thus creating an expanded attack surface. There will also be greater integration of AI, which will expose the network to a host of new attacks.

Although these are new vectors, a majority of 6G threats won’t be totally new: The industry is already protecting IoT devices at scale and we’re getting better at combatting AI threats as we learn more

The $1.6 billion investment is from companies including PayPal, Bank of America and Citigroup and will create 1,800 jobs in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the U.K. Department for Business and Trade said Saturday (Sept. 13).

“Strengthening ties with the U.S. boosts our economy, creates jobs, and secures our role in global finance, delivering on our Plan for Change,” said Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle. “These investments reflect the strength of our enduring ‘golden corridor’ with one of our closest trading partners, ahead of the U.S. presidential state visit.”

That visit is set to happen Tuesday (Sept. 16), with President Donald Trump due to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to sign a multibillion-dollar technology agreement.

As Reuters reported, that agreement will center on technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, telecommunications and quantum computing.

“Cutting-edge technology such as AI and quantum computing will transform our lives,” U.K. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said in a statement.

The Reuters report noted that Trump is expected to be joined during his three-day visit by U.S. tech executives such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI head Sam Altman.

Both countries have this year put forth AI action plans, Reuters added, with companies like OpenAI and Anthropic opening international offices in London, and U.K.-based firms like DeepMind investing in trans-Atlantic partnerships.

[TITLE]Stability through balance: rethinking power in a connected world:
[TEXT]
Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, 'Conversations pour demain' on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Institut Montaigne in Paris, France

It is a great honour to be invited to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Institut Montaigne with you. For a quarter of a century, this institution has stood out for its independence of thought. That independence has given its work both credibility and influence.

As a central banker, independence has a special meaning for me. In this uncertain world, institutional independence is a key source of stability and trust.[1]

But the question of independence extends far beyond monetary policy. As Michel de Montaigne once wrote, “La plus grande chose du monde, c’est de savoir être à soi”. [The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to oneself.]

Today, Europe and its Member States are asking what it takes to “belong to oneself” in a world where the foundations of the international order are shifting.

Since the 17th century, independence has always been guaranteed by balance. Countries built systems of strategic balance to prevent the strong from dominating the weak.

From the Westphalian age until the first half of the 20th century, this balance rested on hard power: the ability to balance others through military force.

After 1945, it shifted towards soft power among Western states: balance was achieved through rules and norms to which all agreed.

Today, it rests on system power: the ability to manage the dependencies created by the infrastructures and technologies that bind us together.

Safeguarding independence in a world of system power is the defining challenge of our time.

And to succeed, Europe must transform – to restore strategic balance in this new era. Only then can we prevent interdependence from descending into cycles of coercion that would ultimately weaken us all.

The path to system power

In modern European history, three distinct paradigms of power stand out.

The first is hard power. For centuries, the independence of European states rested on military strength – the ability to defend oneself by force in a world of feudal and imperial hierarchies.

The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 marked a turning point in international relations. Under the Westphalian order, each state had the exclusive right to govern its territory without external interference.

This laid the groundwork for international law, or at least norms of coexistence. Yet in practice, balance of power still meant military competition, an equilibrium maintained as much by arms races as by agreements or marriages of convenience.

As a result, this system had its limits. When the equilibrium held, it provided peace. When it broke, escalation was swift and uncontrollable. Twice in the space of a few decades, Europe descended into catastrophe.

To avoid a return to the unstable balance-of-power dynamics, a second paradigm emerged after 1945 and gained momentum after the fall of the Berlin Wall: soft power.

Power was no longer exercised only through armies, but through the ability to create and enforce rules, norms and values. Multilateral frameworks and institutions were created that aligned national interests with collective stability.[2]

As long as countries complied with these rules and accepted enforcement, there was no need for an explicit balancing of military or economic capabilities. Independence was safeguarded by global institutions – and enhanced by the ability to shape those institutions in one’s favour.

This period coincided with a sevenfold rise in global GDP per capita. Over a billion people were lifted out of poverty. And the world experienced the longest stretch in modern history without direct war among major powers.

In this rules-based world, Europe thrived. It became a so-called “regulatory power”, able to project its influence not through armies but through markets.

As the leading trading partner for 72 countries, Europe exported not only goods but also standards, shaping corporate practices and laws worldwide – a phenomenon known as the “Brussels effect”.

But open markets and shared standards led to a third paradigm of power emerging: system power. Some countries embedded themselves in global trade and financial networks in ways that gave them leverage over others.

At the time, this shift went largely unnoticed. Many assumed globalisation and democratisation were permanent, and that trade partners would not become adversaries. And because economic interdependence had reached unprecedented levels, it was assumed that no country could coerce another without hurting itself.

[TITLE]US drone dilemma: Why the most advanced military in the world is playing catchup on the modern battlefield:
[TEXT]
War in Ukraine Corporate news Tech news See all topics Follow

The future of warfare felt a lot like playing a video game. Soldiers fastened on virtual-reality glasses and then moved their fingers across the joystick in their palms. A small drone buzzed and lifted in response.

At a military base in Texas last month, American soldiers trained on how to operate small quadcopters, the kind that now dominate the battlefield in Ukraine and are increasingly the weapon of choice for combatants around the world.

With an explosive attached, a drone costing less than $1,000 can destroy a tank worth millions.

For troops at Fort Bliss in El Paso — members of the Multi-functional Reconnaissance Company, 6-1 Cavalry Regiment — the technology and tactics were still new. And for the US military, that’s a problem.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has spurred a flurry of evolution in drone warfare — so much so that the US, with one of the most advanced militaries and defense industrial complexes in the world, found itself behind. Most American soldiers lack the know-how for fighting with unmanned systems, and while the US has excelled at building large, expensive weaponry — fighter jets, tanks, precision-guided missiles — it is in many ways unprepared to quickly produce large quantities of small, cheap systems, like drones.

Defense officials are now rushing to catch up.

In July, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth circulated a memo to senior leaders aimed at accelerating the US military’s adoption of drones. In recent months, US troops began building and 3-D printing drones and training on simulators reminiscent of video games to learn how to guide small systems through windows, around corners or into an enemy tank’s hatch.

“This is not tomorrow’s problem. This is today’s problem,” Maj. Gen. Curt Taylor, commander of the US Army’s 1st Armored Division, told CNN at an Army conference in Germany in July. “And the first fight of the next war is going to involve more drones than any of us have ever seen.”

Learning from Ukraine

While military units are working to get up to speed, the US still faces manufacturing hurdles to match the capabilities and production of countries like China, analysts and industry leaders said. A key challenge is that US weapons can’t contain Chinese parts for security reasons, but domestic alternatives are significantly more expensive.

Ukraine has offered to help on drone production, as officials in Kyiv have sought to cement deeper ties with Washington to ensure Ukraine’s future security. Though Washington has sent billions in weapons to Ukraine, Kyiv now sees its opportunity to send something back to the US.

During a visit to the White House last month, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky pitched President Donald Trump on a $50 billion deal to supply and co-produce drones with the US. Zelensky told journalists that the program, which hasn’t been finalized, would deliver 10 million unmanned systems annually over five years.

“In the past six months especially, there’s been some kind of radical change in the perception of how drones work and the development of the industry,” Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice prime minister who led the country’s wartime effort to buy and mass produce drones, told CNN.

Fedorov said he’s noticed a spike in demand for Ukraine’s drone data — tens of thousands of drone-camera videos depicting successful strikes on equipment, personnel and buildings that countries and defense companies could use to train artificial intelligence systems.

Fedorov said Kyiv could potentially leverage its drone innovation in exchange for more financial or materiel support in the future.

“This a geopolitical card that our president will consider how to use,” Fedorov said. “It would be a big help to our allies, and this is exactly the right relationship to have with them. We provide high-quality drones, high-quality data and our expertise, and then we get back more security assistance.”

A drone for every soldier

At a conference center in Wiesbaden, Germany, in July, Ukrainian military leaders presented a blunt assessment of NATO’s need to invest in drones to a packed room of NATO military officials and defense industry wonks.

Maj. Robert “Madyar” Brovdi, commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces of Ukraine, waged a bet that there is not “a single tank of the road” that could survive first-person view drones, known as FPV drones.

“You should also understand that our experience is super valuable for all of you here, as none of the countries have this kind of experience nowadays,” Brovdi said through his translator.

Maj. Gen. Volodymyr Horbatiuk, deputy chief of Ukraine’s General Staff, told the crowd that while artillery and anti-tank missiles are vital, roughly 80% of Kyiv’s success in hitting targets come from drones.

“It is not the future, it is the routine reality of how we wage our war,” Horbatiuk later added.

American officials have reached the same conclusion. Hegseth’s July memo was repeatedly pointed to by military leaders who spoke to CNN as significant for getting drones into troops’ hands faster. The memo emphasizes that commanders should embrace risk, not shy away from it — an approach that is, ironically, nearly antithetical to how the military does business.

“Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,” Hegseth wrote. “Drone technology is advancing so rapidly, our major risk is risk-avoidance.”

“Next year I expect to see this capability integrated into all relevant combat training, including force-on-force drone wars,” he added.

That memo alone gave many commanders the top-cover they felt they needed to move faster. But the Army had already been moving in that direction as part of a broader modernization initiative bringing in new weapons and technologies. The multi-functional reconnaissance company at Fort Bliss was a product of that effort launched last year.

Col. Nick Ryan, whose office oversees the integration of unmanned aircraft into the Army, told CNN there are “already has plans in place” to ensure every unit in the Army “receives unmanned aircraft systems” in fiscal year 2026.

The ultimate goal is for soldiers to treat drones “as if it was their personal weapon, their radio, their night-vision goggles or a grenade,” Ryan said. “That it’s just something they’re so used to and so familiar with, that it’s just part of their standard kit that they take with them everywhere they go.”

Welcome to Drones 101

The initial two-week training at Bliss starts in a classroom, where soldiers learn how to build their own drones, crucial for the knowledge of how to fix something in the field if something goes wrong. Then, they start practicing how to fly with a computer simulator that gets them used to what is essentially a video game controller.

When that’s mastered, soldiers take their drones to an “FPV gym” of sorts, where they can practice flying through hanging tires or doorways and even into a cardboard replica — with exact measurements, found online — of an adversary’s armored vehicle.

The training isn’t just happening in Texas. In Europe, every US Army unit rotating through the region will leave “with company-level training” on drones, including using them to drop live munitions, Brig. Gen. Terry Tillis, commander of the 7th Army Training Command in Germany, told reporters in Wiesbaden in July.

A new course at Fort Benning, Georgia, expected to start in October will provide “foundational training” for all new soldiers going through One Station Unit Training — which combines soldiers’ basic training and advanced training for their specific jobs — to ensure they’re familiar with drones, according to the Army.

And at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, home to the Army’s storied 82nd Airborne Division, a new company stood up in 2023 is spearheading innovation for a multitude of efforts, including drones. That company — Gainey Company — also works to train others in the division on drones, company commander Capt. CJ Drew told CNN. Those training courses are constantly adjusted using feedback from other US soldiers, as well as what the military is observing in Ukraine with drone warfare.

The 82nd Airborne’s unique mission as the nation’s crisis response force — a brigade of soldiers prepared to deploy around the globe with just hours’ notice — signals that drone innovation and new technology provides a critical edge to soldiers in harm’s way.

A small drone could “take the place of a forward observer” — a soldier who identifies targets for artillery fire or air support — Brig. Gen. Andy Kiser, deputy commanding general of operations for the 82nd Airborne, told CNN. They can also “enhance” the work of cavalry scouts, who are largely responsible for reconnaissance and other missions to gather information

Everything gets easier once you find “your person” — at least that’s what they say on the message boards. Subreddits like the euphemistically named r/RepladiesDesigner keep having their posts deleted, and people don’t share information openly: they might do so by DM, but likely they won’t share anything at all. Every so often, a picture of a beautiful bag will pop up with a celebratory message: “Just obsessed!” or “How did I do??” With supple-looking leather and painstakingly crafted labels, these are not the fake handbags you’d find set out on a white blanket by a surly young man in a tourist-trap street during your Italian vacation. Think $800 investments rather than $18 impulse buys. The hardware is the right weight, the monogram crisp enough to read from across the street. Sometimes they even come with convincing-looking “receipts”.

Bags like this are hard-won, well-designed, top-dollar “superfakes”, procured through clandestine Whatsapp conversations with sellers based in China who have connections to factories specializing in “replica fashion”. And in a world where a Bottega Veneta can set you back $45,500 and the Hermes resale market is thriving to the chagrin of the company’s CEO, they’re becoming more and more appealing.

This is the new era of counterfeiting, one in which the word “fake” feels almost unfair. It’s a species of replica engineered with the same obsessive precision as the originals, sometimes in the very same factories. Once, the knockoff economy ran on nylon monograms and dodgy glue; now it runs on Italian-sourced leather, hardware milled to spec, and stitch counts measured in microns. Even seasoned authenticators admit that some bags require serious dissection to expose their fraudulence.

The stakes are not small. For the luxury industry, these bags represent both a multi-billion-dollar revenue leak and a threat to the very idea of exclusivity. For buyers, they offer an intoxicating loophole: status without the price tag, craftsmanship without the guilt of really buying a fake — or at least with the guilt obscured under a haze of plausible deniability. The moral terrain is slippery. Who’s working in those factories? Where did the leather come from? What seems to make buyers feel better is the fact that they’ve already lost faith in the big designers, anyway.

“I just don't want to support a company marking everything up 10+ times, and telling us it's because it's handcrafted in Italy only to have an article come out a few months later showing it's actually mass produced in a factory in China,” one Redditor wrote. “Reps [sellers of superfakes] aren't more moral. They're doing the same thing. But they at least have the decency not to lie
