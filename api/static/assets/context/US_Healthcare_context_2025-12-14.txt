[TITLE]Mike Johnson Reveals GOP Health Care Plan as ACA Subsidies Set to Expire:
[TEXT]
After the Senate failed this week to advance competing health care plans, attention has shifted to the House, where Republicans are making a last-minute push as the clock runs out to prevent higher insurance costs for millions of Americans.

Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled a sweeping Republican proposal late Friday, moving ahead without extending enhanced tax subsidies that help people afford insurance through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Those subsidies, expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, are set to expire at the end of the year.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump has said he believes Republicans can deliver a better alternative to Obamacare, a promise he has made repeatedly over the years. But he has offered few specifics beyond proposing direct payments to help Americans buy insurance.

...

What To Know

Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, spent much of Friday behind closed doors with GOP lawmakers, as he had earlier in the week, working to assemble the package as the House enters the final days of its 2025 legislative session. The Speaker said in a statement announcing the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act that the House plans to vote on the package next week.

Democrats staged the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history this fall in a failed attempt to force Republicans to negotiate over health care. Despite promises of votes, the Senate this week failed to advance both a Republican-backed health plan and a Democratic bill that would have extended the enhanced ACA tax credits for three years.

With just days remaining before lawmakers leave Washington, Congress appears poised to adjourn without a consensus solution.

House Republicans released a package of more than 100 pages that centers on long-standing GOP priorities aimed at reshaping the health insurance market. The plan seeks to expand access to employer-sponsored coverage and increase oversight of pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, while leaving the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire.

A central element of the proposal would expand access to so-called association health plans, allowing small businesses and self-employed individuals to band together to purchase insurance. Supporters argue that pooling coverage gives employers greater bargaining power to negotiate lower premiums.

Critics, however, warn that association plans often provide fewer benefits and weaker consumer protections than plans sold through the ACA marketplaces.

The proposal also would require PBMs to provide more detailed data, a move Republicans say could help rein in prescription drug costs. PBMs act as intermediaries between drugmakers, insurers and pharmacies, and critics across party lines have accused them of inflating prices and squeezing independent pharmacists.

The GOP package also references cost-sharing reductions for some lower-income ACA enrollees, but those changes would not take effect until January 2027.

Notably absent from the plan is any extension of the enhanced ACA tax credits that millions of Americans rely on to lower their monthly premiums. Those subsidies, enacted during the pandemic, expire Dec. 31. Without congressional action, many families could see their out-of-pocket premiums more than double, and in some cases increase by far more.

Trump has consistently promoted the idea of sending money directly to individuals rather than extending ACA tax credits. It remains unclear how large such payments would be. A Senate Republican plan that failed this week would have created new health savings accounts funded with $1,000 annually for most adults, or $1,500 for people ages 50 to 64.

No such health savings accounts appear in the House plan.

Johnson’s approach has put politically vulnerable House Republicans in swing districts under mounting pressure as the subsidy deadline nears.

Frustrated with delays, a group of centrist Republicans has joined Democrats to push alternative proposals to temporarily extend the ACA tax credits to avoid immediate premium hikes.

Those lawmakers are backing several bills and have begun signing discharge petitions, a rarely successful procedural tactic that can force a vote on legislation if a majority of House members sign on.

This year, however, discharge petitions have gained unusual traction. Lawmakers recently used one to force a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein-related files held by the Justice Department.

One petition, sponsored by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., had attracted 24 signatures as of Friday, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. It would compel a vote on a bill extending the subsidies for two years while adding anti-fraud provisions and PBM restrictions.

Another petition, introduced by Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., has drawn 39 bipartisan signatures and would force a vote on a one-year subsidy extension with new income caps.

Both efforts could succeed if House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries urges his caucus to sign on. So far, he has declined to commit.

Jeffries is also backing a separate Democratic petition with 214 signatures that would extend the subsidies for three years without changes. No Republicans have joined that effort, and Senate Republicans have made clear such a proposal has no chance of passing their chamber.

What People Are Saying

Johnson said in a statement, in part, “Nearly 15 years ago, the Democrats’ Unaffordable Care Act broke the American health care system. Since its inception, premium costs have skyrocketed, networks have shrunk, and the system has become bloated, inefficient, and riddled with waste, fraud, and abuse. While Democrats demand that taxpayers write bigger checks to insurance companies to hide the cost of their failed law, House Republicans are tackling the real drivers of health care costs to provide affordable care, increase access and choice, and restore integrity to our nation’s health care system for all Americans."

Trump said late Friday at a White House event, “I want to see the billions of dollars go to people, not to the insurance companies. And I want to see the people go out and buy themselves great healthcare.”

Jeffries said Friday, “We’re actively reviewing those two discharge petitions and we’ll have more to say

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate failed to get anywhere on the health care issue this week. Now it’s the House’s turn to show what it can do.

Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled a Republican alternative late Friday, a last-minute sprint as his party refuses to extend the enhanced tax subsidies for those who buy policies through the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, which are expiring at the end of the year. Those subsidies help lower the cost of coverage.

Johnson, R-La., huddled behind closed doors in the morning — as he did days earlier this week — working to assemble the package for consideration as the House focuses the final days of its 2025 work on health care.

“House Republicans are tackling the real drivers of health care costs to provide affordable care,” Johnson said in a statement announcing the package. He said it would be voted on next week.

Later Friday, though, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said: “House Republicans have introduced toxic legislation that is completely unserious, hurts hardworking America taxpayers and is not designed to secure bipartisan support. If the bill reaches the House floor, I will strongly oppose it.”

Time is running out for Congress to act. Democrats engineered the longest federal government shutdown ever this fall in a failed effort to force Republicans to the negotiating table on health care. But after promising votes, the Senate failed this week to advance both a Republican health care plan and the Democratic-offered bill to extend the tax credits for three years.

[TITLE]Milestone Receives FDA Approval of CARDAMYST™ (etripamil) as First and Only Self-Administered Nasal Spray for Adults with Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT):
[TEXT]
First FDA approved treatment in 30+ years for more than 2 million Americans with PSVT

Novel nasal spray designed to rapidly resolve episodes of PSVT and restore sinus rhythm

FDA approval in PSVT enables development of AFib-RVR under sNDA pathway

Milestone well-capitalized to launch and commercialize CARDAMYST with existing capital and royalty financing

Conference call and webcast December 15, 8:00 a.m. ET

MONTREAL and CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Milestone® Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: MIST) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first commercial product, CARDAMYST™ (etripamil) nasal spray, a prescription medication for the conversion of acute symptomatic episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) to sinus rhythm in adults. This approval marks the first time that more than two million Americans with PSVT will have a rapid-acting treatment option they can self-administer outside the emergency department or other healthcare setting. CARDAMYST is expected to be available in retail pharmacies in the first quarter of 2026.

CARDAMYST nasal spray is a novel and rapid-acting calcium channel blocker delivered when needed to treat often highly symptomatic and unpredictable episodes of PSVT. With CARDAMYST, adults with PSVT can be prepared wherever and whenever episodes occur, providing them with active management and a greater sense of control of their condition.

“CARDAMYST is a novel at-the-ready treatment option that addresses the unpredictable impact of PSVT by offering patients the freedom to manage episodes anytime and anywhere,” said Joseph Oliveto, President and Chief Executive Officer of Milestone Pharmaceuticals. “The FDA approval of CARDAMYST is a watershed moment for Milestone and a gratifying event for our team members, patients, clinical investigators, and health care providers who participated in the development program, all of whom I sincerely thank for their dedication, counsel, and collaboration toward this important achievement.”

“Some people with PSVT have endured years of anxiety, fearing their next episode and the stress and disruption of emergency department visits,” said James Ip, M.D., FACC, FHRS, an etripamil investigator. “CARDAMYST will give many of them the ability to administer a medication themselves that can quickly stop their PSVT episode and potentially avoid a hospital trip or a call to emergency services.”

CARDAMYST Clinical Data

The FDA approval of CARDAMYST is supported by a robust clinical trial program based on safety data from more than 1,800 participants and more than 2,000 episodes of PSVT. This includes the successful Phase 3 RAPID trial, a global, randomized, double-blind comparison of CARDAMYST vs. placebo, published in The Lancet in 2023. In clinical studies, participants using CARDAMYST were two times more likely to convert symptomatic PSVT to sinus rhythm and did so more than three times faster compared with placebo. The RAPID trial achieved its primary endpoint with 64% of those who self-administered CARDAMYST (N=99) converting from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) to sinus rhythm within 30 minutes compared to 31% on placebo (N=85) (HR = 2.62; p<0.001). At one hour, the benefit was demonstrated in 73% of participants. In addition, significant reductions in time to conversion in those who took CARDAMYST were evident early and durable, with a median time to conversion of 17 minutes (95% CI: 13.4, 26.5) for those treated with CARDAMYST vs. 54 minutes (95% CI: 38.7, 87.3) for those treated with placebo.

A consistent safety profile and treatment effects were observed across all subgroups, including participants concurrently on beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. The most frequent adverse events occurring in ≥5% of participants in randomized clinical trials were mild-to-moderate and transient in nature, including local-site nasal discomfort, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, throat irritation, and epistaxis. Less than 2% of trial participants discontinued therapy due to adverse events.

[TITLE]'People Are Going to Die' If Republicans Let ACA Subsidies End, Warns AOC:
[TEXT]
The US House of Representatives is set to vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies next week, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez warned Friday that if Republicans let the ACA tax credits expire at the end of the year, "people are going to die."

The New York Democrat spoke to reporters in Washington, DC a day after only four Republicans voted with Democratic senators in an unsuccessful effort to pass legislation extending ACA subsidies, as over 20 million Americans face a surge in health insurance premiums. A GOP bill to replace the subsidies with annual payments to tax-advantaged health savings accounts also failed.

"We have to remember who's in charge of the House, the Senate, and the White House. Republicans have a House majority, they have a Senate majority, and Donald Trump is president of the United States, and JD Vance is vice president of the United States," Ocasio-Cortez said in remarks shared by her and multiple news sources on social media.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) "refused to engage" in a debate on the looming healthcare crisis and "kept Republicans home for over a month so that they would not negotiate," she said. Trump and Vance "did the same thing—they stuck their heads in the sand for the entirety of a... government shutdown where we were urging them to come to a solution on extensions of ACA premium subsidies," she continued, calling for a "clean" extension while the GOP sorts out its supposed healthcare plan.

Rep. @AOC on healthcare subsidy proposals: "An extension with abortion restrictions kills women." pic.twitter.com/HOCqHMGemp

— Forbes Breaking News (@ForbesTVNews) December 12, 2025

"People are gonna be kicked off of their insurance. Open enrollment is happening right now, and there are going to be millions of Americans that are affected—that aren't gonna be able to go to a doctor, aren't gonna be able to afford their prescription drugs, because of some petty fight in Washington," the congresswoman said, noting Democratic efforts to force votes on an extension.

As NBC News reported Thursday, early enrollment data from several states shows that "more people appear to be walking away from Affordable Care Act coverage or switching to cheaper plans for 2026 compared to this time last year," which "could reflect signs of financial strain for people who can't afford to pay hundreds of dollars more in monthly premiums once enhanced federal subsidies expire at the end of the year."

Demanding that her colleagues in DC recognize the urgency of the issue, Ocasio-Cortez—who supports Medicare for All—said Friday that "I don't understand why they can't just extend these subsidies so that we can save people's lives while they figure out whatever their political food fight is."

AOC also pushed back against GOP efforts to restrict reproductive healthcare in an ACA subsidy bill, saying "an extension with abortion restrictions kills women—so no, I'm going to allow this Republican majority to kill women in this country so that they can try to do whatever their victory lap is. I will not accept women, and the lives of women, as some political cost for them being able to extend these things. Reproductive care is healthcare. Period."

Since the right-wing US Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade and GOP-led states further restricted reproductive rights, multiple stories have emerged from places including Georgia and Texas exemplifying how "Republican abortion bans kill women."

After Johnson met with the House GOP's "Five Families" on Friday, he is expected to allow a floor vote to extend the subsidies next week and, according to Punchbowl News, is considering giving moderates an option without abortion funding restrictions.

As Politico reported Friday evening:

[GOP] leaders ultimately expect the extension vote to fail, resulting in skyrocketing premiums for millions of Americans when the subsidies expire at the end of the year.

Instead, according to House Republican leadership aides, Republicans are preparing to roll out a healthcare framework that would allow businesses that fund their own health plans to purchase "stop-loss" policies—which would protect businesses from going bankrupt from just a few unexpectedly expensive insurance claims.

It also would appropriate funds to pay for "cost-sharing reductions" in Obamacare and include some elements of a separate legislative proposal designed to crack down on pharmacy benefit managers—companies that negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers and large employers.

Like Ocasio-Cortez—who has faced mounting calls to launch a 2028 primary challenge to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) over his handling of the March funding fight and recent shutdown—the upper chamber's top Democrat put the blame squarely on Republicans after both bills failed to advance on Thursday.

"Republicans must answer for why people will lose coverage. Republicans must answer why families see premiums double and triple over the next year," Schumer said. "Democrats' focus does not change. We fought like hell to stop these hikes, and we're going to continue to fight like hell to bring costs down for the American people on healthcare, on housing, on electric rates, on groceries."

"But Republicans are fighting like hell to send those costs right through the roof," he added. "They're fighting like hell to kick people off insurance. They're fighting like hell to cut taxes and give sweet giveaways to billionaires and the ultrarich. January 1st is coming. Republicans are responsible for what happens next. This is their crisis now, and they're going to have to answer for it."

[TITLE]Cycle Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Applied Therapeutics:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: APLT; “Applied”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to creating transformative treatments for rare diseases, today announced a definitive agreement for Cycle Group Holdings Limited (“Cycle”) to acquire Applied Therapeutics.

Applied Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the development of novel drug candidates against validated molecular targets in rare diseases. Applied’s lead drug candidate, govorestat, is a novel central nervous system (CNS) penetrant Aldose Reductase Inhibitor (ARI) for the treatment of CNS rare metabolic diseases, including Classic Galactosemia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Sorbitol Dehydrogenase Deficiency (CMT-SORD) and phosphomannomutase 2 congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG).

“We are confident that Cycle has the resources and capabilities to move govorestat forward towards the ultimate goal of bringing a life-changing treatment to the patients suffering from Classic Galactosemia, CMT-SORD and PMM2-CDG, who have always been at the center of everything we do at Applied,” said Les Funtleyder, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Applied. “I want to thank the entire Applied team for their perseverance and commitment. We are also grateful to the investigators and patients who have contributed to the development of govorestat.”

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cycle will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock for a per share price of $0.088 per share in cash payable at closing plus one non-transferrable contingent value right (CVR) that entitles the holder to receive potential additional payments.

The CVR provides payments based on the following:

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for any galactosemia indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for the CMT-SORD indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.20 per CVR in cash payable upon the first achievement of worldwide net sales of any product covered by the CVR by Cycle, its affiliates or licensees equal to or exceeding $200 million dollars in any four-quarter fiscal period prior to the tenth anniversary of closing.

Each CVR holder will also be entitled to receive their pro rata share of any cash of Applied in excess of $500,000 at closing (capped at $1.5 million) (“Closing Cash Payment”).

Each such CVR and Closing Cash Payment will be paid only once, if at all.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions contained in the merger agreement that will be filed with the SEC, including the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock. The merger agreement does not include a financing condition. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions. If the tender offer closes, then Cycle would acquire untendered shares of Applied through a second-step merger for the same consideration.

Applied also issued a Promissory Note (the “Promissory Note”) to Cycle. The Promissory Note is unsecured and enables Applied to receive loans aggregating up to $8.5 million from Cycle, to fund Applied’s working capital needs under an approved budget. Cycle’s funding obligations cease, and amounts borrowed immediately becomes repayable, if the transaction is terminated for certain reasons. Absent funds provided by Cycle under the Promissory Note or from another source, Applied would be unable to continue to fund its activities for more than a limited number of days and Applied would anticipate proceeding to wind down operations.

The transaction was unanimously approved by the Applied Board of Directors following an extensive evaluation of strategic alternatives. This evaluation process included numerous discussions with potential counterparties. The Applied Board of Directors determined that entering into the merger agreement with Cycle represented the path that best advanced the interests of Applied and its stockholders.

For Cycle, Goodwin Procter LLP is acting as legal counsel. For Applied, Aquilo Partners, L.P. provided a fairness opinion, and Ropes & Gray LLP is acting as legal counsel.

The price target hike follows the company’s agreement to acquire Bluejay Therapeutics for $620 million in cash. With the acquisition, the company gains worldwide rights to brelovitug, a monoclonal antibody under development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis D, a rare and aggressive liver condition.

“This acquisition fits squarely with what we do best—advancing high-impact medicines for patients with rare diseases through disciplined development, regulatory innovation, and commercial excellence,” Mirum CEO Chris Peetz said in the release.

The acquisition of Brelovitug comes on the heels of 100% HDV RNA response in Phase 2 clinical trials, with Phase 3 results expected in the second half of next year.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley have also reiterated an Overweight rating on Mirum Pharmaceuticals with an $81 price target. The investment bank views the deal as a smart strategic move for Mirum, saying it bolsters the company’s position in rare liver diseases while offering clear synergies with its current commercial setup. The firm also projects that the enlarged pipeline could generate more than $4 billion in peak sales.

Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MIRM) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering treatments for rare and debilitating liver diseases, especially those affecting children, by transforming scientific discoveries into therapies such as their key drug LIVMARLI (maralixibat) for cholestatic pruritus in Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC).

While we acknowledge the potential of MIRM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

MONTREAL and CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Milestone® Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: MIST) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first commercial product, CARDAMYST™ (etripamil) nasal spray, a prescription medication for the conversion of acute symptomatic episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) to sinus rhythm in adults. This approval marks the first time that more than two million Americans with PSVT will have a rapid-acting treatment option they can self-administer outside the emergency department or other healthcare setting.

“Some people with PSVT have endured years of anxiety, fearing their next episode and the stress and disruption of emergency department visits,” said James Ip, M.D., FACC, FHRS, an etripamil investigator. “CARDAMYST will give many of them the ability to administer a medication themselves that can quickly stop their PSVT episode and potentially avoid a hospital trip or a call to emergency services.”

CARDAMYST Clinical Data

The FDA approval of CARDAMYST is supported by a robust clinical trial program based on safety data from more than 1,800 participants and more than 2,000 episodes of PSVT. This includes the successful Phase 3 RAPID trial, a global, randomized, double-blind comparison of CARDAMYST vs. placebo, published in The Lancet in 2023.

A consistent safety profile and treatment effects were observed across all subgroups, including participants concurrently on beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. The most frequent adverse events occurring in ≥5% of participants in randomized clinical trials were mild-to-moderate and transient in nature, including local-site nasal discomfort, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, throat irritation, and epistaxis.

[TITLE]'People Are Going to Die' If Republicans Let ACA Subsidies End, Warns AOC:
[TEXT]
The US House of Representatives is set to vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies next week, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez warned Friday that if Republicans let the ACA tax credits expire at the end of the year, "people are going to die."

The New York Democrat spoke to reporters in Washington, DC a day after only four Republicans voted with Democratic senators in an unsuccessful effort to pass legislation extending ACA subsidies, as over 20 million Americans face a surge in health insurance premiums. A GOP bill to replace the subsidies with annual payments to tax-advantaged health savings accounts also failed.

"We have to remember who's in charge of the House, the Senate, and the White House. Republicans have a House majority, they have a Senate majority, and Donald Trump is president of the United States, and JD Vance is vice president of the United States," Ocasio-Cortez said in remarks shared by her and multiple news sources on social media.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) "refused to engage" in a debate on the looming healthcare crisis and "kept Republicans home for over a month so that they would not negotiate," she said. Trump and Vance "did the same thing—they stuck their heads in the sand for the entirety of a... government shutdown where we were urging them to come to a solution on extensions of ACA premium subsidies," she continued, calling for a "clean" extension while the GOP sorts out its supposed healthcare plan.

"People are gonna be kicked off of their insurance. Open enrollment is happening right now, and there are going to be millions of Americans that are affected—that aren't gonna be able to go to a doctor, aren't gonna be able to afford their prescription drugs, because of some petty fight in Washington," the congresswoman said, noting Democratic efforts to force votes on an extension.

As NBC News reported Thursday, early enrollment data from several states shows that "more people appear to be walking away from Affordable Care Act coverage or switching to cheaper plans for 2026 compared to this time last year," which "could reflect signs of financial strain for people who can't afford to pay hundreds of dollars more in monthly premiums once enhanced federal subsidies expire at the end of the year."

Demanding that her colleagues in DC recognize the urgency of the issue, Ocasio-Cortez—who supports Medicare for All—said Friday that "I don't understand why they can't just extend these subsidies so that we can save people's lives while they figure out whatever their political food fight is."

AOC also pushed back against GOP efforts to restrict reproductive healthcare in an ACA subsidy bill, saying "an extension with abortion restrictions kills women—so no, I'm going to allow this Republican majority to kill women in this country so that they can try to do whatever their victory lap is. I will not accept women, and the lives of women, as some political cost for them being able to extend these things. Reproductive care is healthcare. Period."

Since the right-wing US Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade and GOP-led states further restricted reproductive rights, multiple stories have emerged from places including Georgia and Texas exemplifying how "Republican abortion bans kill women."

After Johnson met with the House GOP's "Five Families" on Friday, he is expected to allow a floor vote to extend the subsidies next week and, according to Punchbowl News, is considering giving moderates an option without abortion funding restrictions.

As Politico reported Friday evening:

[GOP] leaders ultimately expect the extension vote to fail, resulting in skyrocketing premiums for millions of Americans when the subsidies expire at the end of the year.

Instead, according to House Republican leadership aides, Republicans are preparing to roll out a healthcare framework that would allow businesses that fund their own health plans to purchase "stop-loss" policies—which would protect businesses from going bankrupt from just a few unexpectedly expensive insurance claims.

It also would appropriate funds to pay for "cost-sharing reductions" in Obamacare and include some elements of a separate legislative proposal designed to crack down on pharmacy benefit managers—companies that negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers and large employers.

Like Ocasio-Cortez—who has faced mounting calls to launch a 2028 primary challenge to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) over his handling of the March funding fight and recent shutdown—the upper chamber's top Democrat put the blame squarely on Republicans after both bills failed to advance on Thursday.

"Republicans must answer for why people will lose coverage. Republicans must answer why families see premiums double and triple over the next year," Schumer said. "Democrats' focus does not change. We fought like hell to stop these hikes, and we're going to continue to fight like hell to bring costs down for the American people on healthcare, on housing, on electric rates, on groceries."

"But Republicans are fighting like hell to send those costs right through the roof," he added. "They're fighting like hell to kick people off insurance. They're fighting like hell to cut taxes and give sweet giveaways to billionaires and the ultrarich. January 1st is coming. Republicans are responsible for what happens next. This is their crisis now, and they're going to have to answer for it."
