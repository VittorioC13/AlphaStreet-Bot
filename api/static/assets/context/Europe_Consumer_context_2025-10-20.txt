[TITLE]Byte-Sized AI: Google Adds Shoes to User-Centric Virtual Try-On; NoFraud Acquires Yofi:
[TEXT]
Byte-Sized AI is a bi-weekly column that covers all things artificial intelligence—from startup funding, to newly inked partnerships, to just-launched, AI-powered capabilities from major retailers, software providers and supply chain players.

NoFraud acquires Yofi AI

NoFraud, which helps Shopify merchants and companies screen orders to prevent credit card fraud and unnecessary chargebacks, announced last week that it has acquired Yofi AI. The startup has developed systems to help brands and retailers, like JD Sports Canada, to identify abusive shopping patterns, stop fraudulent transactions and reward loyal, legitimate customers.

Yofi had backing from venture capital firms like Nyca Partners, Point72 Ventures and eBay Ventures. NoFraud said the acquisition will help it to extend its capabilities and help retailers and brands fight the issue of fraudulent returns.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Jordan Shamir, co-founder and CEO of Yofi AI, said fraud and theft continue to be major issues plaguing brands and retailers of all sizes.

“Policy abuse has become the single biggest threat to retail margins,” Shamir said in a statement. “It’s forcing merchants to absorb billions in unnecessary costs and putting loyal customer relationships at risk. We built Yofi AI to stop this head-on, and by joining NoFraud we can take that fight to scale—giving merchants the only platform that protects profits in real time.”

Yofi’s systems will be integrated into NoFraud ahead of the holiday season, the two companies said in the announcement.

Scott Gifis, CEO of NoFraud, said older technology solutions can’t provide merchants with an accessible, efficient way to track and mitigate the issues associated with fraud and malicious shopping. He’s hopeful that joining forces with Yofi will help companies bridge that gap.

“Together with Yofi AI, we’re taking a massive step forward to change how merchants manage risk,” Gifis said in a statement. “Legacy tools weren’t built for today’s realities. Our platform meets risk where it happens, in real time, protecting margins and helping merchants grow.”

Frasers links with Commercetools to power agentic shopping integrations

Frasers Group announced this week that it’s using a partnership with Commercetools as a way for some of its brands to participate in agentic commerce.

Frasers Group said the partnership is the first of its kind in Europe and will touch three of its brands—Sports Direct, Flannels and Frasers. Those brands will use Commercetools’ agentic commerce suite to help shoppers discover Frasers’ products through publicly available large language models (LLMs).

David Clark, chief customer officer at Frasers Group, said the partnership will help the brands involved to meet consumers where they are today, while also anticipating where they’re headed next.

“The digital customer ecosystem is evolving faster than ever before, and so are customers’ expectations,” Clark said in a statement. “With this partnership, Frasers Group is now at the forefront of this evolution to deliver enhanced customer experiences across ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity—including native checkout in ChatGPT—across Sports Direct, Flannels and Frasers. This marks a shift in our digital capabilities, delivering an even more intuitive and personalised shopping experience for our consumers.”

The announcement comes on the heels of retail giant Walmart announcing that it had partnered with OpenAI to make items available for purchase directly in ChatGPT. The companies did not disclose when Walmart items would be available via Instant Checkout, but items on Etsy are actively able to be purchased on the ChatGPT platform. OpenAI announced that “thousands” of Shopify merchants will also be available in the near future, with Vuori and Skims among them.

Andrew Burton, CEO of Commercetools, said Frasers Group’s integration comes at a critical turning point for the fashion, apparel and retail industries.

“The future of commerce is agentic, and it’s arriving faster than most retailers realize,” Burton said in a statement. “Frasers Group understands that when customers start delegating shopping to agents or doing their shopping through an LLM, the retailers who will win will be those ready to deliver seamless, trusted, consistent experiences through those agents,” Burton said in a statement.

Google extends virtual try-on to shoes

Google announced last week that it has expanded its generative AI-powered virtual try-on tool, which allows consumers to see items on a virtual version of their own likeness, to include shoes.

The company’s virtual try-on tool, which it expanded a few months ago, allows users to see how a single item of clothing might look on their own body. To test out the tool, users upload a full-body photo of themselves.

Google said it uses “state-of-the-art AI accurately perceives shapes and depths, preserving those subtleties when showing you what something would look like on you.”

Unlike some other companies, Google’s try-on experience is limited to one item at a time. So, for instance, if a consumer is checking out a pair of ASOS heels, they can’t also put a shirt of their choice on their digital avatar.

The experience seems like another play at customization as Big Tech companies continue to advance their AI-enabled offerings and consumers change their shopping patterns.

First Insight launches retail-focused conversational AI co-pilot

First Insight announced this week that it’s allowing “major retailers” to beta test a new conversational AI co-pilot it calls Ellis.

First Insight did not disclose which of its clients have started participating in the beta test, but it partners with companies like Under Armour, Kohl’s, Francesca’s and Marks & Spencer.

Ellis is meant to help brands and retailers scenario plan, leveraging predictive analytics and natural language processing (NLP) to provide real-time insights that can shorten the decisioning process.

First Insight said Ellis can leverage internal data to help planners, merchandisers and other retail professionals with ensuring their assortments match consumers’ interests and expectations; understanding the best price point for specific items; forecasting demand; aligning marketing spends and campaigns with selling goals; compressing time to market and more.

First Insight is testing the tool as retailers head into the holiday season, which is one of the sector’s most critical timeframes of the calendar year. That’s especially true as the macroeconomic environment fluctuates and holiday spending among some generations, particularly Gen Z, is expected to decline.

Greg Petro, CEO of First Insight, said the tool will help brands and retailers bring data into many of the decisions they make, which can enrich decisioning and provide sound reasoning for their actions, rather than making decisions using gut feeling and historical spending patterns alone.

“Retail doesn’t win on intuition anymore,” Petro said in a statement. “Ellis turns signals into decisions—on product, price and promotions—at the moment retailers need them most and with a competitive understanding never before available. It’s about speed with confidence: protecting margins, finding growth and staying in step with customers as they shift.”

[TITLE]Denver-based women’s ski apparel brand Halfdays raises $10M:
[TEXT]
Halfdays is now sitting on a mountain of cash.

The Denver-based women’s ski apparel company announced a $10 million raise this month, bringing its lifetime total to $15 million. Apparel maker Kellwood Company led the raise, with participation from Dicks Sporting Goods Ventures and model Taylor Hill.

“This raise will allow us to fuel our growth trajectory: expanding our core winter and ski collections, continuing to grow into year-round trail and activewear, and investing in brick-and-mortar retail,” co-founder and CEO Ariana Ferwerda said in an email.

Ferwerda, who started the brand in 2020 alongside Karelle Golda and former Olympic skier Kiley McKinnon, said Halfdays’ collection will double in size next year to feature more versatile, all-year activewear. Bestsellers like the $395 Lawrence jacket, $295 Alessandra snowpant and $95 Sophia baselayer leggings will remain.

Ferwerda said powderhounds will also have more places to find Halfdays, with online fashion outfits Revolve and Shopbop joining existing retailers like Nordstrom, REI and Dick’s.

Halfdays will also grow its own store count after a successful Denver debut at 2609 Walnut St. in RiNo, which opened last December. Ferwerda said no additional ones are planned in Colorado, but Halfdays is exploring doing a pop-up shop in the mountains sometime this ski season.

Halfdays started as solely direct-to-consumer before testing the wholesale slopes in 2021, its second ski season. Last year, Ferwerda said, the company “decided to go all in” and tripled to 150 retail locations across North America.

This year, one-third of Halfdays’ projected $25 million in sales will come from that arm of the business. That total revenue is an 80% jump from 2024, Ferwerda said.

Halfdays raised its previous $5 million in 2021 and 2022, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

[TITLE]38-year-old quit his job, spent $50,000 to launch a company from his Bronx apartment—now billionaires wear his luxury coats:
[TEXT]
It was 95 degrees when the first prototype of a Norwegian Wool jacket arrived at Michael Berkowitz's apartment in The Bronx, New York, in August 2014. Needing to test the waterproof knee-length wool coat without getting heat stroke, the founder and CEO of the then-fledgling apparel brand took it to a supermarket in West Harlem. "[I] paced back and forth for 30 minutes in a walk-in freezer" to evaluate its lining for warmth, recalls Berkowitz, 38. "It's New York, so no one stops you, no one asks you. My face was cold by the end, but my body was totally warm. I remember thinking, 'OK, we're on to something.'" At the time, Berkowitz was a commodities trader hoping to launch his own business. Today, Norwegian Wool's coats adorn the shoulders of billionaires, actors, politicians and financiers — at campaign events, during the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and in a Season 3 episode of HBO's "Succession." The apparel brand was profitable in 2024, and has been for seven out of the last eight years, Berkowitz says. DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss Berkowitz declined to share other financials, citing competitive pressure — but says his company's products are now sold in more than 100 stores worldwide, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom and his appointment-only New York showroom. The appeal of Norwegian Wool coats is part form, part function. Financiers are expected to dress a certain way, but the classic wool Italian coats most of them wear aren't designed for sub-40-degree weather, says Berkowitz. "If you show up wearing a [puffer coat] that looks like you're going to the Arctic, but it's only 40 degrees, you do not look like the person that's going to be able to break through walls and get a deal done," he says. Norwegian Wool's bestselling mid-length Euro Coats currently range from $1,545 to $2,945 each, depending on the type of wool used. The brand sells other lengths and styles, including blazers, sport coats, rain and ski jackets, and a variety of winter coat options and accessories for men and women. Roughly 40 billionaires have purchased Norwegian Wool coats, Berkowitz estimates.

A luxury startup with modest roots

Berkowitz had the idea for Norwegian Wool while shivering on a subway platform with a friend in 2013, he says. "I told him, 'I need a coat that looks good, that I could wear to work, that will actually keep me warm,'" Berkowitz remembers. "He put his arm on my shoulders, like, 'Dude, when you find it, get me one, too.'" After doing some research, Berkowitz identified a simple culprit, he says: Many fashionable coats are designed in parts of Italy where the air rarely freezes. The average January temperature in Florence, for example, is roughly 40 degrees Fahrenheit — compared to 30 degrees in New York and 25 degrees in Chicago. Companies based in Canada and Scandinavia make warmer coats for harsher winters, but as one designer told him, the two industries "don't talk to each other," he says.

Norwegian Wool's showroom, located in New York's Midtown neighborhood Norwegian Wool

Berkowitz spent months flying to Italy and back to meet and woo factory owners, who'd ship prototypes to his apartment. He ultimately spent $250,000 — $50,000 of his own money and a $200,000 investment from the former CFO of his company, who'd heard about Berkowitz's efforts from a colleague — to sample the prototypes and order an initial run of 200 coats, he says. On nights, weekends and vacation days, Berkowitz carted those coats — one on his body and two in a small suitcase — to family-owned luxury stores across the U.S., he says. He often pitched directly to sales associates, who knew their clients' shared dilemma of wanting to feel warm while looking nice in a luxury coat, he says. He sold all 200 coats in three months and resigned from his day job in early 2015, he says. "I didn't sleep much that year," says Berkowitz, adding that by day, he tried to hide his efforts to avoid jeopardizing his job. According to his former boss Alan Kestenbaum, now the CEO of New York-based holding company Bedrock Industries, he only ever came across as a "street smart" and eager employee who was "the first to arrive and the last to leave."

Like 'dipping your hand into warm butter'

In 2017, Berkowitz landed his first partnership to sell coats at a major department store. The following year, Norwegian Wool participated in two fundraising rounds, both seven-figure deals with private investors, Berkowitz says. He remains the company's majority owner, he notes. Norwegian Wool coats are generally more expensive than Canada Goose parkas, and less pricey than cashmere coats from established Italian luxury brands like Loro Piana. But the quality of its materials is high, says "Succession" costume director Jon Schwartz: Norwegian Wool's cashmere feels like "dipping your hand into warm butter." Berkowitz's dream for Norwegian Wool is a reputation akin to Range Rover cars — known worldwide for a blend of style and functionality, he says. He plans to add more product lines, invest in marketing and host pop-up retail events to improve the brand's visibility, he adds. Already, he's overheard Norwegian Wool come up in organic conversations, even when nobody realizes the brand's founder is in earshot, he says.

[TITLE]The $17 billion lesson: how retail turned Bitcoin proxy plays into pain trade:
[TEXT]
There’s a grim symmetry to every crypto boom: an idea born from freedom eventually gets packaged, securitized, and sold back to the masses, this time at a hefty premium. According to a new 10XResearch report, retail investors have collectively lost $17 billion trying to gain indirect Bitcoin exposure through listed “digital asset treasury” companies like Metaplanet and Strategy.

10X Research report describes the great proxy trade

The logic made sense on paper. Why bother managing a private wallet or navigating ETF inefficiencies when you could simply buy shares in firms that hold Bitcoin themselves? Strategy had turned this ‘strategy’ into something of a cult playbook. They inspired a wave of corporate imitators from Tokyo to Toronto.

By mid‑2025, dozens of small to mid‑cap “Bitcoin treasuries” had emerged, some genuine, others opportunistic, pitching themselves as pure‑play proxies for Bitcoin’s upside.

But there was one fatal flaw: valuation drift. 10X Research notes that at the height of the rally, the equity premiums on these stocks reached absurd levels. In some cases, companies traded at 40–50% above their net Bitcoin per‑share value. This was driven by momentum traders and retail enthusiasm rather than underlying assets. According to Bloomberg, it soon stopped being exposure to Bitcoin and became exposure to crowd psychology.

When premiums meet reality

As Bitcoin corrected 13% in October, the effect on these treasuries was magnified. The stocks didn’t just track Bitcoin lower. They cratered, wiping out paper wealth at more than double the rate of the underlying asset’s decline. Strategy fell nearly 35% from its recent peak, while Metaplanet plunged over 50%, erasing the majority of its speculative summer gains.

For late‑entry retail holders, the drawdown wasn’t just painful; it was devastating. 10X Research estimates that since August, retail portfolios focused on digital asset treasury equities have collectively lost around $17 billion. This was concentrated largely among unhedged individual investors in the U.S., Japan, and Europe.

The psychology of second‑order speculation

There is irony here: Bitcoin was designed as a self‑sovereign asset, outside the gatekeeping of financial intermediaries. Yet, as it became institutionalized, retail investors found themselves back in familiar territory, buying someone else’s version of Bitcoin through public equities.

These proxies came wrapped in glossy narratives of “corporate conviction,” complete with charismatic CEOs and open‑source branding. In practice, they turned out to be leveraged plays on Bitcoin using corporate balance sheets; a risky bet in a tightening liquidity environment.

When macro headwinds from Washington and Beijing triggered the latest wave of deleveraging, these proxy trades unwound with surgical precision. They hit the same investors who believed they’d found a smarter way to HODL.

A painful reminder

There’s little solace in the numbers. But for anyone watching Bitcoin’s cyclical dance between innovation and euphoria, the lesson stands. The closer crypto edges to traditional markets, the more it inherits their distortions. Owning an idea through a company that monetizes belief might be convenient, even exciting, but convenience has a cost.

As 10X Research put it bluntly, equity wrappers for digital assets are not substitutes for the assets themselves. In this chapter of the Bitcoin story, that difference has already cost retail investors 17 billion reasons to remember why decentralization was so appealing in the first place.

Trade Analysis of the B2B Food & Beverages E-commerce Market: Import & Export Perspective

The B2B food & beverages e-commerce market has expanded rapidly since COVID, as wholesalers, distributors, and manufacturers digitized procurement and sales.

Who Leads the Trade Flows (Platforms & Country Roles)

China: China is the dominant origin for cross-border B2B food shipments and platform activity through Alibaba.com, 1688, and dedicated CBEC pilot zones; Beijing’s cross-border e-commerce programs lifted CBEC volumes substantially in 2023–24, making China a primary exporter/origin for small-lot, high-frequency B2B shipments.

Latin America: Large regional consumer e-commerce players are building B2B offerings (e.g., MercadoLibre’s new B2B unit), which will expand formalized cross-border and intra-regional food wholesale flows.

Trade Characteristics & Logistics Drivers

Small-lot, frequent shipments dominate: B2B e-commerce often favors many smaller, repeat orders (restaurants, retailers) over a few bulk container loads, changing export/import patterns and increasing reliance on express couriers and consolidated freight.

B2B e-commerce often favors many smaller, repeat orders (restaurants, retailers) over a few bulk container loads, changing export/import patterns and increasing reliance on express couriers and consolidated freight. Cold-chain and perishables logistics are critical constraints and growth enablers: As B2B ordering moves into fresh, chilled, and frozen categories, demand for reliable cold chain capacity (refrigerated warehousing, temperature-controlled last mile) is a gating factor for cross-border trade. The global cold chain market is large and growing rapidly, reflecting this need.

The global cold chain market is large and growing rapidly, reflecting this need. Regulatory & documentation friction matters more than price: Imports of food via B2B platforms require stricter traceability, sanitary documentation, and country-specific labeling; exporters that embed compliance documentation into listings win faster onboarding and fewer customs hold-ups.

Increasing Obese Population Fueling the Demand for Ketogenic Diet Food

The ketogenic diet food market is observing growth lately due to increasing health consciousness, increasing diabetes and obesity rates, and the availability of different types of keto-friendly products in the market. A keto-friendly diet involves the consumption of food options that are high in fats and low in carbs to promote weight loss and manage health issues such as diabetes and obesity. Hence, such diets are followed by obese and diabetic people on a larger scale.

Different types of keto-friendly snacks are available in supermarkets and online platforms, allowing consumers to shop for them easily and also carry them outdoors to maintain their diet. The market is also observing growth due to the availability of products such as keto-friendly packaged foods, snacks, meal options low in carbs and high in fats, and related supplements.

New Trends in the Ketogenic Diet Food Market

Higher demand for convenient meal options due to the hectic lifestyles of consumers is a major factor in the growth of the ketogenic diet food market.

Impact of AI in the Ketogenic Diet Food Market

AI is increasingly making inroads into the ketogenic diet food market, enabling more precise product development, personalization, quality assurance, and market responsiveness. In formulation and R&D, AI models assist in designing foods that align with keto requirements (very low carbs, high healthy fats, and moderate protein) by predicting how alternative ingredients, fibers, and fats will behave under processing, how they influence texture, flavor, and shelf life, and how they interact with other components. On the consumer front, AI-driven nutrition platforms generate highly personalized keto meal plans, track macro balance in real time, and predict adherence trends, encouraging tailored food launches and ingredient adjustments. In manufacturing, AI systems monitor process parameters (mixing, drying, cooling, encapsulation) to ensure consistent macro ratios, prevent unwanted sugar formation or moisture anomalies, and maintain quality across batches.

AI also optimizes supply chains and demand forecasting for keto food SKUs, helping minimize perishables’ losses and aligning production with consumer seasonal or regional trends. Finally, in marketing and consumer analytics, AI segments keto followers by lifestyle, goals, and behavioral data, enabling brands to launch niche variants such as keto snacks for diabetics and keto dessert lines, and to target promotional campaigns more effectively. As a result, AI is pushing the keto-food space toward faster innovation cycles, greater consistency, and stronger alignment with individual dietary needs.

This market is witnessing rapid expansion as brands increasingly adopt QR codes, NFC, and IoT technologies to boost consumer engagement, enhance supply chain transparency, and enable product authentication. Stricter regulations, particularly those addressing excessive packaging in food and cosmetics, are pushing companies to innovate and adopt more sustainable, compliant packaging solutions. Sustainability and technology are converging, with firms now developing packaging that not only reduces carbon impact but also integrates smart features such as scannable authenticity markers.

What is Connected Packaging?

Connected packaging refers to physical product packaging integrated with digital technologies, such as QR codes, NFC chips, or augmented reality, to create interactive links between the product and the digital world. It is commonly used to ensure food safety, monitor product freshness, and provide consumers with detailed information. Additionally, connected packaging delivers engaging experiences like games, tutorials, rewards programs, and exclusive content, transforming everyday goods into memorable brand interactions. Brands also use it for direct marketing, collecting customer feedback, and sending real-time updates, including recall notifications.

What are the Latest Trends in the Connected Packaging Market?

Emergence of AI and Connected Platforms

AI and connected technologies like IoT sensors and QR codes are transforming packaging across the entire product lifecycle.

What Potentiates the Growth of the Connected Packaging Market?

The complex logistics of e-commerce, which include various steps from warehouse to doorstep, create new requirements for visibility and efficiency. Connected packaging offers a solution for improved transparency. Consequently, as online sales volumes rise, so does the public concern over packaging waste. Thus, e-commerce brands are responding to user demand for more sustainable practices, and even connected packaging provides a transparent way to communicate these efforts. Moreover, every customer scan is an opportunity to gather valuable data on user behavior, from their options to their location. This information can inform targeted marketing campaigns, personalized content, and future product development, permitting brands to cater more effectively to their audience.

Limitations & Challenges in the Connected Packaging Market

The major challenges in the market include data privacy and security concerns, along with connectivity challenges, high operational expenses, and complex and evolving regulatory environments. Other challenges include cross-functional internal coordination between departments, guaranteeing the safety of packaging materials, and a shortage of standardized regulations worldwide. Implementing advanced connected packaging solutions, mainly those involving AI or complex chips, can be expensive because of high operational expenses, potentially making it difficult for firms to justify the investment.

Regional Analysis

Canada Market Trends

In Canada, the market is expanding steadily as brands embrace connected packaging to foster two-way communication with consumers. Companies are leveraging this technology to deliver product information, exclusive content, and interactive experiences, enhancing both engagement and brand loyalty.

How is the Opportunistic Rise of Asia Pacific in the Connected Packaging Market?

Asia Pacific is expected to experience rapid growth in the market over the forecast period, driven by rapid technology adoption, a large tech-savvy population, and a thriving e-commerce sector. The region’s high smartphone penetration provides a seamless interface for connected features such as QR codes, NFC tags, and augmented reality (AR). Rising environmental awareness, coupled with regulatory efforts to curb single-use plastics, is further accelerating the demand for sustainable and biodegradable smart packaging solutions. Moreover, there is a strong emphasis on enhancing supply chain transparency, contributing to regional market growth.

China Market Trends

China’s market growth is driven by advanced technology integration, a flourishing e-commerce ecosystem, and strong sustainability goals. Notable trends include widespread adoption of QR codes and NFC/RFID tags, increased focus on anti-counterfeiting, greater supply chain transparency, and the emergence of AI-powered solutions to optimize logistics and customer engagement.

Japan Market Trends

Japan’s market emphasizes consumer engagement and traceability, particularly in food, beverage, and pharmaceutical sectors. Smart technologies such as QR codes and NFC are increasingly used to enhance transparency and brand interaction. Additionally, there is a strong push for sustainable packaging, driven by both regulatory mandates and growing consumer preference for recyclable and eco-friendly materials.

More Insights of Towards Packaging:

Segment Outlook

Type Insights

The QR code segment dominated the connected packaging market in 2024. This is due to its cost-effectiveness, ease of integration, and universal smartphone compatibility. Brands favored QR codes because they require no additional hardware, are easily printed on any packaging surface, and enable instant consumer interaction, whether for product authentication, traceability, marketing engagement, or regulatory compliance. Many industries, such as food and pharmaceuticals, are mandating traceability features, boosting the demand for QR codes.

The RFID segment is expected to grow at the fastest rate in the upcoming period. This is because of its ability to enhance supply chain visibility, streamline inventory management, and strengthen anti-counterfeiting measures. These benefits are particularly critical in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and high-value food, where traceability and authentication are vital. RFID enables better stock accuracy, reduces shrinkage, and improves product availability for consumers. Moreover, the declining cost of RFID chips and tags is making the technology more scalable and accessible across a wider range of applications.

End User Insights

The pharmaceutical segment held a considerable share of the connected packaging market in 2024. This is due to stringent regulatory requirements for drug safety, efficacy, and anti-counterfeiting. Connected packaging addresses these demands through advanced features such as serialization, real-time temperature monitoring, and product authentication. As the pharmaceutical industry expands, driven by an aging population and rising prevalence of chronic conditions, the demand for secure, smart packaging solutions is expected to continue to grow in parallel.

The food and beverage segment is likely to grow at a significant rate over the forecast period. This is primarily driven by rising demand for food safety, quality assurance, and transparency. Shifting consumer lifestyles and the surge in e-commerce, particularly online grocery shopping and food delivery services, have amplified the need for packaging that ensures product integrity, traceability, and authenticity during transit. Smart sensors integrated into packaging can monitor freshness and help reduce spoilage, enabling timely consumption and minimizing waste.

Distribution Insights

The supermarkets segment held a significant share of the connected packaging market in 2024, as retailers increasingly leverage this technology to enhance supply chain efficiency, consumer safety, engagement, and sustainability. Connected packaging, through QR codes or NFC tags, enables consumers to trace a product’s journey from its source to the store shelf. This level of transparency is particularly valued in the wake of rising food safety concerns and growing consumer demand for ethical sourcing.

The e-commerce segment is expected to expand at the fastest rate during the forecast period. This is due to the explosive rise in online shopping and direct-to-consumer delivery models. With more goods shipped individually to consumers, there's heightened demand for packaging that ensures safety, enhances customer experience, and enables logistics tracking. E-commerce brands are increasingly adopting connected packaging to create interactive and personalized “unboxing” experiences, particularly for premium categories like electronics, thereby boosting customer engagement and brand loyalty.

[TITLE]38-year-old quit his job, spent $50,000 to launch a company from his Bronx apartment—now billionaires wear his luxury coats:
[TEXT]
It was 95 degrees when the first prototype of a Norwegian Wool jacket arrived at Michael Berkowitz's apartment in The Bronx, New York, in August 2014. Needing to test the waterproof knee-length wool coat without getting heat stroke, the founder and CEO of the then-fledgling apparel brand took it to a supermarket in West Harlem. "[I] paced back and forth for 30 minutes in a walk-in freezer" to evaluate its lining for warmth, recalls Berkowitz, 38. "It's New York, so no one stops you, no one asks you. My face was cold by the end, but my body was totally warm. I remember thinking, 'OK, we're on to something.'" At the time, Berkowitz was a commodities trader hoping to launch his own business. Today, Norwegian Wool's coats adorn the shoulders of billionaires, actors, politicians and financiers — at campaign events, during the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and in a Season 3 episode of HBO's "Succession." The apparel brand was profitable in 2024, and has been for seven out of the last eight years, Berkowitz says. DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss Berkowitz declined to share other financials, citing competitive pressure — but says his company's products are now sold in more than 100 stores worldwide, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom and his appointment-only New York showroom. The appeal of Norwegian Wool coats is part form, part function. Financiers are expected to dress a certain way, but the classic wool Italian coats most of them wear aren't designed for sub-40-degree weather, says Berkowitz. "If you show up wearing a [puffer coat] that looks like you're going to the Arctic, but it's only 40 degrees, you do not look like the person that's going to be able to break through walls and get a deal done," he says. Norwegian Wool's bestselling mid-length Euro Coats currently range from $1,545 to $2,945 each, depending on the type of wool used. The brand sells other lengths and styles, including blazers, sport coats, rain and ski jackets, and a variety of winter coat options and accessories for men and women. Roughly 40 billionaires have purchased Norwegian Wool coats, Berkowitz estimates.

A luxury startup with modest roots

Berkowitz had the idea for Norwegian Wool while shivering on a subway platform with a friend in 2013, he says. "I told him, 'I need a coat that looks good, that I could wear to work, that will actually keep me warm,'" Berkowitz remembers. "He put his arm on my shoulders, like, 'Dude, when you find it, get me one, too.'" After doing some research, Berkowitz identified a simple culprit, he says: Many fashionable coats are designed in parts of Italy where the air rarely freezes. The average January temperature in Florence, for example, is roughly 40 degrees Fahrenheit — compared to 30 degrees in New York and 25 degrees in Chicago. Companies based in Canada and Scandinavia make warmer coats for harsher winters, but as one designer told him, the two industries "don't talk to each other," he says.

Norwegian Wool's showroom, located in New York's Midtown neighborhood Norwegian Wool

Berkowitz spent months flying to Italy and back to meet and woo factory owners, who'd ship prototypes to his apartment. He ultimately spent $250,000 — $50,000 of his own money and a $200,000 investment from the former CFO of his company, who'd heard about Berkowitz's efforts from a colleague — to sample the prototypes and order an initial run of 200 coats, he says. On nights, weekends and vacation days, Berkowitz carted those coats — one on his body and two in a small suitcase — to family-owned luxury stores across the U.S., he says. He often pitched directly to sales associates, who knew their clients' shared dilemma of wanting to feel warm while looking nice in a luxury coat, he says. He sold all 200 coats in three months and resigned from his day job in early 2015, he says. "I didn't sleep much that year," says Berkowitz, adding that by day, he tried to hide his efforts to avoid jeopardizing his job. According to his former boss Alan Kestenbaum, now the CEO of New York-based holding company Bedrock Industries, he only ever came across as a "street smart" and eager employee who was "the first to arrive and the last to leave."

Like 'dipping your hand into warm butter'

In 2017, Berkowitz landed his first partnership to sell coats at a major department store. The following year, Norwegian Wool participated in two fundraising rounds, both seven-figure deals with private investors, Berkowitz says. He remains the company's majority owner, he notes. Norwegian Wool coats are generally more expensive than Canada Goose parkas, and less pricey than cashmere coats from established Italian luxury brands like Loro Piana. But the quality of its materials is high, says "Succession" costume director Jon Schwartz: Norwegian Wool's cashmere feels like "dipping your hand into warm butter." Berkowitz's dream for Norwegian Wool is a reputation akin to Range Rover cars — known worldwide for a blend of style and functionality, he says. He plans to add more product lines, invest in marketing and host pop-up retail events to improve the brand's visibility, he adds. Already, he's overheard Norwegian Wool come up in organic conversations, even when nobody realizes the brand's founder is in earshot, he says.

If you show up wearing a [puffer coat] that looks like you're going to the Arctic, but it's only 40 degrees, you do not look like the person that's going to be able to break through walls and get a deal done. Michael Berkowitz Founder and CEO, Norwegian Wool

[TITLE]Denver-based women’s ski apparel brand Halfdays raises $10M:
[TEXT]
Halfdays is now sitting on a mountain of cash.

The Denver-based women’s ski apparel company announced a $10 million raise this month, bringing its lifetime total to $15 million. Apparel maker Kellwood Company led the raise, with participation from Dicks Sporting Goods Ventures and model Taylor Hill.

“This raise will allow us to fuel our growth trajectory: expanding our core winter and ski collections, continuing to grow into year-round trail and activewear, and investing in brick-and-mortar retail,” co-founder and CEO Ariana Ferwerda said in an email.

Ferwerda, who started the brand in 2020 alongside Karelle Golda and former Olympic skier Kiley McKinnon, said Halfdays’ collection will double in size next year to feature more versatile, all-year activewear. Bestsellers like the $395 Lawrence jacket, $295 Alessandra snowpant and $95 Sophia baselayer leggings will remain.

Ferwerda said powderhounds will also have more places to find Halfdays, with online fashion outfits Revolve and Shopbop joining existing retailers like Nordstrom, REI and Dick’s.

Halfdays will also grow its own store count after a successful Denver debut at 2609 Walnut St. in RiNo, which opened last December. Ferwerda said no additional ones are planned in Colorado, but Halfdays is exploring doing a pop-up shop in the mountains sometime this ski season.

Halfdays started as solely direct-to-consumer before testing the wholesale slopes in 2021, its second ski season. Last year, Ferwerda said, the company “decided to go all in” and tripled to 150 retail locations across North America.

This year, one-third of Halfdays’ projected $25 million in sales will come from that arm of the business. That total revenue is an 80% jump from 2024, Ferwerda said.

Halfdays raised its previous $5 million in 2021 and 2022, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Euratex joins several other European fashion industry associations as well as those representing other industries and businesses in declaring the EU-Mercosur Agreement will be a “critical element in ensuring the EU’s long-term competitiveness”.

The associations, which include the European Footwear Confederation (CEC), the European Branded Clothing Association (EBCA) and the Confederation of National Associations of Tanners and Dressers of the European Community (COTANCE), state: “In this unprecedented time when the rules-based global order is being critically undermined, this free trade agreement represents a beacon in the EU’s diversification strategy.”

Together, the associations’ members cover a significant portion of the total trade in goods and services of over €153bn ($176.86bn) in 2024 between the EU and the Mercosur region, as well as the approximately €380bn of mutual investment in the two regions in 2023.

By 2040, according to DG Trade’s calculations, the agreement is expected to add €77.6bn to the EU GDP and €9.4bn to the Mercosur GDP.

At the same time, the agreement will result in a 39% increase in EU exports to Mercosur and a 17% increase in Mercosur exports to the EU.

The associations describe the EU-Mercosur as a modern agreement that is driven by modern principles.

In a sector traditionally dependent on manual processes and long procurement cycles, AI is introducing automation and intelligence to optimize sourcing, pricing, and logistics. Predictive analytics powered by AI helps businesses forecast demand, manage inventory efficiently, and prevent stockouts or overproduction, crucial in the perishable goods segment.

AI-driven recommendation engines are also enhancing personalization in B2B platforms, suggesting products based on purchasing history, seasonal trends, and client-specific needs. This level of customization strengthens supplier–buyer relationships and increases conversion rates. In pricing, machine learning algorithms dynamically adjust prices based on demand patterns, competitor data, and raw material costs, improving profitability and competitiveness. Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants simplify order management, automate customer support, and streamline negotiations, reducing operational burdens for distributors and wholesalers.

[TITLE]HVAC Air Filters Market Outlook Report 2025-2035: Rising Air Quality Awareness, HVAC Installations, and Adoption of Smart and Antimicrobial Filtration Technologies Bolster Growth:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "HVAC Air Filters Market Size, Share, Trends, Growth Opportunities & Forecast by Filter Type, MERV Rating, End-Use Industry, and Region - Global Outlook 2025 to 2035" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

According to the research report, the HVAC air filters market is projected to reach $14.08 billion by 2035, at a CAGR of 5.1% during the forecast period 2025-2035. The report provides an in-depth analysis of the global HVAC air filters across five major regions, emphasizing the current market trends, market sizes, recent developments, and forecasts till 2035.

The growth of this market is driven by the growing indoor air quality awareness, strict air quality regulations, growth in construction activities, rising HVAC system installations, health consciousness post-pandemic, energy efficiency requirements, increasing air pollution levels, and green building certifications. Moreover, smart filter technologies, antimicrobial filter development, emerging market expansion, retrofit material expansion, and e-commerce channel growth are expected to support the market's growth.

Asia-Pacific is projected to register the highest CAGR during the forecast period across the overall HVAC air filters market. This growth is fueled by rapid urbanization, expanding infrastructure, and increasing awareness of indoor air quality in densely populated countries such as China, India, and Southeast Asian nations. Rising demand from commercial and residential construction, coupled with stricter environmental and air quality regulations, is driving the adoption of advanced HVAC filtration systems across the region.

Additionally, industrial growth and increased investment in smart buildings and energy-efficient technologies are further accelerating market expansion. The booming e-commerce sector and growing middle-class population also contribute to higher HVAC product consumption.

Based on filter type, the HEPA filters segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period of 2025-2035.

The rapid growth of this segment is mainly due to the increasing demand for high-efficiency filtration in applications where air quality is critical. This growth is driven by heightened health and hygiene awareness following the COVID-19 pandemic, the expansion of the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, and rising usage in cleanrooms, laboratories, and even premium commercial and residential spaces.

HEPA filters, which can capture at least 99.97% of airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns, are seen as essential for removing allergens, bacteria, and viruses from indoor air. As indoor air quality becomes a public health priority and end-users become more informed, the adoption of HEPA filtration is rising swiftly, especially in markets emphasizing wellness, infection control, and stringent regulatory compliance.

Based on MERV rating, the MERV 5-8 segment is expected to account for the largest share of the HVAC air filters market.

MERV 5-8 filters are widely used in residential and light commercial settings due to their optimal balance of cost and performance. They are preferred by homeowners and small business operators who seek meaningful improvements in air quality but do not require significant upgrades to their existing HVAC systems. As the residential retrofit market rapidly expands and fundamental indoor air quality standards become more prevalent, the use of MERV 5-8 filters continues to grow, sustaining the segment's dominance.

Furthermore, these filters provide superior allergen control and dust reduction compared to basic fiberglass alternatives, while remaining fully compatible with most existing HVAC infrastructures. This compatibility makes them particularly appealing to cost-conscious consumers looking for an effective, value-driven solution.

Based on the distribution channel, the e-commerce segment is projected to register the highest CAGR from 2025 to 2035.

This growth is driven by the increasing consumer preference for online shopping due to convenience, wider product availability, competitive pricing, and fast delivery options. The rising penetration of smartphones and internet connectivity, along with growing awareness of indoor air quality, is accelerating online purchases of HVAC air filters.

Additionally, e-commerce platforms offer product comparisons, customer reviews, and subscription-based models for filter replacements, further enhancing user experience. Manufacturers and brands are also leveraging digital channels to expand their reach, streamline logistics, and offer customized solutions directly to consumers. As digitalization continues to reshape buying behavior, the e-commerce distribution channel is expected to play an increasingly vital role in the HVAC air filter market's expansion.

Based on end-use application, the commercial segment is expected to account for the largest share of the HVAC air filters market in 2025.

This dominance is primarily driven by the increasing demand for efficient air filtration systems in offices, hospitals, educational institutions, shopping malls, hotels, and other public buildings. With growing awareness of indoor air quality, energy efficiency regulations, and health and safety standards, commercial facilities are prioritizing the installation of high-performance HVAC filters to ensure clean, safe, and comfortable indoor environments.

Additionally, post-pandemic health concerns have heightened the need for advanced air filtration solutions in commercial spaces to minimize airborne contaminants and improve ventilation. The rising number of commercial buildings, particularly in urban areas and emerging economies, further contributes to the segment's substantial market share and ongoing growth trajectory through the forecast period.
