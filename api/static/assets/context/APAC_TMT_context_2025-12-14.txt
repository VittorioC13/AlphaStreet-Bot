[TITLE]Hong Kong set to keep its IPO crown in 2026 on mega deals and return of US capital: UBS:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong's initial public offering (IPO) market is on track to maintain its status as the world's top fundraising venue next year, underpinned by a pipeline of mega deals and the return of US capital, according to UBS.

The Swiss investment bank expects more than HK$300 billion (US$38.5 billion) to be raised from 150 to 200 IPOs in 2026, surpassing the roughly HK$270 billion raised this year, which vaulted the city back to No 1 globally.

UBS also forecast that the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index could climb to 30,000 points next year, implying a 17.5 per cent gain from Thursday's close of 25,530.

[TITLE]Asian stocks rise on Fed rate cut optimism:
[TEXT]
Asian equities rose Friday as investors tracked a record day on Wall Street in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut.

The gains came despite renewed concerns

[TITLE]Global stocks fall ahead of Fed rate announcement:

Most markets fell on Wednesday following a tepid day on Wall Street as investors bided their time ahead of a highly anticipated Federal Reserve policy announcement later in the day.

Earnings from tech giants Oracle and Broadcom this week are also in view amid lingering worries about an artificial intelligence-fuelled bubble that caused some panic on trading floors last month.

With US central bankers expected to cut interest rates for the third straight session later Wednesday, the main focus is on their post-meeting statement, boss Jerome Powell’s news conference and the “dot plot” forecast for 2026 policy.

After November’s tech-led swoon, markets have enjoyed a healthy run in recent weeks as weak jobs figures reinforced expectations for another step lower in borrowing costs.

But that has cooled heading into the Fed gathering amid speculation it will announce a “hawkish cut” that plays down the chances of a fourth successive reduction.

Data on Tuesday showing an uptick in job openings — against estimates for a drop — further tempered expectations for a string of cuts next year, with markets now pricing in two more over the next 12 months, compared with three previously seen.

Pepperstone’s Chris Weston said the figures “catalysed a repricing of US forward Fed rate expectations”.

After a weak day in New York, where the S&P 500 and Dow dropped, Asia fared no better.

Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Seoul, Mumbai, Wellington, Jakarta and Manila all fell, though Hong Kong and Taipei edged up.

Shanghai dropped even as data showed China’s consumer prices rose last month at their fastest pace in almost two years, following an extended period of deflationary pressure in the world’s second-largest economy.

London, Paris and Frankfurt opened in the red.

Still, there is some hope that the Fed will turn more dovish next year with President Donald Trump’s top economic aide, Kevin Hassett — the frontrunner to succeed Powell in May — saying he sees plenty of room to substantially lower rates.

“While he has indicated that he would respond to the data and that he would not bow to political pressure to decide whether to cut interest rates, if he becomes the next chair, it is clear that on the current backdrop, he is comfortable with more easing than many board members, wrote National Australia Bank’s Taylor Nugent.

Aside from the Fed saga, investors are also keenly awaiting earnings from software giant Oracle and chipmaker Broadcom, which will be used to judge the outlook for the tech sector in the wake of huge investments in artificial intelligence.

Markets have been pumped higher for the past two years by the surge into all things AI, though there has been some concern of late that the hundreds of billions splashed out might not see returns as early as hoped.

“Oracle may not have a substantial weight in the S&P 500 or NAS100 to move the index on its own,” said Pepperstone’s Weston. “But what they detail on its capex intentions and future funding plans could resonate across the AI space.”

[TITLE]L&G Asset Management sees AI equity upside despite US$3 trillion debt concerns:
[TEXT]
British institutional investor L&G Asset Management is not perturbed by the rising debt issuance in the artificial intelligence sector, even as it sees opportunities in the equities of industry giants.

Credit related to the AI sector could grow between US$500 billion and US$800 billion a year and reach nearly US$3 trillion by 2030, according to Ben Bennett, head of investment strategy in Asia at the asset management firm known for its active fixed income strategies.

"We are defensive in terms of allocating to that particular sector," said Bennett, whose firm manages some US$1.5 trillion of assets.
