[TITLE]Stoke Space’s $510M round shows the future of launch belongs to defense:
[TEXT]
Stoke Space announced a massive capital raise on Wednesday that might seem, at first glance, like just another bet on the commercial launch market. The details tell a different story.

Led by billionaire Thomas Tull’s U.S. Innovative Technology (USIT), a fund that explicitly invests in technologies tied to national security, the $510 million Series D round underscores a larger shift in the launch industry. The old assumption was the winners of launch would be the companies that capture the lion’s share of commercial payloads.

While there is still demand on the commercial side from private constellation developers and for emerging use cases like in-space manufacturing or lunar payloads, the center of gravity has shifted decisively toward defense.

Just a few years ago, space startups were selling investors on visions of a rapidly expanding commercial market for weather monitoring, broadband, and remote-sensing satellites. Astra, for example, told investors in its 2021 SPAC deck that it would eventually launch hundreds of rockets per year to serve a growing small satellite market. Relativity Space pitched investors on a 3D printing revolution that would make rockets cheap enough to unlock large commercial demand.

But there are only so many commercial payloads to fly, and only one company — SpaceX — has managed to consistently launch them cheaply and reliably.

Defense, meanwhile, is on an opposite trajectory.

Geopolitical shifts, like Russia’s war against Ukraine and growing competition in space from China, have created new tailwinds. The Pentagon’s new “Golden Dome” initiative, a multibillion-dollar project aimed at creating a layered missile defense shield over the continental United States, has flooded the aerospace ecosystem with lucrative new opportunities.

[TITLE]Classrooms embraced AI - training didn’t keep up, CDT warns:
[TEXT]
Today's students are using AI for everything from tutoring to therapy to romance. A new study warns the tech may be dulling kids' social skills quietly, like booze on the brain.

A survey of teachers, parents, and students by the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit focusing on digital rights and responsible technology deployment, found that almost all teachers and students use AI with 85 percent and 86 percent reporting that they've relied on bots in the last year, respectively.

The popularity of chatbots is having a number of unintended consequences, CDT noted, including a rise in data breaches, sexual harassment and bullying enabled by AI, AI failures, and - perhaps most worrying - "troubling interactions between students and technology."

Remarkably, only half of students say they use AI for schoolwork, while even more report personal use (73 percent).

Those non-academic uses of AI raise more alarms, as 42 percent of students said they or someone they know has used AI for mental health support, companionship, or a way to "escape from real life." Nearly a fifth of students (19 percent) said they or someone they know has even formed a romantic relationship with an AI chatbot.

Prior research and experts warn that spending too much time with AI bots can have a negative effect on in-real-life (IRL) social skills - an outcome which may be more severe for young, developing minds. Teachers who responded to CDT's research appear to agree, as 71 percent said that they're worried AI weakens key academic skills such as writing and critical thinking. Again, that's been shown to be the case in a study from MIT, which found that students using AI to assist in writing papers showed less brain activity and, unsurprisingly, worse recall of their written work.

Half of the students surveyed said that they thought using AI in class made them feel less connected to their teachers. In other words, kids can see that AI is having negative effects on them, too.

"Educators and students alike see AI playing a role in the classroom and that they are simultaneously experiencing unintended consequences related to the use of this technology," CDT president and CEO Alexandra Reeve Givens said of the findings. "The potential benefits of AI in the classroom cannot distract us from the core mission of schools — ensuring every student reaches their full potential."

Teachers don't know what to do

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

A startup that reviews contracts for legal teams, another that drafts agreements directly in Word, and a third that writes demand letters for personal-injury lawyers all reported new funding rounds this week. Their shared strategy is to build products that are OpenAI-proof.

Since the first lawyer ran a chatbot query, investors and analysts have asked how startups building tools for lawyers can survive in a world where general-purpose AI is "good enough" for basic legal work. There are whispers that junior lawyers are using Claude to draft memos and law firms are buying ChatGPT licenses.

[TEXT]
20VC + SaaStr is Back!! OpenAI’s Power Move: How Sam Altman Extracted 10% of AMD, Why $5B Pre-Money Rounds Make Sense, and the New Math of Going Public

Sam Altman’s Kingmaker Strategy: Flipping the Chip Deal, The $5B Seed Round Era, and Why Companies at $300M ARR Can’t IPO

Bottom Line Up Front:

OpenAI has fundamentally restructured the power dynamics in tech infrastructure by securing warrants to purchase 10% of AMD—essentially getting equity for the privilege of buying their chips. This stands in stark contrast to their Nvidia deal, where Nvidia invested equity in OpenAI for the right to sell to them. The move reveals that having users and revenue commitments matters more than profitability in today’s AI infrastructure wars. Meanwhile, the venture landscape is experiencing unprecedented price inflation at early stages, with proven founders raising at $5B+ pre-money valuations that challenge traditional return mathematics—yet these deals may still make sense given the capital-intensive, winner-take-most nature of AI markets.

Key Takeaways

1. Users and Revenue Commitments Create More Leverage Than Profitability OpenAI’s ability to extract equity from AMD while losing billions demonstrates that controlling distribution and having scaled usage matters more than bottom-line metrics in platform wars.

2. Traditional Venture Return Math Is Being Stress-Tested When seed rounds happen at $5B+ pre-money, even successful outcomes of $50-100B barely generate traditional venture returns. But in capital-intensive infrastructure markets with proven founders, this may be the new normal.

3. Kingmaking Works Best in Capital-Intensive, Winner-Take-Most Markets You can’t kingmake in every category, but in markets where infrastructure spend creates sustainable moats, early capital concentration can create decisive advantages—though rarely monopolies.

4. The IPO Bar Has Never Been Higher With median 2025 IPOs at $931M ARR, companies at $300M growing 25% face tough choices: continue building toward scale, consolidate with peers, or accept PE valuations well below recent private marks.

5. Founders Must Take Control of Their Destiny Companies in the “muddy middle” need three things: re-incentivized founding teams with equity for growth, profitability to eliminate capital dependency, and second acts (often AI-related) to reignite growth.

6. Deregulation Creates Instant Value Shifts Polymarket went from essentially illegal to $9B valuation with NYSE investing $2B, showing how regulatory shifts can transform entire business models overnight.

7. LP Liquidity Will Increase by Necessity As successful companies stay private for 15+ years instead of 8-10, secondary markets for LP positions will become increasingly important infrastructure, even if currently inefficient and frictionful.

8. Component Suppliers Still Get Squeezed—Unless They Have Monopolies Nvidia’s 50% margins represent an aberration from typical component economics (cost plus 20%) that only exists due to architectural lock-in and monopoly position—a situation OpenAI is actively working to dilute.

The AMD Deal: A Masterclass in Leverage

OpenAI’s chip partnership with AMD represents one of the most revealing power dynamics in modern tech. The company secured warrants to purchase up to 10% of AMD at essentially a penny per share—but only if they actually buy the chips and AMD’s stock price increases. The structure is telling: AMD had to give away equity for the privilege of having OpenAI as a customer, while Nvidia got to invest in OpenAI for the same privilege.

The deal mechanics reveal sophisticated negotiation. OpenAI essentially told AMD that their business would be so transformative for the chipmaker’s stock price that they deserved to capture some of that upside. AMD’s stock jumped 30%+ on the announcement, validating the thesis. The warrants only vest if OpenAI actually purchases the chips and the stock price remains elevated—aligning incentives while still transferring substantial value.

This creates an interesting hierarchy: OpenAI has less power than Nvidia (hence letting Nvidia invest in them) but more power than AMD (hence extracting equity from AMD). The common thread? OpenAI controls the users and has credible multi-hundred-billion-dollar compute spending commitments, even while losing money hand over fist. In infrastructure wars, revenue commitments from scaled users trump profitability metrics.

Rory O’Driscoll on OpenAI’s negotiating power:

“Sam Altman understands power. He has more power than AMD. So he took 10% of their company for the privilege of selling stuff to him. He has probably less power than Nvidia. So he let them get equity for the privilege of selling him chips. It speaks to the hierarchy—there’s dominance clearly been established.”

The deal also carries echoes of historical tech power shifts. Thirty years ago, Microsoft dominated PCs with DOS and Windows, Intel supplied the chips, IBM created the ecosystem but faded, and AMD played second fiddle with ~10% market share. Today’s parallel is striking: OpenAI dominates the AI platform layer, Nvidia supplies dominant chips, Microsoft enabled the ecosystem (and may fade relative to OpenAI’s power), and AMD again serves as the necessary second source. History doesn’t repeat, but it certainly rhymes.

Microsoft: The New IBM?

The comparison to IBM’s PC era mistakes grows more uncomfortable for Microsoft with each OpenAI announcement. At Developer Day, OpenAI positioned ChatGPT as the place where users should run all their applications—accessing Figma, Canvas, Spotify, and other tools natively within the ChatGPT interface. This is precisely Microsoft’s historical role: providing the operating system layer where applications run.

Microsoft does own a significant stake in OpenAI, which is better than IBM’s complete miss on Microsoft equity three decades ago. And to their credit, the Microsoft corporate development team deserves bonuses for at least securing ownership. But owning 30% of the monster you created is cold comfort when that monster is positioning itself as your replacement. The question for Microsoft: did we just fund our own disruption?

O’Driscoll on the PC era parallels:

“What you’re seeing here is the Windows Intel game beginning again. Microsoft was the software company that took control of the PC monopoly. IBM was the old school company that set them up. AMD was the little player that got dealt in to 10% market share. Fast forward to today: OpenAI dominates, Nvidia is Intel, AMD plays the same role, and Microsoft is IBM—they set this Viper in motion.”

The Nvidia angle adds another dimension. Despite appearing to compete just days after Nvidia’s $100B investment in OpenAI, the AMD deal was carefully orchestrated. Sam Altman was explicit in praising Nvidia as the number one vendor and sequenced the announcements thoughtfully. Nvidia, for its part, can afford to be gracious—they’re making incomprehensible amounts of money with 50% operating margins on a $200B+ revenue run rate. Jensen Huang understands he needs to give up some market share to avoid regulatory scrutiny and maintain customer relationships, even while keeping 90%+ of the market.

Jason Lemkin on Nvidia’s calculated generosity:

“The only person making any money in AI is Nvidia. Even Oracle isn’t making any money. OpenAI certainly isn’t making any money. Nvidia is making so much money it’s almost incomprehensible. So I think Jensen knows he’s got to give up some of it. He can minimize his price erosion and maximize his market share without creating a huge conflagration.”

The fundamental insight: component suppliers typically get squeezed on margins (cost plus 20% is standard), but Nvidia’s 50% margins reflect a true monopoly position with architectural lock-in. That’s the primary attack surface for anyone buying chips at scale, and OpenAI is systematically working to create alternatives.

Venture Pricing Has Gone Parabolic—And Maybe That’s OK

Naveen Rao, former VP of AI at Databricks, raised $1B at $5B pre-money for his new venture. The math is brutal: accounting for dilution, investors need roughly a $50-100B outcome for 10x returns. This represents a fundamental shift from venture’s historical pricing dynamics.

The question isn’t whether this is expensive—it obviously is. The question is whether it makes sense. In hard infrastructure markets, the pool of people who can credibly solve these problems is tiny. Rao has successfully built and exited two deep tech companies, including one to Intel and Databricks. He understands the problem space, knows all the key players, and has demonstrated grit and execution. When someone with that profile walks into your office for the third time, the decision gets a lot simpler.

Lemkin on how confidence changes the game:

“If you’re Naveen at Databricks, you’ve seen a hundred billion and more going up. So 5 to 100 seems plausible. Back in the day it was really hard to see north of a billion dollar outcome for a lot of these startups. And now it’s very easy if you are a Databricks alum to see a hundred billion or more because you were just there last week.”

The confidence game has also changed. Back when Lemkin and O’Driscoll started investing, seeing a path to even $1B outcomes was difficult. Today, if you’re a Databricks alum, you just watched your company grow past $100B. The mental model shifts from “can we get to a billion?” to “we’ve seen what hundred billion looks like, and 5 to 100 seems plausible.” Founders who’ve been in the building have different risk tolerances.

The structure of these deals also matters. Companies raising at these valuations typically maintain high growth rates even at scale. If you’re doing $100M at 50x revenue multiple and then $1B at 50x multiple, the pricing is consistent—provided you can sustain the growth and the market is big enough. The risk isn’t overpaying for growth; it’s hitting a market size wall where rapid deceleration makes the large-scale valuation untenable.

O’Driscoll on venture’s forgiving nature:

“Venture is the most forgiving equity business of getting the price wrong. PE, if you get the price wrong, they’re low variance assets. If you overpay by 50%, you’re toast because they’re 3x assets. The great thing

[TITLE]Can Lutnick’s Chip-for-Chip Idea Work?:
[TEXT]
The Commerce Department’s imminent Section 232 investigation — launched in April and expected to conclude soon — may fundamentally shift how the United States acquires semiconductors. The chips America imports range from commodity devices embedded in household appliances to the expensive, high-performance AI processors that power the AI boom, designed in America by Nvidia, but manufactured in Asia.

Taiwan and Korea sit at the center of this challenge. Together, they produce the majority of semiconductors used by the United States across nearly every category. This concentration represents a major national security risk, given China’s preparations and repeated threats to use force against Taiwan and antagonism toward South Korea.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick phrased the situation thus in a recent interview: “If you can’t make your own chips, how can you defend yourself?”

Tariffs are one tool to address this exposure, designed to boost demand for chips manufactured in the United States. But they are not enough. Lutnick offers a second measure, called “chip for chip.” It would tie tariff waivers directly to verifiable domestic production milestones, incentivizing U.S. firms to act more in the national interest.

However, Lutnick’s ‘chip-for-chip’ framework could succeed only if Washington pairs it with enforceable production benchmarks and demand-side incentives. Otherwise, it risks becoming another half-measure in America’s decades-long struggle to rebuild semiconductor sovereignty.

From Offshore Expansion to “Dragon” Dependence

America is in this bind partly because of deliberate state engineering, dating back to the 1960s, that created the export-led “East Asian Miracle.” Favorable government subsidies and credit, structural reforms such as free trade zones, and pro-growth regulations fostered the most successful export-oriented firms in the “dragons” (aka: “tigers”): Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and a prominent “little dragon,” Malaysia.

As the “East Asian Miracle” developed, American chipmakers saw opportunities to lower costs and expand markets. Intel, founded in 1968, kept its leading-edge semiconductor fabrication technology at home but opened an assembly and test plant in Penang, Malaysia, in 1972. That “back-end” factory, which used less advanced technology to package finished chips, was followed by others in the Philippines, Costa Rica, China, and Vietnam. Meanwhile, Intel experimented in taking the higher tech “front-end” fabrication lines overseas: Fab 8 in Jerusalem (1985) and Fab 14 in Ireland (1990). These moves sought global efficiency while retaining the most advanced technology and processes at American fabs located in Arizona, Ohio, Oregon, and New Mexico.

As the “Miracle” evolved into the 21st century, it was exemplified in the electronics sector by Taiwan’s TSMC and Korea’s Samsung. Taiwan’s policies tightly regulate TSMC’s global moves while rewarding domestic investment, and South Korea used its own policies to foster and sustain Samsung’s scale as one of the country’s chaebol, the family-controlled conglomerates with close ties to the government that were central to building the nation’s modern economy.

Enter the Bigger Dragon

But China, as ever, was different. While foreign companies never admitted to trading technology for market access, Beijing’s implicit demands loomed large. Foreign-established fabs and accompanying supply chains sprouted up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain: Motorola MOS 17 (Tianjin, 2000, later sold to China’s SMIC), Texas Instruments (Chengdu, 2010), Intel Fab 68 and 68A (Dalian, 2010 and 2018), UMC (Xiamen, 2016), TSMC Fab 16 (Nanjing, 2018), and Samsung’s Xi’an NAND Fab (2020).

The Few, the Fabless, and the Fab-Lite

Intel is now a rare bird — the only major American “integrated device manufacturer” left standing, meaning that they run a fully vertical operation, from chip design, to fabrication, to assembly and test, to marketing and sales. Soaring front-end manufacturing costs prompted other companies to exit the manufacturing space. For example, AMD spun off its factories in 2008 and 2009, creating Global Foundries. Six years later, IBM paid Global Foundries $1.5 billion to take over its fabs. AMD and IBM can now be characterized as “fabless.” Texas Instruments tried going “fab-lite” but decided to retain and expand its fabs. It is the other rare bird alongside Intel.

Meanwhile, companies that had always been fabless thrived. Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Broadcom focused on design, sales, and marketing, while relying on TSMC and Samsung to manufacture their products. The result: The world’s most advanced semiconductor capacity, along with much of the mature-node production, became concentrated in Taiwan and South Korea.

Today, TSMC alone produces roughly 90 percent of the world’s most advanced chips. Taiwan does not wish to give up that bounty or the silicon shield protection it perceives to come with it. As a result, the island presents a stark single point of failure. A Taiwan Strait crisis, natural disaster, or geopolitical rupture could shut down supply virtually overnight, crippling American and allied manufacturing in everything from automobiles to defense systems.

Washington’s Response

Both the Trump and Biden administrations recognized the danger. They reframed semiconductor manufacturing as a matter of national security, dangling incentives for TSMC and Samsung to establish advanced fabs on U.S. soil.

But progress has been uneven. Though TSMC is building facilities in Arizona, and Samsung has broken ground in Texas, both companies and their governments remain reluctant to export bleeding-edge processes to America. TSMC’s 3-4 nanometer lines are scheduled for Arizona, but the chip giant is prohibited by Taiwan law from producing that node abroad. Samsung has also been conservative, keeping its 2-nanometer production in South Korea.

The Demand Problem

Building a fab is only half the battle — keeping it full of orders is the harder part. The challenge is particularly acute when U.S. fabs will initially produce at 3-4 nm, one or two generations behind Taiwan’s best. Tech giants like Apple, Dell, and HP will likely have no incentive to pay more for chips produced domestically if cheaper or more advanced versions are available abroad.

Tariffs are one lever to address this imbalance. However, as currently structured, they are blunt instruments, punishing some firms while sparing others and creating loopholes that clever corporate lawyers can exploit. Investors may see risk without certainty. Companies could see costs without clear incentives.

Administering “Chip for Chip”

The premise of “chip for chip” is simple. Tie tariff relief directly to verifiable domestic production milestones. For every unit of certified U.S. fab capacity under construction or ramp-up, a company would be allowed to import an equivalent unit tariff-free. Once that U.S. fab reached volume production, the waiver would expire.

This promises to create three immediate effects. First, it raises the likelihood that buyers will be there once U.S. capacity comes online, reassuring investors and mitigating risk for new construction. Second, it would compel global firms like Apple and Dell to begin shifting their sourcing strategies, knowing their tariff relief depends on supporting U.S. fabs. Third, it would close loopholes, replacing open-ended waivers with measurable milestones backed by retroactive duties and “claw-back” penalties if companies fail to meet agreements. Chipmakers would need to match every imported chip with one made in the United States. If they fail to do so over time, penalties in the form of import duties — potentially reaching 100 percent — would be imposed.

There Will Be Pushback

A chip-for-chip framework will not be universally welcomed, and Lutnick’s plan may require tweaking to make it acceptable to major stakeholders. Multinationals that have long optimized their supply chains for cost and convenience will resist reallocating production at a higher expense. End-users operating on thin margins, like auto and electronics firms, may pass costs along to disenchanted consumers. If tariffs raise the cost of importing advanced chips, America’s allies may complain to the World Trade Organization that the United States is distorting markets. And Taiwan has not agreed to Lutnick’s proposal that the two sides aspire to a “50-50” solution, with half of advanced semiconductors made in the United States, and half in Taiwan.

Moreover, the complex semiconductor supply chain that services a fab’s equipment, supplies chemicals, and handles sensitive cargo would have to react to the chip-for-ship scenario without significant disruption through the construction, ramp-up, and full production stages. On the positive side, many key semiconductor equipment, chemical, and clean room suppliers are U.S.-based, and the “pull” of supplier response to manufacturer demand has always been strong. On the other hand, it is not frictionless or instantaneous, and is no longer U.S.-centric. Technical and other barriers are inevitable in the wholesale shift envisioned under chip-for-chip.

Meanwhile, Lutnick is sticking to his 50-50 goal, and Washington has legal cover: national security exceptions to trade rules. The precedent exists in other strategic sectors, and semiconductors are arguably today’s most strategic commodity. More importantly, the risks of inaction outweigh the costs of friction. If supply from Taiwan is disrupted, no amount of World Trade Organization litigation will help Detroit restart auto production or the Pentagon procure advanced weapons. And Beijing knows it.

The Strategic Stakes

China is not standing still. Beijing is pouring tens of billions into the electronics industry in general and new fabs in particular, subsidizing firms like SMIC, and tightening controls over critical materials such as gallium and germanium. Its long-term goal is technological self-sufficiency, freeing itself from U.S. export controls while increasing global leverage.

The U.S. semiconductor industry stands at an inflection point. Though propelled forward by developments in AI, decades of offshoring and complacency have left the world’s most advanced production clustered in Taiwan and South Korea — right next to the country that most threatens American security.

The CHIPS Act was a start. Tariffs are a blunt but necessary step. But the missing pieces are how the economic pain will be borne across the supply chain when major changes are in progress, and the details

[TITLE]Employees regularly paste company secrets into ChatGPT:
[TEXT]
Employees could be opening up to OpenAI in ways that put sensitive data at risk. According to a study by security biz LayerX, a large number of corporate users paste Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Payment Card Industry (PCI) numbers right into ChatGPT, even if they're using the bot without permission.

In its Enterprise AI and SaaS Data Security Report 2025, LayerX blames the growing, largely uncontrolled usage of generative AI tools for exfiltrating personal and payment data from enterprise environments.

With 45 percent of enterprise employees now using generative AI tools, 77 percent of these AI users have been copying and pasting data into their chatbot queries, the LayerX study says. A bit more than a fifth (22 percent) of these copy and paste operations include PII/PCI.

"With 82 percent of pastes coming from unmanaged personal accounts, enterprises have little to no visibility into what data is being shared, creating a massive blind spot for data leakage and compliance risks," the report says.

The State of AI Competition in Advanced Economies

Alex Haag

Global competition in artificial intelligence (AI) has intensified in recent years. Some assessments emphasize US exceptionalism, while others argue that China is eroding US dominance. By contrast, the progress of other advanced foreign economies (AFEs) receives far less attention. Existing cross-country comparisons rely largely on composite indices that, while useful as benchmarks, are subject to weighting and aggregation biases that may obscure important dimensions of AI capacity. A clearer understanding of cross-country AI capabilities can help better contextualize global AI competition.

This note brings together international comparisons on key metrics to assess countries' relative preparedness and performance in AI. The analysis shows that the United States retains important advantages in infrastructure (with the exception of electricity-related infrastructure), compute capacity, and investment conditions. AFEs face greater challenges in scaling compute resources and attracting investment. China has achieved rapid gains in research output and adoption, though its position in enabling infrastructure is less clear.1 Taken together, these comparisons suggest a global landscape in which, despite increased competition in research and applied domains, US strengths in core AI enablers remain durable.

1. Cross-Country Comparisons Using AI Indices

We start with several widely cited indices of AI capacity and preparedness to provide an initial view of the global landscape (Table 1).2 The United States consistently ranks at or near the top, with the United Kingdom close behind and Italy lowest among G7 members. China's ranking varies from just below the United States on some indices (e.g., GII, Stanford) to significantly lower than most AFEs on others (e.g., IMF, Oxford).

These indices are a useful starting point but have limitations. Methodological approaches, such as indicator selection, weighting, and aggregation, can potentially obscure core metrics of AI performance and penalize diverse national AI strategies (Greco et al., 2018). Still, these indices highlight key areas for comparison: physical and digital infrastructure, investment and firm dynamics, and adoption across the economy. The rest of this note delves deeper into these dimensions, focusing on key metrics to provide a clearer picture of global AI capabilities.

2. Physical and Digital Infrastructure

Physical and digital infrastructure form the foundation for AI adoption. Physical infrastructure includes data centers and high-performance computing hardware, supported by reliable energy, telecommunications, and manufacturing capabilities. Digital infrastructure adds cloud computing, data access, and other tools for widespread model deployment.

As shown in Figure 1, the United States made early, outsized investments in computing, software, and databases, with annual real investment in these areas growing over tenfold from 1995 to 2021, far outpacing AFE peers, whose growth was two- to fourfold. These early investments provided the computing power, networks, and hardware that positioned the United States to lead early in AI-related innovation and diffusion.

Figure 1. Investment in AI-Related Physical and Digital Infrastructure

Compute, the processing power and network resources used for AI training and inference, is the clearest measure of a country's ability to develop and deploy AI. Data centers, processors (CPUs and GPUs), and broader computing systems support the growing demands of modern AI workloads.

Data center construction in the United States surged over the past decade.3 The United States hosted an estimated 4,049 data centers as of 2024, far more than the EU (~2,250), the UK (484), and China (379).4 In 2024 alone, the United States added 5.8 gigawatts (GW) of data center capacity, compared with 1.6 GW in the EU and 0.2 GW in the United Kingdom.5 On a per capita basis, the US server base stands at 99.9 per 1,000 people, far surpassing other advanced foreign economies and China (Figure 2A).

Figure 2. Compute Capacity Indicators

High-end computing, particularly AI supercomputers, is particularly critical for large-scale model training and more recently inference-based tasks. The United States dominates cumulative AI supercomputer capacity, controlling an estimated 74 percent of global high-end AI compute, while China holds 14 percent and the EU 4.8 percent (Figure 2B).

3. Energy Infrastructure Risks

The rapid growth of AI workloads is driving a substantial increase in data center power demand, highlighting the importance of electricity generation and transmission capacity in supporting AI infrastructure. RAND estimates that AI could require 117 GW globally by 2028, while the IEA projects that global electricity consumption from data centers will more than double by 2030, with the United States and China accounting for 80 percent of the growth.6

China outstripped the United States in electricity generation capacity more than a decade ago (Figure 3), with roughly 3,200 GW of installed capacity compared with 1,293 GW in the United States and 1,125 GW in the EU. China added 429 GW of net electric generation capacity in 2024 alone, over 15 times the net capacity added by the United States (Chan et al., 2025).

Figure 3. Installed Electric Generation Capacity

It remains unclear whether US power generation and transmission capacity will keep pace with rapidly growing data center demand. Installed data centers currently account for

[TITLE]HavocAI raises $85M to sell autonomous boats to the U.S. military:
[TEXT]
In the aftermath of the passage of President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill—which set aside billions of dollars for the rapid prototyping and integration of artificial intelligence systems for the Defense Department—startups are in a mad dash to raise capital so they can compete for the funding.

One of those companies is HavocAI, a Rhode Island–based startup that demonstrated its autonomous vessels just last summer and is already selling boats to the U.S. military and its allies. HavocAI closed an $85 million venture funding round at the end of September so that it can be prepared to manufacture thousands of autonomous boats and incorporate its autonomous tech stack into new types of vessels at a moment’s notice, its cofounder and CEO, Paul Lwin, tells Fortune.

“When the reconciliation bill came out, all of our existing investors said: ‘Hey, don’t go and try to raise money and take six months doing it.’ They said: ‘You need to run fast,’” Lwin notes.

HavocAI put together the new round within three months, Lwin said—bolstering the startup’s total funding raised to nearly $100 million since the company launched just last January. This most recent round—which included venture capital firms B Capital, Up.Partners, Scout Ventures, and Outlander Ventures; the CIA’s venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel; defense behemoth and strategic partner Lockheed Martin; and Taiwan’s public and private venture capital fund, Taiwania Capital—will position the startup to compete for a piece of the more than $3.3 billion that the new legislation set aside specifically for the development of medium and small unmanned surface vessels. Lwin declined to provide a valuation.

HavocAI’s strategy is all

The new Gemini Enterprise brings together a company’s data, tools and people; enables employees to chat with the company’s documents, data and applications; and provides pre-built AI agents as well as the tools to build and deploy agents, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a Thursday (Oct. 9) blog post.

“Gemini Enterprise is an AI-powered conversational platform designed to bring the full power of Google AI to every employee for every workflow,” Pichai said in the post.

Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said in a Thursday blog post that Gemini Enterprise combines Google’s Gemini models, a no-code workbench for analyzing information and orchestrating agents, pre-built agents that can deliver value from day one, the ability to securely connect to a company’s data in different business applications, a centralized governance framework for managing all these capabilities and access to an ecosystem of more than 100,000 Google partners.

“This isn’t just about making one task easier,” Kurian said in the post. “It’s about making entire workflows smarter by searching and finding information from all your enterprise documents, applications, email and chat systems, and automating processes using agents with any of your enterprise applications.”

To help organizations train their workforce to use these tools, Google introduced a platform called Google Skills that offers training from across Google and offers it for free, together with a new educational program called Gemini Enterprise Agent Ready (GEAR) that trains developers to build and deploy agents, according to the post.

The company also announced a new team of Google AI engineers called Delta that can help organizations with their most complex challenges, per the report.

PYMNTS Intelligence reported Oct. 1 that among enterprises, 26.7% of chief financial officers expect to raise generative AI budgets in the next 12 months.

That figure is down from 53.3% a year ago, a change that the report attributed to enterprises shifting from experimental adoption to more disciplined deployment.

PYMNTS reported in April that the most effective enterprise AI implementations typically address specific business problems rather than pursuing technology for its own sake.

Google is also promoting the use of AI to small businesses. On Wednesday (Oct. 8), the company’s philanthropic initiative Google.org said it is providing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with $5 million in funding to develop and launch a national AI training program for small businesses.
