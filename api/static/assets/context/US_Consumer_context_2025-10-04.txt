[TITLE]Analyst Explains Why Amazon.com (AMZN) Stock Can Move ‘Quite a Bit Higher’ Soon:
[TEXT]
We recently published 10 Stocks to Watch as Investors Scramble to Pour Money into AI Trade. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks that caught analysts' attention.

Andrew Arons from Synergy Advisory said in a recent program on Schwab Network that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares have not performed well compared to its peers, but they can move higher soon.

“Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), you know, they do some cost cutting when they have to and if they have to do that, it usually reflects in the earnings moving forward. And there’s just so many areas logistically they’re doing very very well with the consumer. They’re trying to be really really close to where everyone lives and being able to get goods to people right away, which is what people want. And I just think that they’re going to continue to outperform. I mean, you could see Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) not doing as well as some of these other companies so far this year, but all of a sudden we see a quarter and Amazon does really well and the stock then moves up quite a bit higher, which I think we’re going to probably see here as we go and approach the fourth quarter this year.”

Mairs & Power Balanced Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:

“The Fund also started a new position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the second quarter, where the company is well positioned to continue capturing market share in retail while also growing its market leading cloud business. The Fund took advantage of weakness in the stock during April to start the position as tariff news and a precipitous market decline provided an opportunity to build a position.”

While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an extremely cheap AI stock that is also a major beneficiary of Trump tariffs and onshoring, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Completes Merger With a Partnership Comprised of Worldwide Golf and Capitol Hill Group:
[TEXT]
EL SEGUNDO, Calif. and BETHESDA, Md., Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFV) (“Big 5”), a leading sporting goods retailer, today announced the successful completion of its previously announced merger with a partnership comprised of Worldwide Golf and Capitol Hill Group. Upon the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the approval of Big 5’s stockholders, the merger was consummated, with Big 5 surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of such partnership.

Pursuant to the definitive merger agreement and subject to the terms and satisfaction of its conditions, Big 5 stockholders are entitled to receive $1.45 per share in cash. This represents a premium of approximately 36% to Big 5’s 60-day volume weighted average trading price prior to the transaction’s announcement.

“This transaction marks an exciting new chapter for Big 5 that allows the company to carry on its legacy of serving customers with quality sporting goods at an exceptional value while maximizing return for our stockholders,” said Steven G. Miller, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Big 5. “I want to thank our dedicated employees, loyal customers and valued vendors who continue to support Big 5 in each of the communities we serve.”

Worldwide Golf is a leading nationwide retailer of golf equipment, apparel, shoes and accessories. Capitol Hill Group is a Bethesda, Maryland-based private investment firm with diversified holdings, including retail. This acquisition combines Capitol Hill Group’s financial resources with Worldwide Golf’s specialty retail expertise to provide Big 5 with the long-term capital and strategic support to re-energize growth and further build on its competitive position in the sporting goods retail sector across its western United States footprint.

“Big 5 has a long and rich retail heritage in the Western United States,” said Ted Shin, CEO of Worldwide Golf and Capitol Hill Group. “We believe there is a great opportunity to build off of that legacy and enhance the enjoyment in sports for our current and future customers and communities. We look forward to unlocking future growth opportunities for Big 5 for the benefit of our customers, vendor partners and employees.”

In connection with the closing of the merger, Big 5’s common stock will no longer be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, and Big 5 will cease to be a publicly traded company. Big 5 will remain an independent company within the Capitol Hill Group portfolio and leverage the combined resources of the partnership.

Moelis & Company LLC served as financial advisor and Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal advisor to Big 5. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Holland & Knight LLP, and Sklar Kirsh LLP served as legal advisors to Capitol Hill Group and its related entities.
