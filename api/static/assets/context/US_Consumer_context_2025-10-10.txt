[TITLE]Billionaire Jon Stryker Buys Three 445 Fifth Avenue Retail Condos for $22M – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Billionaire philanthropist Jon Stryker, an heir to the Stryker Corporation medical tech company fortune, now owns the entire commercial portion of a Fifth Avenue building following a recent deal.

Stryker, through the entity 445 5th Retail, has purchased three retail condominium units at 445 Fifth Avenue from Torchlight Investors, which used the entity DOF VI 445 Fifth, for $21.6 million, according to city records made public Friday.

Mark O’Donnell, who has done nonprofit work with Stryker in the past, signed the deal for the buyer, while Gianluca Montalti, head of asset management at Torchlight, signed for the seller, records show.

It’s unclear who brokered the deal. Spokespeople for the Arcus Foundation — Stryker’s international grantmaking organization — Torchlight, and Ripco Real Estate, which is marketing the building’s retail space, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Torchlight originally acquired the retail units at 445 Fifth Avenue for $40 million in September 2023, property records show. Current tenants of the property’s retail units include design agency Brickworks Design Studio in 16,171 square feet as well as cafe Toastique.

With the latest deal, Stryker now owns all 11 commercial condo units in the 33-story tower overlooking Bryant Park, which also has 174 residential units on the top floors, according to StreetEasy.

The billionaire began buying in the building in 2019 on floors eight and nine for

[TITLE]Georgia Tech reportedly inks massive nine-figure apparel deal to ditch Adidas:
[TEXT]
Georgia Tech is going to have a new apparel partner and it comes with a big time price tag. According to ESPN’s Pete Thamel, the Yellow Jackets have agreed to a 10-year deal with Under Armour to become the school’s official apparel provider, starting July 1, 2026.

Source: Georgia Tech and Under Armour have agreed to a new 10-year deal for UA to become the official apparel provider, effective July 1 of 2026. The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that GTech is getting from current adidas deal. pic.twitter.com/MeZfbDkuTU — Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) October 3, 2025

The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that Georgia Tech is getting from the current Adidas deal, according to Thamel and Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Chad Bishop.

"Tech was receiving an average of $3.11 million annually from Adidas in cash and product over its original six-year contract that was signed in 2018," Bishop said. This figure puts the reported value of Georgia Tech's new deal with UA at $186.6 million over ten years.

Georgia Tech’s previous deal with Adidas was set to expire in the summer of 2024, but the two sides put together a new two-year deal. However, the short-term fix wasn't enough to keep the Yellow Jackets from looking elsewhere.

“We’re thrilled to partner with Under Armour, an organization that shares our commitment to excellence, innovation, amplifying the Georgia Tech brand across the globe and enhancing the student-athlete experience, including through innovative NIL opportunities," GT's Vice president and director of athletics Ryan Alpert said in a statement. "Our partnership with Under Armour will play a big part in Georgia Tech continuing to move forward in the new era of collegiate athletics and reaching our ambitions of competing for championships at the highest levels of collegiate athletics.”

For Under Armour, this deal puts the outfitter back on the map in the new era of college athletics.

“As we mark our 30th anniversary next year, we’re thrilled to team back up with Georgia Tech, our first collegiate client, to experience our commitment to enhancing athletic performance." Under Armour's VP of the Team Division Craig Cummings said in a statement. "We are energized by the momentum in Atlanta and look forward to amplifying our presence in the community through meaningful activations and shared purpose.”

Georgia Tech had worn Russell Athletic for over two decades before switching to Under Armour in 1996. They migrated to Adidas and now the two brands will be reunited after thirty years apart.

The Yellow Jacket's first time officially back in the UA branding will come against Deion Sanders and Colorado in Atlanta on Sept. 5, 2026.

[TITLE]Costco Wholesale Corporation Reports September Sales Results:
[TEXT]
ISSAQUAH, Wash., Oct. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: COST) today reported net sales of $26.58 billion for the retail month of September, the five weeks ended October 5, 2025, an increase of 8.0 percent from $24.62 billion last year.

Comparable sales were as follows:

5 Weeks U.S. 5.1% Canada 6.3% Other International 8.5% Total Company 5.7%

Digitally-Enabled 26.1%

Starting with this sales release, we changed our Ecommerce comparable sales metric to “digitally-enabled” comparable sales. This metric now includes all sales delivered to members that are initiated through a digital device, whether fulfilled through a warehouse or a distribution center, and Costco-Travel.

Comparable sales excluding the impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange were as follows:

5 Weeks U.S. 5.0% Canada 9.3% Other International 7.5% Total Company 6.0%

Digitally-Enabled 26.3%

Last year’s total and comparable sales benefitted by approximately two percent in the U.S. and one and one-half percent worldwide as a result of the increased sales due to abnormal consumer activity associated with Hurricane Helene and port strikes.

Additional discussion of these results is available in a pre-recorded message. It can be accessed by visiting investor.costco.com (click on “Events & Presentations”). This message will be available through 4:00 p.m. (PT) on Wednesday, October 15, 2025.

Costco currently operates 914 warehouses, including 629 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 110 in Canada, 42 in Mexico, 37 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 20 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, seven in China, five in Spain, two in France, two in Sweden, and one each in Iceland, and New Zealand.

[TITLE]Walmart's OnePay boosts crypto; Lloyds' tech saves cash:
[TEXT]
Key insight : Walmart's OnePay is expanding into digital assets.

: Walmart's OnePay is expanding into digital assets. Look forward : A number of banks and other firms are looking to tap into demand for cryptocurrency.

: A number of banks and other firms are looking to tap into demand for cryptocurrency. What's at stake: Gaining a share of a market that's still developing.

OnePay, the Walmart-backed fintech, is planning to offer cryptocurrency trading and custody services on its app, CNBC reported , citing unnamed sources.

OnePay is working with Zerohash, a business-to-business-to-consumer fintech that specializes in providing infrastructure for crypto, stablecoins and other digital assets.

The move comes as OnePay looks to broaden its offerings and get more users on its platform. Walmart's OnePay was designed to be separate from the retailer with a focus on providing banking services to underbanked populations, an area that overlaps with segments of Walmart's retail clientele. Last month, it started offering phone plans , and in June it selected Synchrony Financial as its credit card issuer. —Joey Pizzolato

[TITLE]Prime Day’s Not Over Yet: 69+ Best Deals Still Live:
[TEXT]
Prime Big Deal Days 2025 has come and gone, but if you forgot to buy something during the Prime member-exclusive sale, you might be in luck. A handful of brands are still offering discounts across tech, beauty, kitchen, household essentials and more — however, these savings can end at any time, so if you see something you're interested in, don't wait another second.

Below, I rounded up the best October Prime Day deals still live. Each one I recommend is highly rated and 20% off or more, and most products are at their event-day price (their lowest price in at least three months or lowest price ever, according to CamelCamelCamel). That said, a few items currently cost slightly more than their event-day price ($5 maximum, and I noted which ones below). We still include them because they meet our other criteria, we think they're worth knowing about.
