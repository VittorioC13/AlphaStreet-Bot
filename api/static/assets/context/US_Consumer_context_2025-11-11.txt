[TITLE]Lendlease REIT to Acquire 70% of PLQ Mall to Expand its Suburban Retail Portfolio in Singapore:
[TEXT]
Key Highlights

Following the acquisition, Singapore will represent 89% of the portfolio – reinforcing geographic focus while enhancing income stability and portfolio resilience.

Prime location with excellent connectivity to support long-term income growth.

Agreed property value of S$885.0 million represents approximately 2.1% discount on its latest valuation.

Post acquisition, gearing will be 38.3% on a pro forma basis.

Distribution per unit to increase by 2.5% on a pro forma basis.

SINGAPORE, Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lendlease Global Commercial Trust Management Pte. Ltd. (the “Manager”), the manager of Lendlease Global Commercial REIT (“Lendlease REIT”), is pleased to announce that DBS Trustee Limited, in its capacity as trustee of Lendlease REIT (the “Trustee”), has entered into (a) a unit purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party (the “Seller”) to acquire 70% indirect interest in PLQ Mall (the “Property”) via the acquisition of 70% of the total issued units in PLQM Trust, which holds an approximately 100% interest in the Property; and (b) a share purchase agreement with the Seller to acquire a 70% interest in the trustee-manager of PLQM Trust.

Upon completion of the transaction, Lendlease REIT’s total asset value will increase to S$3.9 billion (post completion of the Jem Office Divestment by 12 November 2025) with Singapore representing 89% of the portfolio. This reflects the continued execution of Lendlease REIT’s Singapore-focused growth strategy to acquire higher-yielding assets with long-term income growth potential.

The enlarged portfolio will be well-positioned to deliver consistent growth, with the proportion of essential services expected to rise from approximately 57.7% to 59.9% of the retail gross rental income. Trade sector mix by gross rental income will be more balanced, reducing tenant concentration risks. In addition, the suburban retail component will expand to 62.7%, supported by consumer demand for essential services and the stable, recurring income generated by well-located suburban malls.

Mr. Guy Cawthra, Chief Executive Officer of the Manager, said, “This acquisition marks a strategic step forward in strengthening our resilient suburban retail portfolio in Singapore. It offers immediate DPU accretion for Lendlease REIT’s unitholders, underpinned by an attractive entry valuation. With gearing expected to be approximately 38%, we continue to deliver sustainable growth while maintaining financial prudence.”

Agreed Property Value and Net Property Income (“NPI”) Yield

The agreed property value was arrived on a willing-buyer and willing-seller basis after taking into account the appraised value by Knight Frank Pte Ltd as at 31 October 2025. The agreed property value of S$885.0 million is approximately 2.1% or S$19.0 million discount to the appraised value. The agreed property value is determined on the basis of a 100% interest in the Property. The NPI yield is 4.5%1 based on the agreed property value.

Method of Financing

The total cost of the acquisition is approximately S$246.8 million, comprising (a) S$234.3 million for the sale of units consideration and sale of shares consideration; (b) the acquisition fee payable to the Manager of approximately S$6.2 million; and (c) other acquisition-related fees and expenses of approximately S$6.3 million.

The Manager intends to finance the total cost of the acquisition from the proceeds of the private placement offering of no less than S$270.0 million2 launched on 5 November 2025.

The transaction is not subject to unitholders’ approval under Rule 1014(3) of the Listing Manual.

[TITLE]France Targets Shein Over Illegal Sales - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
France Urges EU Investigation into Shein Over Illegal Product Sales

France is pushing the European Union to launch a formal investigation into Shein, the Chinese online fast-fashion retailer, following accusations of selling illegal products. The allegations include the sale of items such as child-like sex toys and prohibited weapons on the platform. This move highlights concerns surrounding online marketplaces and the potential for the distribution of unsafe products.

According to reports, France is initiating a process that could lead to a ban on Shein for offering these illegal items. In response, Shein has stated that it has shut down its marketplace in France to review third-party vendors and has globally ceased the sale of sex toys.

French Economy Minister Roland Lescure and Digital Minister Marina Ferrari have addressed the issue in a letter to EU tech chief, highlighting the “serious violations” within France and expressing concerns about similar risks related to the platform in other European countries. They urge the European Commission to launch an immediate investigation to determine how such illegal products ended up for sale on the platform. The letter emphasizes the need for greater consumer safety and scrutiny of e-commerce platforms.

The European Commission has acknowledged receipt of the letter and has stated that it will assess the situation before deciding on the next steps. This action comes as Shein falls under the European Union’s Digital Services Act as a “very large online platform,” granting the Commission the authority to investigate potential violations of the law. This situation underscores the ongoing debate about online safety, product compliance, and the responsibilities of large online retailers in ensuring the legality and safety of the goods they offer. The investigation could have significant implications for Shein’s operations in Europe and may influence future regulations concerning online sales and product safety.

[TITLE]E-commerce apps turn to content to amp up sales and influencers are loving it:
[TEXT]
Online retail platforms such as Amazon, Myntra, Meesho, and Nykaa, are increasingly becoming the go-to destination for influencers, nudging at the dominance of social media giants like Instagram and YouTube.

The e-commerce platforms no longer only collaborate with publishers on affiliate programs as they have done for long, they now enable influencers and everyday users to create, publish, and livestream directly on their apps.

This shift has grown such affiliate marketing activity on e-commerce platforms multifold in the last one year, according to online retail company executives. (Affiliate marketing refers to influencers or publishers including product links or recommendations in their videos or content and earning a commission on it.)

Fashion platform Myntra’s chief marketing officer Sunder Balasubramanian said that the videos on the platform have grown 240% in

There’s no sign of a year-end slowdown in the Indian passenger vehicle market . At least 15 new models — including 13 SUVs — will debut between November and March as carmakers race to capitalise on the festive-season boom and record October sales.Mass and luxury carmakers alike are doubling down on high margin models and keeping production lines running at full tilt to sustain the momentum, industry executives said. “We are prioritising high-margin SUV production,” said an executive at a leading automaker who requested not to be identified.Sport-utility vehicles today account for more than half of all passenger vehicle sales in India. Small cars are making a comeback after the recent goods and services tax (GST) cuts, but the next five months will still see just one sedan — the Mercedes CLA — and one crossover — the Fronx hybrid — entering the market.Among the most anticipated launches this season is Tata Motors ’ revived Sierra, a mid-size SUV, making a comeback after 22 years. Teasers of the model have already sparked nostalgia and excitement ahead of its debut later this month. Mahindra is gearing up to unveil its first ‘born electric’ seven-seater SUV, while Maruti Suzuki — fresh off flagging off the e-Vitara exports to Europe — is preparing for its India launch next month. Foreign players are equally charged.Renault’s new-generation Duster and Nissan’s Tekton are set to add muscle to an already crowded SUV calendar. In the luxury end of the market, BMW and Volvo are set to drive in new premium electric SUVs. Traditionally, after the Diwali season, automakers focus on clearing year-end stock and avoid major launches before the model-year reset.But this time, companies are sticking to aggressive timelines as a combination of GST relief, easier financing, and pent-up festive demand have kept dealerships running at full throttle, industry insiders said.“To cash in on the boom, many are sticking to schedules not seen earlier,” a senior official at a major car company said on condition of anonymity. That’s not surprising considering popular models such as the Maruti Brezza, Tata Nexon, and Mahindra XUV700 have waiting periods of 20-24 weeks, meaning a buyer may have to wait for up to six months for the delivery of her new vehicle.It reflects the strength of consumer appetite as well as the limits of production capacity, according to Ravi Bhatia, president of Jato Dynamics, a data and analytics firm focused on the auto industry. In October, passenger vehicle sales in India grew 11.4% yearon-year to around 557,000 units, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (Fada).Looking ahead, 2026 will test the industry’s ability to balance growth with new challenges, industry experts said. Automakers will need to navigate the E20 ethanol rollout, CAFE 2027 efficiency norms, and a rapidly accelerating shift toward electrification. “Production agility , not just policy windfalls, will decide who sustains growth,” Bhatia said.

[TITLE]Shoe Firms Get a China Tariff Break — But Trade Policy Still Unclear:
[TEXT]
firms got a holiday gift from the Trump administration in the form of a one-year hold on any additional China tariffs on imports to the U.S.

An executive order on the White House site disclosed further details on the modification of reciprocal tariff rates in the new trade arrangement between the U.S. and China. Much of the talk when the arrangement was first disclosed on Oct. 30 was centered on a one-year time period in connection with rare earth minerals. The presidential action in the new order clarified that the U.S. will suspend “heightened reciprocal tariffs” on imports from China through 12:01 a.m ET on Nov. 10, 2026.

The caveat in the executive order is that the U.S. will monitor conditions to ensure that China adheres to the trade terms, and if not, Trump “may modify this order as necessary.”

Before the new trade arrangement, the tariff threat on China imports was 100 percent starting on Nov. 1. The new trade deal has tariffs on China shoe imports in the range of 20 percent to 27 percent, depending on classification and not including existing duties. The new rate range is better than what it was as it is both lower than the temporary reciprocal rate of 30 percent and even lower than the original threat of a 55 percent duty rate.

For the industry, the new trade deal does present some form of a guarantee for most of 2026.

“We welcome the pause on further tariff escalation, and are optimistic it will bring some much-needed clarity for companies planning for 2026 and beyond,” said Steve Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA). “Still, true long-term stability demands durable trade agreements and renewed commitments with all of our key sourcing partners, especially while the fashion industry continues to bear disproportionately high MFN (Most Favored Nation) and Section 301 tariffs.”

“In spite of the fact that tariffs on footwear from China remain elevated — even with the reduction in the fentanyl tariff — the White House has provided some much-needed sourcing certainty with China for the foreseeable future. I’ve spoken to dozens of shoe companies since last week, and all have expressed relief that we might actually experience some policy stability out of Washington for at least the next year,” Matt Priest, president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA), said.

Priest noted that for footwear, the U.S. has now established equal tariff rates across “most of the countries we source from in Asia. All things considered, our members will be able to determine their best sourcing strategies based more on normal market realities and less on shifting or inconsistent tariff policy.”

Tariff uncertainties in 2025 presented one big operating headache for shoe companies. And the complexities of footwear production and working with upstream suppliers meant that for some firms it was just easier to stay put.

“The reduction in China tariffs to 20 percent is certainly better than 30 percent, but still too high. We pay the tariffs at the time our shoes are imported and the now 20 percent tariffs put considerable pressure on our cash flow,” said Rick Muskat, president and chief operating officer of Deer Stags. “In addition, we have not been able to establish sufficient price increases with our retail partners to offset the hit to our margins. So, while better…still terrible.”

Muskat said that currently, with the tariff regime in place, “we see no reason to move production from China, which isn’t easy to do.”

For some who moved out of China, moving back could be an option in some instances, said one footwear expert, citing extra costs and timing due to logistics and requirements to avoid transhipping penalties for production outside of China.

Steve Madden Ltd. is one example of a firm that moved a large portion of production out of China in anticipation of higher rates. But CEO Edward Rosenfeld told Wall Street analysts in August that the company returned some work for fall back to China after considering the ability to ensure on-time delivery, product quality and/or unreasonable pricing in an alternative country.

And in Wednesday’s conference call to investors after posting third quarter results, Rosenfeld expressed caution in connection to where the firm chooses to source, even though the reduction in the tariff rate on China is a welcome development. While the math might indicate a move back to China is a good idea, he was advocating for the need to remain flexible.

“I think that we’re going to be careful

As someone who’s covered Amazon’s biggest shopping events for years (and lost more sleep than I’d like to admit waiting for deals to drop at midnight), I can confidently say: the early Amazon Black Friday 2025 event is already shaping up to be one for the record books.

This year, the official Black Friday lands on Friday, Nov. 28, but Amazon, being Amazon, isn’t making us wait that long to save on time and shipping.

[TITLE]How a corporate trainer from Una built two consumer brands and an investment portfolio out of the Tri-City:
[TEXT]
When Vishal Kedia arrived in Chandigarh more than a decade ago, he carried with him just Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 and a degree from Lovely Professional University (Class of 2012). His first job was as a corporate trainer, teaching programming languages such as PHP to engineering students. But the monotony of repeating the same lessons pushed him to reconsider his path.

By 2013, at 23, he shifted from training to IT development, using his technical skills to build mobile applications and websites for clients in the US, Canada and New Zealand. The venture grew quickly, scaling to 100 employees and an annual turnover of Rs 3 to 4 crore.

But Kedia could sense another shift taking shape.

Spotting the E-commerce Opportunity

As customer habits moved from local stores to online shopping, Kedia and his team adapted. They began selling trending products on platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal. With a strong grounding in technology and digital marketing, the transition came naturally.

Story continues below this ad

Gradually, he realised that long-term growth lay not in selling commodity products but in building brands. This insight led to the launch of Qaysa Care Private Limited in 2018.

Two Brands, One Growth Engine

Under Qaysa Care, Kedia runs two brands:

Calmras: A recreational wellness brand that now competes in a crowded but expanding market.

Toujoo: A kids’ toy brand that has established a strong presence in the used-to-market category.

Together, the two brands generate an annual turnover of
