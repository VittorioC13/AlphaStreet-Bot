[TEXT]
A singular theme didn’t dominate the month of August in European tech ventures. What happened instead was a clear set of parallel shifts becoming more apparent. Moves in geographies, sectors, and funding models represented a reorganisation tipping point in the market.

Investors should pay attention to months like August, as the lack of a major headline story doesn’t lessen the signals of how capital is beginning to rebalance. There is still a story, but with many plots where momentum in the industry builds, where some areas recede, and where new patterns quietly take root.

[TITLE]Skincare Primary Packaging Market Worth USD 8.05 Billion by 2034:
[TEXT]
Ottawa, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global skincare primary packaging
[Source link]: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/19/3153265/0/en/Skincare-Primary-Packaging-Market-Worth-USD-8-05-Billion-by-2034.html


[TITLE]Flexible Packaging Market Growth Driven by Plastics, Pouches, and Recycling Innovations:
[TEXT]
Ottawa, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Flexible packages are the ones made from elastic—flexible materials which are easily formed after filling them with a product. The main material used in production is plastics. To the flexible packages belong films and flexible laminates used as wrapping of the product and the package. They are used in retail and institutional food and non-food as well as in industrial applications, retail, consumer storage and trash bags, bags, wraps, shrink, and stretch films.

Flexible packaging is any package or part of a package whose shape can readily be changed when filled or during use. Flexible packaging is produced from paper, plastic, film, aluminum foil, or any combination of those materials, and includes bags, pouches, liners, wraps, rollstock, and other flexible products.

Flexible packages are particularly useful in industries that require versatile packaging, such as the food and beverage, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries.

The flexible packaging market is expected to increase from USD 323.25 billion in 2025 to USD 488.72 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of 4.7% throughout the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. The shift in consumer behavior toward convenience, coupled with regulatory pressure for eco-friendly solutions, has accelerated market adoption across industries.

Major Key Insights of the Flexible Packaging Market:

Asia Pacific dominated the flexible packaging market in 2024.

North America is expected to grow at a significant rate in the market during the forecast period.

By raw material, the plastics segment dominated the market with the largest share in 2024.

By packaging type, the pouches segment registered its dominance over the global flexible packaging market in 2024.

By printing technology, flexography segment is expected to grow at significant rate during the forecast period.

By application, the food & beverages segment dominated the flexible packaging market in 2024.

Types of Flexible Packaging

Flexible packages can take a variety of physical forms. Wraps consist of a layer of material surrounding the product or products, and can be classified as intimate wraps, which make direct contact with the product, or as bundling wraps, used to join together two or more products so they can be handled as a single unit. The largest use of plastic film is in stretch wrap for unitizing pallet-loads of goods.

Stretch wrap functions by utilizing the elasticity of the plastic film, which causes it to try to return to its original dimensions when it has been stretched, to provide the restraining force. Over time, this force decreases due to relaxation within the plastic. Shrink wrap also uses elasticity, in this case using a film which has been oriented and exposing it to an increased temperature which provides the energy needed for the molecules to be able to relax to closer to their pre-orientation dimensions. Shrink wrap is commonly used for small wraps, and stretch wrap for larger ones, although both can be used in a variety of sizes.

Bags can be regarded as having three formed sides, and pouches as having four sides. However, the terms are often used interchangeably. For example, we refer to bag-in-box packaging for cereal, when clearly the flexible package inside the paperboard carton is a pouch. The sides of the flexible package can be formed by folding the film, using a tube, or by joining two edges together. Joining is most commonly done by heat-sealing, which requires use of plastic.

Stand-up pouches, one of the most rapidly growing forms of flexible packaging, are pouches which, when filled with product, are capable of standing upright on a shelf, and can serve as replacements for rigid containers.

Segmental Insights

Plastic Segment Held the Largest Share in 2024

Multi-layered films of pouches offer strong protection against moisture, oxygen, and contaminants. Many pouches are now made with recyclable or biodegradable materials. Mono-material pouches improve recyclability and meet regulatory demands. Flexible and durable, reducing risk of damage during shipping. Pouches are ideal for direct-to-consumer brands and online grocery markets.

Flexography Segment Led the Market in 2024

The flexography segment led the global flexible packaging market. Flexography printing technology Works on a wide range of substrates like plastic films, paper, foil, and biodegradable materials. Faster printing process compared to other methods like gravure. Flexography printing technology is ideal for printing on flexible packaging formats like pouches, bags, and wraps. It is water-based and UV-curable inks which reduce environmental impact. Flexography printing technology supports special effects like metallic finishes and matte-gloss combinations. Flexography printing technology ensures strong adhesion on flexible surfaces, making prints resistant to smudging or wear. Flexography printing supports special effects like metallic finishes and matte-gloss combinations. Works well with sustainable and recyclable packaging materials.

Expansion of Food & Beverage Industries to Project Dominance in 2024

Recycling Flexible Packaging Market Size and Regional Production Analysi

Recycling flexible packaging comprises collecting and processing resources such as pouches, bags, and bottles into new products. This procedure sometimes distinguishes the resources from separate impurities and removes them before redesigning them into a different material. It is a process that reduces the waste materials from the landfills. It is estimated that around 50% of flexible packaging is recyclable in the U.S. All the plastic used in grocery bags, bread bags, and other products is made up of polyethylene, which can easily be recycled. These types of packaging require non-rigid resources that permit more customizable and economical options.

Greenback and Amcor partner to address flexible packaging waste

Greenback Recycling Technologies has announced the first UK deployment of its Enval recycling module at Amcor’s facility.

The module’s installation at Heanor, Derbyshire, will ‘provide learnings’ for scaling circularity as it will predominantly convert household post-consumer flexible packaging waste in a six-month commissioning and trial phase.

Greenback’s recycling technology is designed to process post-consumer flexible packaging and convert it into pyrolytic oil, suitable for producing food-grade plastics.

The entire recycling process will be verified using the eco2Veritas traceability platform. This software uses AI and IoT devices to capture all process data from the receipt of waste through to the production of pyrolytic oil.

The oil carries digital certificate of provenance, which is passed onward in the value chain providing crucial data for mass-balance allocation as the oil is converted into recycled plastics.

Philippe von Stauffenberg, chief executive, Greenback, said: “Hosting this module at Amcor’s Heanor site will enable real-time feedback from global experts, as we refine our system for maximum impact before expanding further.”

Andrew Green, Vice President, Amcor Flexibles Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: “Combining Greenback’s innovation with Amcor’s operational experience enables us to improve circularity for soft plastics and help our customers make progress in achieving their own sustainability targets.”

Flexible packaging firms set for strong 14-16% rebound in sales this fiscal: Crisil Ratings

As per the report, high domestic demand will more than offset the impact of muted exports, of which the US forms nearly 25-30% and will be affected by the recent US tariff hikes. However, stable consumption in other export destinations - Europe, Africa and the Middle East -will support demand.

Rating agency, Crisil Ratings in its latest report has said that flexible packaging manufacturers are set for a strong 14-16% rebound in sales this fiscal, with supply disruptions driving a sharp uptick in realisations amid stable volume growth. It noted that the industry saw muted compounded annual growth rate of 1- 2% over the past three years due to oversupply situation with supply estimated at nearly 1.4x times demand as at end of fiscal 2025. This is likely to change this fiscal as a fire-led disruption at the plant of a major manufacturer, impacted nearly around 18% of the installed capacities, restoration of which will be gradual.

The rating agency further said that the fire related capacity reduction is expected to prune the oversupply to around 1.2x times demand this fiscal despite addition of new capacities and a relatively muted export demand due to US tariffs. This, coupled with rising consumption led domestic demand (around 78% of overall sales), will drive up capacity utilizations from around 72% last fiscal to around 85% this fiscal. Besides, operating leverage benefits stemming from better capacity utilization and improving realisations, will enhance operating profitability by 300-500 bps. Also, higher cash accrual emanating from revenue growth and margin improvement will help deleverage balance sheets, keeping credit profiles stable.

As per the report, high domestic demand will more than offset impact of muted exports of which US forms nearly 25-30% and will be affected by the recent US tariff hikes. However, stable consumption in other export destinations - Europe, Africa and Middle East -will support demand. Even if it assumes a slight moderation in export demand, overall volumes are still expected to grow at a reasonable 3-5% this fiscal. It also said that growth in volumes, higher realisations, stable raw material prices (of polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate, which are primarily linked to crude oil prices), and operating leverage benefits due to better absorption of fixed costs from increased capacity utilisation, will drive up operating profitability by 300-500 bps to upto 15% this fiscal.

Crisil Ratings also noted that however sustainability of the same remains to be seen as historically, the industry has seen cycles of strong performance with high profitability, followed by chunky capacity additions and oversupply, leading to an industry downturn. Going ahead, restoration of the impacted facility, extent of impact of US tariffs on exports and new capacity additions coming onstream will bear watching.

Flexible packaging is all around us – whether in the form of snack pouches, medicine blister packs, or the labels on bottles and cartons. It is lightweight, versatile, and increasingly sustainable. Yet one persistent challenge shadows its success – inks simply don’t like to stick to plastic films. When adhesion fails, the consequences are visible and costly – smudged graphics, peeling labels, delamination, and even product recalls. For printers, converters, and brand owners, ensuring that inks bond reliably to these surfaces is a matter of both science and business.

Why films resist inks

Unlike paper, which absorbs ink into its porous structure, polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyester are smooth, chemically inert, and water-repellent. Their low surface energy means that when ink is applied, it tends to bead up like water on glass rather than spreading evenly. Solvent-based inks have traditionally been used to overcome this, as the solvents lower surface tension and improve wetting. However, environmental pressures and stricter regulations are driving the industry toward alternatives.

Water-based inks, while safer and more sustainable, have higher surface tension and struggle to wet these non-porous substrates. Achieving good wetting is essential because adhesion depends on the ink drop flattening across the surface. If the angle of the droplet remains steep, the print will lack the intimate contact needed for bonding. Coated and treated films, which often measure in the range of 38–56 dynes per centimetre, require inks with even lower surface tension to spread spontaneously.

The invisible barriers

Beyond the natural chemistry of polymers, other factors interfere with adhesion. Additives used during film processing, such as slip or anti-block agents, can migrate to the surface and form an invisible, slippery layer that reduces surface energy. Contaminants from handling – fingerprints, dust, oils, and mold release residues – further obstruct bonding. Even when inks are designed with the right viscosity and colour strength, these surface conditions can sabotage performance.

Ink formulation itself is a balancing act. Solvent-based systems spread easily but raise safety and environmental concerns. Water-based systems are cleaner but dry more slowly and can fail on untreated plastics. To bridge this gap, chemists have introduced new polymers that reduce surface tension, crosslinking agents that strengthen resistance to heat and chemicals, and hybrid resins that combine adhesion with printability. The direction is clear: inks are evolving to grip more stubborn surfaces while remaining compliant with regulations.

[TITLE]Europe’s VCs must embrace risk — or resign the AI era to US control:
[TEXT]
Europe’s AI startups are losing ground to the US — and their own investors are to blame. Only 5% of global venture capital is raised in the EU, according to the European Commission. The US, by contrast, attracts more than half, while China takes 40%. Yet Europe isn’t capital-poor: households save €1.4tn a year, nearly twice as much as in America. Still, very little of that money finds its way into startups, despite a plethora of incentives like the UK’s EIS tax relief for business angels.

Even when funding is available, Europe’s venture capital firms are slow and cautious. Funds spend weeks on diligence and hesitate once valuations rise past $10-15mn. Regulation is often cited as a hindrance, and to some extent, it is. However, American funds backing European startups operate under the same regulatory frameworks, yet their capital keeps flowing freely.

The drag isn’t the law itself. It’s investors who interpret rules conservatively — instead of moving decisively.

Conservatism over conviction

European investors have historically avoided risks. Banks, insurers, and pension funds have long dominated the market, driven by capital preservation. In Germany, the Mittelstand mindset — a focus on steady, long-term business — has led family-owned industrial firms to aim for generational stability. While that conservatism has built resilience, it also sets the tone for the capital markets. This cautious approach helps explain why net investment in the country fell by 6.3% between 2019 and 2024.
