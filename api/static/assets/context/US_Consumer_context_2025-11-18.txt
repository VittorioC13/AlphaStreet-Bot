[TITLE]Peachtree Supplies $35M Acquisition Loan for Chicago-Area Retail Center – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Core Acquisitions has nabbed a $35 million loan to acquire a grocery-anchored shopping center in suburban Chicago, Commercial Observer has learned.

Peachtree Group originated the acquisition loan for Core’s $44 million purchase of the Deerbrook Shopping Center in Deerfield, Ill., from global investment firm DWS.

Taylor Pike, senior vice president at Peachtree, said the property has strong retail fundamentals with a lease through 2035 with anchor tenant Jewel-Osco, the largest grocer in the Chicago metropolitan area. It has been at the site since 1968. The 428,000-square-foot property also includes Marshalls, Floor & Décor, Panera Bread, Starbucks and Sky Zone.

Pike said the northern area of the property has strong foot traffic from a number of national chains, while the southern portion has vacancy with potential for “value-add” redevelopment. He noted that another draw for the deal was Chicago-based Core Acquisitions’ strong institutional knowledge of the market.

“They all live here and drive past the center every single day, and we really like the fact that they’re going to be super hands-on,” said Pike of Core. “They’re going to know a bunch of people that go there, and we like that story and that kind of commitment because they’re going to be in there every single day, working it, trying to make it the best that it can be.”

Deerbook Shopping Center is located at 16 South Waukegan Road, 40 miles north of Downtown Chicago. Pike said the shopping center draws plenty of traffic, with access to Interstate 94 and Metra commuter rail. He also noted new multifamily projects are being developed near the shopping center that will potentially add more foot traffic.

Core Acquisitions did not immediately return a request for comment.

Indian investors are showing growing faith in Reliance Industries (RIL), the country’s most valuable company — even as foreign funds take a step back.In the September 2025 quarter, retail investors slightly increased their stake in Reliance to 7.08%, up from 6.92% in the June quarter, according to shareholding data. That means over 42 lakh small investors now collectively own around 94 crore shares of Reliance Industries.At the same time, mutual funds also boosted their exposure, raising their stake from 9.32% to 9.66%. The move indicates growing domestic conviction in Reliance’s prospects — even though the stock’s performance has been far from stellar lately.In sharp contrast, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) trimmed their holdings in the company, cutting their stake from 19.21% to 18.65%. The number of foreign investors fell as well — from 2,280 to 2,146 — suggesting that global funds may be taking a more cautious stance toward Indian equities or booking profits after a long rally.This shifting ownership pattern comes at an intriguing time.

[TITLE]Trump cuts tariffs on goods like coffee, bananas and beef in bid to slash consumer prices:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.

President Donald Trump on Friday exempted key agricultural imports like coffee, cocoa, bananas and certain beef products from his higher tariff rates.

The move comes as Trump faces political blowback for high prices at U.S. grocery stores. Some distributors of beef, coffee, chocolate and other common food items have raised prices as Trump's tariffs took hold this year, adding to pressure on household budgets created by decades-high inflation in recent years.

Trump's action Friday also exempts a range of fruits including tomatoes, avocados, coconuts, oranges and pineapples. Along with coffee, the tariff reductions extend to black and green tea, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.

The move marks a reversal for Trump, who has insisted tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. businesses and workers. He has contended U.S. consumers will not ultimately pay for the higher duties.

The exemptions come just a day after Trump reached trade framework agreements with four Latin American countries – including 10% tariffs on most goods from Argentina, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and 15% from Ecuador. It also removes duties specifically on products not grown or produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities, like bananas and coffee.

Rising food prices have hampered U.S. households for several years. Consumer Price Index data show food-at-home prices increased approximately 2.7% year-over-year in September. (More recent data was delayed because of the government shutdown).

The tariff exemptions aim to help moderate these grocery price increases, although experts caution that other factors such as global supply shortages also influence prices, especially for coffee and beef.

Here's more background on how industries like beef, coffee and cocoa have reacted to tariffs and rising prices.

[TITLE]There could be a buying opportunity in consumer packaged goods stocks, Jim Cramer says:
[TEXT]
CNBC's Jim Cramer told investors why he thinks it might be a good time to invest in packaged good stocks that have been lagged as of late, naming companies including Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark as undervalued winners in the sector.

"Right now, I'm concerned that we might be missing a bottom in a group of stocks that I haven't particularly cared for at all, especially in a long time," he said.

Wall Street has largely soured on the packaged goods group for a while, Cramer suggested, saying there has been too much inflation and not enough growth.

But inflation may be nearing a peak, Cramer said, which would drive consumer giants' costs down. The Trump administration's lenient attitude towards antitrust enforcement also makes it easier for companies to merge and dominate the industry, Cramer suggested.

Kimberly-Clark just announced it plans to buy Kenvue , Cramer noted, and he praised the latter's brands even as Trump officials promote unproven theories that question the safety of Tylenol, one of its popular drugs. He lauded Procter & Gamble as an inventive company that has the size and scale to make products cheaper. Clorox , which is one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 , also caught Cramer's eye, and he said he likes its namesake cleaner as well as brands like Burt's Bees, Hidden Valley and Brita. He added that investors willing to take on risk might want to buy General Mills — but only if they're betting on a takeover, as the popularity of weight loss drugs is putting food stocks under pressure.

Cramer also said investors can look beyond traditional consumer packaged goods stocks and into pharmaceuticals, saying he expects big mergers in that industry. He named Johnson & Johnson and Amgen as solid picks.

There's "too much opportunity to pass up," Cramer said, "given that these are currently among the most hated companies in the universe."

[TITLE]BranchOut Food Announces $2.5 Million Institutional Investment Pricing Following Record October Achieving a $20 Million Annualized Revenue Run Rate:
[TEXT]
BEND, Ore., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BranchOut Food Inc. (NASDAQ: BOF), a leading food technology company pioneering the next generation of natural fruit and vegetable snacks through its proprietary GentleDry™ process, today announced the pricing of a $2.5 million institutional investment consisting of 1,034,600 shares of common stock to be purchased by Bard Associates, Inc. The financing will strengthen BranchOut’s working capital reserves and marks an important milestone in the company’s growth. This investment is opportunistic for BranchOut, providing the company with the ability to bolster its balance sheet and fund key growth initiatives. Alexander Capital L.P. is acting as sole bookrunner for the offering.

“This financing is a powerful validation of our momentum and mission,” said Eric Healy, CEO of BranchOut Food. “October was the best month in our company’s history, with record revenue of $1.7 million, equivalent to a $20 million annualized run rate. With this capital, we will be well positioned to scale production and execution across our rapidly growing retail and ingredient channels.”

Healy added, “We see significant growth ahead and are expanding our production facility early next year with the installation of our fourth large-scale production line, which strengthens BranchOut’s position as the largest GentleDry™ operation in the world. In addition, we are transitioning from a made-to-order model to an inventory-based production strategy to reduce air shipping requirements, improve efficiency, and support larger retail programs. This capital will directly support those initiatives, funding both inventory build and critical capital expenditures.”

[TITLE]Redesdale invests in Talio Technologies to forecast emerging food trends through AI:
[TEXT]
Redesdale invests in early-stage companies in the food, drink and nutrition sector.

John Conroy’s Redesdale Fund has invested in a company that uses artificial intelligence to help food businesses identify emerging consumer trends.

Talio Technologies uses AI agents to gather and analyse data on menus, retail trends and social habits to help food companies make faster and better-informed decisions on new products and marketing.

Founded in Dublin by Oran O’Flynn and Ciaran O’Connor, Talio says it works with food and beverage groups to support trend forecasting, concept development and long-term innovation planning. It numbers Kerry Group and Valeo among its clients.

Talio says its AI allows customers to differentiate between short-term fads and more sustained shifts in taste.

“This is a very exciting opportunity for Redesdale as it brings us into the AI technology space in food and we are partnering with first-class entrepreneurs in Oran and Ciaran, who have shown tremendous drive and skill to bring this product to market,” said Redesdale partner Michael Cantwell.

It is the venture capital group’s first AI-related investment.

“Innovation in the food and beverage industry has never moved faster,” Talio said. “For enterprise teams, predicting what’s truly next – beyond the hype – can mean the difference between a blockbuster launch and a costly misfire.”

The Redesdale Fund focuses on investment in early-stage businesses in the food, drink and nutrition sectors. Talio is the fifth investment by the €27 million fund which is backed by Enterprise Ireland, US-based Lord Abbett, Musgrave, Coca-Cola, Monaghan Mushrooms and Tate & Lyle.

The fund is expected to ramp up its investment portfolio over the coming months.

The group’s investments to date include: Dundalk-based Soothing Solutions, which says its dissolvable honey-based jelly pop harnesses natural ingredients to provide relief for children with sore throats; Thanks Plants, which produces a range of plant-based products such as frankfurters, sausages and roasts for health-conscious consumers; Fiid, a maker of plant-based microwaveable meals for the convenience meal market; and Kwayga, a company that has developed technology to help supermarket buyers cut their sourcing times dramatically.

Top companies across the consumption spectrum are reporting robust sales even after Diwali, marking a visible departure from earlier years that typically witnessed tepid demand at the end of the prime shopping season.Aggregate demand in the four-week period after Diwali has climbed 10-20% on year, suggest data from Lifestyle International, LG Electronics, AWL Agri Business and Haier, as well as discretionary product brands Titan Raymond Lifestyle and Kalyan Jewellers. Higher disposable cash due to cuts in GST and standard income tax rates, an early onset of winter, and a stronger wedding business have undergirded post-Diwali demand, senior executives said. “There is absolutely no lull in post-Diwali demand this year,” Sanjay Chitkara, chief sales officer, LG Electronics India, told ET. The country’s largest home appliance and television manufacturer, which raised funds in one of the biggest initial share sales lately, is continuing to run production at 85% utilisation rate in its factories on double shifts, contrary to output slack traditionally seen after Diwali.“Overall affordability has improved after the GST rate cut. Sales and wedding season outlook in the third and fourth quarters are very strong,” he said. “A lot of weddings during summer in the North were postponed to winter due to geopolitical border tensions there.”“This has multiplied the wedding season demand now,” said Chitkara. Haier India president Satish NS said business is climbing at 10-15% post Diwali, with demand for wedding-related purchases improving in the heartland. In major direct and indirect tax reforms, the Centre effectively waived personal income tax below Rs 12 lakh of annual income for the salaried and incomes that attract standard tax rates, and reduced GST applicable on nearly 99% of consumption items, collapsing both the number of slabs and moving items to lower brackets from September 22.Direct tax rebates of up to Rs 12 lakh of income do not apply to capital gains — both long and short term — and other forms of investment incomes that do not attract standard tax rates.The monsoon has also been normal this year, likely lifting farmgate incomes amid the lowest consumer inflation on record. Lifestyle International chief executive Devaranjan Iyer said sales after Diwali have not slumped as there are 12-14 wedding dates this quarter itself. “Typically, what we see is a massive demand spike during Diwali, and then it comes down, but this year it's significantly higher. India shops during weddings,” he said.Large, listed jewellers such as Titan-owned Tanishq and Kalyan Jewellers said wedding demand ensured sustained sales growth similar to the festive season, further driven by the post-Diwali 3-6% moderation in gold prices. Ajoy Chawla, chief executive of Titan’s jewellery division, told analysts that even in the 10 days since the end of the festive season, sales growth has continued to be in the same vein as before Diwali. That should mean the pace of growth until December will be better than in the first half of the fiscal.Kalyan Jewellers executive director Ramesh Kalyanaraman said post Diwali, the demand is trending at the same level as pre-Diwali, aided in good measure by a retreat in gold prices. Angshu Mallick, managing director at India’s largest packaged edible oil company, AWL Agri Business, said November demand is better than October, with offtake of large packs of edible oil, basmati rice, sugar and maida picking up. He said business is climbing in the double digits, both compared with last year and over October. “Trade was not filling the edible oil inventory as they anticipated prices may fall. But the spike in demand has now led to refiling of the pipeline,” said Mallick.Even small towns are showing good demand, better than during the festive season in categories such as apparel. Value fashion retail chain V-Mart Retail managing director Lalit Agarwal said Diwali saw greater sales of summer-related and basic products, which reduced the average selling price. But an early onset of Diwali and the chill factor have driven sales of the winter lines. "We expect a better November than October. Overall, Diwali was good, not great as per our expectation. We do believe that post Diwali should be a better period for us,” Agarwal said.Brands already track banquet and hall bookings to project wedding demand outlook, and some such as Vedant Fashions have also started tracking state-issued data. According to Vedant, India hosts

[TITLE]McDonald's is losing its low-income customers. Economists call it a symptom of the stark wealth divide:
[TEXT]
A recent earnings report from Delta offers yet another illustration. While Delta's main cabin revenue fell 5% for the June quarter compared to a year ago, premium ticket sales rose 5%, highlighting the divide between affluent customers and those forced to be more economical.

Josephson and other economists say the shrinking traffic of low-income consumers is emblematic of a larger trend of Americans diverging in their spending, with wealthier customers flexing their purchasing power and lower-income shoppers pulling back — what some call a "K-shaped economy."

"Happy Meals at McDonald's are prohibitively expensive for some people, because there's been so much inflation," Josephson said.

[TITLE]How tariffs and AI are giving secondhand platforms like ThredUp a boost:
[TEXT]
At ThredUp 's 600,000-square-foot warehouse in Suwanee, Georgia, roughly 40,000 pieces of used clothing are processed each day. The company's logistics network — four facilities across the U.S. — now rivals that of some fast-fashion giants.

"This is the largest garment-on-hanger system in the world," said Justin Pina, ThredUp's senior director of operations. "We can hold more than 3.5 million items here."

Secondhand shopping is booming. The global secondhand apparel market is expected to reach $367 billion by 2029, growing almost three times faster than the overall apparel market, according to GlobalData.

President Donald Trump's tariffs were billed as a way to bring manufacturing back home. But the measures hit one of America's most import-dependent industries: fashion.

About 97 percent of clothing sold in the U.S. is imported, mostly from China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.

For years, Gen Z shoppers have been driving the rise of secondhand fashion, but now more Americans are catching on.

"When tariffs raise those costs, resale platforms suddenly look like the smart buy. This isn't just a fad," said Jasmine Enberg, co-CEO of Scalable. "Tariffs are accelerating trends that were already reshaping the way Americans shop."

For James Reinhart, ThredUp's CEO, the company is already seeing it play out.

"The business is free-cash-flow positive and growing double digits," said Reinhart. "We feel really good about the economics, gross margins near 80% and operations built entirely within the U.S."

ThredUp reported that revenue grew 34% year over year in the third quarter. The company also said it acquired more new customers in the quarter than at any other time in its history, with new buyer growth up 54% from the same period last year.

"If tariffs add 20% to 30% to retail prices, that's a huge advantage for resale," said Dylan Carden, research analyst at William Blair & Company. "Pre-owned items aren't subject to those duties, so demand naturally shifts."

Inside the ThredUp warehouse, where CNBC got a behind-the-scenes look. automation hums alongside human workers. AI systems photograph, categorize, and price thousands of garments per hour. For Reinhart, the technology is key to scaling resale like retail.

"AI has really accelerated adoption," said Reinhart. "It's helping us improve discovery, styling, and personalization for buyers."

That tech wave extends beyond ThredUp. Fashion-tech startups Phia, co-founded by Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni, is using AI to scan thousands of listings across retail and resale in seconds.

"The fact that we've driven millions in transaction volume shows how big this need is," Gates said. "People want smarter, cheaper ways to shop."

ThredUp is betting that domestic infrastructure, automation, and AI will keep it ahead of the curve, and that tariffs meant to revive U.S. manufacturing could end up powering a new kind of American fashion economy.

"The future of fashion will be more sustainable than it is today," said Reinhart. "And secondhand will be at the center of it."

[TITLE]William Blair Maintains Bullish Stance on Costco Wholesale (COST) Stock:
[TEXT]
Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the Best Fundamentally Strong Stocks to Buy. On November 6, William Blair analyst Phillip Blee maintained the bullish stance on the company’s stock. The analyst’s rating is backed by the company’s impressive performance in October, highlighting Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)’s robust merchandising capabilities.

William Blair Maintains Bullish Stance on Costco Wholesale (COST) Stock

Notably, the company reported net sales of $21.75 billion for the retail month of October, 4 weeks to November 2, 2025. This reflects a rise of 8.6% from $20.03 billion last year. As per the analyst, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) strategically changed its product focus from seasonal items to more enduring categories, including apparel and home goods.

This has been effective in maintaining customer interest and sales. This adaptability, together with a limited SKU assortment as well as a skilled team of merchants, places the company well for the holiday season. Furthermore, the analyst believes that Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is a market leader, thanks to its curated product mix, robust value proposition, and appeal to higher-income consumers.

Despite the international markets demonstrating softer-than-expected performance, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)’s valuation is justified considering its consistent performance in the consumer sector, added Blee.

While we acknowledge the potential of COST as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you’re looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]Beyond Discounts: iGaming's New Deal:
[TEXT]
The frantic, coffee-fueled-refresh-hitting of Cyber Monday is starting to lose its magic. That “50% Off!” email, which once felt like a secret key to massive savings, now just feels… predictable. We’ve all felt the “deal fatigue.” We buy a discounted toaster or a pair of headphones, and the excitement is fleeting. But as the thrill of traditional e-commerce sales wanes, a new contender for the “best deal” crown has emerged: the iGaming industry. This sector isn’t just offering discounts; it’s fundamentally redefining what “value” means to a consumer.

The core difference lies in the value proposition. A Cyber Monday deal, at its heart, is a discount on an expense. You have to spend $200 to “save” $50. The iGaming industry completely flips this script. Its deals are built around multipliers. A typical offer isn’t “spend less”; it’s “get more.” An offer to “deposit $50 and play with $100” feels psychologically different. It’s not a rebate; it’s a value-add that doubles your entertainment potential from the very start.

This shift is evident across the digital entertainment landscape. Consumers who are savvy about value now compare a 20% discount on electronics to the kinds of welcome offers available on various platforms. For instance, in the iGaming space, promotions are a core part of the user experience, not just a seasonal event. Enthusiasts visiting a site like VulkanBet casino often find that the value lies in the added playtime and enhanced experience, which a simple e-commerce discount struggles to match. This model is built on engagement, not just transactions.

The Psychology: A Bonus vs. A Discount

The power of the iGaming model lies in its deep understanding of behavioral psychology. A discount is passive; a bonus is active. It taps into our desire for gamification and a sense of “beating the system.”

The Gamification of Loyalty

E-commerce loyalty programs are often slow and uninspired, offering tiny points that eventually lead to a minor discount. The iGaming industry, by contrast, has mastered gamification. Loyalty is rewarded instantly and in tiers. Players unlock new levels, “free spins,” or exclusive bonuses simply by participating. This creates a compelling loop that makes the user feel valued and rewarded for their time, not just their money. The “deal” is an ongoing, interactive experience rather than a single, boring transaction.

Personalization at Scale

Cyber Monday deals are a broadcast, a one-size-fits-all digital flyer. They might be based on your browsing history, but they often feel impersonal. iGaming platforms excel at personalization. The deals you are offered are often tied directly to your play style, your favorite games, or your loyalty status. A “VIP” player gets a different, more substantial bonus than a casual new user. This targeted approach makes the user feel recognized and understood, making the “deal” feel far more exclusive and valuable than a generic 20% off coupon code.

More Than Just a Transaction

When you break it down, the e-commerce model and the iGaming model are selling two completely different things. One is selling a product; the other is selling an experience.

The Entertainment Factor

When you buy a discounted laptop on Cyber Monday, the “fun” part (the deal) is over in a click. The real product (the laptop) is the goal. In iGaming, the “deal” is the product. A 100% deposit bonus or a set of free spins directly translates to more entertainment. The value isn’t a physical item; it’s extended playtime, more chances for a thrilling win, and a longer, more engaging experience. You are, in effect, buying “fun,” and the bonus is just “more fun” for your money.

Immediacy is King

Let’s not forget the most powerful psychological driver of all: instant gratification. You find a Cyber Monday deal, you click “buy,” and then… You wait. You track the shipping for three to five business days. The iGaming bonus is immediate. The moment you make your deposit, the bonus funds are credited to your account, ready for use. This instant, tangible reward provides a dopamine hit that the “your item has shipped” email simply cannot compete with.

What E-Commerce Can Learn

This doesn’t mean Cyber Monday is dead, but it does mean e-commerce platforms are no longer the undisputed kings of value. To compete, they need to think less like digital department stores and more like entertainment platforms.

They can start by shifting their focus from simple discounts to more engaging reward structures.

Focus on Gaining, Not Saving: Instead of just “50% off,” offer “Buy one, get one” or “Spend $50, get a $25 credit” on a future purchase. This reframes the value from losing less to gaining more.

Gamify the Shopping Experience: Implement meaningful loyalty tiers that offer tangible, instant rewards, not just points that expire. Create “missions” or “challenges” for shoppers to unlock exclusive deals.

Personalize Rewards: Use data to offer rewards that truly matter to the individual, making them feel like a valued VIP, not just another name on an email list.

A Shift in Value Perception

The battle for the consumer’s dollar is no longer just about the lowest price. It’s about the best experience and the greatest perceived value. While Cyber Monday will continue to be a day for stocking up on goods, the iGaming industry has proven that a well-designed, bonus-driven ecosystem can create far more excitement and loyalty. It has shifted the goalposts from “saving money” to “getting more,” and in a digital world, that’s a much more compelling game to play.
