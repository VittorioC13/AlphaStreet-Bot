Canada’s Linamar has agreed to acquire select North American assets of auto parts company Aludyne, in a deal valued at $300m.

The deal encompasses substantially all of Aludyne’s precision casting, machining solutions, and manufacturing operations within North America.

It is set to “significantly” enhance Linamar’s manufacturing presence across the continent, particularly in the US, according to a statement from the Canadian manufacturer.

Aludyne, based in Southfield, Michigan, is recognised as a Tier 1 automotive supplier, focusing on lightweight aluminium chassis and structural technologies.

The company operates across six countries, comprising 20 manufacturing facilities and five technical centres in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Once the deal is finalised, the North American assets of Aludyne will be incorporated into Linamar’s Structures Group, which forms part of the firm’s wider Mobility Segment.

Amsterdam, Netherlands Reuters —

The Dutch government has taken control of Chinese-owned computer chipmaker Nexperia, ratcheting up tensions with Beijing as a global fight brews over technology intellectual property, especially around semiconductors.

The government said late on Sunday that it has intervened in Dutch-headquartered Nexperia, which manufactures chips for cars and consumer electronics. It cited worries

In a move that could dent China's relations with the European Union, Chinese technology company Wingtech said control of its Dutch subsidiary Nexperia has been effectively frozen, following an intervention by a government ministry and court in the Netherlands.

In a corporate filing dated October 13, lodged with the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Sunday, Wingtech said semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia is now under temporary external management following an order from the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs.

In a WeChat post on Sunday that was subsequently deleted, Wingtech lashed out at the Dutch move and its claim that the action was taken for reasons of "national security".

Ratepayers across the U.S. have been shocked this year by record electricity prices. In July, according to the latest numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average residential rate in the state of New York was 26.18 cents per kilowatt hour and in California it was a whopping 32.58. Those rates are up 40% and 62% respectively over the same month five years ago, while the national average has risen 32% in that period. What is causing these runaway rates?

[TITLE]HyOrc and Start Lda Announce Formation of Portuguese JV Company, Accelerating National Green Methanol Platform with Construction Set for 2026:
[TEXT]
PORTO, Portugal, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HyOrc Corporation (OTCID: HYOR) and Start Lda (“Start”) today announced the formal execution of the Shareholders Agreement for their 50/50 joint venture company, HyOrc Start Green Fuels, Lda., established to deploy a national network of waste-to-green methanol plants.

This definitive step triggers the full mobilization of the venture, with the HyOrc technology team initiating final preparations on the existing 35 TPD (tons per day) Municipal Waste - Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) gasification unit, and the local Porto team actively advancing permitting and site development. The companies target the delivery of the core gasifier to the project site by the end of May 2026, putting the inaugural plant on a clear path to first Green Methanol production of 8 tonnes per day by the end of 2026.

“Signing the Shareholders Agreement is the trigger that moves our vision from the boardroom to the ground. Our teams are already mobilized, and the pace of activity is a direct response to the overwhelming market pull we are experiencing,” said Andrea Magalini, HyOrc’s Director for Business Development. “We are not just building a plant; we are building a new energy balance for Europe—one that turns local waste into continental energy security and assists in global decarbonization.”

The JV’s first project in Porto will serve as the blueprint for a planned national rollout of five larger-scale facilities, representing a potential multi-billion-euro investment into the Portuguese economy and creating a new, circular energy source for hard-to-abate sectors like maritime shipping.

“Portugal is demonstrating leadership by embracing innovative solutions to its waste and energy challenges,” said Ricardo Mota, CEO of Start Lda. “This partnership leverages our local execution strength with HyOrc’s world-class technology to create a replicable model that can position Portugal as a net exporter of green fuel. The speed of this deployment reflects our shared commitment.”

The companies reported robust inbound interest from fuel distributors and global shipping lines seeking to secure long-term offtake agreements for green methanol, as well as from strategic and financial investors looking to participate in the green methanol platform’s expansion.

[TITLE]Data centres costing €5.6bn have planning approval but no electricity, industry warns:
[TEXT]
New data centres costing €5.6 billion have planning approval but no electricity to power them, an industry chief has said as the sector urges Ministers to tackle restrictions that have left big investments “marooned”.

Data-centre access to electricity and gas has been limited for years because of the risk of blackouts set off by the sector’s surging demand for power.

Although the Coalition promised in the programme for government in January to accelerate energy generation, several big projects remain stalled due to a lack of power and policy uncertainty.

[ Data centres could consume 'as much electricity as two million Irish homes' by 2030Opens in new window ]

“It is a serious stain on Ireland’s foreign direct investment record as a welcoming, pro-business destination that data centres have been built and rightly expected connections, but have been marooned,” said Maurice Mortell, chairman of Digital Infrastructure Ireland (DII), a group representing large data-centre providers.

“This needs to be rectified by Government as a matter of urgency. Some €5.6 billion of data centres have planning but no power, with a further €7.8 billion in a pipeline for Ireland.”

Despite the State being a significant beneficiary of the internet economy in the first quarter of the century, data-centre curbs have led to anxiety that it has missed out on the first wave of notable investment in artificial-intelligence (AI) technology.

Ireland has seen a sharp increase in the amount of data centres in operation in recent years, but are they necessary for economic growth? Video: Enda O'Dowd

Data centres are buildings that house highly energy-intensive computer systems for storing internet, business and AI data. Restrictions were imposed in 2021 and 2022 after the sector’s electricity demand added the equivalent of 140,000 households to the national grid over four successive years.

Constraints on the electricity network have implications beyond data centres, retarding accommodation delivery and other business investment.

Amid shifting power dynamics within Tata group, following the appointment of Noel Tata as chairman of Tata Trusts, which controls 66% of Tata Sons, the holding company of the conglomerate, after the death of half-brother Ratan Tata last October, there's one constant. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran will continue at the group for another five years. ET has reported that based on information from sources that the Tata Trusts have approved a third executive term for Chandrasekaran, in the first ever departure from the Tata Group's retirement policy. Chandrasekaran will be 65 when he ends his second term in February 2027. Under group rules, executives are expected to step down from such roles at 65 although they can remain in non-executive capacities until 70. A source told ET that the Trusts' resolution was sent to Tata Sons, which will decide the matter.Chandrasekaran was granted a second five-year term in February 2022. A Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) veteran, he had first joined the board of Tata Sons in October 2016 and was appointed chairman in January 2017.A few months ago, Chandrasekaran had briefed the board of Tata Trusts

[TITLE]China and the US are in a race for critical minerals. African countries need to make the rules:
[TEXT]
Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are essential for modern technologies. They are key to industries ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy, defence, and aerospace systems.

The global demand for these minerals has been growing, as has the competition for them.

The supply and production of these minerals is largely concentrated in the global South. Most of the world’s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It produces almost three-quarters of the global cobalt output. Australia produces nearly half of the world’s lithium. Chile accounts for another quarter of global lithium production, with China following at 18%.

China dominates the supply chain through massive investments in mining operations, particularly in Africa. It is responsible for refining 90% of rare earth elements and graphite, and 60-70% of lithium and cobalt. The United States and European Union — long-term trading partners with African nations — have also adopted policies to secure access to Africa’s resources.

The question is what African countries are doing to take advantage of this demand for these critical minerals, especially to drive their own development.

As development researchers we address this question in a special publication on the rising significance of critical minerals in Africa by the Indian Council of World Affairs. In another publication, we look at how emerging resource diplomacy may reinforce Africa’s position in the global economy as a mere source of raw materials.

We recommend that African countries determine for themselves how to benefit from this global competition. This includes developing national strategies that emphasise local value addition and benefits. Also, national strategies should begin positioning African countries to gain from their resources beyond value addition.

The competition for Africa’s critical minerals underscores the urgency of governance reforms and regional cooperation to transform mineral wealth into sustainable prosperity, avoiding another “resource curse.”

The emerging ‘New World Order’

A Chinese-led ‘New World Order’ is emerging to counter the US-led Western influence. Eastern and global South countries demonstrate this shift through groupings like BRICS and South-South cooperation in technology and development. China has strengthened its influence in the global South through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.

Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious infrastructure project that connects continents by land and sea. Since then, over 200 agreements have been signed with over 150 countries and 30 international organisations. The initiative has expanded China’s access to resources. This is often in exchange for infrastructure development that links mining regions to ports.

In Africa, China has invested heavily in mining and infrastructure. Its firms have spent

New Delhi: India should consider making rules easier for foreign companies to fully own local units in the defence sector, said Patrice Caine, chief executive of French military, avionics and cybersecurity software group Thales “Countries like France, Australia and the UK — they make a clear distinction between protecting intellectual property and economic rights. They don’t care who owns the company as long as the intellectual property is protected by them,” he told ET in an interview. “Perhaps this will evolve in India.”India allows 100% foreign investment in the defence sector. While investment up to 74% in a joint venture with a local company requires no prior government approval under the automatic route, the process for a foreign investor to hold a stake beyond that is complex and requires multiple government clearances.The government has been extremely cautious on allowing full ownership for foreign companies in this strategic sector. Sweden’s Saab is probably the only foreign company that has so far received New Delhi’s approval for a fully owned local subsidiary, to make anti-tank weapons under an estimated `500-crore project.Meanwhile, Indian conglomerates have entered the sector in partnerships with foreign companies, including Thales.These companies include Reliance Industries Adani Group and Mahindra , as the government pushes for boosting local participation in defence supplies for the Indian armed forces as well as for exports.Caine, who was in India on a short visit, sought to dispel concerns
