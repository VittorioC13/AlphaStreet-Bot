[TITLE]NANOBIOTIX Provides Business Update and Reports Half Year 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
PARIS and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO - NASDAQ: NBTX - the “Company”), a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering nanotherapeutic approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases, provided an update on operational progress and announced its half year financial results for the six-month period ended June 30, 2025.

Operational Highlights of the 2025 Half Year Period and To Date

Expanding clinical development program evaluating the potential broad applicability of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) continues to build significant momentum:

First patient dosed in the CONVERGE study, a Johnson & Johnson (“J&J”)-sponsored randomized Phase 2 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) for patients with Stage 3 unresectable non-small cell lung cancer receiving standard of care chemoradiation followed by consolidation durvalumab

First data announced from the completed dose escalation part of a Phase 1 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) as a 2L+ therapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC, sponsored by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center

Announced full data from the completed MD Anderson Phase 1 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in pancreatic cancer along with the launch of a new cohort and expansion of the trial

Achieved regulatory harmonization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) after agreement with health authorities in major European countries to reclassify JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) from a medical device to a drug

Filed a new composition of matter patent for JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) that aims to reinforce the intellectual property foundation supporting the product candidate

First data announced from a Nanobiotix-sponsored Phase 1 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with primary cutaneous melanoma resistant to anti-PD-1

Updated data announced from a Nanobiotix-sponsored Phase 1 study continuing to support JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) plus anti-PD-1 as a potential new 1L or 2L+ option in anti-PD-1 naïve or resistant R/M-HNSCC

Further execution of disciplined financial plan to reinforce pathway to long-term, self-sustained growth:

Strengthened financial position through amendment of the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) global licensing agreement extending cash visibility to mid-2026

In active discussions regarding non-dilutive financing, intended to meaningfully extend its cash runway beyond mid-2026.

Half Year 2025 Financial Results

Revenue and Other Income: Revenue and other income have increased for the six months ended June 30, 2025, up to €26.6 million, compared to €9.3 million for the same period in 2024. Further to J&J amendment letter signed in March 2025 reducing the Company’s funding obligation on the future NANORAY-312 study costs, a positive non-cash revenue impact amounting to €21.2m was recorded in accordance with IFRS15 revenue recognition accounting principles application, offsetting the negative non-cash revenue impact recognized in 2024 results following the transfer of NANORAY-312 study sponsorship to J&J signed at the end of 2024. In addition, revenue towards J&J also included €3.4m of clinical product sales to J&J and R&D tax credit income of 1.7 million.

Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses: R&D expenses consist primarily of preclinical, clinical and manufacturing expenses including employee-related payroll expenses related to the development of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3). These expenses for the six months ending June 30 2025, were €14.5 million compared to €22.0 million for the same period in 2024. This favorable R&D cost decrease was primarily driven by lower clinical development activities in NANORAY-312 study further to the transfer of sponsorship to J&J which has assumed nearly all remaining study expanses, less a small portion of costs that remain covered by the Company.

Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses: SG&A expenses consist primarily of administrative employee-related payroll expenses, legal and other professional fees, patent filing and maintenance fees, and insurance. Total SG&A expenses for the six months ending June 30, 2025, were €11.3 million, which is quite stable compared to €10.8 million for the same period in 2024. This slight unfavorable variance is mainly due to a phasing issue of social contributions expenses.

Net loss: Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the six months ending June 30, 2025, was €5.4 million, or a €0.11 basic loss per share. This compares to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of €21.9 million, or €0.46 basic loss per share, for the same period in 2024.

Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025, were €28.8 million, compared to €49.7 million as of December 31, 2024.

Financial Guidance: Based on the current operating plan and financial projections, the Company anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents of €28.8 million as of June 30, 2025, will fund its operations into mid-2026, similar to its prior guidance.

Going Concern:

In March 2025, the Company and J&J executed an amendment to the License Agreement. The amendment provides that J&J will assume nearly all remaining costs for the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trial through completion, less a small portion of costs that will remain covered by the Company, allowing the Company to extend its cash runway and to reduce its operating cash outflows post this amendment, including the period beyond mid-2026.

With the available €28.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025 and based on its current operating plan, the Company anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be insufficient to fund its operations over the next twelve months following the issuance of interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

These events and conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, the Company may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.

However, as the Company is in active discussions regarding non-dilutive financing intended to meaningfully extend its cash runway beyond the 12 months, the executive board determined it is appropriate to prepare the interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2025, on a going concern basis, assuming the Company will continue to operate for the foreseeable future and to address its liquidity challenges by pursuing activities to generate additional cash inflows and by closely managing its operating expenditures, based on assumptions described in the half-year 2025 financial report.

Availability of the Half Year 2025 Financial Reports

The 2025 half-year financial report has been filed with the French financial market authority (Autorité des marchés financiers). It is available to the public on the Company’s website, www.nanobiotix.com.

[TITLE]Oatly Announces Issuance of SEK 1,700 million Nordic Bonds, Entry into SEK 750 million Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and Intention to Complete Prepayment of Term Loan B, as well as Repurchase:
[TEXT]
MALMÖ, Sweden, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oatly Group AB (Nasdaq: OTLY) (“Oatly” or the “Company”) announced today that it has issued SEK denominated senior secured floating rate bonds in a total amount of SEK 1,700 million (the “Nordic Bonds”), entered into a new sustainability-linked SEK 750 million super senior revolving credit facility agreement and intends to complete its repurchase of certain U.S. Notes (as defined below).

Marie-José David, Oatly’s CFO, commented, “These transactions represent yet another step forward in our company’s transformation journey. They strengthen our financial foundation by reducing our total outstanding debt, lowering costs related to the remaining outstanding debt, improving the terms of our capital structure, as well as reducing the dilution impact of our convertible notes. We have done all this while not raising additional financing and our business plan remaining fully funded.”

The proceeds from the Nordic Bonds will initially fund into an escrow account and are intended to be released to the Company on or around October 3, 2025, subject to customary conditions. The new senior revolving credit facility is intended to become effective thereafter, subject to prepayment in full of the group’s existing $130 million term loan B credit facility (the “TLB”) and customary conditions. As previously communicated, the Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Nordic Bonds to prepay the TLB in full, to repurchase and cancel certain of its U.S. Notes as further described below and to pay related transaction costs.

The proceeds from the Nordic Bonds will also be used to complete the transactions contemplated by the Convertible Note Repurchase Agreements (the “Repurchase Agreements”) which the Company entered into on September 9, 2025, with certain accredited investors (the “Selling Noteholders”) that are holders of the Company’s 9.25% Convertible Senior PIK Notes due 2028 (CUSIP No. 67421J AC2) (the “U.S. Notes”). The transactions contemplated by the Repurchase Agreements will result in U.S. Notes sold by the Selling Noteholders being cancelled and no longer outstanding, and are expected to close on or around October 3, 2025, following release of the Nordic Bonds proceeds from escrow and prepayment of the TLB in full and subject to customary conditions.

Additional information regarding the foregoing transactions may be found in a Form 6-K that will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

[TITLE]Melanion Capital Pioneers First Private Bitcoin Treasury Model in Europe:
[TEXT]
Firm to raise €50m to Bitcoin and offer treasury blueprint for other private companies to follow

PARIS, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Melanion Capital today announced the launch of a new strategic initiative, positioning itself as the first private regulated asset management company to implement a Bitcoin treasury operated model (BTOC). This marks a new phase in the investment management firm's evolution as a leader in Bitcoin (BTC) investment, and unlocking opportunities for other private companies to follow in its footsteps.

The move reflects Melanion's conviction that Bitcoin is not just a tactical hedge, but the foundation of a historic monetary transition. The transformation towards Bitcoin treasuries has become a significant trend for public companies, including those outside the crypto space, where a portion of their cash reserves is allocated to the decentralized currency.

Unlike public company models, Melanion's private structure provides greater flexibility to navigate volatility, structure deals, and manage liquidity. The firm will apply its strategy directly on its own balance sheet, offering a demonstration of what a sustainable Bitcoin treasury looks like, ahead of providing the framework to other private businesses to become a BTOC.

"Melanion was founded as a forward-thinking asset manager with traditional roots," said Jad Comair , Founder & CEO of Melanion Capital. "In time, it became clear that Bitcoin represents not just an asset, but a destination as the long-term anchor of capital preservation and growth, especially for Bitcoin treasuries. Our pivot to a regulated treasury is a commitment to that belief: that we can overperform on an asset which is already successful and make this model available for other private businesses to follow."

Melanion differentiates itself from passive treasury approaches by engineering alpha on top of Bitcoin exposure. The firm applies advanced capital structuring, treasury optimisation, and liquidity design to deliver enhanced performance beyond Bitcoin's own repricing cycle.

To accelerate this strategy, Melanion's board is set to raise €50 million in capital dedicated entirely to Bitcoin allocation. This will represent one of the largest private treasury commitments to Bitcoin in Europe, underlining both the scale of Melanion's ambitions and its belief that corporate treasuries must adapt to the new monetary order.

Paul Dalziel , Head of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy at Melanion Capital, said, "By anchoring our own treasury in Bitcoin, we demonstrate its potential role as a superior long-term store of value. But our ambition is larger, as we hope to show how private companies can compound that exposure, turning Bitcoin from a defensive allocation into a source of active outperformance."

Building on the firm's pioneering track record of bridging traditional and decentralized finance, including the launch of Europe's first Bitcoin Equities UCITS ETF in 2021, Melanion views its private treasury model as an actionable playbook for others.

"Our long-run vision is simple and we mean to lead by example," added Comair. "Every company will one day become a Bitcoin treasury company, and our strategy will help them achieve that".

Investment in Bitcoin carries a risk of partial or total loss of capital.

About Melanion Capital:

Founded in Paris in 2013, Melanion Capital is an independent alternative asset management firm and Bitcoin treasury company, bridging traditional finance and innovation. Recognised as a "Jeune Entreprise Innovante" by the French Ministry of Research, the firm launched its digital asset business in 2020 and was the first to offer a UCITS-compliant Bitcoin thematic ETF in 2021.

Today, Melanion is defining the standard for private Bitcoin treasuries: proving the resilience, compliance, and profitability of its own model, ahead of enabling its use to other private businesses.

[TITLE]Oatly Announces Issuance of SEK 1,700 million Nordic Bonds, Entry into SEK 750 million Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and Intention to Complete Prepayment of Term Loan B, as well as Repurchase:
[TEXT]
MALMÖ, Sweden, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oatly Group AB (Nasdaq: OTLY) (“Oatly” or the “Company”) announced today that it has issued SEK denominated senior secured floating rate bonds in a total amount of SEK 1,700 million (the “Nordic Bonds”), entered into a new sustainability-linked SEK 750 million super senior revolving credit facility agreement and intends to complete its repurchase of certain U.S. Notes (as defined below).

[TITLE]Construction bosses say they're sending their staff abroad for work because of uncertainty here:
[TEXT]
THE BOSSES OF some of the biggest construction companies in the country are claiming there’s been been significant delays to major housing and infrastructure projects in Ireland because of uncertainty and indecision from within government departments.

Multiple chief executives sounded the alarm on whether the government could deliver the key infrastructural projects that the economy is dependent upon during the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) annual conference at Croke Park today.

The construction executives were speaking during a panel looking at Ireland’s ability to manage its construction industry and provide a steadier stream of work in the industry.

Tackling infrastructure systems such as water supply has been one of the major goals of the coalition government in its bid to try and fix the backlogs and wait times for housing across the country.

The Central Bank expects 32,500 homes will be built in 2025, having scaled down an earlier projection by 5,000 houses.

According to JJ Rhatigan chief executive Ger Ronayne, it’s unlikely to get better anytime soon as uncertainty over projects is leading Ireland to “export our expertise around Europe and the UK”, rather than enticing the workforce to stay in the country.

He was backed by executive director of BAM UK and Ireland Alasdair Henderson, who said that this was harming efforts to build up the domestic construction industry.

“You can’t build strategy on the handful of work that is coming in,” Henderson told the conference in Croke Park.

Ronayne claimed that the government’s procurement system, E-Tenders, has “never been quieter” in terms of projects.

“Everyone in the room will have seen that,” Ronayne insisted.

Taoiseach’s address to the conference

Addressing the conference earlier this morning, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that the government understands the importance of providing “certainty, predictability and a clear vision” of what it aims to achieve.

He pointed to a revised National Development Plan, published in July, that he said represents that “step-change” needed in the approach to infrastructure delivery in the years ahead.

The Fianna Fáil leader said it would be the largest ever capital investment in the history of the State, at a total investment of €275.4 billion. It includes €24 billion invested in key transport programmes such as MetroLink and over €12 billion for water and wastewater services

We are releasing funds from many and varied sources because we understand the need and know that now is the time to invest in our future.

Court case against department

JJ Rhatigan, which employs 346 people directly, recently took legal action against the Department of Housing over the government’s decision to suddenly halt almost 500 social homes over rising costs.

While Ronayne did not specifically discuss the project today, he did warn that the company was increasingly seeing projects stall after getting approved following a competition for the State contract.

“There’s a lot of talk about infrastructure being the blocker. Many, many shovel ready projects which we have tendered that are not getting approved and not getting the go ahead – the funding seems to be there. This is after the tender has been selected.”

Ronayne said this was resulting in a “constant” see-saw where the industry veers between being busy with projects to then a “fall-off-a-cliff” period where work dries up.

He added that he believes “costs will come down” if a more regular pipeline of work is created, adding that this should “create efficiency” in the sector.

Gillian Murtagh, whose Shay Murtagh concrete company employs over 150 people in Westmeath, echoed the concerns.

Murtagh said companies are “sitting and waiting”, wondering “are we going to be there in six months” or if the work will cease at the same time.

Paul Sheridan, director of contracting services for CIF, told The Journal afterwards that companies can’t sustain their investment without a guarantee of multiannual funding.

“With all that uncertainty, we’re seeing teams getting on flights at Dublin Airport on a Monday morning and heading to the UK and Europe for work,” Sheridan said.

“Over 60% of the top 50 contractors – who are key for building the major infrastructure here – are actually exporting their teams. So the capacity is there, but we need to see the pipeline and the multiannual funding.”

Department response

When contacted, a spokesperson for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said that reviewed National Development Plan (NDP) published in July seeks to provide certainty sought by the construction sector.

The levels agreed for the next 10 years total €275 billion of capital investment.

Departments will be tasked with setting out initial 5-year NDP sectoral plans to provide clarity to the sector and the public around priority projects for delivery up to 2030, with details on when the projects will likely go to tender and commence construction. These plans are to be published in November.

However, the spokesperson added that any final decisions on when to issue tenders and approve projects to go to construction still sit with the relevant minister and their departments and agencies.

[TITLE]Ellomay Capital Reports Results for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2025:
[TEXT]
Tel-Aviv, Israel, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American; TASE: ELLO) (“Ellomay” or the “Company”), a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and the USA, today reported its unaudited interim consolidated financial results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025.

Financial Highlights

Total assets as of June 30, 2025 amounted to approximately €729.3 million, compared to total assets as of December 31, 2024 of approximately €677.3 million.

Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2025 were approximately €11.3 million, compared to revenues of approximately €11.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025 were approximately €20.1 million, compared to revenues of approximately €19.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Loss for the three months ended June 30, 2025 was approximately €8.4 million, compared to profit of approximately €1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Loss for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was approximately €1.6 million, compared to loss of approximately €3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2025 was approximately €3.2 million, compared to EBITDA of approximately €4.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was approximately €6.1 million, compared to EBITDA of approximately €6.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. See below under “Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for additional disclosure concerning EBITDA.

Financial Overview for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2025

Revenues were approximately €20.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €19.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in revenues mainly results from revenues generated from the Company’s 19.8 MW and 18.1 MW Italian solar facilities that were connected to the grid in February-May 2024 and in January 2025, respectively. Such increase was partly offset by lower revenues from one of the Company’s Dutch biogas plants, which experienced a biology-related production issue that affected output in January and April 2025 and by slightly lower revenues from the Talasol facility, which in July 2024 sustained damage due to a fire that has since been repaired and restored to nearly 97% output, though not yet fully recovered.

Operating expenses were approximately €9.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €9.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in operating expenses mainly results from lower costs in connection with the acquisition of feedstock by the Company’s Dutch biogas plants, partially offset by the achievement of preliminary acceptance certificate (PAC) of the Company’s 19.8 MW Italian solar facilities subsequent to June 30, 2024, upon which the Company commenced recording operating expenses of the solar facilities. Depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately €8.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €8.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Project development costs were approximately €2.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in project development costs is mainly due to development expenses in connection with solar projects in the USA and Italy.

General and administrative expenses were approximately €3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in general and administrative expenses is mostly due to higher consultancy expenses.

The Company’s share of profit of equity accounted investee, after elimination of intercompany transactions, was approximately €12 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to share of profits of equity accounted investee, after elimination of intercompany transactions, of approximately €1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in share of profits of equity accounted investee was mainly attributable to increased financing expenses recorded by Dorad Energy Ltd. (“ Dorad ”) due to the impact of the USD/NIS exchange rate fluctuations on deposits in USD and forward contracts and the reduced demand for electricity in Israel during the June 2025 war between Israel and Iran.

Other income was approximately €1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to €0 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The income during the six months ended June 30, 2025 was recognized based on agreed compensation expected to be received from the EPC contractor of two of the Company’s USA solar facilities for loss of income due to delays in construction.

Financing expenses, net was approximately €1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to financing expenses, net of approximately €2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The change in financing expenses, net, was mainly attributable to higher income resulting from exchange rate differences that amounted to approximately €5.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, an aggregate change of approximately €4.6 million. The exchange rate differences were mainly recorded in connection with the New Israeli Shekel (“ NIS ”) cash and cash equivalents and the Company’s NIS denominated debentures and were caused by the 4.2% devaluation of the NIS against the euro during the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to 0.2% during the six months ended June 30 2024. The increase in financing income for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was partially offset by a decrease in financing income of approximately €2.4 million in connection with derivatives and warrants for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was also partially offset by increased interest expenses resulting from the issuance of the Company’s Series G Debentures in February 2025 and Series F Debentures in August and November 2024.

Tax benefit was approximately €1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to tax benefit of approximately €1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The change is primarily attributable to the tax impact of the investment transaction with Clal Insurance Company Ltd. (“ Clal ”) in the Company’s 198 MW solar portfolio, which is expected to be fully offset through the utilization of current losses.

Profit from discontinued operation was €0 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to profit from discontinued operation (net of tax) of approximately €80 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Loss for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was approximately €1.6 million, compared to loss of approximately €3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Total other comprehensive loss was approximately €8.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to total other comprehensive income of approximately €5.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The change in total other comprehensive income (loss) is primarily as the result of foreign currency translation adjustments due to the change in the NIS/euro exchange rate and by changes in fair value of cash flow hedges, including a material decrease in the fair value of the liability resulting from the financial power swap that covers approximately 80% of the output of the Talasol solar plant (the “ Talasol PPA ”). The Talasol PPA experienced high volatility due to the substantial change in electricity prices in Europe. In accordance with hedge accounting standards, the changes in the Talasol PPA’s fair value are recorded in the Company’s shareholders’ equity through a hedging reserve and not through the accumulated deficit/retained earnings. The changes do not impact the Company’s consolidated net profit/loss or the Company’s consolidated cash flows.

[TITLE]Oatly Announces Issuance of SEK 1,700 million Nordic Bonds, Entry into SEK 750 million Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and Intention to Complete Prepayment of Term Loan B, as well as Repurchase:
[TEXT]
MALMÖ, Sweden, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oatly Group AB (Nasdaq: OTLY) (“Oatly” or the “Company”) announced today that it has issued SEK denominated senior secured floating rate bonds in a total amount of SEK 1,700 million (the “Nordic Bonds”), entered into a new sustainability-linked SEK 750 million super senior revolving credit facility agreement and intends to complete its repurchase of certain U.S. Notes (as defined below).

Marie-José David, Oatly’s CFO, commented, “These transactions represent yet another step forward in our company’s transformation journey. They strengthen our financial foundation by reducing our total outstanding debt, lowering costs related to the remaining outstanding debt, improving the terms of our capital structure, as well as reducing the dilution impact of our convertible notes. We have done all this while not raising additional financing and our business plan remaining fully funded.”

The proceeds from the Nordic Bonds will initially fund into an escrow account and are intended to be released to the Company on or around October 3, 2025, subject to customary conditions. The new senior revolving credit facility is intended to become effective thereafter, subject to prepayment in full of the group’s existing $130 million term loan B credit facility (the “TLB”) and customary conditions. As previously communicated, the Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Nordic Bonds to prepay the TLB in full, to repurchase and cancel certain of its U.S. Notes as further described below and to pay related transaction costs.

The proceeds from the Nordic Bonds will also be used to complete the transactions contemplated by the Convertible Note Repurchase Agreements (the “Repurchase Agreements”) which the Company entered into on September 9, 2025, with certain accredited investors (the “Selling Noteholders”) that are holders of the Company’s 9.25% Convertible Senior PIK Notes due 2028 (CUSIP No. 67421J AC2) (the “U.S. Notes”). The transactions contemplated by the Repurchase Agreements will result in U.S. Notes sold by the Selling Noteholders being cancelled and no longer outstanding, and are expected to close on or around October 3, 2025, following release of the Nordic Bonds proceeds from escrow and prepayment of the TLB in full and subject to customary conditions.

Additional information regarding the foregoing transactions may be found in a Form 6-K that will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

World markets, except for the US, inched higher on Tuesday despite concerns a US government shutdown could delay key jobs data.

Dublin

Euronext Dublin finished the day up 1.6 per cent off the back of a strong performance from budget airline Ryanair and the banks.

Ryanair climbed 3.6 per cent after it said it will not restart low-fare flights to and from Tel Aviv this winter after the city’s Ben Gurion Airport refused to confirm the airline’s summer 2026 slots or guarantee access to its low-cost terminal.

The airline said the Israeli airport had repeatedly forced Ryanair to use the more expensive Terminal 3 instead of the low-cost Terminal 1 during security concerns this summer, making tickets unprofitable. A trader suggested certainty around the issue had pleased investors.

Among the financial names, AIB and Bank of Ireland rose 0.8 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively, while PTSB was up 2.7 per cent at close of business, albeit on low trading volumes.

Elsewhere, Cavan-based insulation specialist – one of the biggest hitters on the index – finished the day up 1.5 per cent.

On the down side, food giant Kerry Group dropped 0.3 per cent, while housebuilder Cairn Homes dropped 1.6 per cent.

London

The FTSE 100 ended the quarter with a flourish, hitting an all-time high on Tuesday, as hopes grew of a peace settlement in the Middle East and as UK prime minister Keir Starmer reiterated a commitment to fiscal responsibility.

The FTSE 100 index closed up 0.5 per cent, while the FTSE 250 ended 0.7 per cent higher, and the AIM All-Share ended up 0.4 per cent.

[TITLE]Jeh Aerospace scales to $100 m order book, plans defence entry:
[TEXT]
Hyderabad-based Jeh Aerospace has secured long-term export contracts worth over $100 million from tier-1 and tier-2 players in the US commercial aerospace supply chain.

“We have been able to secure contracts in excess of $100 million, which has created a very stable platform for us,” said Vishal R Sanghavi, Founder, CEO of Jeh Aerospace. “These are long-term contracts that provide significant visibility.”

While the company currently operates on a 100 per cent export model, Sanghavi anticipates a shift as domestic revenues begin flowing in. “We would not be surprised to see this mix change to 80-20 or even 70-30 over the next four to five years,” he explained, indicating a gradual pivot toward the Indian market.

Demand cycles

Currently focused entirely on commercial aerospace, Jeh plans to diversify into defense aerospace in the coming years to balance demand cycles across sectors. The company operates with a 110-member team from its production facility in Hyderabad.

Jeh’s growth comes amid a broader surge in aerospace sourcing from India. In 2024, Airbus announced plans to double its sourcing from India to $1.5 billion in the coming years, up from $750 million currently, according to Remi Maillard, president of Airbus India and South Asia, speaking at the “Wings India” event in Hyderabad.

Similarly, Boeing has indicated it will increase its sourcing from India, which currently stands at ₹10,000 crore, signalling strong confidence in the country’s aerospace manufacturing capabilities.

While the US remains Jeh’s immediate focus, the company is laying the groundwork to expand into Western Europe, targeting countries like Germany, France, and Switzerland.

Founded in 2022, Jeh Aerospace is backed by industry veterans Prat Kumar, former Boeing India CEO and Srinivasan Dwarkanath, former CEO of Airbus India. The company also raised funds (undisclosed) from IndiGo Ventures, the venture capital arm of airline operator IndiGo.

In August 2025, the company raised $11 million in a funding round led by Elevation Capital, with participation from existing backer General Catalyst.
