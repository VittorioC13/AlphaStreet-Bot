[TITLE]Trump's Truth Social to Merge With Fusion Startup You've Probably Never Heard Of:
[TEXT]
A fusion-power startup revealed its own fusion experiment this week: A planned merger with a tech firm that seems to have little in common with its work, but which does bring access to ruling-family levels of influence.

TAE Technologies, a Foothill Ranch, California, company that has been developing a compact nuclear-fusion reactor design since 1998, announced that it would merge with Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the Florida-based parent firm of President Trump's Truth Social.

The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion, a substantial increase from TMTG's $4.16 billion market cap as of Thursday, and a step up from 2021, when its financial struggles reportedly led Trump to ask Elon Musk to buy his social network.

The transaction calls for TMTG to kick in $200 million to TAE at the signing of the deal, with $100 million more available when it files Securities and Exchange Commission paperwork. The parties predict that the deal will close in the middle of 2026, pending shareholder signoff and regulatory approval, which does not seem like much of a risk in this case.

TAE plans to spend that money to accelerate its plans to build a 50-megawatt commercial fusion electric-power plant. A merger presentation predicts that it will pick a site and begin construction in 2026, start “pre-commercial operations” in 2029, and begin commercial operations in 2031.

Fusion power, in which atoms fuse together under immense pressure to generate heat that can be turned into electricity, promises safe, zero-emission energy without the radioactive waste that nuclear fission plants leave behind.

Creating conditions similar to what allows fusion to happen inside the sun and other stars has proved to be an immensely difficult exercise; it took until 2022 for a US facility’s fusion energy output to exceed the energy input required to initiate that reaction.

Meanwhile, solar panels offer a much cheaper and proven way to turn the sun’s fusion energy into electricity; on a lower-tech scale, a clothesline technically functions as a fusion-powered clothes dryer.

But fusion’s potential, combined with the growing power needs of AI data centers, has pushed interest in the concept to its highest ever level. The “AI Action Plan” that Trump unveiled in July sees a role for fusion, while essentially ruling out the solar and wind power that the president has repeatedly attacked. Fusion also figures in Microsoft’s data-center ambitions.

TAE's plant concept involves using what it calls an “advanced beam-driven Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC)” to confine its hydrogen-boron fuel inside a superhot plasma. Before 2025, it had pitched this as a key part of electrifying transportation; in 2022, it touted its attendance at a fusion-power summit hosted at the White House and approvingly quoted President Biden’s Office of Science & Technology Policy director Alondra Nelson as saying “the world is on fire.”

Building 'Uncancellable Infrastructure'

Global warming, however, did not come up in the brief conference call TAE and TMTG hosted on Thursday morning. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes and TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer—who will share chief-executive titles in the combined firm—gave brief statements and took no questions.

"TMTG has built uncancellable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans, and now we're taking a big step toward a revolutionary technology that will cement Americans’ global energy dominance for generations,” Nunes said. “Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s, an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America’s AI supremacy, and revive America’s manufacturing base and bolster national defense.”

(Before joining TMTG in January 2022, Nunes served in the House as a Republican representing California and filed a lengthy series of defamation lawsuits—most since dismissed or withdrawn—against news organizations, journalists, Twitter, and such online critics as the unknown operator of a “DevinCow” parody account.)

“Today is a big milestone for TAE, fully recognizing the dedication and passion of our people who worked tirelessly over the last quarter century to advance our research to the point that capital is now becoming our biggest challenge,” Binderbauer said. “Fusion power is the answer, providing reliable, cost-effective, carbon-free electricity– and importantly, cost-competitive with conventional production.”

The merger announcements credit TAE with raising more than $1.3 billion in private capital to date. Truth Social may not have much of a market presence—a November report by the Pew Research Center found that only 3% of Americans had ever used it—but TMTG isn’t just another social-media or technology company.

Trump himself continues to use Truth Social far more than X, TMTG’s board of directors includes Trump’s oldest son Donald Trump, Jr., and the firm’s stock-ticker symbol is Trump’s initials: DJT.

Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) called for Congressional oversight of the deal in a post on Bluesky: “The merger between Trump Media and TAE raises significant concerns

[TITLE]Don’t expect Trump Media’s nuclear fusion power plant to generate electricity soon:
[TEXT]
Trump Media — yup, the parent company of Truth Social — is the latest entrant in the near century-long race to develop a nuclear fusion power plant. It announced a merger agreement with fusion company TAE Technologies on Thursday and a bold plan to break ground on the first utility-scale fusion plant some time in 2026.

TAE doesn’t plan to start generating power from its first plant until 2031, which is still an incredibly ambitious timeline. There will likely be a myriad of financial and regulatory issues to contend with along the way, of course. But the scientific and engineering challenges to overcome, which we’ll dive into here, are also enormous.

Fusion is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of clean energy technologies

Fusion is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of clean energy technologies, and AI companies are salivating over it as a potential source of abundant electricity for data centers. But while a future fusion reactor might one day help solve some of humanity’s headaches, it could just be wishful thinking to expect them to come to the rescue for data centers anytime soon.

Why would Trump Media care

[TITLE]Meet Nex Playground, the AI-powered hit console set to sell over 1 million units by 2026:
[TEXT]
There's no such thing as an overnight success.

Many of us have only recently heard of the Nex Playground console thanks to its recent blockbuster Black Friday sales, but its creator, Nex Team, has been around for eight years. Launched in December 2023, the hardware comprises an AI-powered camera that tracks user movements, allowing players to interact with its family-focused collection of games.

It's only available in the US and Canada right now. In 2023, Nex Team shipped 5,000 units, then sold 150,000 the following year after being stocked in US retailers Walmart, Target, and BestBuy.

Thanks to huge sales in 2025 – 635,000 consoles and counting – the company is closing in on 800,000 units sold to date, and it expects this figure to hit 1 million in the first half of 2026. Although right now, the console is very hard to come by due to such high demand.

But as noted earlier, it's taken the company some time to get to where it is today. Nex Team was founded back in 2017 by a group of Apple veterans led by David Lee, who joined the iPhone maker after his first startup, online spreadsheet service EditGrid, was acquired in 2008.

The company initially focused on the AI-powered basketball training app HomeCourt, which Apple invited Nex Team to showcase on stage at the iPhone XS launch. HomeCourt later went viral during the COVID-19 pandemic, so the company created a collection of motion-based games called Active Arcade.

This was a hit in Asian markets. Millions of downloads and "hundreds of millions of play sessions" later, Lee and his colleagues noticed that if users connected their phone or tablet to a TV to play Active Arcade, the company saw retention leap up by ten times.

"We built something that people wanted, but we built for the wrong platform," co-founder and CEO Lee explains. "That's how Nex Playground came along."

Creating a console – especially as some of the biggest platform holders in the world appear to be shifting focus away from hardware – feels like a leftfield move. But Lee says the decision was made after trying to find a smart TV that could power his company's ambitions. After an unsuccessful search, Nex Team decided that a console was the way forward.

"Having a hardware component allows us to deliver the best experience," Lee insists.

Kinect callback

The Nex Playground features a lot of older industry DNA. It's an Android box that plays games, similar to the Ouya console from 2013, but it also centres on controller-free motion tracking, like Microsoft's now discontinued Kinect. The former saw limited success, but the latter was a smash hit that – along with the similarly motion-controlled Nintendo Wii – expanded games to new audiences. Yet this type of motion-controlled experience has all but disappeared, save for a handful of Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 games.

"We stand on the shoulders of giants," Lee admits. "Wii was a wonderfully successful console for Nintendo. Kinect sold a lot. The idea of playing games with your body appealed to a broad audience. Our focus is on how we differ from previous attempts. If it was there and now it's gone, then something's wrong; otherwise, they'd still be here.

"There are a few things we do to differentiate ourselves. With AI, we have a new technology backbone which delivers experiences. It doesn't require hand-held sensors or headsets, unlike many motion-based VR games. We just use a camera to understand your motion. The technology has moved beyond requiring a sensor or a complex camera system, as Kinect did. It's just a simple RGB camera with AI processing. We moved everything into software."

David Lee

One feather in Nex Team's cap on the hardware side of things is that it is relatively low-cost. Nex Playground has an RRP of $249, although this drops to $199 during peak promotion periods. That's not cheap, but compared to the US prices for Switch 2 ($449.99), PS5 ($549.99 with disc drive), Xbox Series S (from $399.99), or Xbox Series X (from $599.99), it's also not expensive.

"It was really important to keep the price affordable, because we serve families," Lee says.

"We made conscious decisions. If we are making family games and want four players, imagine you need four controllers – what would that cost? We use a single camera to view the entire living room and identify the four players. There's a very simple remote control [to select games] which is very affordable. It's certainly a cost-saving there.

"Another instance where we made the right choice is the hardware capabilities we chose. We are not going to compete with PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, or Switch. Our hardware capabilities are roughly at a PS3 level; you can build great immersive games already. We just made the conscious choice of picking the right hardware. We have a pretty beefy neural processor unit (NPU), so the AI capabilities are pretty good."

Subscription model

Another lesson that Nex Team learnt from previous hits in the console space, especially for those focused at a family audience like the Wii, is that while they sold huge amounts of hardware, the limited attach rate meant that the audience was not as profitable as it might have been. The answer was an $89-per-year subscription called Play Pass.

"A lot more users are open to subscriptions now," Lee says. "It's fantastic as a business model. Back in the day, Wii expanded the market, but a lot of the audience didn't know Mario. They bought Wii Fit, Wii Sports and they didn't buy many other Nintendo games. Those customers were not very profitable.

"The subscription-based model allows us to keep innovating for the customers we are serving. It's a simple, honest business model 100% aligned with parents, so kids can't come and ask for more and more games."

In terms of power, the Nex Playground is roughly equivalent to the PS3. | Image credit: Nex Team

[TITLE]Medline’s Blockbuster IPO Signals a Comeback for Public Offerings:
[TEXT]
A blockbuster IPO from an under-the-radar health care company is reviving hopes for a strong year of stock offerings. Medline, a medical supplier, raised nearly $6.3 billion earlier this week in the largest IPO this year and the largest since Rivian’s public debut in 2021. The company’s stock jumped 41 percent after opening at $35 on Nasdaq on Wednesday (Dec. 17). “The huge demand for Medline’s IPO in the last week is a strong market to end the year with,” Sam Kerr, head of global ECM at Mergermarket, told Observer in a statement.

[TITLE]Games industry layoff figures were down slightly in 2025 – but it was still horrendous | Year in Review:
[TEXT]
Conditions remain tough in the games industry, and layoff figures were still high in 2025, although down from their peak in 2024.

Amir Satvat, business development director at Tencent Games, maintains a widely used resource for helping people find jobs in the games industry, and for the past few years he has been tracking and forecasting layoff numbers. Crucially, he attempts to include layoffs that were not publicly reported, as well as using his community connections to find out actual figures for layoffs when companies report them without listing the numbers of people affected.

At the time of writing, Satvat has settled on a figure of 9,175 games industry layoffs in 2025, just shy of the prediction of 9,769 he made back in January. That's dramatically down on the estimated 15,631 layoffs in 2024, although still higher than the estimated 8,500 layoffs in 2022, when the current games industry crisis kicked in.

Satvat predicts that we'll see another 7,500 layoffs in 2026, pointing towards a slow recovery in the industry. However, he thinks that the share of open roles in North America and Western Europe will continue to decrease.

Earlier this year, he told The Games Business that "over 70%, and in some years 75%, of the layoffs have been in North America," with AAA studios being particularly affected, and with more than 50% of cuts taking place in California.

Similarly, a survey released in October found more than 26% of European game professionals were laid off in the past year, with median salaries dropping dramatically compared with 2024. "Salaries for programmers – especially Unity developers – have dropped by almost half, mainly because there are barely any open positions," said Tanja Loktionova, founder of Values Value and co-founder of InGame Job, the companies behind the survey. "There have been a lot of layoffs and very few new opportunities."

Satvat predicts that whereas job opportunities will decrease in Western Europe and North America, they will increase in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia. That tallies with comments made during this year's GamesIndustry.biz Investment Panel by Lirui Ding, principal at the gaming venture capital firm Transcend Fund,

[TITLE]Wall Street banked on a flurry of deals under Trump in 2025. It wasn't that simple:
[TEXT]

Deal value, however, was up, boosted by high-dollar-figure agreements: The 2025 deals tracked by Pitchbook totaled roughly $2.4 trillion in value, compared with roughly $1.83 trillion in 2024. The data represents both corporate M&A and private equity buyout activity and considers both announced and closed transactions. In particular, middle-market deal volume was low this year with those large M&A transactions padding the stats, according to a S&P Global analysis of deal-making as of November. "This has been a decade-high level of megadeals, double the number of deals from last year. When you look at the importance of scale, it's been an all-time record in terms of the premium that the market has given to scale," said Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan 's global head of advisory and M&A, on a recent JPMorgan podcast episode. Over the last 10 years, 2021 remains the biggest year on record for U.S. deal activity, a reflection of low interest rates at the time. By this point in the year in 2021, there were 19,666 deals recorded with a total valuation of roughly $5.55 trillion, according to Pitchbook. Executives, lawyers and bankers like Aiyengar note that the sluggishness in deal-making this year took place primarily in the first half of the year as Trump's rolling tariff announcements roiled the financial markets and industry leaders tried to make sense of the effects.

Uncertain times

Early in the year, consultants and bankers across sectors agreed that the Trump administration would make for smoother deal-making and a friendlier regulatory environment after a number of big consumer deals were squashed by President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission. Then came Trump's trade war and his so-called liberation day tariffs. Trump's April announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" on more than 180 countries left executives with an unclear path forward. "Macroeconomic uncertainty" became an often-used phrase in company updates and on investor calls as executives were hesitant to make plans or offer guidance without a clear understanding of how the future with tariffs would play out. "We knew there was going to be some disruption with tariffs, but probably not to the extent that sort of slowed things down," KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC of deal-making in that sector. "With all that uncertainty around where things were going to land, I think it just put a big pause on M&A in general." In addition to automakers, retail and consumer companies bore the brunt of the uncertainty as they navigated whether and how to pass on undetermined higher costs to already-burdened shoppers. Overall deal value in the consumer space was 17% lower during the first three quarters of 2025 than the same period a year prior, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group. Meanwhile transactions by deal value grew in the industrials, energy and health-care sectors, the study found. Through mid-December, there were 227 U.S. deals in the retail space, compared with 296 in the prior year period, according to Pitchbook. The combined valuation of deals, however, was more than $40 billion year to date, compared with roughly $28.4 billion at the same point in 2024, Pitchbook found. Add in the rise of artificial intelligence, which has commanded major spending by companies across the board, and still-high Federal Reserve interest rates that make borrowing more expensive, and the deal-making equation was even trickier for much of the year. "That has felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride," said Kevin Foley, JPMorgan's global head of capital markets, on its recent podcast. "We went through that six-week pause post-liberation day ... and then after that, the level of uncertainty, at least the perception of it, started to fade. "The sentiment became more positive, benefiting from the fact that you've got the secular tail winds of what's happening with AI investments, the anticipation of the Fed being more supportive, along with a pro-business fiscal policy out of this administration," Foley said. "All of that had a very positive impact on sentiment in both the equity and debt markets." Last week the Fed approved its third rate cut this year, but the central bank committee's vote signaled a tougher road ahead for more reductions. While Trump continues to pressure the Fed to bring rates down further, he's also exerting his influence in other arenas and keeping industries guessing.

Policy playbook

Ahead of Trump taking office for his second term, automotive industry insiders and onlookers believed the auto supplier industry was ripe for consolidation. The sector was coming off years of turmoil due to parts shortages and an industrywide move toward electrification. But the end of federal tax credit programs for all-electric vehicles caused many companies to reverse course on EVs and redesign their lineups yet again. Ford Motor on Monday said it would take a $19.5 billion write-down tied to changing plans on electric vehicles. That policy shift and need for automakers to adjust to tariffs and higher costs slowed transactions in the sector. There were more than 8,800 deals globally last year involving industrial manufacturing, which includes automotive, totaling $303.7 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG. The number of deals increased 3.1% from the prior year but notably fell during the fourth quarter of last year – a trend that continued into 2025. Through the third quarter of this year, deals in the automotive industry represented the largest decline by volume of KPMG's industrial manufacturing sectors, off 19.9% year over year compared with a 3.6% decline in the broader category, which also includes aerospace, transportation and logistics and other manufacturing sectors. LaRocca said he believes the broad pullback in EVs, as well as slowing industry sales and a need for diversification, will drive an uptick in deals in the coming year following this year's lull. "If volumes aren't growing, you can't sit still, you've got to think

Wanted: leaders to take the helm of India’s manufacturing growth story, as it seeks to dominate global markets and edge past its rivals.Search firms and hiring companies such as Heidrick & Struggles, Insist Consulting, and Michael Page are seeing a sharp uptick in mandates from the manufacturing sector, as companies look to bring on board leaders with expertise in areas such as engineering-led manufacturing, electronics, and semiconductors.A chunk of the hiring is being driven by Indian companies focusing on strengthening their R&D capabilities, industry insiders said. CEAT , Larsen & Toubro, Thermax Kirloskar Brothers , Tata Electronics and Dixon Manufacturing are among those hiring in this space, said companies and recruiters.While domain skills are crucial, industry executives said digital transformation, sustainability, and leadership for large-scale change are universal priorities.Multinationals and domestic conglomerates are strong hunting grounds for such talent, but expat talent is also being tapped from the US, Europe, Middle East, Singapore, and Taiwan for niche, high-tech areas like semiconductors, EV batteries, and biologics, they said.Semiconductor and electronics industries account for the strongest hiring appetite, but there is also a rise in opportunities in capital goods companies, EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) players, green energy, auto and speciality chemicals, industry executives said.Salaries can start at Rs 70 lakh for a plant head role and go as high as Rs 5-6 crore plus ESOPs at bigger companies for top leaders, recruiters said.“We’re seeing heightened interest in senior leaders across operations, technology, and R&D who can embed automation, Industry 4.0 technologies, and stronger quality systems across the manufacturing lifecycle,” said Suresh Raina, partner at Heidrick & Struggles India. “This includes leaders who can stabilise and scale greenfield facilities, improve productivity and cost efficiency, and localise supply chains to reduce dependency on single markets.”Indian companies are looking to expand their markets and reduce dependence on the US and Chinese markets amid geopolitical uncertainties.Evolving US trade policies are prompting Indian companies to actively diversify beyond a single export market, which has increased demand for senior leaders who can strengthen global sales and business development capabilities, particularly across Europe, APAC, and the Middle East and Africa, Raina said.At Insist Consulting, the manufacturing sector accounts for 30-40% of overall mandates compared to 10-20% a year ago.“In the October-December period, we’ve already placed three CXOs at manufacturing companies in Bengaluru alone,” said R Suresh, managing director of Insist Consulting. “Salaries are through the roof – the CEO of a Rs 2000-crore revenue engineering company can get Rs 3-4 crore plus ESOPs; at bigger companies, that would go up to Rs 5-6 crore plus ESOPs.”Michael Page has seen a 40-50% jump in mandates compared to last year, and is seeing demand for manufacturing, supply chain, and tech roles from the automotive and heavy engineering sector, and R&D, projects, and legal roles in the chemicals and pharma space.“Many Indian setups are investing heavily in building their manufacturing and R&D capabilities, specifically industries like precision engineering, chemicals and the like,” said Anshul Lodha, managing director of Michael Page India.Tyre manufacturer CEAT is looking at hiring mid-level to senior professionals for roles in digital transformation, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and R&D, over the coming months. The RPG Group company has leveraged AI-driven recruitment tools and people analytics to identify and attract talent.“The tyre industry is rapidly evolving with capacity expansion, technology shifts and changing mobility trends. To stay ahead, we need leaders who can drive innovation, strengthen processes, and accelerate our sustainability agenda,” said Somraj Roy, chief HR officer at CEAT.Tata Motors is prioritising skillsets in battery technology, software-defined vehicles, hydrogen fuel systems, advanced engineering, sustainability and commercial functions, its CHRO Sitaram Kandi said.“For niche roles in EV and advanced technologies, we have onboarded expats and specialists from Europe, EMEA, South Asia and the US; our focus remains on professionals who can strengthen capabilities, develop talent base, lead transformation, and accelerate our EV roadmap, regardless of geography,” Kandi told ET.

Indonesia urged to join global chip supply chain to boost AI ambitions

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesia should position itself within the global semiconductor supply chain to strengthen its competitiveness in the artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, Deputy Minister for Communication and Digital Affairs Nezar Patria said on Thursday.Speaking at a discussion in Central Jakarta, Nezar said Indonesia’s vast mineral resources could become a strategic advantage as global competition intensifies in AI-related industries.“To strengthen our bargaining position amid competition in the artificial intelligence industry, Indonesia, with its mineral wealth, must be able to enter the global supply chain of the AI industry,” he said.Nezar noted that Indonesia has an estimated 340 million tons of silica sand reserves, a key raw material used to produce silicon wafers, which form the foundation of chips and semiconductors.“This is our main capital. Silica sand is the primary raw material for making silicon wafers, which are the basis of chips. Today, this has become a strategic industry being aggressively pursued by advanced economies,” he said.Despite this potential, Indonesia has yet to become part of the global semiconductor supply chain. Domestic semiconductor manufacturing facilities, Nezar added, still rely heavily on imported components.To change that, he stressed the importance of downstream processing, warning that Indonesia should no longer remain merely an exporter of raw materials.“At the moment, we can only export raw silica sand to China, European countries, and Japan, where it is processed. This has to stop. We must pursue downstream processing so we can truly enter the global supply chain,” he said.Nezar said the government is now working to identify opportunities and map the natural resources needed by the semiconductor industry as part of a broader strategy to build domestic capacity.In parallel, Indonesia is actively exploring cooperation with countries that play strategic roles in the global semiconductor industry.“We are opening doors for cooperation with strategic countries that we can partner with to build a semiconductor industry, especially to strengthen artificial intelligence infrastructure,” he said.Nezar expressed optimism that Indonesia could achieve sovereignty in its AI ecosystem if it effectively harnesses its resources and industrial opportunities.“There are many opportunities we have overlooked. Only now are we realizing that all this capital exists in Indonesia and can be developed to achieve sovereignty in our artificial intelligence ecosystem,” he said.

[TITLE]Intermap Awarded Malaysian Flood Mapping Program; Indonesia ILASPP Phase 2 Evaluation Period Extended:
[TEXT]
Malaysian award expands national flood forecasting footprint

World Bank-funded Indonesia program advances

Global insurers increasingly rely on Intermap’s elevation data to enhance flood risk and catastrophe modeling

DENVER, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intermap Technologies (TSX: IMP; OTCQB: ITMSF) (“Intermap” or the “Company”), a global leader in 3D geospatial products and intelligence solutions, today announced an update on Indonesia, Malaysia, insurance and guidance.

Indonesia

The World Bank-funded Indonesian Integrated Land Administration and Spatial Planning Project (ILASPP) has extended the decision date for the next phase in the tendering by two weeks to allow for further review and coordination. The extension reflects the decision committee’s mandate for a thorough selection process.

“National geospatial data infrastructure provides critical insight for multiple departments and use cases that promote sovereignty and economic growth. For this reason, it is appropriate and important that decision makers in Indonesia conduct thorough planning and assessments with all stakeholders and perform the highest level of duty of care. We are informed and believe the program remains on track although it’s timing has now extended into 2026 with no other changes to the program’s size or scope,” said Patrick A. Blott, Intermap Chairman and CEO.

Malaysia

In Malaysia, Intermap has been awarded a project to supply high‑resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data and related services to the government for the State of Sabah as part of the National Flood Forecasting and Warning Program. The project is implemented by the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID) under the Ministry of Energy Transition and Water Transformation (PETRA).

The Malaysian national program aims to develop a modern flood forecasting and warning system with monsoon flood forecasts up to seven days ahead and to extend warning lead times from hours to days for agencies and the public.​ Intermap’s high-fidelity DEM data will support more accurate assessments of flood depths and extents based on existing and planned infrastructure, providing critical insight for planning and engineering works to further safeguard communities against major flood risk. These models with proven and standardized interoperable data are a critical first step in establishing commercial grade digital infrastructure capable of supporting effective global private sector risk management and insurance programs. They also provide a scalable foundation for additional forecasting and resilience initiatives across Malaysia and the broader region.

This new project builds on Intermap’s previous phase of work in West Malaysia, which covered river basins in Terengganu, Kelantan and Pahang under PRAB Phase I. In that phase, Intermap’s elevation data contributed to national flood modelling efforts and to the development of the hydrological database and ICT infrastructure that underpin the National Flood Forecasting and Warning Program. The Sabah project extends these capabilities to key flood-prone catchments on the island of Borneo. Data will be delivered in the first quarter of 2026.

“Our extensive experience in hydrological and hydraulic modeling for our insurance and other government clients positions us to supply the best-available DEM product for flood forecasting in Southeast Asia and around the globe,” said Mr. Blott. “Intermap and its local partner in Malaysia, Antaragrafik Systems Sdn Bhd, will continue to provide support to key government officials involved in remote sensing, mapping and water resources management as they enhance flood resilience across the country.”

Global Insurance

Intermap’s global insurance business continues to thrive, including rapid and broad adoption of its new AI risk agent across Europe and renewals with substantial new capacity in the United States. This includes a recent upsell of $2.25 million for one of the country’s leading providers. Intermap continues to see growing demand from global insurance and reinsurance customers for its high-resolution elevation data to support flood risk assessment, catastrophe modeling and underwriting analytics. Insurers increasingly rely on consistent, interoperable terrain data to improve portfolio risk selection, pricing accuracy and capital allocation in flood-exposed regions. Intermap’s elevation datasets are being deployed across multiple geographies as part of insurers’ core analytical infrastructure, reinforcing the Company’s strategy to expand recurring, private-sector revenue alongside government programs.

Outlook

The Company is removing its previously issued 2025 guidance and introducing initial 2026 guidance of $30-35 million in revenue and a 28% EBITDA margin to reflect previously anticipated 2025 milestones occurring in 2026. While the timing of certain government contracts may change due to funding delays and complex global tender processes, management believes these timing effects are typical for government contracting and are mitigated by having multiple concurrent pursuits. Risks to the guidance include uncertainties regarding the timing of subscription renewals, the award of future contracts and the timing of revenue recognition for future awards.

[TITLE]Xanadu Pioneers the Use of Quantum Computers in Photodynamic Cancer Therapy Research:
[TEXT]
TORONTO, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Xanadu Quantum Technologies Inc. (“Xanadu”), a leading photonic quantum computing company, today announced that it has developed a novel quantum computational framework to accelerate the discovery of next-generation photosensitizers for photodynamic cancer therapy, a targeted cancer treatment. Published as a pre-print article on arXiv, Xanadu’s new research demonstrates how fault-tolerant quantum computers can accelerate research into cutting-edge cancer treatments.

Photodynamic cancer therapy uses light-activated compounds called photosensitizers to selectively destroy tumor cells, typically resulting in less collateral damage than conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy. However, a photosensitizer’s success or failure often depends on complex properties, such as sensitivity to specific wavelengths of light and efficiency in triggering cancer cell death. Through the application of quantum simulation algorithms to four diverse photosensitizers, several of which are particularly challenging for classical simulations, Xanadu’s new research shows that quantum computers can effectively simulate the key properties needed to model and improve these treatments.

“The development of effective photosensitizers is currently hampered by the high cost and runtime required for experimental synthesis and classical simulations. We believe our results position fault-tolerant quantum computing as a highly attractive solution for discovering advanced photosensitizers by modelling key physical properties,” says Christian Weedbrook, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Xanadu.

Through this work, Xanadu provides a blueprint for an efficient, quantum-based workflow that can help identify potentially promising drug candidates. By focusing on simulating critical physical properties, such as cumulative absorption and intersystem crossing rates, Xanadu provides a way to determine, from first principles, which photosensitizer candidates could lead to highly efficient generation of reactive, cancer-killing molecules, thereby supporting the effectiveness of the photodynamic cancer treatment. In addition, the research provides estimates for the computational resources required to run these algorithms on utility-scale quantum computers and indicates potential speed and efficiency gains over classical methods.

This research serves as a foundational step toward a quantum-based workflow for drug design, with additional work planned to extend the framework to model more complex photosensitizer molecules. It provides an exciting new avenue for quantum computing to push the boundaries of drug development and cancer treatment.

Business Combination

Xanadu recently announced a business combination agreement with Crane Harbor Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: CHAC), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company (“Crane Harbor”). The combined company, Xanadu Quantum Technologies Limited (“NewCo”), is expected to be capitalized with approximately US$500 million in gross proceeds, comprising approximately US$225 million from Crane Harbor’s trust account, assuming no redemptions by Crane Harbor’s public stockholders, as well as US$275 million from a group of strategic and institutional investors participating in the transaction via a common equity committed private placement investment. NewCo is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

The project is being structured as an infrastructure-grade renewable energy platform capable of supporting up to 250 MW of installed solar capacity, with estimated annual generation of approximately 350 to 450 gigawatt-hours (GWh), subject to final design and grid conditions. The platform is intended to support long-term power purchase agreements with utilities, industrial users, and data centre operators, while remaining future-ready for battery energy storage system integration.

Demand for data centre power offtake is increasing, driven by the rapid growth of AI and cloud workloads. VCI Global has confirmed that data centre offtake arrangements and adjacent AI infrastructure development are under active evaluation, reflecting strong commercial interest and aligning with the Company’s strategy to support the digital economy through energy and platform-based assets.

Long-Term Infrastructure Value and Revenue Visibility

At full scale, utility-grade solar assets of this size are typically valued at approximately US$0.8 to 1.2 million per megawatt, implying an indicative gross project value of US$200 to 300 million upon full development and commissioning.

Based on industry-standard assumptions for solar irradiation, capacity utilisation, and long-term power purchase agreements with tenors of up to 20 years, the project is designed to generate approximately 350 to 450 (GWh) annually. This equates to an indicative annual gross revenue of US$18 to 24 million and potential cumulative contracted revenue of US$360 to 480 million over a 20-year operating life, subject to final tariff structures, grid connection approvals, and offtake arrangements.

Aligned With Malaysia’s AI, Data Center & Energy Policy Tailwinds

Malaysia is rapidly emerging as a regional hub for hyperscale data centers and artificial intelligence infrastructure, supported by strong government policy, expanding semiconductor manufacturing, and increasing commitments by global technology leaders. The country has set national targets to raise renewable energy capacity to 31% by 2025 and 40% by 2035, reinforcing long-term structural demand for large-scale renewable energy platforms. VCI Global believes renewable energy availability is becoming a critical gating factor for data center expansion, and this project positions the Company as a key enabler of Malaysia’s AI-driven digital economy.

“This is not just a solar project; it is an infrastructure platform. As AI, cloud computing, and hyperscale data centres expand across Malaysia, access to large, reliable, and renewable power is becoming mission critical. This initiative marks a decisive step in positioning VCI Global upstream in the energy layer that powers the digital economy,” said Dato’ Victor Hoo, Group Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VCI Global.
