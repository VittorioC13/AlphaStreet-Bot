[TITLE]Moderna Secures $1.5B Five-Year Loan from Ares Management Ahead of Strategy Update:
[TEXT]
Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is one of the high short interest stocks to buy right now. On November 20, Moderna announced that it had secured a five-year loan of $1.5 billion from Ares Management Corp (NYSE:ARES). The company made this announcement as it prepared to unveil strategy updates to analysts later that day. Moderna plans to draw $600 million upfront and retains optional access to an additional $400 million through November 2027 and $500 million through November 2028.

President of Moderna, Stephen Hoge, noted that the loan provides the company with flexibility to fund business development opportunities or manage risk. Moderna is targeting up to 10% revenue growth in 2026, following financial struggles since the collapse of COVID-19 vaccine demand. The company’s revenue fell from $18.4 billion in 2022 to a fraction of that, which forced deep cost cuts and pipeline reprioritization. Moderna now expects sales between $1.6 and $2 billion for 2025.

Moderna Secures $1.5B Five-Year Loan from Ares Management Ahead of Strategy Update

The projected 10% revenue growth for 2026 is contingent upon momentum from partnerships in the UK, Canada, and Australia, along with US demand for its next-generation COVID vaccine, mNEXSPIKE. Further revenue lifts are anticipated in 2027 as Pfizer’s EU COVID vaccine deal expires, opening national tenders in a $1.8 billion market where Moderna currently has minimal share. Additional growth is expected in 2028 from the anticipated rollouts of its COVID-flu combination shot and a norovirus vaccine, products which Moderna expects to be the first and potentially only player to offer in those categories.

Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a biotechnology company that provides messenger RNA medicines in the US, Europe, and internationally.

[TITLE]GRI Bio Announces Positive Topline Data from its Phase 2a Study in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (“IPF”):
[TEXT]
Study met its primary endpoint demonstrating that GRI-0621 was well tolerated over 12 weeks of treatment, with no drug-related severe or serious adverse events and no increase in GI issues when used with existing approved treatments

Study met its secondary endpoints and demonstrated improvement in biomarkers of collagen turnover, suggesting a resolution of fibrosis and repair of the alveolar basement membrane

GRI-0621 demonstrated increases in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 6 and 12 weeks of treatment

39% of GRI-0621 treated subjects experienced an increase in FVC at 12 weeks compared to 80% of subjects treated with placebo experiencing a decline in FVC at 12 weeks

LA JOLLA, CA, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GRI Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ: GRI) (“GRI Bio” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company advancing an innovative pipeline of immune cell modulators for the treatment of inflammatory, fibrotic and autoimmune diseases, today announced positive topline data from the Phase 2a GRI-0621-IPF-02 clinical trial evaluating GRI-0621 for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (“IPF”). The study met its primary endpoint and secondary endpoints demonstrating that GRI-0621 was well tolerated over a 12-week treatment period, consistent with earlier studies evaluating over 1,700 subjects treated for up to a year. Subjects treated with GRI-0621 also displayed improvements in serum biomarkers of collagen turnover suggesting fibrosis resolution and induction of an alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism.

“Treatment of patients with IPF in the GRI-0621 Phase 2a trial was observed to be safe and well tolerated through the completion of the 12-week study,” said Toby Maher, MD, PhD, Professor of Clinical Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, USC Los Angeles. “Secondary endpoints related to the effect of GRI-0621 on biomarkers associated with disease progression provided evidence that GRI-0621 maintains a net anti-fibrotic effect compared to standard of care. Lastly, FVC improved in patients treated with GRI-0621, with more patients experiencing an increase at 12 weeks than with standard of care. We look forward to watching the clinical advancement of GRI-0621 as a potential treatment for patients with IPF.”

Study Met Its Primary Endpoint, Demonstrating a Safety Profile Differentiated From Existing Treatment Options

No safety or tolerability concerns were observed in the subjects enrolled at 12 weeks of treatment, with dry skin, dry lips, muscle and joint pain as the most common adverse events reported. There were no increases in cough (0% in the GRI-0621-treated arm compared to 25% in the placebo arm) or gastrointestinal disorders reported in the GRI-0621 arm compared to the placebo arm (diarrhea reported in 13% versus 33%, respectively). 80% of the subjects enrolled were taking background pirfenidone or nintedanib.

Study Met Secondary Endpoints Suggestive of Disease-Modifying Activity, Reversing Fibrosis and Inducing a Lung Repair Mechanism

Subjects treated with GRI-0621 also displayed improvements in serum biomarkers of collagen turnover, suggesting fibrosis resolution and induction of an alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism. PRO-C6, a biomarker of type VI collagen synthesis, was observed to decrease from baseline (-3%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and increase (+12%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. C6M, a biomarker of type VI collagen degradation, was observed to increase from baseline (+6%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and decrease (-3%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. The type VI collagen remodeling rate shifted from fibrogenic (+10%; continued worsening of fibrosis) in placebo-treated subjects to fibrolytic (-7%; resolution of fibrosis), suggestive of GRI-0621 inducing resolution of fibrosis in treated subjects compared to continued worsening of fibrosis in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care.

Destruction of the alveolar basement membrane is a hallmark of IPF, and type IV collagen synthesis, and repair of the basement membrane, is a crucial step in lung tissue repair. PRO-C4, a biomarker of type IV collagen synthesis, was observed to increase from baseline (+9%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and decrease (-2%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. C4Ma3, a biomarker of type IV collagen degradation, was observed to decrease in GRI-0621 treated subjects compared to subjects treated with placebo and standard of care (10% vs 24%, respectively). The type IV collagen remodeling rate shifted from fibrolytic (-16%; continued destruction of the basement membrane) in placebo-treated subjects to neutral (0%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects, suggestive of GRI-0621 inducing a lung tissue repair mechanism and repair of the alveolar basement membrane compared to placebo-treated subjects.

Interestingly, the alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism is supported by differential gene expression data of AT1 cell re-epithelialization of the basement membrane. GRI-0621 was observed to significantly reduce DLK1 (-6.46 LogFC; FDR 0.0003), a gene involved in lung epithelial AT2 cell fate plasticity and regeneration of alveolar AT1 cells (Sawhney, et al. (2025) Nat Commun 16, 8924; Li, et al. (2025) Resp Res 26 188), another critical step in alveolar basement membrane repair, compared to subjects treated with placebo and standard.

Reductions in neutrophil and macrophage activity (immune cell biomarkers upregulated in IPF and associated with disease progression) and downregulation of genes associated with fibrosis, disease progression and mortality were also observed in patients treated with GRI-0621 compared to placebo-treated subjects.

“The positive Phase 2a results represent an important milestone for our IPF program and a compelling early signal of GRI-0621’s disease-modifying potential. IPF remains one of the most devastating respiratory diseases, with limited treatment options and a significant need for therapies that can do more than slow decline and address the underlying biology of the disease,” commented Marc Hertz, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of GRI Bio. “In addition to a favorable safety and tolerability profile, GRI-0621 demonstrated meaningful improvement in biomarkers suggesting fibrosis resolution and repair of the alveolar basement membrane. These results reinforce our belief in GRI-0621’s differentiated mechanism and support its potential to go beyond slowing disease progression by directly impacting core drivers of IPF. With this mechanistic proof-of-biology in hand, we are well-positioned to advance toward the next stage of development. We believe GRI-0621 could represent a truly meaningful advance in the IPF treatment landscape, with the potential to create significant value for patients and shareholders alike.”

Study Met Exploratory Endpoints Demonstrating Increased Forced Vital Capacity, With Twice as Many Subjects Observed to Have No Decline in FVC Compared to Standard of Care at 12 Weeks

Placebo-adjusted changes from baseline in FVC increased by 99 ml in the GRI-0621-treated arm and a 139 ml increase in the subset taking both GRI-0621 and standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care. Spirometry is subject to large visit-to-visit variability and is dependent on the individual’s effort, often resulting in data outliers. To minimize the impact of outliers in the dataset, a post hoc data analysis was performed excluding the datapoints with the largest gain or loss in FVC over 12 weeks from both arms. The results of this analysis demonstrated an increase in placebo-adjusted change from baseline in FVC of 54 ml in the GRI-0621-treated arm and an increase of 81 ml in the subset taking both GRI-0621 and standard of care. Overall, 39% of GRI-0621 treated subjects experienced an increase in FVC at 12 weeks compared to 80% of subjects who experienced a decline in FVC at 12 weeks in the placebo-treated arm.

The Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, multinational, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-design, 2-arm study enrolled 35 subjects with IPF who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio for GRI-0621 4.5mg or a placebo. GRI-0621 dose of 4.5mg was compared with a dose of placebo following once daily oral administration for 12 weeks. Concurrently, a sub-study examined the number and activity of immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (“BAL”) fluid in 8 subjects (across various centers). The primary endpoint for the Phase 2a study was safety and tolerability of oral GRI-0621 as assessed by clinical labs, vital signs and adverse events after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints were baseline changes in serum biomarkers collected at week 6 and week 12; an assessment of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GRI-0621 at the week 12 visit of treatment (steady state); and a determination of the pharmacodynamic activity of oral GRI-0621 as measured by inhibition of immune cell activation in blood after 6 weeks and 12 weeks, and from BAL fluid after 12 weeks of treatment in the sub-study. Additional exploratory endpoints for the study included assessment of the effect of GRI-0621 on pulmonary function at baseline and after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment and flow cytometry and differential gene expression at various time points. These results show that GRI-0621’s receptor selectivity is consistent with the toxicity profile observed in earlier studies evaluating oral tazarotene in over 1,700 patients treated for up to 52 weeks.

[TITLE]Igyxos Biotherapeutics Announces Positive Results from Phase 1 Trial of IGX12, its First-in-Class Monoclonal Antibody for the Treatment of Male and Female Infertility:
[TEXT]
TOURS, France, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Igyxos Biotherapeutics, a biotechnology company dedicated to developing innovative monoclonal antibodies for infertility treatment, today announced the successful completion of its Phase 1 clinical trial evaluation of IGX12.

The recent Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Phase 1 trial of IGX12 was a randomised, placebo-controlled study in 14 healthy male volunteers at two doses (20 & 40 μg/kg) given every other week as 4 subcutaneous injections over 6 weeks.

These results demonstrated an excellent safety profile at both doses, with no serious adverse events reported. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile showed a gradual absorption phase and a slow elimination half-life which could be supportive of monthly dosing, important for fertility treatment. These results are supported by the preceding Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study in 32 healthy volunteers (16 men & 16 women), reported in March 2025. The company is now planning Phase 2 trials, due to start in leading fertility centres in Europe in 2026.

IGX12 is a first-in-class potentiating monoclonal antibody developed by Igyxos to enhance the potency and efficacy of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a critical hormone involved in female and male gametogenesis. IGX12 has been designed to improve ovarian stimulation in women undergoing medically assisted reproductive technologies and enhance spermatogenesis in men with oligozoospermia, the medical term for a low sperm count.

Dr. Elke Bestel, Chief Medical Officer of Igyxos Biotherapeutics, said, “There has been little innovation in the field of infertility over the last 40 years. Unlike current IVF treatment regimens, our innovative monoclonal antibody-based approach addresses both female and male infertility. Male infertility accounts for nearly half of all infertility cases and currently has no approved treatment. We are excited by these promising results, this time in exclusively male cohorts. Our goal is to bring a new treatment option for infertility to everyone that needs it.”

Florent Ferré, Chief Executive Officer of Igyxos Biotherapeutics, said, “Following the results of our Single Ascending Dose study in March, these MAD study results are another important new milestone in the clinical development of our innovative approach to treating infertility. We are extremely encouraged by these positive Phase 1 results in both male and female cohorts.”
