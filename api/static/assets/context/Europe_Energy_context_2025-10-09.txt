[TITLE]After Tariffs, Trump Courts India With Energy and Defense Deals:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump’s core financial strategy for ending Russia’s war in Ukraine is to starve it of oil and gas revenue. The initial focus of this from Washington’s perspective in the immediate aftermath of the 24 February 2022 invasion was to stop Europe, especially its de facto leader Germany, from continuing to import the huge quantities of cheap gas and oil that had powered its economic expansion from the late 1990s. The U.S.’s efforts at that point were broadly successful, and the pressure is now on Europe to reduce these imports to zero as soon as possible. To do so, Washington has offered Europe U.S. gas and oil as replacements, in addition to the ongoing deals with other countries that stepped in during 2022 with replacement gas and oil supplies for those lost from Russia. In recent days, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has made the same offer to India

[TITLE]U.S. Energy Shift Bolsters China's Offshore Wind Dominance:
[TEXT]
The shift in US energy policy is deterring European wind developers from US investment, and Western original equipment manufacturers are returning to China's favorable business environment, making it difficult for the US to compete in the long term.

Despite US setbacks, global offshore wind capacity is projected to reach 16 gigawatts by 2025, with China developing two-thirds of these projects and forecasted to hold 45% of the world's cumulative capacity by 2030.

The US strategy to decouple from Chinese supply chains by focusing on domestic oil and gas has created economic challenges for its offshore wind industry, leading to decreased investments and project halts.

As the US aims to decouple from Chinese supply chains by doubling down on its domestic oil and gas resources, industries such as offshore wind have faced a barrage of economic challenges, from stop-work orders, to tax break rollbacks and rising inflationary costs. Despite unfavorable conditions in the US, Rystad Energy research shows new global offshore wind capacity will reach 16 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2025 due to projects already underway, with two thirds of them being developed in China. By 2030, Rystad Energy forecasts China’s offshore wind projects will claim 45% of the world’s cumulative capacity, making it difficult for the US market to compete in the long term, regardless of policy reversals.

It is now clear that the energy policy shift in the US not only halts or slows progress on offshore wind projects that were previously greenlit but pushes European wind developers away from US investment. The US-China supply chain may be decoupled, but China’s position as a global renewables leader may have only been strengthened because of it.

Some clear effects are already emerging. US renewable energy investments have plunged 36% year-on-year?so far in 2025, whereas European investments are rising as companies redirect capital away from the US. Stop work orders were issued for both Orsted’s Rhode Island offshore wind development and Equinor’s New York project, with the latter reaching a deal that lifted the administration’s ban. A federal judge has reversed the order on Orsted’s Revolution project, with the question of a continued legal battle waiting to be answered. To remain attractive to investors, Orsted and companies like it must evaluate all options for offshore wind developments and their overall US presence.

On the flipside, China-based CNOOC stated that it is staging its offshore wind portfolio expansion, with a key project in the 1.5 GW Hainan CZ7 aimed to be commissioned before 2030. The project is approved and is to be the first utility-scale project for CNOOC.?For European energy companies with less US exposure, their reliance on China and other nations will only be enhanced.

The chances of creating an alternate, renewables-driven supply chain to compete with China are low, with Western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) flocking back to the country’s favorable business environment after fleeing in 2020. The challenge is formidable: an analysis of turbine platforms with IEC-type certification commonly used across Europe, for example, reveals that approximately 25% of the manufacturing sites producing key components for Western OEMs are in China.

Europe’s wind industry has taken notice, and policymakers are mobilizing to help reduce the reliance on Chinese imports and beef up the domestic wind energy supply chain. Officials hope such measures will encourage manufacturing buildouts while keeping costs in check.

[TITLE]How the European Hydrogen Bank is Jump-Starting Europe’s Hydrogen Economy:
[TEXT]
A few years ago, clean hydrogen in Europe seemed stuck in ambition. Targets were bold, but execution was thin. That’s changing fast, thanks to a smart new mechanism that tackles one of hydrogen’s toughest challenges: bridging the cost gap between low-carbon hydrogen and fossil-derived alternatives.

Auctions that de?risk and prioritize

The European Hydrogen Bank operates via competitive auctions under the Innovation Fund. Producers bid on a fixed-premium subsidy per kilo of hydrogen for up to ten years. Only projects with credible offtake agreements and feasibly demonstrated paths to Final Investment Decision (FID) qualify. The effect: cheaply structured projects get funded, low-cost hydrogen thrives, and risk gets spread, while taxpayers get better value.

This pilot mechanism applied real pressure on project economics, and the first auction in April 2024 delivered €720?million to seven winners. Bids ranged around €0.4–0.5/kg, well below expectations, unlocking more hydrogen per euro than anticipated. That auction funded production volumes that could reach 6?GW electrolyser capacity, or around 0.7?Mt/year by 2030, almost doubling what was committed beforehand.

Second round confirms momentum, and competitive bids

The second auction in early 2025 showed the model is working. With a budget of €1.2?billion, it attracted 61 bids representing 6.3?GW of planned electrolyser capacity and over 7.3?Mt hydrogen production over ten years, four times what the budget could support. The winners, 15 projects across the EU, will receive nearly €992?million in support.

Most successful bids came from Spain (8 projects), Germany (2), the Netherlands (1), Finland (1) and Norway’s maritime corridor (3 projects). Bids in the general category clustered between €0.20–0.60/kg, while maritime-focused bids ranged €0.45–1.88/kg due to higher production or delivery complexity. If all proceed to FID, Europe’s committed green hydrogen capacity jumps from ~2.7?GW to ~5?GW, the clearest signal yet that rational scale is arriving.

Why this matters: efficiency, price, impact

The Hydrogen Bank is not just offering subsidies; it is sorting the hydrogen supply chain by efficiency and credibility. Regions with the best renewable resource costs, like the Iberian Peninsula and Nordics, dominated winning bids. That ensures hydrogen comes online where it can be cheapest and most scalable.

Policymakers also introduced aftermarket rules in the second auction, such as limiting Chinese-sourced electrolyser stack content to 25% and requiring stricter timelines and bonds, ensuring projects are not only low-cost but also secure and resilient.

Case studies: real projects, real promise

For some context, let’s have a look at some of the winners;

Industrial hydrogen hubs in Spain , geared to supply ammonia, methanol, or transport fuel customers. These projects requested premiums as low as €0.20/kg and tied directly to buyer-side demand in chemicals and heavy transport sectors.

, geared to supply ammonia, methanol, or transport fuel customers. These projects requested premiums as low as €0.20/kg and tied directly to buyer-side demand in chemicals and heavy transport sectors. Germany and Netherlands projects , larger in scale (hundreds of ktons over 10 years), situated near existing industrial clusters, benefiting from infrastructure and local offtakers, capturing scale economies.

, larger in scale (hundreds of ktons over 10 years), situated near existing industrial clusters, benefiting from infrastructure and local offtakers, capturing scale economies. Maritime hydrogen proposals in Norway, securing higher premiums but filling niche demand from ports and green shipping corridors. Their presence underscores diverse hydrogen use cases beyond static industrial uses.

One notable analogy: Germany’s Skipavika green ammonia project (in collaboration with EnBW and FUELLA) took part in the pilot auction, securing hydrogen backing tied to ammonia exports, anchoring hydrogen imports alongside domestic production.

Building investor confidence, and the wider market

This auction model has drawn sharp attention from policymakers and industry alike. The oversubscription by a wide margin shows strong investor appetite. Importantly, the Bank’s mechanisms encourage co-financing from national funds via its Auction-as-a-Service feature, boosting support from member states like Spain, Austria and Lithuania with additional billions, still through the same competitive process.

Each project needs to reach FID within 2.5 years and start producing within five years; failure to do so risks losing the subsidy. That tight timeline ensures only mature, bankable projects make it to the finish line, cutting scope for speculative proposals.

Complementing import plans, not replacing them

While the Hydrogen Bank currently focuses on EU production, its design allows for future import auctions under the same framework, complementing domestic supply with diversified overseas renewable hydrogen. This dual pillar model balances internal scale?up with global sourcing, reinforcing energy security and competitive pricing.

By deploying subsidies via auctions, the Bank achieves four main objectives: closing the green premium gap, facilitating price discovery, de-risking projects, and leveraging private capital, all while protecting public funds through a merit-based system.

It also supports broader EU policy goals: meeting RED III mandates for renewable hydrogen supply in industry (e.g. 42.5% of industrial hydrogen by 2030), and embedding green hydrogen targets in the EU’s REPowerEU plan and Net Zero Industry Act framework.

The bottom line: hydrogen market formation in action

The Hydrogen Bank has now turned hydrogen from a vague ambition into an actionable pipeline. Through its structured auctions and clear criteria, it focuses capital and confidence on the most efficient projects in Europe: those that require minimal public support, leverage renewable energy resources well, and serve real end?user demand in transport, chemicals, ammonia, or maritime use.

The second auction's €992?million to 15 projects, the fourfold oversubscription, and the increase to over 5?GW committed capacity, all signal healthy institutional demand and market appetite. Wins in diverse member states, including Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, and Norway, confirm that hydrogen is moving from fringe pilot status into industrial reality.

Yes, volumes remain modest versus the ambition of 20?Mt/year by 2030, but this is a realistic scale-up, not hype. And, crucially, every tonne backed by the Hydrogen Bank is more likely to materialize.

[TITLE]Global renewable power output overtakes coal for the first time, report says:
[TEXT]

[Source link]: https://biztoc.com/x/615113588c228a42


[TITLE]Renewables become biggest source of electricity globally for 1st time, beating coal:
[TEXT]
Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31 per cent in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7 per cent, according to the report by the global energy think-tank Ember.

Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

Renewables accounted for 34.3 per cent of electricity generation globally in the first half of 2025, while coal accounted for 33.1 per cent. It's the first time renewables have overtaken coal, according to the report.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

"That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide," said Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than one per cent.

"The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant," said Wiatros-Motyka. "This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing."

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world.

Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centres, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Men use a cot to salvage belongings, including a solar panel, from their flooded home in Pakistan in 2022. Some made rescuing their solar panel a priority as they fled their homes in the face of the rising floods. Pakistan has added huge amounts of solar through rooftop panels since 2021. (Fareed Khan/The Associated Press)

China, India leading the way

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by two per cent, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India's fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both countries, emissions fell.

"It's often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn't really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use," said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report.

"This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction."

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Renewables in U.S. face challenges

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump's administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

[TITLE]Renewables top coal as Trump seeks reversal:
[TEXT]
What happened

Solar and wind power outpaced new demand for electricity in the first half of the year, energy think tank Ember said in a report Monday night, and for the first time, renewable energy sources generated more power than coal. The boom in renewables, especially solar power, led to a slight decrease in fossil fuel generation worldwide, the researchers found. But fossil fuel use, and greenhouse gas emissions, rose in the European Union and U.S.

Who said what

The combination of the “small” but “significant” drop in fossil fuel use and renewables keeping “pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide” represents a “turning point when we see emissions plateauing,” said study lead author Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka. China added more solar and wind capacity than the rest of the world combined, and lower-income countries now account for 58% of solar generation thanks to a “spectacular reductions in cost,” the BBC said. The EU burned more coal and gas due to “months of weak wind and hydropower performance.”

In the U.S., President Donald Trump has launched an “assault on clean energy policy and related funding” while steering resources to boost coal and oil production, The Associated Press said. At the largest U.S. federal coal auction in over a decade, the lone buyer Monday bid “one-tenth of a penny per ton, underscoring coal’s diminished value” despite Trump’s efforts.

What next?

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission anticipates that solar and wind will make up 83% of new U.S. electricity capacity through mid-2028. “I am very cautiously optimistic” that renewables can “continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S.,” Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Downtown, told the AP. “I am more optimistic on the world scale.”
