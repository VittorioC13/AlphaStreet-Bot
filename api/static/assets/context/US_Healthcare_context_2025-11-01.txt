Fund IV brings total Assets Under Management (AUM) to c. €9 billion, making GHO the largest healthcare specialist private equity firm headquartered in Europe

GHO has diversified its investor base to include over 30 new institutional investors across Europe, North America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East

Since GHO Capital III's 2021 close, GHO has expanded its leading transatlantic healthcare platform with 19 new hires, including one Partner and five Operating Partners

London, UK – 28 October 2025: Global Healthcare Opportunities (including investment manager GHO Capital Management Limited and investment advisor GHO Capital Partners Advisory Ltd.) (“GHO”), the European specialist investor in global healthcare, today announces the final close of its fourth fund, GHO Capital IV LP (“the Fund” or “Fund IV”), raising over €2.5 billion (~$2.9 billion) of capital available to invest.

Fund IV further diversifies GHO’s investor base, with strong support from both existing investors as well as a significant amount of capital from over 30 new institutional investors across Europe, North America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East. As GHO’s largest fund to date, 25% larger than its predecessor, Fund IV brings total assets under management (AUM) to c.€9 billion, making GHO the largest healthcare specialist private equity firm headquartered in Europe.

Building on GHO’s proven success and market leadership across multiple healthcare verticals, GHO remains well-positioned to capitalise on mid-market opportunities in the rapidly growing technical healthcare sector across BioPharma, MedTech, Advisory & Data, Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and HealthTech. Fund IV will continue the strategy of its predecessor funds – delivering better, faster and more accessible healthcare, through scaling innovative regional leaders into vertically-integrated platforms with diversified offerings and global reach.

Beyond fundraising, GHO has made strong progress in 2025, signing three new platform investments and several add-on acquisitions. New investments include Avid Bioservices, a CDMO focused on development and CGMP manufacturing of biologics, Scientist.com, an AI-powered R&D orchestration platform serving pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and FotoFinder Systems, a manufacturer of cutting-edge skin diagnostics and imaging solutions. These investments exemplify GHO's continued commitment to scaling industry leaders, transforming critical healthcare segments through operational excellence and transatlantic expansion.

Since closing GHO Capital III in 2021, GHO has expanded its transatlantic footprint with 19 new hires, taking the team to over 75 professionals who provide on the ground support for its portfolio across Europe and the US. The firm has also strengthened its senior leadership with the appointment of a new Partner in 2024 alongside five new integrated Operating Partners and Senior Advisors, who bring deep industry insights to support GHO’s thematic investment and value creation approach.

Mike Mortimer, Alan Mackay and Andrea Ponti, the Managing Partners at GHO Capital commented: “We are witnessing a golden era of healthcare innovation, driven by the convergence of advanced science, digital technologies, and data. GHO Capital is at the forefront, delivering strong returns while enabling better, faster and more accessible healthcare. Fund IV's success against the backdrop of a challenging fundraising environment reflects confidence in our strategy, transatlantic reach and consistent track record of outperformance across the healthcare ecosystem.

“We are grateful for the trust from both existing and new investors as we partner with world-class management teams to build the next generation of healthcare leaders.”

GHO Capital was advised by placement agent Rede Partners and law firm Kirkland & Ellis on the fundraising.

[TITLE]Cardinal Health lifts annual adjusted profit forecast on specialty drug demand:
[TEXT]
By Siddhi Mahatole

(Reuters) -Drug distributor Cardinal Health raised its annual adjusted profit forecast on Thursday after beating estimates for first-quarter profit on strong demand for costly specialty medicines and branded drugs at its pharmaceuticals unit.

Shares of the Dublin, Ohio-based company rose 17.7% in early trading.

Drug distributors have been benefiting from sales of specialty medicines, which are used to treat complex conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, due to their high profit margins.

They have also benefited from sales of cheaper versions of complex biotech drugs called biosimilars at a time when prices of generic medicines have been falling due to intense competition.

Cardinal now expects adjusted profit per share in a range of $9.65 to $9.85 for fiscal 2026, up from its prior range of $9.30 to $9.50.

The company said the 35-cent increase reflects its strong first-quarter performance. It anticipates contributions from its pending acquisition of Solaris Health that is expected to close in early November.

"We expect M&A to contribute about 8 percentage points to pharma profit growth in fiscal 2026," said CFO Aaron Alt, adding the company expects the first half to be stronger than the second half, driven by new customers.

Cardinal Health said in August it would buy healthcare management firm Solaris Health for $1.9 billion in cash.

Cardinal reported quarterly adjusted profit of $2.55 per share, beating analysts' estimate of $2.18 per share, according to LSEG data.

Its quarterly revenue came in at $64 billion, above the $59.20 billion estimate.

Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said pre-quarter concerns around the company's first quarter - largely stemming from its comments about the timing of vaccine shipments - were "overblown".

"Even with that dynamic, we did not see this magnitude of beat across the enterprise coming," Cherny said.

The company's Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment generated $59.2 billion in revenue for the quarter ended September 30, up 23% year-over-year.

Fund IV brings total Assets Under Management (AUM) to c. €9 billion, making GHO the largest healthcare specialist private equity firm headquartered in Europe

GHO has diversified its investor base to include over 30 new institutional investors across Europe, North America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East

Since GHO Capital III's 2021 close, GHO has expanded its leading transatlantic healthcare platform with 19 new hires, including one Partner and five Operating Partners

London, UK – 28 October 2025: Global Healthcare Opportunities (including investment manager GHO Capital Management Limited and investment advisor GHO Capital Partners Advisory Ltd.) (“GHO”), the European specialist investor in global healthcare, today announces the final close of its fourth fund, GHO Capital IV LP (“the Fund” or “Fund IV”), raising over €2.5 billion (~$2.9 billion) of capital available to invest.

Fund IV further diversifies GHO’s investor base, with strong support from both existing investors as well as a significant amount of capital from over 30 new institutional investors across Europe, North America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East. As GHO’s largest fund to date, 25% larger than its predecessor, Fund IV brings total assets under management (AUM) to c.€9 billion, making GHO the largest healthcare specialist private equity firm headquartered in Europe.

Building on GHO’s proven success and market leadership across multiple healthcare verticals, GHO remains well-positioned to capitalise on mid-market opportunities in the rapidly growing technical healthcare sector across BioPharma, MedTech, Advisory & Data, Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and HealthTech. Fund IV will continue the strategy of its predecessor funds – delivering better, faster and more accessible healthcare, through scaling innovative regional leaders into vertically-integrated platforms with diversified offerings and global reach.

Beyond fundraising, GHO has made strong progress in 2025, signing three new platform investments and several add-on acquisitions. New investments include Avid Bioservices, a CDMO focused on development and CGMP manufacturing of biologics, Scientist.com, an AI-powered R&D orchestration platform serving pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and FotoFinder Systems, a manufacturer of cutting-edge skin diagnostics and imaging solutions. These investments exemplify GHO's continued commitment to scaling industry leaders, transforming critical healthcare segments through operational excellence and transatlantic expansion.

Since closing GHO Capital III in 2021, GHO has expanded its transatlantic footprint with 19 new hires, taking the team to over 75 professionals who provide on the ground support for its portfolio across Europe and the US. The firm has also strengthened its senior leadership with the appointment of a new Partner in 2024 alongside five new integrated Operating Partners and Senior Advisors, who bring deep industry insights to support GHO’s thematic investment and value creation approach.
