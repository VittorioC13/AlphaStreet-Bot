The Celestial deal would allow Marvell to tap into the startup's work on photonics, which uses light rather than electrical signals to create connections between AI chips and memory chips, an area in which it competes with Broadcom and the world's most valuable company, Nvidia.

Marvell CEO Matt Murphy told Reuters that the Celestial AI technology will be used in Marvell's next-generation photonics-related infrastructure products, which will contribute to a new market for the company at the tune of

[TEXT]
Nvidia Corp. invested $2 billion in chip-design software maker Synopsys Inc. as part of a broader engineering and design tie-up, aiming to infuse its AI-computing technology into more industries.

Nvidia purchased the shares at $414.79 each, the companies said in a statement on Monday. The stake represents 2.6% of Synopsys’ outstanding stock.

California-based Synopsys is one of the largest providers of software and services used to design electronic components. It aids with designing the complex layout of billions of transistors and connectors for modern chips, and also verifies that hardware will work as intended before the production stage. That process is used to build the chips needed in artificial intelligence systems, such as those sold by Nvidia.

The new partnership involves integrating Nvidia’s tools into Synopsys’ chip-design applications. The companies also will deploy AI agents and work on joint marketing.

[TEXT]
We recently published 10 Stocks Stealing the Spotlight Early as Christmas Looms. NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) is one of the top performers on Tuesday.

NXP Semiconductors extended its rally for a fourth consecutive day on Tuesday, jumping 7.95 percent to close at $215.35 apiece as investors continued to load portfolios ahead of the deadline to be included in the next quarterly dividend payment.

According to NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI), it would distribute an interim dividend of $1.014 per share to all its ordinary shareholders as of the December 10 record date, payable on January 7, 2026.

The dividends would be subject to a 15 percent withholding tax for Dutch residents. Non-Dutch resident shareholders may be entitled to a full or a partial refund depending on their circumstances.

In the third quarter of the year, NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) dropped its net income attributable to shareholders by 12 percent to $631 million from 718 million in the same period last year. Revenues were down by 2 percent to $3.17 billion from $3.25 billion year-on-year, but were within the company’s previous outlook.

Despite the dismal performance, NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) said that it experienced broad-based sequential improvement across all regions and end markets.

“Our outlook reflects the strength of our company-specific growth drivers and signs of a cyclical recovery. We remain focused on disciplined investment and portfolio enhancement to drive profitable growth, while maintaining control over the factors we can influence,” said NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) President and CEO Rafael Sotomayor.

While we acknowledge the potential of NXPI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

[TITLE]Gulf region aims to become digital data hub – DW – 12:
[TEXT]
Qatar and Saudi Arabia are investing in new terrestrial cable systems to relieve the strain on underwater cables in the Red Sea. This is part of a fundamental modernization strategy.

Ooredoo, a Qatar-based communications company, plans to spend $500 million (€430 million) on new terrestrial fiber optic cable systems in the coming years. The cables will stretch from the Arabian Peninsula to Europe. According to a report by the Qatari news agency QNA, they will start in Oman, run from there to Iraq and Turkey and finally to France.

Notwithstanding, according to press reports, Syria and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to build a similar system of data cables that would also run from the Arabian Peninsula — more precisely, Saudi Arabia — to Europe.

Ayad Al-Ani, a Professor for Change Management and Consulting in Berlin, told DW that it was noteworthy that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were attempting to establish a land connection.

"This implies that both Iraq and Syria are safe transit countries that can be invested in," he said. "It will integrate the two countries more into the international data communication system, from which the local digital economy will benefit. This is likely to promote their economic development."

Alternative routes to bypass Red Sea challenges

According to QNA, Aziz Al Uthman Fakhroo, CEO of Ooredoo, suggested at a conference in Doha that the system would "strengthen the resilience of global networks, create alternative routes that bypass current challenges in the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz."

From the perspective of network operators, both sea regions are considered risky. The Strait of Hormuz separates Iran from the Arabian Peninsula and, therefore, from countries with which Tehran has had a fierce rivalry, namely Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Iran has had several confrontations with Saudi Arabia in particular in the Straight of Hormuz. Qatar, meanwhile, maintains good relations with Iran.

The situation in the Red Sea is more fragile. Every year, 22,000 ships pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait that connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. It's also a main route in the digital network: There are currently 15 intercontinental undersea cables running through the area, and according to HGC Global Communications, 80% of data traffic between Asia, Africa and Europe runs through them.

The cables have repeatedly been the target of attacks — or might have been, because there is not always clear evidence of damage having been caused deliberately.

There were several outages in 2008 when, according to a study by the Henry Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington, five cables were damaged in different incidents. Three of the cables connected Asia and Europe, and as a result 70% of Egypt's internet connectivity was temporarily lost, while India experienced a 50% to 60% loss of bandwidth.

Houthi attacks on shipping routes and cable systems

In the recent war between Israel and the militant Islamist group Hamas in Gaza, the latter received support from the Houthi rebel group in Yemen. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the EU, the US and others.

Houthis attacked hundreds of ships in the Red Sea to disrupt international trade. According to HGC, the group also damaged four cable systems in the spring of 2024, including the Asia-Africa-Europe 1 cable, which connects the three continents. A good quarter of data traffic was reportedly affected.

In a statement, HGC described how it was maintaining international communication by rerouting data traffic to Europe via mainland China, the US or undamaged cables in the Red Sea.

The idea is that the new systems will prevent such incidents. According to the QNA report, Aziz Al Uthman Fakhroo of Ooredoo said that "cross-border cooperation has become both an operational and strategic necessity, especially given that the Middle East is a global logistical and digital hub, with 30% of the world's data and 90% of the data exchanged between Europe and Asia passing through it."

Qatar expands telecommunications sector

Qatar is systematically expanding its telecommunications industry. Last fall, Qatar National Broadband Network (QNBN) and Gulf Bridge International (GBI) announced their intention to merge their telecommunications divisions. This merger has now been completed. QNBN specializes in fiber optic cables, while GBI focuses on underwater and terrestrial cables.

The Peninsula, an English-language daily in Qatar, reported that the "integration of QNBN and GBI brings together two highly complementary businesses to create a carrier-neutral digital and AI infrastructure leader, further connecting Qatar to the world."

Ayad Al-Ani pointed out that the projects were not focused only on infrastructure but also on Qatari digital technology, such as data centers.

"The infrastructure alone is already considered a significant source of revenue today. But in conjunction with data and innovation centers, it provides the prerequisites for a successful digital economy," he told DW.

According to GBI, Qatar is currently trying to attract innovative AI companies from Europe and Asia and to offer a "seamless gateway to interconnect within the Middle East region," the Gulf Times reported in October 2024. "The combined company will focus on maximizing opportunities within the international data traffic market," the Qatar-based English-language newspaper continued. "By leveraging its combined resources and expertise, the company aims to position itself as a key player…, driving innovation and expanding its presence globally to meet increasing demand for data connectivity across borders."

Ayad Al-Ani said that Qatar, like Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, was also looking to the post-fossil fuel era by creating these systems.

"The region also has almost unlimited solar energy, which is relatively inexpensive, for operating data centers," he said. "This is a significant advantage in this energy-intensive industry. No additional nuclear power plants are needed, as is the case in the US, for example."
