[TITLE]Washington’s $80-Billion Nuclear Play Targets AI’s Energy Hunger:
[TEXT]
The Trump Administration is following through on its pledge to revive America’s nuclear energy with a strategic partnership with Westinghouse and Cameco to help build large-scale nuclear power plants in the U.S. with a total investment of at least $80 billion.

In the landmark agreement, Cameco Corporation, Brookfield Asset Management, and Westinghouse Electric Company have entered into a binding term sheet with the United States Department of Commerce to establish a strategic partnership, which is expected to accelerate the global deployment of Westinghouse’s nuclear reactor technologies. The partnership is also aimed at reinvigorating supply chains and the nuclear power industrial base in the U.S. and abroad.

Brookfield and Cameco acquired Westinghouse in November 2023.

Under the new strategic partnership, the U.S. Government will be granted a participation interest, which, once vested, will entitle it to receive 20% of any cash distributions in excess of US$17.5 billion made by Westinghouse. For the Participation Interest to vest, the U.S. Government must make a final investment decision and enter into definitive agreements to complete the construction of new Westinghouse nuclear reactors in the U.S. with an aggregate value of at least $80 billion.

Each two-unit Westinghouse AP1000 project creates or sustains 45,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in 43 states, and a national deployment will create more than 100,000 construction jobs, Westinghouse says.

“The program will cement the United States as one of the world’s nuclear energy powerhouses and increase exports of Westinghouse’s nuclear power generation technology globally,” the reactor manufacturer said.

Connor Teskey, President of Brookfield Asset Management, commented, “This partnership with the U.S. Government will help unlock the potential that Westinghouse and nuclear energy can play to accelerate the growth of artificial intelligence in the United States, while meeting growing electricity demand and energy security needs at scale.”

The strategic partnership follows a May 2025 executive order in which U.S. President Donald Trump said that “In conjunction with domestic fossil fuel production, nuclear energy can liberate America from dependence on geopolitical rivals,” in a clear message which energy sources the Administration prefers to power America’s soaring electricity demand.

The Trump Administration gave an additional boost to an already revitalizing nuclear power industry.

Last year, Constellation Energy signed its largest-ever power purchase agreement with Microsoft, which paved the way for the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant.

This year, Constellation, the biggest nuclear power operator in the U.S., signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Meta for the output of the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois.

Talen Energy signed a deal with Amazon to provide carbon-free energy from Talen’s Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania to Amazon Web Services data centers in the region.

And just this week, NextEra Energy and Google announced an agreement to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa—the state’s only nuclear facility—to help meet soaring U.S. electricity demand driven by AI and data center growth.

The biggest hyperscalers are signing PPAs from operational and restarted nuclear power plants, but they are also betting on the next-generation of nuclear technology—the small modular reactors (SMR) believed to be simpler and cheaper to build and install.

The new nuclear age is upon us, experts at the Goldman Sachs Global Institute wrote in an analysis last month.

Globally, data center power demand is projected to surge by 165% by 2030, bringing total data center capacity to about 137 GW—about 60% of which will need to be met with new generation capacity, according to Goldman Sachs Research.

Nuclear can play a major role in this, as hyperscalers, while largely turning to natural gas, are also looking to use sustainable power sources, while avoiding the intermittency issues of wind and solar, Goldman Sachs said.

In recent decades, the U.S. has allowed its domestic nuclear industry and supply chains to erode, while China and Russia have taken the lead in global nuclear reactor investment and installation, Goldman Sachs Global Institute noted.

In the United States, the last two domestic reactors built at Georgia’s Plant Vogtle took about 15 years to complete and cost more than $35 billion. That’s more than double the initial projections of $14 billion.

The U.S. still leads the world in terms of installed nuclear capacity, but the current operating licenses of most U.S. reactors are set to expire in the 2030s.

The $80-billion strategic partnership could go a long way toward helping the U.S. meet part of the AI demand with new nuclear power generation.

As Goldman Sachs Global Institute said, “success will depend on whether nations can build the infrastructure and partnerships necessary, with the right capital solutions in place, to support a robust nuclear industry.”

[TITLE]Trump tariffs to raise costs, delay oil and gas projects in 2026, report says:
[TEXT]
US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are set to raise operating costs, disrupt supply chains and weaken investment momentum for the oil and gas industry in 2026, a report published by Deloitte showed on Wednesday.

Why it’s important

The energy industry relies heavily on global supply chains and internationally sourced materials such as drilling rigs, valves, compressors and specialised steel are central to their operations.

US tariffs on these components and other key input materials, including steel, aluminum and copper, could increase material and service costs across the value chain by 4 per cent to 40 per cent, potentially compressing industry margins, the report said.

Context

The US has imposed tariffs on a wide range of imports, including 10 per cent to 25 per cent on crude feedstocks not covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and 50 per cent on steel, aluminum and copper.

The tariffs could reshape the oil and gas industry’s cost structure and add uncertainty around feedstock sourcing, Deloitte said in its report.

Key points

Inflation and financial uncertainty sparked by the tariffs could push final investment decisions (FIDs) and offshore greenfield projects worth more than $50 billion to 2026 or later.

As a result, operators may struggle to recover higher costs, which could eventually dampen investment activity in the sector, the report said.

As input costs climb and cascade through the value chain in the form of pricing adjustments, Deloitte expects oil and gas companies will renegotiate contracts with escalation and force majeure clauses to share risks and limit exposure to volatility.

What’s next

The ongoing disruptions could drive companies to prioritise supply chain resilience over lowest-cost sourcing and shift to domestic or non-tariffed suppliers and use foreign trade zones or tariff reclassification to manage duties, Deloitte said.

“This shift is significant given the United States’ reliance on imports, with nearly 40 per cent of oil country tubular goods demand in 2024 met through foreign sources.”

[TITLE]Oil prices fall after US and China reach trade deal framework:
[TEXT]
By Seher Dareen

LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices fell on Monday, pressured by scepticism that a U.S. and Chinese trade deal framework would immediately boost oil demand and after Iraq's oil minister confirmed an oilfield fire had not affected the OPEC member’s oil exports.

Brent crude futures were down 32 cents, or nearly 0.5%, to $65.62 a barrel at 1015 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 30 cents, also nearly 0.5%, to $61.20.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday U.S. and Chinese officials had hashed out a "substantial framework" for a trade deal that could avoid 100% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China's rare-earth export controls in trade discussions this week.

This boosted global stocks on Monday, while safe-haven gold and bonds retreated, along with oil. [MKTS/GLOB]

DEMAND CONCERNS WEIGH ON OIL

"Oil market participants are much more sceptical of trade deals than their equity counterparts. A bright negotiating atmosphere does not immediately mean demand," said PVM Oil Associates analyst John Evans.

Concerns over lacklustre demand have weighed on the market, with Brent falling to its lowest since May earlier this month, but renewed sanctions on Russia from the U.S. along with stronger-than-expected U.S. demand have helped buoy prices.

"The hope for bulls is that U.S. consumption continues to recover, otherwise it seems the drift lower seen so far today is likely to intensify," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Bank.

Meanwhile Iraq, the OPEC group's biggest overproducer, was in negotiations over the size of its quota within its available capacity of 5.5 million barrels per day, oil minister Hayan Abdel-Ghani said at an oil conference on Monday.

OPEC and its allies have changed course this year by reversing previous production cuts to regain market share, helping in part to keep a lid on oil prices.

The fire at Iraq's Zubair oilfield on Sunday did not impact exports from the country, the country's oil minister added.

Last week, Brent and WTI rose 8.9% and 7.7%, respectively, on U.S. and EU sanctions on Russia.

"There are likely some continued challenges for Russian oil to enter the market, but it depends on how sanctions will be enforced," said Rystad analyst Janiv Shah.

[TITLE]Nepal Calls for Renewable Energy Investment - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
Nepal Invites International Investment in Renewable Energy

New Delhi – The Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation, Physical Infrastructure and Transport, and Urban Development, Kulman Ghising, has called upon the international community to invest in Nepal’s hydropower and solar power, as well as other renewable energy sources. Minister Ghising highlighted that Nepal’s journey towards clean energy is entering a crucial new era.

“With immense hydropower potential, growing solar energy capacity, and expanding cross-border transmission lines and energy connections, we have the potential to sustainably energize the region,” Ghising stated. “I invite our friendly nations and partners to invest in Nepal, invest in renewable energy, and become part of a brighter and greener future for all.”

Addressing a thematic session on “Envisioning Regional and Global Interconnections for Large-Scale Clean Energy Transition,” Ghising served as a key speaker on the sustainable development of vast energy potential and the roadmap for trilateral electricity trade (Nepal-India-Bangladesh). He emphasized that Nepal’s hydropower is a strategic enabler for clean energy transformation in South Asia.

He noted that Nepal’s hydropower is a crucial resource for a resilient and stable grid in the region. Ghising highlighted Nepal’s vision to become a major exporter of clean and green energy to South Asia, with hydropower production not only contributing to the country’s development but also supporting regional sustainability. He mentioned that Nepal and India are jointly identifying and constructing high-capacity transmission line infrastructure with the goal of exporting 15,000 MW of renewable energy by 2035.

Nepal is rich in energy resources, with approximately 83,000 MW of hydropower potential and around 42,000 MW of pumped storage hydropower potential. These resources are clean, renewable, and ideally complement the solar and wind energy of Nepal’s neighboring countries, he added.

He explained that as grids develop regionally and globally, interconnected transmission networks enable the flow of renewable energy between different regions, balancing electricity demand and supply, reducing costs, and expanding access.

“This vision aligns perfectly with the ‘One Sun, One World, One Grid’ concept, where clean energy flows seamlessly and sustainably across borders,” he said. “To turn this vision into reality, regional countries must move towards an integrated electricity market.”

“Ensuring a seamless, non-discriminatory, and unrestricted flow of green energy requires transparent regulations, standardization of norms, and open access to transmission infrastructure – key elements for attracting private investment and ensuring long-term sustainability.”

Ghising emphasized that cross-border energy cooperation is at the heart of Nepal’s clean energy vision. He stressed the need to strengthen transmission infrastructure between not only Nepal and India but also India and Bangladesh to establish a fully integrated grid among the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) countries, facilitating effective regional integration of electricity.

He called for further strengthening regional and international cooperation to address and mitigate the serious damage that climate change is inflicting on electricity systems and livelihoods.

Minister Ghising stated, “Another crucial aspect of sustainability is the resilience of our energy infrastructure to cope with the increasing impacts of climate change. Although Nepal’s contribution to carbon emissions is negligible, frequent floods and droughts are causing serious damage to our electricity systems and livelihoods, often requiring large-scale reconstruction. Therefore, strengthening climate-resilient infrastructure is our national priority, and we call for further strengthening regional and international cooperation to address and mitigate these climate-induced damages.” He reiterated the importance of investment in renewable energy for a sustainable future.

[TITLE]US electric utilities entering investment ‘super-cycle,’ says Morningstar DBRS:
[TEXT]
U.S. electric utilities are entering a five-year capital expenditure “super-cycle” as they build out transmission and generation networks to meet new demand from data centers, Morningstar DBRS said in a Monday research note.

“Investment in electricity infrastructure is projected to be $1.4 trillion from 2025 to 2030, double the amount invested in the prior 10 years,” the firm said. And based on data from the North American Electric Reliability Corp., Morningstar said many regions can expect load growth to increase from previously estimated 6.1% to around 11.6% over the next decade.

“The challenges posed by the rapid buildout of data centers are overlaid on existing concerns for most utilities, including decarbonization and guaranteeing the reliability of grid infrastructure while increasing the contribution of renewable power,” Morningstar said. “The projected surge in demand provides opportunities for utilities that must be counterbalanced with structural changes and regulatory support for utilities and rate payers.”

"We anticipate that regulated utilities with supportive regulatory commissions, solid credit ratings, and access to capital markets will deploy the needed capex to take advantage of the data center boom," Bukola Folashakin, Morningstar assistant vice president of corporate ratings, said in a statement. "We expect this capex investment in turn to make such utility locations attractive for more data center construction, potentially creating a cycle of increased revenue for as long as data centers remain economically viable."

Some states — Morningstar named California, Texas, and Louisiana — will see elevated risks of resource inadequacy next year that “in extreme conditions, could trigger electricity shortfalls,” according to the note.

Morningstar’s analysis mirror’s recent capital expenditure estimates from the Edison Electric Institute, which expects U.S electricity generation to grow “for the foreseeable future.” The group, which represents investor-owned utilities, said generation rose 3% in 2024 and generation investments as a share of the industry’s total capital expenditures have risen for four straight years.

The rapid rise in electricity demand, following decades of stagnation, will challenge utilities in a few ways, according to Morningstar.

Uncertainty around needed data center capacity “makes it challenging for utilities to accurately forecast future power demand and the required investment,” according to the report. And those data centers bring demand surges that are driving “higher tolls for other customer segments,” which “will be exacerbated as more data centers become operational.”

Meeting the demand requires massive utility investment but “traditional funding sources are inadequate to meet future investment needs,” Morningstar said. “Utilities are increasingly looking to private capital to fill funding gaps,” while increased ratepayer-funded investments lead to regulatory lag.
