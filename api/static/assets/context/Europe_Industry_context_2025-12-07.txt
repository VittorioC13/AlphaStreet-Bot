[TITLE]Putin and Modi hold talks and announce expansion of Russia-India trade ties:
[TEXT]
By RAJESH ROY and AIJAZ HUSSAIN

NEW DELHI (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday at an annual summit and agreed to diversify mutual economic ties, as the United States presses India to revise its decades-old partnership with Russia.

The 23rd Russia-India Summit comes at a pivotal moment as the U.S. pushes for a Ukraine peace deal while seeking global cooperation. It will test New Delhi’s efforts to balance relations with Moscow and Washington as the nearly four-year war in Ukraine grinds on.

Putin was received by Modi at an airport in New Delhi on Thursday. The Indian leader gave Putin a bear hug and a tight handshake with the gusto of an old friend.

Leaders outline Russia-India expanding ties

After the talks, Putin and Modi announced that India and Russia have finalized an economic cooperation program until 2030, which will help diversify mutual businesses to boost annual trade to $100 billion by 2030. They also emphasized strong energy ties.

Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $68.7 billion in the last fiscal year ended March. The trade is heavily skewed in favor of Russia with deep deficits for India, which it is looking to bridge by pushing exports.

“To achieve this significant goal, a program for the development of Russian-Indian economic cooperation until 2030 has been agreed upon,” Putin said. He said work is underway on an agreement for India to establish a free trade zone with the Eurasian Economic Union, a Moscow-dominated economic grouping of several ex-Soviet nations, adding that it could help increase trade.

“Russia is a reliable supplier of energy resources and everything necessary for the development of India’s energy sector,” Putin said. “We are ready to continue ensuring the uninterrupted supply of fuel for the rapidly growing Indian economy.”

Before the summit talks, the Russian leader said the two countries “have a very trusting relationship when it comes to military-technical cooperation.”

Modi said after the talks that the two countries will work toward early conclusion of a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. He also announced that India will soon start issuing free electronic visas for Russian tourists and groups visiting the country.

The Indian leader said energy security has long anchored India-Russia ties, with civil nuclear cooperation spanning decades. He added that such cooperation will continue, alongside collaboration in clean energy, shipbuilding, fertilizers and labor mobility.

US seeks to push India away from Russia

While India has historically maintained deep ties with Russia, critics say Putin’s visit could strain relations with the European Union and the United States and might jeopardize negotiations for major trade agreements with both that are seen as critical for India’s exports.

U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50% in August, citing New Delhi’s discounted Russian oil. India has been the second biggest importer of Russian crude after China.

The U.S. says purchases of Russian oil help finance Moscow’s war machine. In October, the U.S. sanctioned two of Moscow’s biggest oil producers to force countries like India to cut down on imports. Indian officials have said New Delhi has always abided by international sanctions and would do so in the case of Russia oil purchases.

India’s foreign secretary Vikram Misri told reporters that the recent sanctions imposed on Russian oil were discussed.

Without specifying India’s position on its purchases, Misri said the government’s priority was to secure the energy needs of its 1.4 billion people.

Misri said India’s private and state-run oil companies make decisions based on evolving market dynamics and commercial issues they confront while sourcing supplies.

“We are continuing our cooperation between the two countries,” he said.

India and the U.S. set a target for the first tranche of a trade deal by the fall, but the deal hasn’t come through yet amid strains in relations, mainly because of New Delhi’s unabated imports of Russian crude.

India is also in the final stages of talks on a trade agreement with the EU, which sees Russia’s war in Ukraine as a major threat.

Given the timing and geopolitical context, Putin’s India visit “underscores New Delhi’s strategic tightrope walk between the West and the rest, chiefly Russia,” said Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group.

Donthi said India’s tilt toward Russia dates back to the Cold War and persists despite its official nonaligned position. “The significant change now is its desire to be a strategic partner with the U.S. at the same time, which will be a diplomatic challenge,” he added.

Defense and trade expansion on cards

Indian officials earlier said that Modi in the meeting with Putin would push for faster delivery of two further Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. It has already received three under a 2018 deal worth

[TITLE]Putin Promises India ‘Uninterrupted’ Oil and Joint Weapons Production:
[TEXT]
Russian President Vladimir Putin promised an “uninterrupted” supply of cheap oil to India after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, defying President Donald Trump’s effort to use tariff pressure to get India to stop funding Putin’s war machine in Ukraine.

“Russia is a reliable supplier of oil, gas, coal – everything required for the development of India’s energy,” Putin boasted at his meeting with Modi.

“We are ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel for the fast-growing Indian economy,” he promised.

President Donald Trump imposed a punitive tariff rate of 25 percent on India in August for buying Russian oil, piled atop the 25 percent general tariff rate for India.

Trump noted at the time that India has “always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of energy, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to stop the killing in Ukraine.”

In October, Trump announced sanctions against Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The sanctions included penalties for third parties who did business with either company. The Russian companies were forced to sell off some of their overseas assets as a result, and Russian oil revenue fell by over $13 billion between October and November.

Modi’s government has always insisted it had the right to buy oil from any supplier and criticized the U.S. for penalizing India while giving Europe a pass for buying Russian energy products. Putin made a similar argument when he arrived in New Delhi on Thursday by criticizing the United States for continuing to purchase Russian uranium.

Despite the defiant rhetoric from both India and Russia, India’s purchases of Russian oil have sharply declined under Trump’s tariff and sanctions pressure. India’s crude oil imports are projected to hit a three-year low in December.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov hinted this week that the decline in Indian oil imports was “insignificant” in the long term, because it would only last for “a very brief period of time.” He hinted that Moscow was working on a method of subverting U.S. sanctions that would enable India to resume heavy oil purchases.

“We have deep experience in performing under the regime of these illegal sanctions. We have our own technologies in doing that. We will continue to make those technologies more sophisticated should this practice of sanctions continue,” Peskov threatened on Tuesday.

In an interview with Russian state media on Friday, Peskov praised India as a “great purchaser of Russian oil” that was “earning good money” by using discounted Russian products. He expressed confidence that India’s benefits from doing business with Russia would outweigh the costs of U.S. sanctions.

“It is necessary to take into account what is lost due to duties imposed, and what is gained as a result of continued purchases,” Peskov said. “If continuation of purchases is bringing you better money, why not continue?”

Putin told a Russian-Indian business forum on Friday that many other avenues of profitable trade exist between the two countries.

“The Russian delegation has come not only to talk

[TITLE]EU plan would boost ESMA powers over crypto and capital markets:
[TEXT]
The European Commission has proposed expanding the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) over crypto and broader financial markets in a bid to narrow the competitive gap with the United States.

Published Thursday, the package would transfer “direct supervisory competences” for key pieces of market infrastructure, including crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), trading venues and central counterparties, to ESMA and strengthen its coordination role in the asset management sector.

The proposal still needs approval from the European Parliament and the Council, where it is under negotiation.

If adopted, ESMA’s role in overseeing EU capital markets would more closely resemble the centralized framework of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

EU proposal aims to streamline markets and strengthen ESMA’s authority. Source: finance.ec.europa.eu

In September, France became the third European country to call for the Paris-based ESMA to take over supervision of major crypto firms, joining Austrian and Italian securities regulators.

The move followed growing criticism of Malta’s crypto licensing regime. In July, ESMA released a peer review of the Malta Financial Services Authority’s authorization of a crypto service provider, saying that the regulator only “partially met expectations.”

Due to concerns over more lenient regulations in some jurisdictions, France has also threatened to block the “passporting” of European licenses obtained from member states, raising enforcement gaps

[TITLE]Integrated capital markets and centralised supervision key to urgent investments in Europe:
[TEXT]
Today, the European Commission has presented its new legislative package to promote further integration of capital markets and to centralise supervision in the EU. The Socialists and Democrats welcome it as an important, necessary step to reap the full benefits of the single market and ensure the urgently needed massive investments in Europe.

Over a year ago, Mario Draghi, former Italian prime minister and president of the European Central Bank, warned in his report on competitiveness that Europe needs €800 billion in annual investments, an amount that cannot be met through bank financing alone. He also emphasised the need to improve European competitiveness through measures such as supervisory simplification.

The S&D Group has long called for further integration and completion of the EU’s Capital Markets Union, including giving European supervisory authorities direct oversight of large cross-border financial firms.

This is crucial, as the persistent national fragmentation in Europe’s capital markets severely limits the benefits that can be gained from the EU’s single market. According to the International Monetary Fund, internal barriers in financial services alone act as the equivalent to a tariff of over 100 percent.

[TITLE]Calystron Capital Announces Strategic Global Expansion Across Europe and Asia:
[TEXT]
DENVER, Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Calystron Capital today announced a new phase of international expansion, marking an important milestone in the firm’s long-term vision to build a global investment presence supported by advanced technology and cross-market expertise. This initiative centers on deepening the firm’s footprint in Europe—particularly in Spain and Germany—while simultaneously accelerating entry into key Asian markets including Singapore and Japan. Together, these regions represent growing financial hubs with increasing investor demand, regulatory openness to innovation, and strong alignment with Calystron Capital’s technology-driven investment philosophy.

Christopher Ellington, Chief Investment Advisor of Calystron Capital, emphasized that globalization is not only a strategic choice but a natural extension of the firm’s core competencies. With more than thirty years of experience across major financial centers, Ellington noted that global markets are becoming increasingly interconnected, making cross-regional diversification a requirement rather than an option. “Our clients need access to opportunities beyond their home markets,” Ellington said. “Global allocation is no longer optional. It is essential for risk management, resilience, and long-term performance. A truly modern investment architecture must operate across borders.”

Calystron Capital’s expansion is anchored by two defining advantages. The first is the firm’s technology-driven investment infrastructure, which integrates the Calystron Quant Framework™ with the Calystron AI Trading System™. Together, these systems generate data-rich strategies, multi-market liquidity intelligence, high-frequency analytics, and adaptive execution models capable of responding to rapidly shifting environments. This technological backbone allows the firm to monitor global capital flows, cross-asset behavior, and macroeconomic transitions with precision, enabling more sophisticated portfolio construction for clients across diverse regions.

The second advantage lies in Calystron Capital’s approach to combining localized expertise with global oversight. By establishing specialized teams in European and Asian markets, the firm aims to directly understand local investor behavior, evolving regulations, and emerging sector opportunities—while still applying the disciplined standards and risk framework developed in the U.S. institutional market. This blend of local insight and international perspective is designed to create a more robust, diversified investment ecosystem that can adapt to global and regional cycles alike.

As part of its global strategy, Calystron Capital also intends to guide U.S. investors toward broader international diversification—especially in fast-growing European and Asian industries—while helping international investors gain access to the depth, liquidity, and stability of U.S. capital markets. According to Ellington, this two-way flow of capital is becoming increasingly important. “We want to build a bridge between markets,” he said. “Our role is to help clients navigate that bridge with clarity, discipline, and intelligent technology. The future of capital management lies in global mobility and intelligent allocation.”

Looking ahead, the firm expects its expansion to accelerate over the coming year as new research hubs, trading nodes, and advisory teams begin operations across Europe and Asia. With technology and financial expertise serving as its dual engines, Calystron Capital aims to position itself as a central connector between intelligent capital and the world’s major financial regions, shaping a future where innovation and global access define long-term wealth creation.

[TITLE]Egypt’s economy stabilises, but poverty challenges persist:
[TEXT]
Egypt found itself back on the international front pages in the second half of this year. The country played host to the Sharm el-Sheikh conference in October when US President Donald Trump rallied global and regional powers alike behind his ceasefire plan for the Gaza Strip. Shortly after, in November, Cairo invited world leaders to attend the spectacular opening of the new Grand Egyptian Museum next to the pyramids.

Amid these eye-catching events, other domestic developments have received less attention. Most notable were Egypt’s parliamentary elections, with the first round held in November, and runoffs planned for early December.

The elections have been dominated by a coalition of pro-government parties running unopposed for the party list seats, which are half of the parliamentary seats being voted for. Individual candidates can run for the other half of the seats in contention, but those seats are difficult to win for candidates without the necessary financial resources and connections.

Critics, therefore, believe that the race is essentially only between loyalists to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, with a group of Egyptian human rights groups saying that the elections had occurred “under chronic and severe restrictions on meaningful political participation”.

With that context in mind, the elections have not attracted a groundswell of attention from Egyptians, continuing a pattern since el-Sisi took power in the country more than a decade ago, after a coup against Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi.

“They are even less important than under [former President Hosni] Mubarak, it is not the talk of the day,” said a businessman in the textile industry, who did not wish to give their full name for fear of reprisals. “There are fewer banners and posters than during previous elections.”

Capital injections

In the shadow of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, it is often forgotten that less than two years ago, Egypt experienced the worst economic crisis seen under el-Sisi. Billions of dollars worth of capital injections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the European Union, and massive investment pledges from the UAE in early 2024 prevented an economic crisis in Egypt.

Leading to the question, how is Egypt’s economy faring now? On paper, the picture looks promising. Recently, Egypt’s credit rating was upgraded, GDP growth is increasing, skyrocketing inflation rates that battered the population for years have cooled down, and investment from the Gulf continues. For example, Qatar is planning to develop a prime coastal strip near el-Alamein on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, not far from a similar UAE-funded project now under construction.

Earlier this year, the IMF completed its fourth review of Egypt’s economic reforms as part of conditions attached to its loan, and distributed a further $1.2bn – part of a loan worth $8bn in total, of which Egypt has now withdrawn $3.2bn.

The IMF continues to voice concern

[TITLE]Integra pitches $386M deal to remake Miami-Dade public housing site:
[TEXT]
Integra Solutions wants to take on one of Miami-Dade’s biggest public housing overhauls, proposing a $385.9 million redevelopment that would quintuple density on a 12-acre Brownsville site while layering in a wide spread of income-restricted units.

The Miami-based developer is asking the county for a 99-year ground lease and master development agreement to raze and rebuild the aging Annie Coleman 15 complex with 905 apartments, the South Florida Business Journal reported. The proposal heads to the county’s Housing Committee next week.

The site, at 2200 and 2501 N.W. 57th Street, holds 144 public housing units built in 1965. Integra also has a small adjacent parcel under contract, which it aims to fold into the plan.

Miami-Dade began shopping the property in 2023 as part of a broader push to modernize its public housing stock. These deals typically blend replacement public housing with deeper affordability and workforce units, but they require federal approval, adding time and complexity.

Integra estimates construction at $270.1 million, spread across three phases. The public housing delivered would allow all of the existing tenants to stay in place.

How Modern Aerospace Materials Are Used in the Industry

For nearly a century, aluminum was the dominant material in aerospace manufacturing, chosen for its light weight, strength and relatively low cost. It defined the first generation of all-metal aircraft and continued to serve as the backbone of aerospace engineering for decades. Today, however, the material mix looks very different.

Modern jets contain significantly less pure aluminum, with many noncritical structures, such as paneling and interior components, replaced by advanced composites like carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) and honeycomb materials.

At the same time, critical components such as engine parts demand metals that can balance lighter weight with the ability to withstand extreme heat and stress. This has led to wider adoption of titanium alloys, high-performance superalloys, and other advanced materials that were once considered too costly or difficult to machine.

For manufacturers and machine shops, these changes bring both challenges and opportunities. Toolmakers and equipment providers must keep pace with evolving material requirements, developing solutions that can handle tougher machining conditions, extend tool life and support efficiency goals across the aerospace supply chain.
