[TEXT]
The Department of Anthropology at the University of Hyderabad will be participating in an international project aimed at addressing the environmental and health impacts of single-use plastics in healthcare.

The “After the Single Use” project, funded by the Wellcome Trust with a £5.9 million Discovery Award, brings together a global team of researchers from eight countries to explore the cultural, social, and environmental dimensions of medical plastics and promote circular healthcare economies.

Led by Nanda Kishore Kannuri, Associate Professor in the Department of Anthropology, UoH, will receive a grant of £422,608 (approximately ₹5 crore) over a five-year period to contribute to this significant initiative.

The project will examine the historical, local, and global factors that have shaped the current healthcare waste crisis, analyze the life cycles of disposable medical technologies, and collaborate with policymakers, activists, engineers, and designers to develop sustainable solutions.

“This collaboration represents a significant opportunity for the University of Hyderabad to contribute to a global initiative at the intersection of anthropology, environmental sustainability, and healthcare,” Nanda Kishore Kannuri.

“We look forward to working with our international partners to develop innovative solutions that can be applied in diverse healthcare settings,’‘ he added.

The “After the Single Use” project involves a global team of collaborators from the University of Edinburgh (UK), University of New South Wales (Australia), University of Geneva (Switzerland), University of Oslo (Norway), National Institute of Medical Research (Tanzania), CRCF (Senegal), PNG Institute of Medical Research (Papua New Guinea), and Johns Hopkins University (USA), as well as key NGO partners Health Care Without Harm and the Norwegian Bioart Arena.
