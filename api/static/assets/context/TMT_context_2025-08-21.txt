[TITLE]Softbank reportedly considered buying Intel's foundry division outright before investing $2 billion into the company as equity:
[TEXT]
SoftBank today announced its intent to purchase a historic $2 billion worth of Intel shares—a roughly 2% stake—making it one of the largest shareholders of the American chipmaker. However, the Financial Times reports that just days before the deal was inked, Softbank actually considered buying Intel's foundry division outright.

This follows another unprecedented report that the White House is considering a 10% stake in Intel, utilizing grants from the CHIPS Act and converting them into equity.

Intel received that CHIPS Act money on the promise of never spinning off the fabs the funds directly impacted, as they serve an important geopolitical role in the race for bleeding-edge semiconductors. Intel is one of the last companies in the cutting-edge process race with TSMC, whose roots in Taiwan have provoked long-simmering concerns

[TITLE]A lifeline for Intel: The company gets $2 billion equity investment amidst financial problems:
[TEXT]
Softbank closed an agreement to acquire $2 billion in common shares, becoming the sixth-largest shareholder. The Trump administration is reportedly considering acquiring a 10% stake in Intel.

4 Reviews ← exclude selected types

After closing 2024 with losses of $18.8 billion, Intel is getting a capital injection after the Japanese SoftBank and the chipmaker signed an agreement that will guarantee $2 billion investment in Intel’s common stock.

The investment comes as a ‘lifeline’ for the chip manufacturer, which has faced problems keeping up with manufacturers like TSMC. The terms of this agreement include that SoftBank will not seek to have a seat on the board.

The deal states that SoftBank will pay $23 per Intel common stock share, down from the closing market price on Monday of $23,66. After this, SoftBank became the sixth-largest shareholder of the US company, which, according to an Intel spokesperson, acquired under 2% of Intel shares, as Reuters informed.

“Semiconductors are the foundation of every industry. For more than 50 years, Intel has been a trusted leader in innovation. This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role,” said Masayoshi Son, Chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group.

The agreement comes after reports of interest of the Trump administration to acquire 10% of Intel’s stake. According to reports, this investment would be made under the CHIPS Act. This would require over $10 billion in shares.

Under this Act, Intel has received around $10.9 billion in grants. This way, the US seeks to expand American semiconductor manufacturing and depend less on other countries.

[TITLE]Satcom: India’s game-changer for inclusivity:
[TEXT]
India’s satellite communication (Satcom) sector is poised for a historic leap. A flood of proactive Government initiatives, massive private investments, cutting-edge space-tech breakthroughs, and surging demand are pushing it into the national spotlight. The IN-SPACe/Industry Decadal Vision is for capture of 8 per cent of the global market by the Indian space economy reaching $44 billion by 2033 with Satcom contributing a staggering $14.8 billion by then.

By December 2025, India could witness a tidal wave of Satcom services from new entrants. Heavyweights like Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb, Reliance Jio-SES, Elon Musk’s Starlink and Amazon Kuiper are actively pursuing full approvals and spectrum for launch of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) services.

Satcom spectrum isn’t like terrestrial mobile networks. Satcom operates on shared spectrum, coordinated globally by ITU, Geneva to prevent interference. Almost all countries, including the US, Mexico, and Brazil, allocate it administratively — a proven, globally accepted method. Attempts at auctions have mostly failed.

The Telecommunications Act 2023 rightly stipulates administrative assignment for Satcom. However, it is also important to have the price set low otherwise it could choke investment and derail India’s inclusivity goals for connecting the unconnected. The fee should be purely cost-based — which is actually only 0.1–0.2 per cent of revenue — just enough to cover administration and regulation cost, not to make profits to fill treasury coffers.

Upfront investment

While satellites are far cheaper to build and launch than they were two decades ago — thanks to modern technologies — there is still a challenge regarding scale. Unlike terrestrial networks, a satellite constellation demands hefty upfront investment while serving markets that are less dense and less profitable. Handsets and terminals are pricier too. This is why Satcom should never be seen as a “rival” to mobile networks. Their strengths are fundamentally different. Terrestrial networks thrive in dense, high-capacity urban zones. Satellites excel in remote, sparse, and tough-to-reach regions.

Think Delhi’s Metro vs. its buses — both move people but serve entirely different needs. One moves huge volumes quickly; the other reaches every last corner. Neither can replace the other — but together, they make the city truly connected. So, it is with telcos and Satcom.

Terrestrial networks have done a splendid job but there are remote locations, mountains, deserts, oceans, and forested regions where mobile towers just aren’t practical. Here, Satcom becomes the magic carpet — delivering coverage without building a single tower.

During floods, earthquakes, or cyclones, when ground infrastructure collapses, Satcom can be the only lifeline. It can plug isolated base stations back into the core telecom network. It can connect oil rigs, mining operations, and agricultural IoT systems deep in the hinterland. It can be BharatNet’s secret weapon in places where fibre simply can’t go. It can secure our borders by keeping defence forces connected in high-altitude and forward areas.

India’s digital divide still stands at 66 per cent (TRAI, March 2025). Bridging it isn’t just about fairness — it’s about unlocking economic opportunity for millions. Satcom won’t cannibalise the telecom market; it will grow the pie. By blending the reach of satellites with the capacity of terrestrial networks, India can achieve true universal and meaningful connectivity. The best way forward would be to allocate spectrum expeditiously with no overpricing that scares away investment and encourage peaceful coexistence and coopetition — not false competition — between terrestrial and satellite operators. The common goal of all should be to leverage Satcom for national missions like Digital India, BharatNet, disaster management, and defence.

Satcom is not a competitor — it’s a force multiplier. If we get the policy, pricing, and partnerships right, India could genuinely enjoy the best of both worlds: the power of terrestrial networks and the reach of the skies. The opportunity is here. The technology is ready. The players are primed. All that remains is for India to give the final go-ahead — and let Satcom take off to bridge India’s divide.

[TITLE]OECD slams broadband inequality in Australia:
[TEXT]
A new OECD report highlights how Australia’s broadband system, once ambitious, is now fuelling inequality, especially for rural and low-income communities. Paul Budde reports.

WHILE THE WORLD is surfing faster than ever, not everyone is catching the wave equally. A new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report reveals that although broadband connectivity is improving globally, the gap between urban and rural areas is not only persisting — it’s widening. For Australia, these findings offer both a warning and a call to action.

Global progress, local disparity

The OECD’s latest report, Closing Broadband Connectivity Divides for All: From Evidence to Practice, presents a sobering look at the uneven spread of digital infrastructure. It confirms that broadband speeds and availability have improved dramatically across OECD countries. Median fixed broadband speeds more than tripled between 2019 and 2024 — from 53 Mbps to 178 Mbps.

However, this overall growth masks deepening disparities. In 2019, the speed gap between urban and rural regions was 22 Mbps. By 2024, it had jumped to 58 Mbps. Fixed download speeds in metropolitan areas were, on average, 44% higher than in regions far from urban centres.

The OECD attributes these widening gaps to the economics of network deployment, a persistent urban bias in infrastructure investment and inconsistent policy implementation across countries. Even mobile networks, which were once expected to narrow access gaps, have seen similar patterns, with rural areas lagging behind in speed, latency and service consistency.

This report is based on novel data from 61 countries, with detailed subnational analyses provided by industry sources such as Ookla, Opensignal and GSMA Intelligence.

Australia: A unique model under scrutiny

Australia’s broadband infrastructure has long drawn attention internationally due to the scale and complexity of its National Broadband Network (NBN). The OECD acknowledges this in its analysis, pointing to Australia’s use of 121 Points of Interconnect (POIs) as a unique feature. These POIs were intended to ensure nationwide access and provider competition, but in practice, they have created chokepoints and regional disparities.

The report reflects several criticisms I have made over the years, particularly regarding the inefficiencies introduced by Australia’s mixed-technology model and the resulting underperformance in regional areas. The abandonment of the original fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) plan in favour of copper, hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC), wireless and satellite solutions left large parts of the country with second-tier infrastructure. These decisions have led to network inefficiencies that are now being exposed as fibre becomes the global benchmark.

As I have previously written, this shift away from full fibre created a system that is more expensive to maintain and upgrade, and less capable of supporting future demand. The OECD now echoes this concern by emphasising how poor infrastructure choices can deepen digital divides, even in otherwise wealthy and well-connected nations.

In terms of fibre uptake, Australia continues to trail behind its OECD peers. In 2023, only

[TITLE]‘One of the most challenging periods in Spark’s history’: Telco takes big profit hit, reveals new five-year plan:
[TEXT]
Spark, which had set the aim of shaving $50m from its labour costs, revealed that its workforce was cut by “approximately 1300 full-time employees at the end of FY2025 [June 30]” for a new total of 4043 as roles were eliminated or went to outsourcing and offshoring firms.

The profit crunch was within revised-down guidance and close to analysts’ consensus expectation.

And the telco predicted a more stable FY2026 after its recent accelerated cost-cutting - which hit $85m in the second half - and asset sales.

FY2026 dividend will be lower

The full-year dividend was 25 cents per share - in line with revised-down guidance (from the original 27.5cps) and ahead of the analyst consensus 24cps.

Spark said 100% of FY2026 free cash flow (a forecast $290-$330m), which a Spark spokeswoman said translated to 15 to 17cps. Craigs had been expecting a dip, but to 18cps.

The telco also revealed a new five-year strategy, dubbed “SPK 30″, which it said would deliver a “capital management reset that refocuses Spark on its core connectivity business”.

SPK-30 was outlined in very broad strokes today.

“The strategy includes four key focus areas – growing core connectivity, simplifying and optimising beyond the core, and delivering a better network and better customer experiences.

“These priorities are enabled by a focus on people and culture, embedding technologies such as AI across Spark, disciplined financial management, and an enduring commitment to sustainability,” the telco said in an NZX filing.

Spark says a “Process has commenced to introduce new investors” to Mattr, its digital identity spinout that recently won a key contract for a new digital wallet and ID system that people will use to interact with Government departments.

In-line operating earnings, flat guidance

Reported ebitdai was $1.053b, just a whisker shy of the analyst consensus $1.054b. FY2026 guidance was for operating earnings of $1.02-$1.08b or $1.01-$1.07b excluding its now spun-out data centre business.

Revenue fell 2.5% to $3.75b.

Total capital expenditure fell 17.2% to $429m. Spark said “business as usual” capex would fall to $380-$420m in FY2026 - excluding $50-$70m in “strategic capex” for data centre expansion, which will now be shared with a new majority owner.

Mobile down sharply in govt, corporate

Mobile service revenue declined 2.3% to $987m, “driven by price competition in enterprise and government and consumer prepaid,” Spark said in an NZX filing. Small business and consumer numbers grew in the second half, the telco said.

Mobile revenue from consumer and small-to-medium business customers was down 0.9% from $869m to $861m for the full year. On a conference call, CEO Jolie Hodson said the telco was three weeks into $2 to $5 per month increases for the segment with “low churn”.

At the top end of town, there was continued pain, with mobile revenue from enterprise and government falling 17% from $120m to $100m.

Spark said total FY2025 mobile market growth was 1.2%, which it said was lower than market researcher IDC’s 3% pick. One bright spot: Growth picked up to 1.9% in the second half.

Continued weakness in IT services

IT services revenue continued to be a pain point, falling 7.7% to $144m.

Broadband revenue fell 0.8% to $608 million.

Cloud revenues grew 4.4% to $235 million “as public cloud uptake continued to increase”.

Data centre growth, sale

Data centres revenue grew 11.1% to $50 million.

On August 12, Spark said it had sold 75% of its data centre operations to Australian Pacific Equity Partners in a deal that values the business at $705 million.

The telco will get $486m cash, with a further $98m - for a total $584m - in FY2027 if performance targets are hit.

The proceeds will go to paying debt, the company said in an NZX filing. Spark had net debt of $2.74b as of December 31, 2024 and $2.13b as of June 30, 2025.

[TITLE]Lumen lights up 400GB datacentre connectivity to fuel AI:
[TEXT]
Lumen Technologies has made major enhancements to datacentre and cloud connectivity across its US network, with a strategic expansion capable of turbocharging metro markets with high-speed datacentre connectivity.

The upgrade enables it to deliver “blazing-fast”, secure, cost-efficient infrastructure with up to 400Gbps Ethernet and IP Services at more than 70 third-party, cloud on-ramp ready datacentres across 16 highly connected metros.

Locations include Northern Virginia, Atlanta, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City, Phoenix, Portland, San Jose and Seattle. San Antonio is targeted to be added in the fourth quarter of 2025.

With the new fibre network, customers are said to be able to turn up services as needed – provisioning bandwidth in minutes, scaling up to 400Gbps and only paying for what they use.

This, says Lumen, will make it easy to connect to datacentres and cloud on-ramps, scale enterprise applications, and respond to fluctuating AI and data-intensive demands and next-generation enterprise workloads, all while managing costs.

Services available include: Ethernet On-Demand connectivity activated in real-time; Internet On-Demand, scalable internet access, when and where it’s needed; E-Line, point-to-point Ethernet for secure, predictable data transport; E-LAN multipoint-to-multipoint Ethernet for “seamless” site interconnectivity; and E-Access, simplified access to broader Ethernet networks for enterprise reach.

Because it owns and operates the underlying network, Lumen believes customers can benefit from greater control, reliability and performance.

Ghassan Abdo, vice-president of research and worldwide telecommunications at research firm IDC, said: “Lumen’s network investment in bringing high-speed connectivity to key datacentres is a strategic move to meet the growing demand for more capacity and reach across datacentres, anticipating customer needs amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom where network is emerging as an indispensable resource. This expansion supports AI-first planning and multi-cloud architectures, ensuring a high-performance environment for business applications, which are the lifeblood of digital enterprises.”

Lumen chief revenue officer Ashley Haynes-Gaspar added: “This investment isn’t just about faster datacentre connectivity – it’s about creating the digital foundation for an AI-first economy. We’re giving customers what they need most: performance, flexibility and speed at scale – whether they’re turning up a single connection or orchestrating thousands of AI workloads across metro markets.

“As enterprises race to harness the power of AI, Lumen is building the network foundation they need to move faster, scale smarter and stay ahead. We’re not just keeping up with digital transformation, we’re helping our customers lead it.”

The announcement comes just weeks after Lumen announced it will provide the terrestrial backhaul connectivity for the Juno Trans-Pacific cable system. Operated by Seren Juno Network Co, the Juno cable is 10,000km long and is engineered to deliver up to 350 Tbps across 20 fibre pairs, using next-generation space division multiplexing technology.

Lumen’s dark fibre backhaul is designed to carry traffic from the cable’s US landing point in Grover Beach in California to two major points of presence in San Jose and Los Angeles, helping to “revolutionise business operations and technological advancements” in both the US and Japan. Connecting Juno at the cable landing station to two critical PoPs will help data reach major cloud hubs, datacentres and enterprise networks across the US.

[TITLE]AI boom in Australia: Amazon investment sparks debate on artificial intelligence and housing shortage – Jason Murphy:
[TEXT]
But what do we actually get for the money? Just data centres.

If I was making a list of things Australia should be doing with concrete and air-conditioning, it would not include making data centres. What we need desperately, what we are horribly short of, is homes.

House prices are zooming up, and not just from speculation.

We’ve had huge inflation in the cost of building. Building a house from scratch costs around A$500,000, depending on its size and location. Maybe as much as a million bucks. And the inflation data tell us that price is up 39% compared with 2020.

Even renovation costs a bomb. Chucking a renovation on a small old home is now an A$500,000+ activity.

Jeff Bezos' Amazon wants to build data centres in Australia. Photo / Getty Images

Why is building houses expensive? For a lot of reasons.

One is the tradie shortage. Prices for getting the plumbing and wiring and framework of a house all put in are up sharply. Concrete slabs cost a fortune now.

Australia needs new homes. Photo / Getty Images

When it comes to these data centres, Amazon is supplying the capital, the money, which is nice. But money is not something Australia is super short of.

We have trillions in the national superannuation fund that’s just plonked in the sharemarket. (In fact, we have more super funds than the whole sharemarket is worth, so we now have to invest in other countries’ sharemarkets too.)

What we are short of is skilled people. Unemployment is at a historically low 4.3% right now. Unemployment among trades workers (people whose last job was in the trades) is
