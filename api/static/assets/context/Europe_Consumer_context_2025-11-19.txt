[TITLE]South India emerges as the next big battleground for value fashion retailers:
[TEXT]
BENGALURU : South India is fast becoming the next battleground for value fashion retailers, as they aim to focus on a largely untapped market with high demand for affordable and organized apparel in states with rising income, consumption patterns that support the format, and favourable store economics.

Take, for instance, the country’s fastest-growing value retailer, Trent’s Zudio. The brand has 833 stores nationwide. While Maharashtra hosts the highest number,

[TITLE]Costco Members Are The Target Of A New Money-Making Initiative:
[TEXT]
The company that brought you bargain bulk shopping, $1.50 hot dogs, and surprisingly cheap Kirkland signature products intends to make more money by encouraging membership upgrades, selling targeted third-party online advertisements on its website, and partnering with a buy now, pay later service.

Costco Wholesale executives discussed these new initiatives during a fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call with investors. Not that Costco is having a problem making money. Net income was $2.61 billion in Q4 2025, an increase of 11% from last year, Costco Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Gary Millerchip said in the September 2025 call. That includes $1.72 billion in income from membership fees, an increase of 14% from the year before, he added.

Costco aims to make additional revenue by improving its website in ways that will provide "more relevant messaging" to customers depending on what sort of membership and co-brand credit card they have, Millerchip said, per a Seeking Alpha transcript. He added: "We spent a lot of time as a team focusing on how we can continue to invest in improving the digital experience and making it more convenient for members to shop, and we've had some good progress in those areas."

[TITLE]Three Ways to Style Kate Spade’s Bestselling Handbags (and Take Advantage of Its Early Black Friday Deals):

If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

The holiday season has officially commenced (we know, we can hardly believe it!). This means that just as you might be picking out the most symmetrical and fragrant of Christmas trees at this moment, to adorn with charmingly chic baubles, so too is it the time to treat yourself to a bit of a style upgrade… and accessorize it in a way that the purchase truly deserves.

Enter Kate Spade‘s instantly covetable, trendy-yet-timeless assortment of handbags fit for all your needs and preferences. Not only does the iconic, founded-in-1993 label offer shoulder bags perfect for gifting to every woman in your life (or keeping all to yourself), Kate Spade is also coming in hot with no shortage of new jewelry, shoes, apparel, and accessories, all capable of making your bag of choice the ultimate personality statement this fall and winter.

Doubting the fact that Kate Spade bags — the status symbol of every city-dwelling young female in the early 2000s — are still “in” this year? Think again. With the likes of Ice Spice, Charli D’Amelio, influencer Rain Judge, and Laufey starring in its latest campaigns, Kate Spade has secured a firm spot for itself in our day and age: consistently releasing fashions and accessories that are quick to become TikTok-viral and end up as more of a need and not a want among tastemakers.

All your favorite celebrities have hopped on the Kate Spade bandwagon by now, with no signs of ending their love affairs with the brand that, for more than two decades, has been synonymous with a kind of preppy, feminine, and very much accessible aesthetic. Lola Tung recently stepped out with a Kate Spade crossbody while promoting “The Summer I Turned Pretty,“ making it an integral part of her press tour outfits. Olivia Rodrigo, too, has been spotted wearing the brand on multiple occasions this year alone: most recently seen hauling her Liv Shoulder Bag, donned in conjunction with an airy blouse and straight-leg jeans. And McKenna Grace carried the Duo Suede Crossbody while outside the CBS Morning Show to promote her new film “Regretting You” in New York.

All this is to say, investing in a Kate Spade handbag this season just might turn out to be your best financial decision of 2025. Every single style here, after all, manages to fuse mid-range price tags with the kinds of textures (think suedes or high-end pebbled leathers) and silhouettes (crescent-shaped crossbodies, bucket bags, slouchy ones, and the perennially popular top-handles) that have proven to be the It-things of fall/winter 2025 in top designers’ collections.

The best part? Now is the most optimal time to dive into (and shop) Kate Spade’s selections. After all, the brand has just kickstarted its early Black Friday sale, featuring 50-percent-off deals on select leather goods, 30 percent off full-price jewelry, and an additional 40 percent off everything in the sale section — all the more reason to welcome Christmastime with a lil’ splurge.

And because we’re in the business of going the extra mile for our readers, we’ve suggested three unique ways to dress up your fresh Kate Spade purchases — in a way that aligns with the leading trends while ensuring your ensembles turn every head on the street as soon as you wear them outside. Cheers to one stylish holiday!

Add the Fuzz

Pick a Charm (and Earrings for Good Measure)

Kate Spade Halo Suede Large Bucket Bag $498 Buy Now at kate spade In case you’re not yet familiar with the Kate Spade Halo Suede Large Bucket Bag, it deserves a reintroduction of sorts. By all measures, it’s quite the looker, what with the catchall’s Purple Agate colorway and suede exterior, the latter aspect securing an extremely soft underhand feel while the former takes care of things in the autumnal trends department. As far as functionality goes, the bag also stands out from the crowd on the basis of its zip and slip pocket options for all your valuables, adjustable shoulder strap, and substantial size (a 15-inch height, to be exact) that can accommodate everything from a laptop to the notebook where you house your doodles.

Now, onto the fun part — the bling! Our editors suggest pairing your buy with the top-selling Molten Glass Statement Studs from the brand. A bit of contrast play between green and purplish-red never hurt anyone, after all, and the brass-slash-cubic zirconia earrings are also quite en vogue right now, given their sculpturality. As for the adornment that deserves to be featured front-and-center on the actual Kate Spade suede bag, we have a good feeling you’ll fall in love with the Sammy Bag Charm. Though it’s not on sale for the label’s early Black Friday markdown event, every dollar of that price tag becomes worth it when you consider the charm’s serpent-inspired design (an ode to the Year of the Snake), polka dots, pop of bright green, and floral appliqué added in for bonus points.

Shown With: Kate Spade Molten Glass Statement Studs ($61.60), Kate Spade Sammy Bag Charm ($118)

Pair With Sensible Loafers, and Don’t Forget the Scarf

[TITLE]Bell shares early Black Friday “deals”:
[TEXT]
Bell has posted its Black Friday deal page, but anyone with a basic understanding of math can see that most of these plans are not good deals. If you are looking for a new phone or plan to shop on Black Friday, we often recommend checking in-store, as they usually have better deals due to local competition. This doubly applies in malls.

That said, let’s unpack Bell’s offers and see if there are any savings to be had.

The first one that appears to be an okay deal is the Google Pixel 10 Pro. The company has it down to $1 per month if you get into a two-year contract and plan to return the phone after that. However, the only plan it currently offers with that deal is $115 per month. That leaves you paying $2,784 to Bell over two years for the phone and plan, and you won’t own your phone at the end of that time. The Samsung S26 deal turns out exactly the same.

It’s actually cheaper to buy the Pixel 10 Pro without the deal for $15 per month with the $85 Bell plan, since that only amounts to $2,400. However, you still don’t own the phone at the end of your contract.

You can buy the Pixel 10 Pro outright from Google for $1,349, but you can pair it with a $50 plan from Virgin (also Bell’s coverage area), and your total two-year spend would only be $2,549. Or you could go with another provider, as the likes of Public Mobile and Freedom Mobile have even better options.

You do get more perks with the Bell plan, such as HD video streaming and 250GB of data, but I still don’t know anyone who uses that much data in a month. On average, Canadians use about 9GB per 30 days, and as a huge nerd, I might use 15GB on average per month .

I’ll also say that Google has a habit of discounting the Pixel on Black Friday, so there is a big chance that if you want a Pixel 10 Pro, you can likely find one for a few hundred dollars less than retail if you wait.

Moving on, Bell’s iPhone deal is even more transparent. The Black Friday offer is for last year’s iPhone 16, but you need to bring it back after two years and trade in an iPhone 14 to be eligible. This deal is also only available in stores, but when I called one near me, they told me it’s also locked to the $115 Ultimate plan. This means you’ll spend $2,820 on the phone/plan over two years, and again, you won’t own the phone at the end of it.

Moreover, you’ll need to pay a connection fee whether you go in-store or online. Bell is charging an $80 connection fee right now, and unlike in past years when Bell waived the entire connection fee for online orders, the company is only offering a $55 credit to be applied “within 60 days.”

You can get the iPhone 16 from Apple for $999 (or you can finance it at zero per cent). Then, if you combine that with the same $50 Virgin Plus plan I mentioned earlier, you’re at a two-year cost of $2,200. Apple rarely discounts its phones, but it usually packs in a $50 gift card if you shop on Black Friday, if you feel like waiting.

Speaking of waiting, we’re still a couple weeks out from Black Friday, so it’s likely worth waiting to see if deals get any better.

If you’re looking for more tech deals, check out our roundup of all ongoing Black Friday coverage.

[TITLE]Podcasting Market Worth USD 114 Billion by 2030 as Connected-TV, Voice Assistants, and Regional Audience Growth Gain Momentum, Reports Mordor Intelligence:
[TEXT]
Hyderabad, Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to Mordor Intelligence's latest report, the global podcasting market is set for explosive growth, rising from USD 31.49 billion in 2025 to USD 114.48 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 29.45%. This surge is being powered by the rapid expansion of video podcasts on Connected-TV platforms, the growing use of voice assistants among younger listeners, and strong regional momentum as new markets embrace digital audio. Together, these trends are accelerating podcast adoption worldwide and solidifying the medium as a mainstream channel for entertainment, learning, and brand engagement.

Emerging Trends in the Podcasting Market

Growing Use of Voice Assistants Among Young Listeners

Smart speakers adoption among Gen-Z households is becoming an important driver in the podcast market. Voice-activated devices are reducing the steps needed for listeners to discover and start a show, making podcasts more accessible in everyday routines. With producers increasingly optimizing content for smart-speaker playback, these devices are becoming a meaningful part of how younger audiences engage with podcasts.

Connected-TV Boost for Video Podcast Earnings

Major podcast platforms now automatically format episodes into 16:9 video, making it easier for creators to distribute their content on connected-TV apps. Advertisers are taking advantage of this shift, placing mid-roll ads that benefit from higher video CPMs while still retaining the style of host-read messaging. Studios that invest in multi-camera production workflows are reporting stronger sponsorship performance, which is encouraging more creators to design episodes that work both visually and in audio.

Regional Momentum in the Podcast Landscape

North America continues to lead the podcast market thanks to advanced ad-tech systems and widespread smart-speaker adoption, supporting strong monetization and platform innovation. South America, meanwhile, is experiencing rapid listener growth driven by the rise of local-language content in Spanish and Portuguese. While programmatic advertising infrastructure in the region is still developing, expanding mobile access and local creative momentum are contributing to significant growth potential.

[TITLE]Packaging Specialties Expands in Fayetteville, Arkansas:
[TEXT]
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark., Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Packaging Specialties is expanding its manufacturing operations in Fayetteville, Arkansas with an investment of more than $24 million. The company plans to create 101 new jobs over five years.

“At Packaging Specialties, Inc. and Pacmac, Inc., we are committed to the continuous improvement of our products, processes, and services—always maintaining a ‘Customer First’ focus. To support our customers’ growing demand, entry into new markets, and development of new products, we recognized the need to expand our flexographic printing capabilities,” said Nick Guglielmi, CEO of Packaging Specialties, Inc. “Founded in Fayetteville in 1974, we are proud to be deeply rooted in Northwest Arkansas. The support we’ve received from the City of Fayetteville and our state representatives has been instrumental in helping us continue to grow and invest in the future—right here at home.”

The expansion will support the company’s continued business growth to meet demand for its printed film products. As part of the expansion, Packaging Specialties will purchase new equipment for the Fayetteville facility to increase production capacity.

“Everywhere you look, Arkansas-grown businesses like Packaging Specialties are expanding their footprints - and the good jobs and investment they offer our state’s communities,” said Governor Sanders. “Arkansas is a state where businesses of all sizes can expand and thrive, and my administration is working to keep it that way. Packaging Specialties' success is proof that when you cut taxes three times, remove regulatory red tape, and invest in a strong workforce, not only do businesses thrive, but the people and communities they serve thrive too.”

Packaging Specialties provides printed films to more than 20 food and non-food industries using one-color continuous to 10-color process printing. The Fayetteville location provides printed packaging films; printed lamination films; C-Folding, raw or printed slitting; and INNO-LOK with multiple pre-applied zippers to customers across the United States and internationally.

“Packaging Specialties is growing in Fayetteville, Arkansas, marking the latest growth in its five-decade history in the Natural State,” said Clint O’Neal, executive director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission. “Since its founding in Fayetteville, Packaging Specialties has been an industry leader and has created jobs in Northwest Arkansas. This is an important milestone for Packaging Specialties and the City of Fayetteville. We congratulate them both on this success, and we look forward to seeing much more growth in the years ahead.”

Packaging Specialties was founded in Fayetteville in 1974 by Hays Biggs. The Fayetteville location remains the company’s corporate headquarters.

“For decades, Packaging Specialties has contributed to Fayetteville’s economic strength and community character,” said Fayetteville Mayor Molly Rawn. “This expansion builds on that legacy and highlights the power of partnership between local employers, state leaders, and the City of Fayetteville.”

“As one of our most critical legacy firms in Fayetteville, Packaging Specialties provides a profound impact on our economy as well as tremendous leadership within our business community. We are so excited and appreciative to witness their expansion here in Fayetteville,” said Jennifer Irwin, President and CEO of Chamber Fayetteville. “We also thank the team of support assisting Packaging Specialties, from local to state officials, who helped make this a success. On behalf of the Chamber and our entire business community, we thank Packaging Specialties for their commitment to Fayetteville and the many residents they impact, both directly and indirectly.”

Since its founding, Packaging Specialties has grown into a multi-state operation with 473 total employees. The company currently employs 254 at the Fayetteville location.

“Packaging Specialties’ bold expansion in Fayetteville exemplifies the best of responsible, homegrown growth—rooted in our community, fueled by local innovation, and committed to sustainable success for decades to come,” said Washington County Judge Patrick Deakins. “On behalf of Washington County, I celebrate this milestone and look forward to partnering for even brighter horizons.”

[TITLE]The Trump administration is racing to reframe his tariff rollbacks:
[TEXT]
Trump administration officials are racing to reframe the president's tariff rollbacks, as critics say the White House is capitulating on its signature economic policy.

Late Friday, the White House announced the president had signed an executive order exempting more than 200 food products, including bananas, beef and coffee, from the so-called reciprocal tariffs he has imposed on U.S. trading partners.

The move comes as the trade duties have begun to face economic, legal and political resistance that cast doubt on their efficacy.

Some two-thirds of voters who helped sweep Democrats into power in a host of races earlier this month said President Donald Trump hasn’t lived up to his promises to curb inflation and improve the economy, according to NBC News polling.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court could issue an opinion in the coming months striking down the central argument Trump has made as to why he has the power to apply seemingly arbitrary tariff rates on dozens of countries.

White House officials are insisting the rollbacks do not amount to a retreat from the president's staunch defense of tariffs as an economic driver.

“This is nothing new," National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday in response to a question of whether the reversals represent an acknowledgement that the policies have contributed to rising costs.

Hassett cited previous moves by the administration to exempt certain products from duties following trade-framework agreements.

One day earlier, Hassett told ABC News' “This Week” that price increases for some goods weren't being solely caused by tariffs — but acknowledged that prices could start coming down as imports into the U.S. climb.

He also sought to blame former President Joe Biden, whose administration oversaw a post-pandemic inflation surge.

“We understand that people still feel the pain of the high prices, but we’re closing the gap fast,” Hassett said.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent likewise sought to cast blame for rising beef prices backward.

"The beef market is a very specialized market,” Bessent began. “It goes in long cycles. And this is the perfect storm, again, something we inherited.”

In addition to Friday's broad rollback of food-related tariffs, Trump also announced Friday that he was significantly reducing tariffs on goods from Switzerland, which had faced some of the highest duties yet announced during Trump’s second term.

A day earlier, the White House said many food products from four Central and South American countries would be exempted from levies after they agreed to trade frameworks with the U.S.

The U.S. economy continues to contend with stubborn inflation — especially for many everyday grocery items. Orange juice prices have increased approximately 29% year on year, while beef costs are up 13.5%, according to the latest NBC News grocery price tracker data.

While some of the factors influencing the cost increases are not directly tied to tariffs, economists have estimated that consumers have been shouldering more than 50% of the overall price increases seen from Trump's import duties.

Businesses and analysts alike continue to sound the alarm on the impact of tariffs, saying they are compounding the stubborn inflation that has taken root since the pandemic and holding back investment decisions.

The U.S. manufacturing sector — consisting of industries the administration had hoped would benefit most directly from the trade duties — has been particularly hard-hit, with many indicators suggesting it is in recession. Between February and August, manufacturing employment fell by some 41,000 jobs.

Small businesses, whose owners tend to lean more conservative, have also seen an outsize impact from tariffs.

Key elements of Trump’s tariff regime now also face legal jeopardy, however, as the Supreme Court weighs whether Trump illegally bypassed Congress when he imposed reciprocal duties and fentanyl-related tariffs using emergency powers authorization.

Oral arguments before the court earlier this month indicated that multiple justices believed there were constitutional limits built into the emergency tariff powers the administration has claimed during Trump’s second term. A decision is expected before the end of the year.

In a statement Monday, a White House spokesman said the administration remains “committed to the tariff policies that have secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America along with unprecedented trade deals for American workers, industries, and farmers.”

“President Trump’s September 5th executive order specifically laid out various natural resources and agricultural products not produced in the United States that could be eligible for tariff-free treatment in the context of trade deals — the President’s recent tariff announcement reflects how the Administration has now secured a critical mass of trade deals with countries in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, and Asia,” spokesman Kush Desai said.

But whether all the products that were most recently exempted from tariffs fall into the category of “not produced in the United States” is doubtful.

Beef and oranges are produced in the United States, for example, and yet they were included on Friday’s list of broad exemptions from all reciprocal tariffs — not just from duties on imports from countries where the U.S. has secured trade deals.

In the Friday executive order that rolled back all reciprocal tariffs on certain food products, Trump cited “current domestic demand for certain products, and current domestic capacity to produce certain products.”

That definition goes beyond the strict categories of products the United States does not produce and products from countries with which the U.S. has trade agreements.

It signals that a desire to cool off price increases is increasingly being seen as a justification for tariff exemptions on some products, like beef.

Last week’s announcements are not the first time Trump has signaled a willingness to reconsider his trade stances.

Throughout the spring and summer, the president frequently floated higher duties on a trade partner, usually amid ongoing negotiations, only to backtrack on them later. Some on Wall Street eventually dubbed the inevitable reversals “TACO” — “Trump Always Chickens Out.”

The back-and-forth announcements served to whipsaw markets, with the president often standing down after major stock indexes experienced declines in response to his threats.

It is unlikely tariffs are going away entirely: The White House has signaled it would likely seek to reimpose some duties via other statutes if the Supreme Court rules against Trump’s emergency authority.

Just last month, the president announced a slew of new duties on imports including furniture, heavy trucks and pharmaceuticals.

The tariffs have also raised billions in revenues — though even with those increased funds, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has said U.S. lawmakers will “need to identify substantially more deficit reduction to put debt on a sustainable path.”

Any ruling that calls for refunds of the collected funds could have unforeseen consequences on the economy.

Still, some analysts say the recent tariff rollbacks may have only just begun.

“What matters more for the outlook … is the signal that this move sends about the directional shift of future tariff adjustments,” Bernard Yaros, economist with Oxford Economics research group, wrote in a note published Saturday.

“As we near the (2026 midterm) election, the administration may broaden these tariff exemptions to a wider swathe of food products.”

[TITLE]UC Service Workers Strike, Saying Wages Aren’t Enough to Afford Cost of Living:
[TEXT]
“In the last three years, a third of [AFSCME members] have voluntarily left their jobs. Why? Because they can’t afford to stay,” he said.

In April, the university increased its best and final offer to make up for “potentially catastrophic state and federal funding cuts,” UC Associate Vice President for Systemwide Labor and Employee Relations Missy Matella said.

The UC said its offer was $113 million higher than its initial offer in February 2024, and meets the union’s demand to raise minimum wage to $25 an hour. AFSCME had asked that the wage hike be retroactive to 2023. It was implemented in July.

The university also implemented terms from its offer to add monthly health insurance premium credits up to $125 to reduce costs for Kaiser and UC Blue and Gold HMO enrollees. Under its offer, some employees could have access to $0 premiums.

Still, Joanna Marie Fernandez, who’s been an ophthalmic technician at UCSF for 11 years, said the deal doesn’t keep up with rising insurance and housing costs. At the same time, she said, she and her colleagues have had to take on more work because they are understaffed.

“We have double-booked, triple-booked patients in our clinic,” she told KQED. “I came out here [to UC] because of these incredible doctors, this incredible institution, and the thing is, we’re not even able to take care of our own health.”

This month, two other bargaining groups have come to agreements with the UC.

“These outcomes show that UC can and has quickly closed deals when both parties actively participate in solutions-oriented bargaining,” the university said in a statement. “Despite UC’s continued outreach, AFSCME has not presented any substantive counterproposals since April 2025. Absent AFSCME’s engagement, the University cannot engage in meaningful negotiations for this critical workforce.”

On Nov. 8, UPTE-CWA, which represents 21,000 research and technical professionals across the UC, announced a tentative deal with the university, prompting them to pull out of Monday’s strike.

And over the weekend, California Nurses Association/National Nurses United, which had planned a sympathy strike with AFSCME, also came to a tentative agreement.

UC nurses will vote on the tentative agreement this week, and thousands said they still planned to join picket lines off duty.

Stenhouse said it’s telling that AFSCME workers, who are some of the UC’s lowest-paid, are still negotiating.

“It says a lot that as we’re here today after a week where we saw two contracts settle, the most economically vulnerable workers are the last ones standing,” he said.

KQED’s Ezra David Romero contributed to this report.

[TITLE]Govt withdraws BIS norms on polyester chain, polymers; user industry cites relief on costs for MSMEs:
[TEXT]
The Centre has withdrawn quality control orders (QCOs) on a wide range of polyester and petrochemical inputs, in a move that spells relief for user industries such as apparel and footwear, while raising competition from imports for local manufacturers of these key inputs.

QCOs issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) subject manufacturers and importers of specific goods to certain standards. While they ensure greater quality, they also raise costs, which cascade down to industries which use these raw materials.

The order from the department of chemicals and petrochemicals comes after a Niti Aayog committee led by former cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba recommended relaxing QCOs. These orders raise costs for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which import them in large quantities.

While the withdrawal will make raw materials accessible for makers of textiles and PVC products, it may impact manufacturers such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and the Aditya Birla Group companies Grasim and Thai Acrylic Fibre.

Also Read | Filatex bets on polyester recycling and renewables for next phase of growth

Queries sent to Indian Oil and the Aditya Birla Group remained unanswered till press time.

Reliance has always priced its products keeping the long-term growth of textile industry in mind, a company spokesperson said in an email. "This has been our philosophy from the from the day we started manufacturing products & polyester and integrated backwards. We welcome the decision of the government, and we will continue to stay competitive offering the best quality products to the downstream industry for domestic and value-added export market."

The withdrawal of QCOs fulfils an MSME industry wish, significantly benefiting textile makers, said Rahul Mehta, chief mentor of the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India. However, it also goes against the government's original plan to expand the ambit of QCOs to cover more products.

The raw materials now free of QCOs are used to make man-made fibres, plastics, packaging, footwear, consumer goods, appliances and automotive components. Several of them such as PTA, MEG, polypropylene, PVC and ABS are among India’s most critical chemical imports, sourced from China, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Thailand and Singapore. Products like polyester staple fibre, POY and FDY also rely on imports during periods of domestic shortage, particularly from China and Indonesia.

Welcome decision

Just last week, the Chemicals and Petrochemicals Manufacturers Association had written to the government, making a strong case for QCOs. While industries abroad benefitted from state subsidies, India's QCOs helped counter them, the association had said. On Thursday, the association did not respond to a query

[TITLE]Global retail rebound lifts outlook for Indian apparel exporters:
[TEXT]
Global retail demand is showing signs of recovery, signaling a potential turnaround for Indian garment exporters. Leading players such as Gokaldas Exports and Pearl Global Industries are reworking their strategies, diversifying markets, expanding production bases outside India, and positioning for trade advantages under proposed free trade agreements (FTAs).

The companies, in post-Q2 investor calls, indicated that order inflows from key markets such as the US and Europe have begun to stabilise, with new business emerging from regions like Japan and Australia. This, combined with the ongoing sourcing diversification by global retailers, is expected to set the stage for a steadier growth cycle for Indian exporters.

“In the longer term, sourcing diversification is a key theme for all customers. With likely tariff rationalisation, India will remain one of the top contenders among Asian peers,” said Sivaramakrishnan Ganapathi, Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of Gokaldas Exports.

“The recently announced India-UK FTA offers a 12 per cent duty advantage over China and puts India on par with Bangladesh, creating strong export potential. A trade deal with the EU could open significant opportunities as well,” he added.

Gokaldas, which has been expanding its footprint in the UK and EU, is witnessing growing visibility from its Africa operations, leveraging the low-tariff regime and potential renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Currently, Africa contributes

[TITLE]Three Ways to Style Kate Spade’s Bestselling Handbags (and Take Advantage of Its Early Black Friday Deals):
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

The holiday season has officially commenced (we know, we can hardly believe it!). This means that just as you might be picking out the most symmetrical and fragrant of Christmas trees at this moment, to adorn with charmingly chic baubles, so too is it the time to treat yourself to a bit of a style upgrade… and accessorize it in a way that the purchase truly deserves.

Enter Kate Spade‘s instantly covetable, trendy-yet-timeless assortment of handbags fit for all your needs and preferences. Not only does the iconic, founded-in-1993 label offer shoulder bags perfect for gifting to every woman in your life (or keeping all to yourself), Kate Spade is also coming in hot with no shortage of new jewelry, shoes, apparel, and accessories, all capable of making your bag of choice the ultimate personality statement this fall and winter.

Doubting the fact that Kate Spade bags — the status symbol of every city-dwelling young female in the early 2000s — are still “in” this year? Think again. With the likes of Ice Spice, Charli D’Amelio, influencer Rain Judge, and Laufey starring in its latest campaigns, Kate Spade has secured a firm spot for itself in our day and age: consistently releasing fashions and accessories that are quick to become TikTok-viral and end up as more of a need and not a want among tastemakers.

All your favorite celebrities have hopped on the Kate Spade bandwagon by now, with no signs of ending their love affairs with the brand that, for more than two decades, has been synonymous with a kind of preppy, feminine, and very much accessible aesthetic. Lola Tung recently stepped out with a Kate Spade crossbody while promoting “The Summer I Turned Pretty,“ making it an integral part of her press tour outfits. Olivia Rodrigo, too, has been spotted wearing the brand on multiple occasions this year alone: most recently seen hauling her Liv Shoulder Bag, donned in conjunction with an airy blouse and straight-leg jeans. And McKenna Grace carried the Duo Suede Crossbody while outside the CBS Morning Show to promote her new film “Regretting You” in New York.

All this is to say, investing in a Kate Spade handbag this season just might turn out to be your best financial decision of 2025. Every single style here, after all, manages to fuse mid-range price tags with the kinds of textures (think suedes or high-end pebbled leathers) and silhouettes (crescent-shaped crossbodies, bucket bags, slouchy ones, and the perennially popular top-handles) that have proven to be the It-things of fall/winter 2025 in top designers’ collections.

The best part? Now is the most optimal time to dive into (and shop) Kate Spade’s selections. After all, the brand has just kickstarted its early Black Friday sale, featuring 50-percent-off deals on select leather goods, 30 percent off full-price jewelry, and an additional 40 percent off everything in the sale section — all the more reason to welcome Christmastime with a lil’ splurge.

And because we’re in the business of going the extra mile for our readers, we’ve suggested three unique ways to dress up your fresh Kate Spade purchases — in a way that aligns with the leading trends while ensuring your ensembles turn every head on the street as soon as you wear them outside. Cheers to one stylish holiday!

Add the Fuzz

Pick a Charm (and Earrings for Good Measure)

Kate Spade Halo Suede Large Bucket Bag $498 Buy Now at kate spade In case you’re not yet familiar with the Kate Spade Halo Suede Large Bucket Bag, it deserves a reintroduction of sorts. By all measures, it’s quite the looker, what with the catchall’s Purple Agate colorway and suede exterior, the latter aspect securing an extremely soft underhand feel while the former takes care of things in the autumnal trends department. As far as functionality goes, the bag also stands out from the crowd on the basis of its zip and slip pocket options for all your valuables, adjustable shoulder strap, and substantial size (a 15-inch height, to be exact) that can accommodate everything from a laptop to the notebook where you house your doodles.

Now, onto the fun part — the bling! Our editors suggest pairing your buy with the top-selling Molten Glass Statement Studs from the brand. A bit of contrast play between green and purplish-red never hurt anyone, after all, and the brass-slash-cubic zirconia earrings are also quite en vogue right now, given their sculpturality. As for the adornment that deserves to be featured front-and-center on the actual Kate Spade suede bag, we have a good feeling you’ll fall in love with the Sammy Bag Charm. Though it’s not on sale for the label’s early Black Friday markdown event, every dollar of that price tag becomes worth it when you consider the charm’s serpent-inspired design (an ode to the Year of the Snake), polka dots, pop of bright green, and floral appliqué added in for bonus points.

Shown With: Kate Spade Molten Glass Statement Studs ($61.60), Kate Spade Sammy Bag Charm ($118)

Pair With Sensible Loafers, and Don’t Forget the Scarf

This initiative is aimed at accelerating the upgrade of global supply chain networks, enhancing the logistics efficiency and liquidity of cross-border e-commerce, and supporting sustainable growth for global sellers.

The “Global Warehouse Logistics Fund” is initially valued at several million dollars and is primarily focused on key market nodes in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

In parallel with the supply chain strategy upgrade, IFYshop is also launching its innovative financial service product — the “Saving Wallet.” Positioned as an intelligent funds management tool within the platform ecosystem, this product allows sellers to flexibly deposit settlement funds into their wallet accounts, benefiting from daily interest accruals and the ability to redeem funds at any time. A portion of the funds will be linked to the Global Warehouse Logistics Fund, enabling users to indirectly participate in the growth of platform infrastructure and share in the resulting profits.

The Saving Wallet employs a multi-layered encryption security framework and is overseen by an independent third-party custodial institution to ensure fund security and transparency in earnings. IFYshop stated that this initiative further enhances the platform’s cross-border e-commerce financial ecosystem, providing users with a more robust funds management experience.

[TITLE]Europe Tea Market Analysis Report 2025-2033: Trends, Shares, Value Chain, SWOT, Pricing Benchmark, and Key Players:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Europe Tea Market Analysis and Growth Forecast 2025-2033" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Europe Tea Market is anticipated to grow from US$ 20 billion in 2024 to US$ 33.71 billion by 2033 at a CAGR of 5.97% from 2025 to 2033. Growing health consciousness, demand for specialty and herbal teas, and changing consumer tastes towards organic products are fueling market expansion throughout the region, complemented by robust retail and e-commerce distribution networks.

Growth Drivers in the Europe Tea Market

Increased Health and Wellness Awareness

European consumers are increasingly substituting tea for sugary drinks and coffee as a healthier option. Green tea, herbal teas, and functional teas (which contain ingredients such as turmeric or ginger) are becoming sought after for their antioxidant, cleansing, and soothing virtues. As interest grows in immune well-being and mental health, demand for organic and wellness-focused tea products has accelerated, particularly since COVID-19, transforming consumption behaviors throughout the region. March 2024, Twinings launched a line of functional tea blends specially crafted for the European market, featuring distinctive botanical ingredients and wellbeing benefits.

Growth in Specialty and Premium Tea

The tea market in Europe is being driven by growth in specialty blends, luxury teas, and artisanal products. Consumers are trying new tastes, single-origin teas, and responsibly sourced varieties, stimulating innovation among companies. Boutique tea houses, experience-based store formats, and edited subscription boxes are raising tea from an ordinary drink to an aspirational product. The premiumization movement has widened appeal across younger, more upscale audiences. January 2024, Unilever PLC introduced a new range of premium organic teas appealing to health-focused consumers, with innovative eco-friendly packaging.

Development of E-commerce and Digital Retail Channels

Online tea sales have seen high growth in Europe as a result of convenience, wider product range, and social media. Internet platforms enable access to niche and international brands that might be lacking in physical retail. Subscription models and wellness influencers also play a part in product finding and interaction, enabling tea businesses to create direct customer relationships and tailor offers. For instance, in the UK, tea sales online became extremely popular, with investment increasing by 70% in 2022, according to the British E-commerce Association. One of the main forces driving this sector's high growth is the increasing focus on digital accessibility and subscription services.

Challenges in the Europe Tea Market

Market Saturation and Intense Competition

The European tea industry is mature and competitive, especially in Western Europe. There are many local and international brands competing for consumers' attention, triggering price pressure and constrained shelf space. Innovation assists but is challenging for new brands to make headway without massive marketing spend. Mature tea-consuming nations such as the UK experience levelling-off growth, with brands needing to differentiate via health messages, taste, or ethical origin.

Fluctuating Raw Material Costs and Climate Impact

Tea production is greatly dependent on climatic factors. Erratic weather conditions, floods, and droughts in key tea-producing countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Kenya may impact supply chains and raise costs. These uncertainties impact price and supply in Europe. Also, increased transportation and energy costs, along with sustainability issues, pose difficulties for producers and importers in keeping the producers profitable without sacrificing quality or ethical sourcing practices.
