Japanese luxury beauty products maker Shiseido may evaluate manufacturing in India as it scales up, joining global peers such as Estee Lauder Companies and The Body Shop , which are also in talks with local partners to kickstart or step up production in the country and tap into the world’s fastest-growing market in the segment.“Local manufacturing would get the company inherent advantages, including lower duties, in the rapidly expanding India market,” Sanjay Sharma, country head of Shiseido Group in India, told ET. “It’s a global decision and will depend on scale which we will evaluate.” The brand currently imports its entire range.India’s luxury beauty products market is estimated to expand to $4 billion in sales by 2035, from $800 million in 2023, at a time when China is facing economic headwinds and dampened consumer spending in the segment, according to a report by consulting firm Kearney , along with luxury products retailer LuxAsia. “As scale builds up, makers of luxury cosmetics are starting to make in India,” Sharma said. “A few have already set up such facilities,” he added, though he declined to specify a time frame for starting manufacturing in the country.The past year alone has seen luxury beauty labels Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez, Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty, Anomaly by Priyanka Chopra, H&M Beauty and Dubai’s Huda Beauty entering the Indian market.“We have enquiries from two global celebrity-owned luxury beauty brands to find local partners to make in India,” an executive at a Delhi-based cosmetics importer said on condition of anonymity. “Even if these would likely be third-party associations to begin with, the global brands are looking for partnerships that are exclusive, for mid-tier pricing.”US’ Estée Lauder Companies , which owns Mac Bobbi Brown and Clinique, and the UK’s The Body Shop, which sells imported cosmetics in India through its local partner Quest Retail, along with other global brands such as Kiehl’s, Avon, Kylie Cosmetics and Max Factor, too are in the process of finalising manufacturing partners in the country.Estee Lauder, which has nine global production sites across the US, Europe and Japan, has already launched some limited-edition products made in India through a third party. Its global president and chief executive Stéphane de La Faverie had said at a Barclays Consumer Staples conference in September that the cosmetics maker had approved a “massive investment” in India to cater to increasing aspirational demand. Without specifying the amount of investment, he had said, “In India, one of the winning strategies has been the deployment of small sizes. The ability to bring luxury products at a mass affordable price points, is going to be critical for us to win in the market.”An executive at an American cosmetics firm, who declined to be identified since he is not an authorised spokesperson, said, “We have started making two lip colour lines and foundation in India, and we sold during Diwali at prices 25% lower than our imported lines.”Shiseido’s other flagship brand in India, French label Nars Cosmetics, recently entered into retail partnerships with online platforms Reliance Retail’s Tira and Nykaa, and set up its second standalone store.The luxury beauty products segment is classified on the basis of pricing, with products priced above $15 (

India's economic growth in the second half of the current financial year is expected to remain steady, with strong domestic consumption likely to cushion the slowdown, according to a report by SBI Capital Markets (SBICAPS). The report noted that while global uncertainties and trade tensions persist, India's internal demand continues to provide stability to the economy.The report highlighted that with India facing steep 50 per cent tariffs from the United States, policymakers are pushed to rely more on domestic growth levers. Both the Union and State governments have increased their capital expenditure in the year-to-date FY26 period, which is expected to show up in higher gross fixed capital formation.Realising the importance of domestic consumption, GST rate changes have been timed with the festive season. According to the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), festive sales are estimated to touch a record Rs 4.75 trillion this year. Early signs of this buoyancy are visible in auto retail sales, which showed strong year-on-year growth during the Navaratri period.The SBICAPS report highlighted that global trade remains uncertain, with tariffs now becoming the "new abnormal." While Chinese exports to the US dropped by 33 per cent in August 2025 compared to the previous year, overall shipments rose by 4.4 per cent, suggesting a supply chain reroute rather than a full disruption. Exporters and retailers have so far absorbed inflationary pressures, though consumers are beginning to feel the impact. The US has avoided imposing duties on critical sectors like electronics and generic drugs, reflecting key trade-offs.Globally, the report noted a visible shift away from the US dollar as the world's dominant asset. Central Banks now hold more gold than US Treasuries for the first time in three decades. While no credible alternative has yet emerged, the Chinese yuan and digital currencies have drawn growing attention as countries explore new anchors for the global monetary system.The report also cautioned that a rush to rebalance investments could lead to asset bubbles. Artificial intelligence, it said, has emerged as the latest frontier for investment, with capital flooding into the sector even as business models remain untested. OpenAI's valuation touching USD 500 billion exemplifies this trend, though monetisation remains uncertain. The report emphasised that investor discretion is key in such a speculative environment.Domestically, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has moved to ease credit flow by proposing the removal of sectoral caps on large borrowers and relaxing restrictions on acquisition finance. Lending limits for loans against shares, REITs, and InvITs are also being raised. The report said that these steps, along with a more gradual implementation of new capital norms, have lifted the credit-deposit ratio above 80 per cent for the first time in FY26.Despite foreign portfolio investors pulling out USD 18 billion from Indian equities in 2025, domestic investors have shown strong confidence.

[TITLE]Bodycams worn by Toronto FreshCo cashiers raise questions about safety and privacy:
[TEXT]
Some grocery stores owned by Sobeys I nc. are the latest T oronto stores to test body-worn cameras.

In a statement, the retailer confirmed it's piloting the project after the bodycams were spotted on FreshCo cashiers in a store located at Sherbourne and Isabella streets.

The cameras are being used to combat harassment and assault directed toward employees and to prevent shoplifting and other crimes, Sobeys spokesperson Caitlin Gray said.

But James Turk, director of the Centre for Free Expression at Toronto Metropolitan University, said he thinks they could have the opposite effect.

“I think it makes any employee … more vulnerable rather than safer because potential thieves may see the bodycam and just want to grab it off them,” he told CBC Toronto.

James Turk, director of the Centre for Free Expression at Toronto Metropolitan University, worries body-worn cameras could cause more harm than good in retail spaces. (CBC)

Sobeys has seen a significant decrease in violence and aggression toward employees and customers since the cameras were introduced to select locations, Gray said in a statement. The retailer also said the bodycams only record when activated during an incident and are not used to monitor employees.

Sobeys has not yet responded to questions

Stainless Steel Overview

The stainless steel market is experiencing robust momentum, driven by strong demand from major sectors such as infrastructure development, automotive component manufacturing and heightened interest in sustainable materials production. A key catalyst is the accelerated pace of urbanisation and industrial expansion particularly in the Asia Pacific region where large scale contruction projects and expanding vehicle production are raising the need for cosrrosion resistant, long lasting alloys, at the same time, changes in manufacturing technology and increasing emphasis on eco-friendly production are shaping the competitive landscape, producers are investing in processes with higher recycled content, energy-efficient operations and advanced steel grades tailored for high performance applications.

Stainless Steel Market Report Highlights

By region, Asia Pacific held approximately a 55% share in the stainless steel market in 2024.

By type, the austenitic stainless steel segment held approximately a 52% share in the market in 2024.

By product form, the flat products segment held approximately a 55% share in the market in 2024.

By end-use industry, the construction & infrastructure segment held approximately a 45% share in the market in 2024.

By manufacturing process, the hot rolling segment held approximately a 50% share in the market in 2024.

How Stainless Steel Market is Made

The exact process for a grade of stainless steel will differ in the later stages. How a grade of steel is shaped, worked and finished plays a significant role in determining how it looks and performs.

Before you can create a deliverable steel product, you must first create the molten alloy.

Because of this most steel grade share common starting steps.

Step 1: Melting

Manufacturing stainless steel starts with melting scrap metals and additives in an electric arc furnace (EAF). Using high-power electrodes, the EAF heats the metals over the course of many hours to create a molten, fluid mixture.

As stainless steel is 100% recyclable, many stainless orders contain as much as 60% recycled steel. This helps to not only control costs but reduce environmental impact.

Exact temperatures will vary based on the grade of steel created.

Step 2: Removing Carbon Content

Carbon helps to increase the hardness and strength of iron. However, too much carbon can create problems—such as carbide precipitation during welding.

Before casting molten stainless steel, calibration and reduction of carbon content to the proper level is essential.

There are two ways foundries control carbon content.

The first is through Argon Oxygen Decarburization (AOD). Injecting an argon gas mixture into the molten steel reduces carbon content with minimal loss of other essential elements.

The other method used is Vacuum Oxygen Decarburization (VOD). In this method, molten steel is transferred to another chamber where oxygen is injected into the steel while heat is applied. A vacuum then removes vented gases from the chamber, further reducing carbon content.

Both methods offer precise control of carbon content to ensure a proper mixture and exact characteristics in the final stainless steel product.

Step 3: Tuning

After reducing carbon, a final balancing and homogenization of temperature and chemistry occurs. This ensures that the metal meets requirements for its intended grade and that the steel’s composition is consistent throughout the batch.

Samples are tested and analyzed. Adjustments are then made until the mixture meets the required standard.

Step 4: Forming or Casting

With the molten steel created, the foundry must now create the primitive shape used to cool and work the steel. The exact shape and dimensions will depend on the final product.

Common shapes include:

Blooms

Billets

Slabs

Rods

Tubes

[TITLE]Northrim BanCorp Earns $27.1 Million, or $1.20 Per Diluted Share, in Third Quarter 2025:
[TEXT]
ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northrim BanCorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NRIM) (“Northrim” or the “Company”) today reported net income of $27.1 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $11.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2025, and $8.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in third quarter 2025 profitability as compared to the third quarter a year ago was primarily the result of the gain from the sale of certain assets by Pacific Wealth Advisors of $14.2 million, as well as an increase in net interest income, and higher purchased receivable income, which were partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes and higher other operating expenses. Net interest income increased over the same periods primarily due to higher earning asset balances, lower interest-bearing liability balances, higher yields on earning assets, and a lower cost of funds. Purchased receivable income increased primarily due to the Company’s acquisition of Sallyport Commercial Finance, LLC (“Sallyport or SCF”), which was completed on October 31, 2024. Sallyport and its direct and indirect subsidiaries provide services and products related to purchased receivable factoring and asset-based lending in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

The Company's Board of Directors approved a 4-for-1 forward stock split of its common stock that was effective after the close of business on September 22, 2025, for shareholders of record at the close of business on September 18, 2025 (the “Stock Split”). The Stock Split is part of the Company's ongoing review of optimal trading and spread levels. The intended purpose of the Stock Split is to enhance stock liquidity, make shares more accessible to a broader base of retail investors, and support increased trading activity. All per share ratios in this release have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the Stock Split.

Dividends per share in the third quarter of 2025 remained consistent with the first and second quarter of 2025 at $0.16 per share as compared to $0.155 per share in the third quarter of 2024.

“We achieved yet another quarter of record core earnings as loan yields continued to increase and deposit costs decreased. In addition, we recognized a $10.9 million after-tax gain from the sale of certain assets by Pacific Wealth Advisors where we have a minority interest,” said Mike Huston, Northrim’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Northrim’s Alaskan deposit market share increased by 187 basis points to 17.5% in 2025 and has increased by 531 basis points over the past five years. We are proud of this progress and believe these gains are the result of consistent investments in our people and banking infrastructure.”

Third Quarter 2025 Highlights:

Net interest income in the third quarter of 2025 increased 5% to $35.3 million compared to $33.6 million in the second quarter of 2025 and increased 23% compared to $28.8 million in the third quarter of 2024.

Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis (“NIMTE”) * was 4.88% for the third quarter of 2025, up 16-basis points from the second quarter of 2025 and up 53-basis points from the third quarter a year ago.

was 4.88% for the third quarter of 2025, up 16-basis points from the second quarter of 2025 and up 53-basis points from the third quarter a year ago.

Alaska Economic Update

(Note: sources for information included in this section are included on page 15.)

The Alaska Department of Labor (“DOL”) has reported Alaska’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in August of 2025 was 4.7% compared to the U.S. rate of 4.3%. The total of 355,900 payroll jobs in Alaska, not including uniformed military, increased 0.8% or 2,900 jobs between August of 2024 and August of 2025. This matched the year-over-year increase for the U.S. of 0.8% for the same period.

According to the DOL, the Oil and Gas sector had the largest growth rate in new jobs of 6% through August compared to the prior year, up 500 direct jobs. The Construction sector added 1,000 positions for a year-over-year growth rate of 4.8% in August of 2025. The Manufacturing sector, which is dominated by seafood processing, added 900 jobs and grew 5.7% in the same period. The larger Health Care sector also grew by 900 jobs for an annual growth rate of 2.1%. Transportation, Warehousing and Utilities added 300 jobs for a 1.1% growth rate. Professional and Business Services increased 200 jobs year-over-year through August of 2025, up 0.7%.

The Government sector declined by 100 jobs, or (0.1%). Government gained 200 State positions, while losing 100 Federal jobs and 200 Local government jobs in Alaska between August of 2024 and August of 2025. Other declining sectors include: Information down 300 jobs or (-6.8%); Leisure/Hospitality declined 100 jobs (-0.2%); Wholesale Trade lost 100 jobs (-1.5%) and Financial Activities, down 100 jobs (-0.9%).

Alaska’s seasonally adjusted personal income was $59.4 billion in the second quarter of 2025 according to the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis (“BEA”). Alaska had an annualized improvement of 9.7% in the first quarter and 5% in the second quarter of 2025. This is compared to the national average of 6.4% in the first quarter and 5.5% in second quarter of 2025. Alaska enjoyed an annual personal income improvement of 5.8% in 2024 compared to the U.S. increase of 5.6%. Per capita personal income in Alaska is now estimated at $80,208 according to the BEA, ranking it 12th highest of the 50 U.S. states.

Alaska’s Gross State Product (“GSP”) in the second quarter of 2025 reached $74.2 billion according to the BEA. Alaska’s inflation adjusted “real” GSP increased 1.5% in 2024, 1.8% annualized in the first quarter of 2025, and 2% in the second quarter of 2025. The average U.S. GDP growth rate was 2.8% for 2024, annualized -0.6% in the first quarter of 2025 and 3.8% in the second quarter of 2025. Alaska’s real GSP improvement in the second quarter of 2025 was led by the Mining, Oil & Gas sector; Transportation & Warehousing; Professional, Scientific & Technical Services; and Manufacturing, but was somewhat offset by decreases in Retail Trade and Government.

Alaska exported $5.9 billion in goods to foreign countries in 2024 according to the U.S. International Trade Administration. China is the largest importer of Alaska’s products at $1.5 billion, followed by Australia at $804 million, Japan at $674 million and South Korea at $634 million in 2024. Fish and related maritime products accounted for the largest volume at $2.1 billion, followed by minerals and ores $2 billion, and primary metals at $992 million in 2024. Oil & Gas international exports were $380 million because the majority of Alaska’s production is refined and consumed within the United States.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, for the U.S. increased 2.9% between August of 2024 and August of 2025. In Alaska, the rate of increase was lower at 2.4% for the same time period. The largest increases since last August came from Apparel (+6.9%), Food and beverage (+3.9%), and Housing (+3.8%). Slower increases or declining costs in Medical Care (+1.2%), Gasoline (+0.9%), Transportation (-1.2%) and Recreation (-1.7%) through August 2025 have helped moderate inflationary pressures in Alaska relative to the U.S.

The monthly average price of Alaska North Slope (“ANS”) crude oil has ranged between a high of $76.39 a barrel in January of 2025 and a low of $67.07 in May of 2025. The August 2025 average was $69.29. The Alaska Department of Revenue (“DOR”) calculated ANS crude oil production was 461 thousand barrels per day (“bpd”) in Alaska’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Production rose to 469 thousand bpd in fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. In the Spring 2025 Revenue Forecast published March 12, 2025, the DOR expects production to continue to grow to 663 thousand bpd, or 41% by fiscal year 2034. This is primarily a result of new production coming on-line in and around the NPR-A region west of Prudhoe Bay. A partnership between Santos and Repsol is constructing the new Pikka field and ConocoPhillips is developing the large new Willow field. There are also several smaller new fields in Alaska’s North Slope that are contributing to the State of Alaska’s production growth estimate.

The Alaska Permanent Fund is seeded annually by the oil wealth the State continues to save each year and has grown significantly over 40 years of successful investment. As of August 31, 2025 the fund’s value was $83.26 billion. According to the DOR it is scheduled to contribute $3.7 billion to Alaska’s General Fund in fiscal year 2025 for general government spending and over $600 million to pay the annual dividend of $1,000 in October to Alaskan residents.

According to the Alaska Multiple Listing Services, the average sales price of a single-family home in Anchorage rose 6.2% in 2024 to $510,015, following a 5.2% increase in 2023. This was the seventh consecutive year of price increases. Through September of 2025 prices continued to increase on average 3.7% to $529,097.

The average sales price for single family homes in the Matanuska Susitna Borough rose 3.8% in 2024 to $412,859, after increasing 4% in 2023. This continues a trend of average price increases for more than a decade in the region. Through September of 2025 prices continued to increase on average 6.7% to $440,366. These two markets represent where the vast majority of the Bank’s residential lending activity occurs.

The Alaska Multiple Listing Services reported a 3.4% increase in the number of units sold in Anchorage when comparing 2024 to 2023. The first nine months of 2025 saw a 4.7% increase in home sales compared to the same nine months of 2024 in Anchorage.

Last year there was virtually no change in the number of homes sold in the Matanuska Susitna Borough, with only four fewer homes sold in 2024 than in 2023 or -0.2%. In the first nine months of 2025 the number of units sold has increased by 133 sold or 11.1% in the Matanuska Susitna Borough compared to the first nine months of 2024.

[TITLE]City-States Without Limits – Part 2:
[TEXT]
In Part 1, we discussed the NRx technocrats’ ideas and how they have influenced the city-state model that seeks to capitalise on the global proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). We examined the role of functional oligarchies in this endeavor. In Part 2, we look at how that city-state model manifests internationally and what it implies, not just for global governance structures, but for humanity.

In Part 1, we explored the ideology that has been adopted by a powerful group of NRx technocrat-oligarchs and how their proposals align with the interests of their international oligarch partners. We discussed the venture capital impact investment strategy the NRx technocrats call “accelerationism” and how governments are actually “functional oligarchies.”

The model of “government” the NRx technocrats propose is unlike anything we are currently familiar with. It is much more akin to the kind of authoritarian dictatorships exercised by the feudal monarchs of Medieval Europe. These gov-corp Technates, as envisaged, effectively amount to dictatorial city-states under the direct control of oligarchs.

The NRx technocrats seek to break nation-states apart into technologically governed “enclaves” (gov-corp Technates). These “realms” will form an international “Patchwork,” with each enclave or “network archipelago” represented as a digital node, almost certainly on a single, overarching blockchain or “unified ledger.” The digital access permissions to the node, which serves as the digital twin for the physical realm of the city-state “enclave,” will be controlled by the “founder” or their selected administrators of the realm. This forms a gov-corp Technate ruled by a CEO King (oligarch) where “nothing officially exists” unless it is represented digitally on the realm’s ledger (blockchain).

The citizens of the realm are customers of the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) that rules the gov-corp Technate. The customers will have no individual sovereignty unless they purchase it from the “founder.” All value is digital in the realm. The life of your “digital twin,” monitored through the requirement to use digital ID, seamlessly links a customer’s offline life to that of their online digital twin.

By controlling the programmable digital currency allotted to the customer’s digital twin, via their digital ID, any misbehaviour can be punished by the founder or their delegated system administrators. For example, by freezing “their deposits” or locking people “out of all doors for a time period as a punishment.” There are no means of recourse in a gov-corp Technate. The only option open to the persecuted customer is to flee, if they have the means.

We also discussed how governments around the world have already started carving out nascent gov-corp Technates in the form of thousands of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Some of which, such as Shenzhen in China, have already been established as de facto city-states with their own increasingly independent jurisdictions and embryonic city-state governments.

At the heart of this effort to create a global patchwork of city-states are the NRx technocrats, perhaps most notably Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen in the US, and venture capital firms like NeWay Capital and Pronomos Capital. But they are far from alone. The NRx technocrat network is global and, at the highest governmental and intergovernmental level, the hope is to bring

[TITLE]The ‘Everything App’: How Robinhood Grew From Trading Platform to Financial Ecosystem:
[TEXT]
Seven years ago this month, Robinhood celebrated a major milestone: It had signed up 6 million users. Fast-forward to 2025 and that growth seems like peanuts for the Menlo Park, California-based startup that has fundamentally upended the world of retail investing.

Robinhood had 26.7 million customers as of the end of August and offers cryptocurrency, options and futures trading, access to mortgage lenders, a robo-advisor and more. Just this year, the firm has introduced a predictions market hub and stock tokens. It has evolved far beyond a stock-trading app into a comprehensive financial ecosystem, says Caydee Blankenship, an analyst at investment research firm CFRA.

The company, which tends to cater to younger investors, is “perfectly positioned at the epicenter of the largest wealth transfer in human history,” Blankenship adds. “We’re looking at a multi-decades tailwind here. As their customers get richer, Robinhood will also get richer.”

Since Robinhood (HOOD) debuted on the Nasdaq in July 2021, its market capitalization has nearly quadrupled from $32 billion to

There are a lot of ASX 200 shares to choose from on the Australian share market.

But not all of them are necessarily buys.

For example, courtesy of The Bull, listed below are three shares that experts are tipping as sells this week. Here's what you need to know:

Domino's Pizza Enterprises Ltd (ASX: DMP)

Bell Potter has named this pizza chain operator as an ASX 200 share to sell now.

After a disappointing time in FY 2025, which culminated in its first net loss since listing 20 years ago, the broker highlights that its outlook remains uncertain despite its restructuring plans. It said:

The fast food giant recently posted its first annual net loss since listing in May 2005. A statutory net loss of $3.7 million in fiscal year 2025 was impacted by one-off items. Guidance is cautious, and earnings before interest and tax pressures persist despite aggressive restructuring. Franchisee sentiment is mixed, and higher input costs are unlikely to ease in the near term. In our view, the company's valuation remains demanding versus earnings certainty amid downside risks to consensus estimates. […] In our opinion, execution risk overshadows recovery hopes.

Santos Ltd (ASX: STO)

Another ASX 200 share that has been named as a sell by experts is energy giant Santos.

The team at MPC Markets doesn't think investors should be buying its shares following their decline in recent weeks. In fact, unless another offer comes in, its analysts expect its shares to remain under pressure. They said:

Shares in the energy giant were punished after the XRG consortium withdrew its $US30 billion takeover bid in September, just days before the expected decision date. The shares have fallen from $7.65 on September 17 to trade at $6.47 on October 23. The failed takeover deal impacted shareholder sentiment, raising questions

[TITLE]Health Canada Grants Authorization for “LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that Health Canada has issued a Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) for humanized anti-soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody “LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) for the treatment of adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (early AD) who are apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4*) non-carriers or heterozygotes and who have confirmed amyloid pathology. LEQEMBI is the first treatment for early AD that targets an underlying cause of the disease, to be authorized in Canada.

LEQEMBI selectively binds to soluble Aβ aggregates (protofibrils**), as well as insoluble Aβ aggregates (fibrils) which are a major component of Aβ plaques, thereby reducing both Aβ protofibrils and Aβ plaques in the brain. LEQEMBI is the first approved treatment shown to reduce the rate of disease progression and to slow cognitive and functional decline in adults with AD. LEQEMBI is also approved in 51 countries and regions including Japan,1 the United States,2 Europe,3 China,4 South Korea,5 Taiwan,6 and SaudiArabia,7 and applications have been filed in 9 countries.

The approval of LEQEMBI is based on the large global Phase 3 Clarity AD study. In the Clarity AD study, LEQEMBI met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with statistically significant results.8,9 LEQEMBI has been issued market authorization with conditions, pending the results of trials to verify its clinical benefit. Eisai plans to submit clinical assessment data captured from participants in real-world clinical practice.

AD is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80% of all cases.10 As of January 1, 2025, it is estimated there are more than 771,000 patients with dementia in Canada, which is expected to increase to approximately 1 million in 2030 and over 1.7 million in 2050.11 In addition, annual care provided by family and friends for those with dementia is equivalent to 290,000 full-time jobs, which is expected to increase to 690,000 full-time jobs in 2050.11

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with both Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. In Canada, Eisai Limited will distribute the product and conduct information provision activities. Eisai and Biogen are committed to working together with healthcare professionals and other stakeholders towards the early treatment of AD.

* Apolipoprotein E is a protein involved in the metabolism of lipid in humans. It is implicated in AD. People with only one (heterozygous) or no copy (non-carriers) of the ApoE ε4 gene are less likely to experience ARIA than people with two ApoE ε4 copies (homozygous).12

** Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.13 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction.14

[TITLE]Is Sustainability Still Worth It? Fashion Industry, Supply Chain Say Resounding Yes:
[TEXT]
VENICE, Italy — As sustainability faces disruption and political backlash globally, fashion finds itself questioning how to move the needle forward after a decade of quantum leap efforts.

Against a dampened economy and geopolitical turmoil, the stakes are higher than ever.

Global supply chains, including Italy’s, are under pressure — and increasingly under scrutiny. Policymakers are navigating the complexity of dealing with a different world — and business views. The performance of the fashion sector is still iffy and the outlook hard to predict.

“The issue at hand concerns the models we want to champion for the future, the vision of the world we want to embrace,” said Vittorio Emanuele Parsi, international relations professor at Milan’s Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, at the fourth two-day edition of the Venice Sustainable Fashion Forum held here at the Fondazione Cini.

“This is the time to have the courage to face our era head-on,” echoed Carlo Cottarelli, director of the program for education in economic and social sciences and of the observatory on Italian public accounts at the same university.

Industry players at the forum recognized the importance of scaling up, rather than back, their efforts and of doing so collaboratively.

“Not only Made in Italy fashion is under attack. The reality is that it’s part of a much broader ecosystem, one we share with our European partners. This is a multifaceted attack,” said Luca Sburlati, president of Confindustria Moda, in reference to the many pressing issues faced by the sector.

“We are working within a model where ethics, economy and innovation are all evolving rapidly, so it’s crucial that we take center stage in this discussion and make decisions to bring to the attention of the policymakers,” he said.

The Italian association was among the organizers of the event alongside Confindustria Veneto Est and consultancy The European House Ambrosetti, or TEHA Group.

A study by the latter titled “Just Fashion Transition 2025,” provided a candid picture of where the fashion sector stands in its eco-journey.

Drawing from data by the European Environment Agency, the research said that the EU fashion sector has cut 37 percent of its carbon emissions since 1990.

An additional 18 percent is still required to comply with the EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles for 2030, which the consultancy estimates would require at least 4.4 billion euros.

“The cost of waiting is higher than the cost of taking action,” said Carlo Cici, partner and head of sustainability practices at TEHA Group. “When it comes to sustainability, waiting is not a viable strategy for growth,” he added, sparking applause from the audience.

Making his point, Cici said that biodiversity and the health of natural ecosystems are crucial enablers of growth as

Shares of KPR Mill Gokaldas Exports and other textile stocks climbed up to 13% in morning trade on Thursday, October 23, as investors pinned hopes on a possible breakthrough in the highly anticipated India-US trade deal This comes after US President Donald Trump said he loves India and both countries are working on a trade deal. The President had phoned Prime Minister Narendra Modi to wish Happy Diwali. The development gains significance as Donald Trump recently said that negotiations for a trade deal with India were underway. On Tuesday, Trump also said he had received assurance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a phone call that New Delhi would scale back purchases of Russian oil.In the morning, Gokaldas Exports led the surge, rallying 13% to their day’s high of Rs 899 per share. K.P.R Mill gained 6.5% to its day high of Rs 1,090 per share on the NSE. Raymond Lifestyle shares surged to its day high of Rs 1,246, or 4.2% from the last close. Pearly Global rallied as much as 7% to an intra-day high of Rs 1,403. Indo Count also gained 7% to its day high of Rs 288 per share on the NSE. Welspun Living soared 8% to Rs 132 per share.Other major triggers that could benefit the textile majors include the India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The deal is expected to aid textile exporters by removing the 10–12% duty that had previously hurt them against competitors. The deal now gives India parity with Cambodia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, which already enjoy duty-free access.In addition, the new GST rate on readymade garments priced up to Rs 2,500 has been reduced to 5% from 12%. Man-made fibres, yarns, handloom, handicrafts, and carpets will also face a lower uniform rate of 5%.In a recent report, Crisil Ratings said India’s home textile makers could be staring at a 5-10% decline due to Trump tariffs. Companies that derive more than half of their revenue from the US are expected to feel a sharper impact. To counter this, exporters are eyeing the European Union and the UK, which together made up

[TITLE]United States Lobster Market Consumption Patterns and Forecast Report 2025-2033: Growing Consumer Demand for Premium Seafood, Particularly in the Fine Dining, Retail, and Export Segments:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "United States Lobster Market - Consumption Patterns & Forecast 2025-2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

United States Lobster Market is expected to reach US$ 3.95 billion by 2033 from US$ 2.07 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 7.44% from 2025 to 2033

Strong consumer demand, growing seafood consumption, and growing export prospects are the market's main drivers. Sustainable fishing methods, improvements in cold storage, and rising demand in the retail and catering industries are important considerations.

Growing consumer demand for premium seafood, particularly in the fine dining, retail, and export segments, is driving the lobster business in the United States. The market is expanding due to rising demand for high-protein diets and rising disposable income. In December 2024, personal income climbed by $92.0 billion (0.4%), while disposable personal income increased by $79.7 billion (0.4%), according to data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

Spending on personal consumption increased by $133.6 billion (0.7%). At a 3.8% saving rate, personal savings totaled $843.2 billion. The PCE price index grew by 0.3% on a monthly basis. Restaurants and seafood franchises that specialize in lobster-based cuisine are part of the significant foodservice industry. Consumer trust is growing as a result of the use of sustainable harvesting methods and certification schemes, which raises demand for lobster that is supplied ethically. Technological developments in processing, storage, and transportation enhance product quality and prolong shelf life.

One of the primary drivers of development is still the demand for exports, especially from China, Europe, and Canada. International sales are impacted by market dynamics that are influenced by trade agreements and tariff reductions. Lobster populations are impacted by climate change and changes in water temperatures, which leads to changes in regulations and restrictions on seasonal harvesting. Wider market penetration is supported by the move toward frozen and value-added lobster goods, such as flesh and tails.

For example, in order to grow its lobster and snow crab operations, Phillips Foods, a significant supplier of crabmeat in the United States, said in March 2024 that it would acquire two processing facilities in Canada, located on Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. At Seafood Expo North America, the business will introduce new chilled pasteurized lobster flesh products and a frozen crab toast appetizer. Online seafood markets and direct-to-consumer sales increase accessibility while accommodating changing customer tastes and buying habits.

Key Factors Driving the United States Lobster Market Growth

Growth in Export Markets

Strong demand from important overseas markets, particularly China, Europe, and Canada, is the primary reason for the healthy growth of the U.S. lobster export business. European demand for lobster is rising, especially in upscale dining establishments and retail chains, while China's middle class is developing and its consumption of premium seafood has expanded the market for U.S. lobster. The Food and Agriculture Organization reports that US live lobster shipments to China increased 69% in volume and 55% in value from Q2 2022 to 830 tons valued at USD 16.25 million in Q2 2023.

In the face of economic uncertainty, tighter supply and high demand might result in price increases even with stable EU imports. In addition to the local supply, U.S. lobster is a major trading partner of Canada. Both trade agreements and tariff reductions are crucial tools for enhancing exporters' market accessibility and bolstering export dynamics. The growth of U.S. lobster is being driven by both overseas sales and the rising demand for seafood abroad.

Rising Demand for Premium Seafood

In the US, there is a growing consumer demand for premium, sustainably farmed lobster. Restaurants, shops, and internet platforms are giving priority to lobster that is obtained sustainably as customers grow more conscious of the effects their food choices have on the environment. Red Lobster, for example, unveiled a redesigned menu in November 2024 that includes seven new dishes and the return of the popular hush puppies. With a 20% reduction in total size, the new menu hopes to appeal to seafood enthusiasts.

Lobsterfest will still give visitors an improved experience even though the well-liked Ultimate Endless Shrimp promotion has ended. Customers seeking ethically sourced products are becoming more and more interested in sustainability certifications and traceability initiatives. Seafood companies are responding by highlighting low-impact fishing methods and approved traps as examples of sustainable harvesting practices. This is further demonstrated by the increased demand for premium lobster goods from eateries, specialty shops, and internet marketplaces that cater to affluent customers prepared to shell out more money for superior, eco-friendly seafood.

Rising E-Commerce and D2C Sales

The expansion of the U.S. lobster market is being transformed by e-commerce and direct-to-consumer sales. According to the Census Bureau, retail e-commerce sales in the United States reached $300.1 billion in Q3 2024, increasing 7.4% year over year and 2.6% from Q2 2024. With $1.84 trillion in total retail sales, Q3 saw a 1.3% gain over Q2. 16.2% of the quarter's total revenues came from e-commerce. Without using the conventional retail route, customers can purchase fresh, frozen, or value-added lobster goods straight from producers through online seafood platforms.

In addition to saving time, this increases product variety and transparency in pricing. With cutting-edge packing that preserves product quality, direct shipping services guarantee a quicker delivery. The demand for premium lobster offers through these digital channels keeps rising as more customers look for gourmet seafood experiences at home. The growing desire for individualized purchasing and easy access to sustainable sourcing methods lend credence to this.
