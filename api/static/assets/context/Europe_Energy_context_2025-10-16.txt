[TITLE]North Sea Oil Giants Choose Norway Over Unpredictable UK Market:
[TEXT]
The North Sea has become the site of a live policy experiment, showcasing two dramatically different approaches to the energy transition, with profoundly different results.

While Norway, committed to net zero, backs further exploration, provides long-term regulatory certainty, and cashes in on massive oil and gas revenues, the UK, also focused on net zero, is actively driving away investors.

This divergence occurs against a backdrop of global oil prices, with Brent crude at $62.68 and WTI at $59.10, being suppressed by economic slowdown worries and OPEC+ continuing its ramp-up of production.

Yet, beneath the bearish sentiment, the long-term need for hydrocarbon supply is undeniable, highlighted by the OPEC Secretary General's recent stark warning that the world requires $18.2 trillion in oil and gas investment to meet future demand, a message clearly embraced by Norway, but ignored by the UK.

A Tale of Two North Seas

“There is a huge difference between the two countries’ approach and it has become bigger over the past five years,” Tom Erik Kristiansen, an energy specialist at Nordic-focused investment bank Pareto, told The Telegraph.

“In Norway, you have two or three of the biggest parties agreeing not to touch [the oil and gas industry]. In the UK it is much more party political.”

For decades, successive governments in Norway have supported the oil and gas industry and the domestic supply chain, acknowledging that these create jobs and economic opportunities.

Norway, unlike the UK, strongly supports oil and gas development and exploration for undiscovered resources on its shelf, not only in the North Sea, but also in the Norwegian Sea and the Arctic waters in the Barents Sea.

The Norwegian government has started to plan its 26th oil and gas licensing round in little-explored frontier areas as Norway looks to boost exploration and resources to stem an expected decline in production from the early 2030s.

In Norway, companies can get refunds of 71.8% of losses associated with exploration. The taxes in Norway are high, but they have been this way since the 1990s, providing long-term certainty to operators.

This is so unlike in the UK, where the tax regime has changed every year since 2022 by both Conservative and Labour governments, making any investment plans so unpredictable that companies are quitting the UK North Sea.

Since the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), or the windfall tax, was initially introduced by the Conservative government at the height of the energy crisis in 2022, oil and gas companies operating in the UK North Sea have been calling for certainty in the regulatory and tax framework. Recent changes in policies and the rising taxes imposed by the current Labour government have driven away operators, who say that a lack of North Sea investments would only make the UK more dependent on oil and gas imports.

Late last year, as Labour further raised the windfall tax, it also removed the 29% investment allowance on oil and gas operations, further stifling UK North Sea investment.

The result has been an exodus of companies, a decline in production, and a slump in exploration drilling.

In fact, due to the fiscal turmoil in recent years, 2025 is set to become the first year since 1960 without a single exploration well in the UK North Sea, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

What The Future Holds

The UK’s unpredictable regulatory and tax regime has already pushed operators away from the UK North Sea.

At the end of last year, U.S. oil producer Apache said it would cease oil production at its assets in the UK North Sea by 2030, saying that “the expected returns do not economically support making investments required under the combined impact of the regulations.”

In a major blow to the UK industry, Ineos Energy this summer ended UK investment, after warning a few months earlier that the tax is “the most unstable fiscal regime in the world.”

The UK’s “current tax regime, its over-regulation and the negative political attitude towards oil and gas are barriers that would deter any investor at the moment,” Ineos Energy chairman Brian Gilvary, a former chief financial officer at BP, said last December.

The UK government has launched consultations on what type of tax regime should come next and on whether to award licenses in the North Sea. Decisions are expected later this autumn.

The main offshore energy industries association, OEUK, urges the government to replace the Energy Profits Levy with a permanent profits-based tax system and update licensing rules “to provide predictable access to new resources, ensuring infrastructure is fully utilised rather than decommissioned prematurely.”

The loss of investment is reducing oil and gas production—it has plunged by 40% in the past five years and is on track to halve again by 2030, OEUK warns.

While the UK is in a race against time to save its oil and gas industry and its industrial capabilities from demise, Norway is enjoying higher oil and gas production as new fields come online.

But Western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer, Norway, is not complacent. It is aware that it needs more exploration and new field developments to keep output at high levels while the world still needs it.

The current and past Norwegian governments have continuously bet on the oil and gas industry and the massive revenues it raises for the country and its sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest. Government Pension Fund Global, which is commonly referred to as ‘Norway’s oil fund’ because it was created with oil and gas revenues, has $2 trillion worth of assets and holds on average 1.5% of all listed companies in the world.

“Norway wants to be a long-term supplier of oil and gas to Europe, while the Norwegian continental shelf will continue to create value and jobs for our country,” Energy Minister Terje Aasland said in August, announcing the plans for a new licensing round.

“We need new discoveries to ensure that Norway can remain a stable and predictable supplier of oil and gas to Europe,” Aasland said earlier this year.

[TITLE]Brazil, other nations agree to quadruple sustainable fuels:
[TEXT]
Brazil, India, Italy and Japan have vowed to dramatically increase production and consumption of renewable fuels ahead of the UN's planned climate summit in Belem, Brazil - Copyright AFP Sergio Lima

Brazil, India, Italy and Japan vowed Tuesday to quadruple their production and consumption of renewable fuels, hoping other countries will join the pledge during UN climate talks in November.

“We hope to have a good number of signatories” by COP30, Brazilian foreign ministry official Joao Marcos Paes Leme told reporters in the capital Brasilia.

“Other European countries are also interested,” he added.

Paes Leme was speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of representatives from 67 countries in the run up to COP30 climate talks in the Amazon city of Belem next month.

The pledge involves quadrupling the production of sustainable fuels such as biofuels, hydrogen and some synthetic fuels by 2035, compared to 2024 levels.

Paes Leme noted that these fuels can be used to replace planet-harming fossil fuels in sectors such as aviation, maritime transport, or the cement and steel industries.

“These are sectors where decarbonization is difficult,” because electrical energy has not yet succeeded in replacing fossil fuels.

Sustainable fuels are already used in these industries “but they are not produced in sufficient quantities,” he said.

The massive use of coal, oil, and fossil gas for energy since the industrial revolution is the primary driver of human-induced global warming.

The commitment to sustainable fuels “is something we love to hear,” said Francesco La Camera, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

However, he warned that some biofuels can be harmful due to the vast expanses of land required to produce raw materials such as sugarcane, soy, or corn.

[TITLE]Energy companies will factor in subsidies to ‘gouge’ customers, Taoiseach says:
[TEXT]
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said pressure needed to be put on energy companies that were factoring subsidies into their costs. Photograph: PA

Energy companies will keep “gouging” customers if the Government keeps providing credits to domestic customers, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.

Pressure needed to be put on the companies, he added, because they were factoring such subsidies into their costs.

“If you keep [giving] them, then we keep underpinning the gouging,” he said. “If you give €500 every year it will be factored in.”

He was referring to various energy credits for households issued by Government over recent years.

Mr Martin was responding in the Dáil to Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald who highlighted reports that energy companies are charging householders three times the wholesale price.

“That’s price gouging, plain and simple; a rip-off, plain and simple,” she said. Ms McDonald said the report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) showed that Ireland has the highest electricity prices in Europe.

“These companies are refusing to pass on the drop in wholesale price to their customers,” she said.

“Big energy companies are making bumper profits on the backs of working households and hundreds of thousands of those already can’t afford to pay their bills.”

Ms McDonald said the Government was showing “deference” to the energy companies. “People have known for a long time that they are being gouged on their energy bills,” but she said the Government was doing nothing about it.

The Taoiseach accused her of always going after “the latest headlines” and asked why she went after the Government instead of “going after the companies”.

But Mr Martin said Minister for Energy Darragh O’Brien had established a national group to look at the regulatory framework governing the pricing of energy.

“We need more renewable energy,” but Ireland is almost 80 per cent reliant on imports and one of the fundamental factors affecting energy prices is the price of gas.

Ms McDonald said the IEA report confirmed Ireland had the highest prices in Europe but the Taoiseach said Ireland had the eighth-highest electricity prices in the EU when adjusted for “purchasing power parity”.

People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy said energy companies “are engaging in blatant profiteering on the backs of ordinary people.”

The Dublin Southwest TD said there were no controls to stop what Mr Martin himself referred to as “gouging”.

Asking what the Government would do to help people this winter, he called for energy credits to be reintroduced.

But the Taoiseach insisted that “we will not be introducing price controls. They failed in the past and they would fail again.”

[TITLE]How Global Offshore Wind Is Battling a Perfect Storm of Challenges:
[TEXT]
Over the past couple of years, the global offshore wind sector has been facing growing pains, with supply chain constraints, policy volatility, and economic headwinds threatening a power segment that has been slated to become the most dominant wind energy source in many regions. These challenges are increasingly forcing companies in the space to abandon projects and undergo strategic restructuring as the momentum for offshore wind and other nascent clean energy industries, such as hydrogen, wanes. To wit, last year, Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced plans to cease new offshore wind investments and split its power division as CEO Wael Sawan looks to boost the company’s profitability. Shell appears to be systematically scaling back its clean energy investments: Earlier in the year, the company also ditched plans to build a low-carbon hydrogen plant on Norway's west coast due to a lack of demand.

Earlier in the same year, Norway's state-controlled energy giant Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) abandoned plans to invest in Vietnam's offshore wind sector, dealing a significant blow to the country's green energy ambitions. According to the World Bank, over the past couple of years, Vietnam has attracted plenty of interest in its clean energy sector thanks to the country’s strong winds in shallow waters near coastal, densely populated areas. Unfortunately, recent political turbulence in the country has paralyzed regulatory reforms and discouraged investors. That marked the first time Equinor had abandoned offshore wind development; in contrast, the company had previously exited more than a dozen fossil fuel projects to focus on renewables and low-carbon systems. Back in 2023, Danish offshore wind giant Ørsted A/S (OTCPK:DNNGY) paused its multi-gigawatt offshore wind plans in Vietnam, citing issues with the "route to market," business ethics, and a lack of a comprehensive legal framework for the sector.

Related: North Sea Oil: Booming in Norway and Doomed in the UK

Unfortunately, the offshore wind sector woes appear to be going nowhere. Back in July, Ørsted paid $110 million to Danish offshore wind services provider Cadeler (NYSE:CDLR) as compensation for the cancellation of the construction of a wind turbine installation vessel (WTIV) for the 2.4 GW Hornsea 4 offshore wind farm in the UK. In May, Ørsted announced the cancellation of the project, citing higher rates, rising supply chain costs and increased construction risks as some of the challenges. Ørsted was among the developers who were awarded contracts in the UK’s Allocation Round 6 (AR6) in 2024 that procured 9.6 GW of clean energy capacity from offshore and onshore wind and solar energy. AR6 marked a major improvement from AR5, which failed to secure any new offshore wind projects.

On a brighter note, Cadeler’s short-term financials will receive a boost from the receipt of the termination compensation, with the company recently upgrading its full-year 2025 revenue to the range of EUR 588 million to EUR 628 million, up from EUR 485 million to EUR 525 million, while the EBITDA forecast for 2025 is expected to clock in at EUR 381–421 million, up from EUR 278–318 million.

Meanwhile, Singapore’s Seatrium Ltd (OTCPK:SMBMF) recently received a notice of the termination of a WTIV contract by Maersk Offshore Wind valued at $475 million. Seatrium had secured the contract in 2022 while still operating as Sembcorp Marine, before it merged with Keppel Offshore and Marine in 2023 in a $3.34 billion deal. Maersk says it will try and recover monies already paid to Seatrium, adding that it will not accept delivery of the unit due to delays in the construction schedule despite the project being ~ 98.9%. Seatrium shares have tanked nearly 15% after the announcement of the Maersk decision.

Maersk's cancellation of the Seatrium deal could signal that it’s abandoning the offshore wind business, which says something considering the startling fall of its core container shipping business. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that container shipping rates for the busy Shanghai to Los Angeles route have declined by nearly 60%, meaning the company is likely receiving below $2,200 per container it requires to break even.

That said, the U.S. offshore wind sector could fare worse than its European peers thanks to policy headwinds by the Trump administration. Trump has cancelled ~$679 million in U.S. offshore wind project funding, stifling growth and development of the nascent sector. In contrast, WindEurope recently reported it built 6.8 GW of wind power across Europe in the first half of 2025, comprising 6 GW onshore and 0.7 GW offshore. Europe is, by far, the biggest offshore wind market in the world, commanding 92% of the floating offshore wind market. However, Asia-Pacific is enjoying the fastest growth, with the region projected to expand at a torrid 156% CAGR through 2030.

[TITLE]US, China roll out port fees, threatening more trade turmoil:
[TEXT]
Analysts have warned the tit-for-tat trade fees risk ‘distorting global freight flows’ for goods ranging from petrol to toys.

The United States and China have started charging additional port fees on ocean shipping firms that move everything from holiday toys to crude oil, making the high seas a key front in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

A return to an all-out trade war appeared imminent last week, after China announced a major expansion of its rare earths export controls, and US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to triple digits.

But after the weekend, both sides sought to reassure traders and investors, highlighting cooperation between their negotiating teams and the possibility they could find a way forward.

China said it had started to collect the special charges on US-owned, operated, built or flagged vessels, but it clarified that Chinese-built ships would be exempted from the levies.

In details published by state broadcaster CCTV, China spelled out specific provisions on exemptions, which also include empty ships entering Chinese shipyards for repair.

Similar to the US plan, the new China-imposed fees would be collected at the first port of entry on a single voyage or for the first five voyages within a year.

“This tit-for-tat symmetry locks both economies into a spiral of maritime taxation that risks distorting global freight flows,” Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers said in a research note.

Early this year, the Trump administration announced plans to levy the fees on China-linked ships to loosen the country’s grip on the global maritime industry and bolster US shipbuilding.

An investigation during the administration of former US President Joe Biden concluded that China uses unfair policies and practices to dominate the global maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors, clearing the way for those penalties.

China hit back last week, saying it would impose its own port fees on US-linked vessels from the same day the US fees took effect.

“We are in the hectic stage of the disruption, where everyone is quietly trying to improvise workarounds, with varying degrees of success,” said independent dry bulk shipping analyst Ed Finley-Richardson. He said he has heard reports of US shipowners with non-Chinese vessels trying to sell their cargoes to other countries while en route, so the vessels can divert.

The Reuters news agency was not immediately able to confirm this.

Tit-for-tat moves

Analysts expect China-owned container carrier COSCO to be the most affected by the US fees, shouldering nearly half of that segment’s expected $3.2bn cost from the fees in 2026.

Major container lines, including Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd and CMA CGM, slashed their exposure by switching China-linked ships out of their US shipping lanes. Trade officials there reduced fees from initially proposed levels, and exempted a broad swath of vessels after heavy pushback from the agriculture, energy and US shipping industries.

The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

China’s Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday said, “If the US chooses confrontation, China will see it through to the end; if it chooses dialogue, China’s door remains open.”

In a related move, Beijing also imposed sanctions on Tuesday against five US-linked subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, which it said had “assisted and supported” a US probe into Chinese trade practices.

Hanwha, one of the world’s largest shipbuilders, owns Philly Shipyard in the US and has won contracts to repair and overhaul US Navy ships. Its entities will also build a US-flagged LNG carrier.

Hanwha said it is aware of the announcement and is closely monitoring the potential business impact. Hanwha Ocean’s shares sank by nearly 6 percent.

China also launched an investigation into how the US probe affected its shipping and shipbuilding industries.

A Shanghai-based trade consultant said the new fees may not cause significant upheaval.

“What are we going to do? Stop shipping? Trade is already pretty disrupted with the US, but companies are finding a way,” the consultant told Reuters, requesting anonymity because he was not authorised to speak with the media.

The US announced last Friday a carve-out for long-term charterers of China-operated vessels carrying US ethane and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), deferring the port fees for them through December 10.

Meanwhile, ship-tracking company Vortexa identified 45 LPG-carrying VLGCs — an acronym for very large gas carriers, a type of vessel — that would be subject to China’s port fee. That amounts to 11 percent of the total fleet.

Clarksons Research said in a report that China’s new port fees could affect oil tankers accounting for 15 percent of global capacity.

Meanwhile, Omar Nokta, an analyst at the financial firm Jefferies, estimated that 13 percent of crude tankers and 11 percent of container ships in the global fleet would be affected.

Trade war embroils environmental policy

In a reprisal against China curbing exports of critical minerals, Trump on Friday threatened to slap additional 100 percent tariffs on goods from China and put new export controls on “any and all critical software” by November 1.

Administration officials, hours later, warned that countries voting this week in favour of a plan by the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from ocean shipping could face sanctions, port bans, or punitive vessel charges.

China has publicly supported the IMO plan.

“The weaponisation of both trade and environmental policy signals that shipping has moved from being a neutral conduit of global commerce to a direct instrument of statecraft,” Athens-based Xclusiv said.

[TITLE]Energy Secretary speech to Energy UK conference 2025:
[TEXT]
Let me start by offering sincere thanks for Energy UK for hosting this conference.

And I want to thank Dhara [Vyas] for your leadership over the last year as CEO, can you join me in giving this tribute.

You are a brilliant champion of this industry.

Coming here today I am once again reminded that it is an incredibly exciting time for the energy sector.

Wherever you work, there is a sense of huge possibility for the future—and I want to thank you all for the work you are doing.

And I am incredibly proud of everything we have achieved together over the last 15 months, it has only been possible because of our work together, including:

Consenting record amounts of clean energy, enough to power the equivalent of more than 7.5 million homes—including just today Tillbridge solar farm, which alone will power hundreds of thousands of homes.

We are ending the first come first served grid connections queue.

Introducing the biggest reform of planning in a generation.

Setting up Great British Energy.

Investing in the biggest nuclear building programme in half a century.

And kickstarting our carbon capture and hydrogen industries.

None of this would have been possible without your advice, support and delivery.

All these achievements speaks to a wider purpose, which I believe unites so many people in this room.

Building our country’s clean energy future as part of a bigger vision of a fairer, more prosperous economy.

Soon we’ll publish our Clean Energy Jobs Plan, which will show not just the hundreds of thousands of good jobs that already exist in this sector, but also the hundreds of thousands of new jobs we expect to be created by 2030. This making a difference.

But of course, we also know that creating an economy for the many involves tackling the long-running cost of living crisis that so many people face.

And that’s what I want to focus on today.

We will be judged on the success of our mission in delivering for consumers, and rightly so.

My case today is this:

First, our exposure to fossil fuel markets remains the Achilles heel of our energy system, keeping bills high and giving us no long-term certainty over price.

Second, that we face further challenges of historic under-investment in our energy system and growing electricity demand. The choice for the future is therefore what kind of energy system we want to build, not whether we want to build it at all.

Third, building clean energy is the right choice for the country because, despite the challenges, it is the only route to a system that can reliably bring down bills for good, and give us clean energy abundance.

Fourth, as we build this new infrastructure, the government is determined to work with you to bring the benefits to families and businesses as quickly as possible.

First, memories can be short in Westminster.

But we should never forget the huge damage to family finances, business finances and the public finances caused by the energy shock we have been through in recent years—a shock that still reverberates today.

And the reason for this damage is because the UK was and is so exposed to international fossil fuel markets due to our dependence on gas across the economy.

Even today, wholesale gas costs for households are still 75% higher than before the energy crisis.

If they were at pre-crisis levels, bills would be more than £200 a year lower than they are today for families.

The same story applies to business.

Industrial electricity prices soared at the start of the energy crisis and have remained stuck at high levels.

So while it is true we have inherited a system of paying for network and other costs which is less weighted towards public spending than other countries, a large part of the issue facing industry in the UK is our exposure to fossil fuels.

SINGAPORE, Oct. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ: BTDR) (“Bitdeer” or the “Company”), a world-leading technology company for Bitcoin mining, today announced its unaudited mining and operations updates for September 2025.

Operational Update

Self-mining: 452 Bitcoins mined, an increase of ~20.5% from August 2025 due to higher average self-mining hashrate from energization of SEALMINERs. 35.0 EH/s deployed. On track to reach 40 EH/s at the end of October. After October, Bitdeer will continue deploying SEALMINER mining rigs for self-mining and concurrently begin retiring all third-party, older-generation rigs to further enhance profitability and fleet efficiency.

452 Bitcoins mined, an increase of ~20.5% from August 2025 due to higher average self-mining hashrate from energization of SEALMINERs. 35.0 EH/s deployed. On track to reach 40 EH/s at the end of October. After October, Bitdeer will continue deploying SEALMINER mining rigs for self-mining and concurrently begin retiring all third-party, older-generation rigs to further enhance profitability and fleet efficiency. Mining Rig Manufacturing and R&D: SEALMINER A2: Total of 34.2 EH/s in mining rigs have been manufactured and an additional 2.8 EH/s are in final assembly as of end of September 2025. Of the 34.2 EH/s mining rigs that have been manufactured: External-sales: 6.1 EH/s of mining rigs have been shipped to external customers, including 0.1 EH/s that were shipped in September. Self-mining: 22.6 EH/s of mining rigs have been deployed in U.S., Tydal, Norway and Jigmeling, Bhutan, including 4.6 EH/s in September 2025. 5.5 EH/s of mining rigs are in-transit to Bitdeer’s sites in Norway and Bhutan. SEALMINER A3: Launched in September, the A3 series includes four models: Two air-cooling models A3 Air and A3 Pro Air, achieving a power efficiency of 12.5 J/TH ~ 14 J/TH and a hashrate of 260 TH/s ~ 290 TH/s. Two hydro-cooling models A3 Hydro and A3 Pro Hydro, reaching a power efficiency of 12.5 J/TH ~ 13.5 J/TH and a hashrate of 500 TH/s ~ 660 TH/s. Commenced mass production and expect initial deliveries/shipments in October 2025 for self-mining. SEALMINER A4: Planning two different chip designs of SEAL04 to ensure success. The first SEAL04 chip tape out was completed in September and are currently under testing. Initial results from the early samples demonstrated sub-10 J/TH power efficiency at the chip level, though still above the 5 J/TH target. Awaiting further sample testing to verify the feasibility of achieving the 5 J/TH chip-level power efficiency goal on the first SEAL04. Nevertheless, Bitdeer is now confident that the first SEAL04 chip is ready for mass production and will deliver significant power efficiency improvements. The SEAL04 with the new architecture is still expected to reach a target chip level efficiency of 5 J/TH. U.S. Manufacturing: Bitdeer’s U.S. factory is actively in planning and preparation.

HPC/AI: As of September, Bitdeer allowed its LOI (Letter of Intent) with its development partner to expire in order to significantly expand its direct role in the HPC/AI data center market. In conjunction, Bitdeer has initiated design and layout planning for the Clarington, Ohio site. The new data center will be suitable for Bitcoin mining, with core infrastructure designed from the start to enable easy conversion into an AI data center with redundancy and other critical design elements to ensure flexibility and scalability. Actively recruiting US based in-house experts across multiple AI data center disciplines. HPC/AI priority remains Clarington, Ohio, where the local utility has confirmed that the full 570 MW will be available by the end of Q3 2026—nearly a year earlier than prior expectations. Teams are targeting substation energization in the first half of 2027. Bitdeer also plans to convert its 175 MW Tydal Phase 2 site into an AI data center with expected completion date of Q4 2026. This site is expected to support 164 MW of key IT load after applying various security redundancy considerations. During the conversion process, mining operations will be minimally impacted, as the Tydal, Phase 2 design had already incorporated potential conversion from Bitcoin mining to an AI data center. The capital expenditure required for this conversion will be significantly lower than the average cost of constructing a new AI data center in the U.S or Norway. Bitdeer is also working on converting its Wenatchee 13 MW site into an AI data center with modular data center technology. Bitdeer is also sourcing data center resources in Southeast Asia, either through rental arrangements or self-built facilities. By the end of 2026, Bitdeer expects to operate more than 200 MW of IT load dedicated to AI computing, the majority of which will be owned by Bitdeer. Bitdeer plans to pursue two business models in parallel or in combination — colocation services and AI factory operations. Bitdeer sees sustained imbalance between the growing demand and limited supply of AI computing power, and expects it to extend through 2027. In the most optimistic scenario, Bitdeer plans to acquire GPUs for cloud deployment and convert the entire 200 MW of IT load into an AI factory, potentially generating an annualized revenue run-rate (ARR) exceeding US$2 billion at the end of 2026. Bitdeer.AI, Bitdeer’s neo cloud business, reached US$8 million AI cloud ARR in September from providing GPU cloud services, with significant growth expected in the remaining three months of 2025. Cloud services has 584 GPUs as of September 2025, of which 501 GPUs are under subscribed, with a utilization rate of approximately 86%. The un-utilized GPUs are B200 GPUs, which were newly installed at the end of September, and are being tested by customers. Bitdeer anticipates full deployment of 1,160 GPUs by year-end. Bitdeer is concurrently securing procurement agreements for NVIDIA's next-generation GB300 and B300 systems.

Infrastructure: Tydal, Norway (Hydro): All 175 MW is energized. Jigmeling, Bhutan: All 500 MW is energized. Niles, Ohio: Officially launched 300 MW grid-interconnected site in Niles, Ohio with a target energization date of Q1 2029. Includes 41.8 acres of owned land and an interconnection agreement with FirstEnergy. Located approximately 1 hour away from existing Massillon Ohio site and 2 hours away from Clarington Ohio site. Total global power pipeline: Increased to 3 GW.

Management Commentary

"In September, we allowed our LOI with our development partner to expire,” said Matt Kong, Chief Business Officer at Bitdeer. “While we remain free to collaborate with this partner in the future, we have chosen to significantly expand our direct role in the HPC/AI data center market. Our expanded initiatives include negotiating directly with potential tenants, building relationships with EPCs specializing in data centers, developing proprietary AI data centers and hiring in-house experts across multiple AI data center disciplines. In parallel, we are accelerating the development of additional sites for HPC/AI data centers at our Clarington, Tydal, and Wenatchee sites. This push is driven by a marked increase in inbound interest in our power assets, which has become a strong catalyst for expanding our efforts.”

Mr. Kong continued, “Our ASICs and self-mining operational team continued to execute. In September, our first SEAL04 chip tape out was completed and initial testing demonstrates significant efficiency improvements compared to existing chips. Further, we successfully launched our SEALMINER A3 series with our Pro versions boasting a power efficiency of 12.5 J/TH. Mass production began in September and initial shipments are expected in October. In addition, our self-mining hashrate grew to 35 EH/s and remain on track to achieve 40 EH/s by end of October. Over the coming quarters, we will continue expanding our SEALMINER fleet into our near-term global power capacity, putting us on track to become one of the largest vertically integrated miners in the world.”

[TITLE]Brazil, other nations agree to quadruple sustainable fuels:
[TEXT]
Brazil, India, Italy and Japan have vowed to dramatically increase production and consumption of renewable fuels ahead of the UN's planned climate summit in Belem, Brazil - Copyright AFP Sergio Lima

Brazil, India, Italy and Japan vowed Tuesday to quadruple their production and consumption of renewable fuels, hoping other countries will join the pledge during UN climate talks in November.

“We hope to have a good number of signatories” by COP30, Brazilian foreign ministry official Joao Marcos Paes Leme told reporters in the capital Brasilia.

“Other European countries are also interested,” he added.

Paes Leme was speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of representatives from 67 countries in the run up to COP30 climate talks in the Amazon city of Belem next month.

The pledge involves quadrupling the production of sustainable fuels such as biofuels, hydrogen and some synthetic fuels by 2035, compared to 2024 levels.

Paes Leme noted that these fuels can be used to replace planet-harming fossil fuels in sectors such as aviation, maritime transport, or the cement and steel industries.

“These are sectors where decarbonization is difficult,” because electrical energy has not yet succeeded in replacing fossil fuels.

Sustainable fuels are already used in these industries “but they are not produced in sufficient quantities,” he said.

The massive use of coal, oil, and fossil gas for energy since the industrial revolution is the primary driver of human-induced global warming.

The commitment to sustainable fuels “is something we love to hear,” said Francesco La Camera, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

However, he warned that some biofuels can be harmful due to the vast expanses of land required to produce raw materials such as sugarcane, soy, or corn.

“We have to be serious

[TITLE]India Energy Transition Fund marks first close, EIB arm commits $60 mn:
[TEXT]
The India Energy Transition Fund, managed by EAAA Alternatives, has achieved its first close at $163 million with a commitment of $60 million from the European Investment Bank's development arm, EIB Global.

The total corpus of the fund is targeted at $300 million, which will be invested in greenfield infrastructure projects and growth-stage companies.

The announcement was made on Tuesday in New Delhi by EIB vice president Nicola Beer and EAAA Alternatives chief executive Subahoo Chordia.

“EIB’s development arm, EIB Global, is investing up to $60 million in the India Energy Transition Fund, a new greenfield infrastructure fund that will accelerate private capital investment in sustainable infrastructure and support decarbonisation efforts in India. It is the country’s first energy transition fund managed by a domestic fund manager,” said a joint statement from EIB Global and EAAA Alternatives.

Most commitments will focus on climate action and environmental sustainability, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, transmission, battery energy storage, and electric vehicles. This may also potentially support circular economy sectors such as recycling and wastewater management, the statement said.

“India is one of Europe’s most important partners in the global green transition. By joining forces with the India Energy Transition Fund, we are helping to accelerate renewable energy, strengthen energy security and affordability and unlock sustainable infrastructure investment across the country. This initiative shows how EIB Global, as part of the EU Global Gateway strategy, mobilizes capital to deliver real climate action, better conditions for households and lower energy prices,” said Beer.

Chordia added that EIB Global’s partnership adds depth and credibility to this effort, “helping us accelerate India’s clean energy and decarbonization journey while delivering long-term value for investors. Together, we will foster innovation, attract further private capital, and drive long-term sustainable growth”.

Along with accelerating new capacity additions and supporting companies that pioneer clean energy and decarbonization solutions, the initiative also aims to create opportunities for technology and investment flows between India and the European Union.

EIB Global aims to support €100 billion of investment by the end of 2027. This investment by EIB Global is part of the European Union’s Global Gateway Investment Agenda, supporting projects that improve global and regional connectivity in the digital, climate, transport, health, energy, and education sectors.

[TITLE]Resilience of the lambs: Some US solar projects are farming much more than sunlight:
[TEXT]
Image art by Paul Gerke via ChatGPT-5. Any resemblance to copyrighted material is incidental and otherwise protected as parody under Section 107 of the Copyright Act.

Ask 100 people how U.S. farmland should be used for solar photovoltaic development, and you might get 100 different answers.

Advocates point out that solar is much more efficient than ethanol, which is the end-use for more than 40% of total U.S. corn production, eating up 30 million arable acres. It takes 31 acres of corn grown for ethanol, in fact, to produce the same energy as a single acre of solar panels. That’s a glaring statistic amidst unprecedented load growth. Plus, harvesting sunlight decreases pollution from fertilizer runoff and protects the land from erosion caused by annual tillage.

But that logic only goes so far, as every farmer considering letting someone plant panels on their land has unique interests. Some value every cent they can squeeze out of each square acre, while others are concerned with preservation or upholding family traditions. The American Farmland Trust asked hundreds of Virginian farmers for their thoughts last year and found nearly two-thirds think solar is best suited for less productive land.

“We need farmland,” one poll respondent replied. “How [else] are we going to feed ourselves in the future?

That narrative, in particular, is pervasive at a time of increasing food prices. It has been politicized in some state legislatures and by a federal government that seems more focused on fossil fuel production than pushing along utility-scale solar projects.

But who says the installation of a state-of-the-art solar PV system necessarily means the land is out of commission? Recent polling suggests most farmers are open to large-scale solar projects on their properties if they can still produce crops or raise livestock around the infrastructure —precisely how some developers are making inroads with the gatekeepers to transmission line rights-of-way.

Agrivoltaics, using land for both farming and solar energy generation, is a middle ground between the naysayers and the panel-pushers. The customized projects are becoming increasingly popular, and developers are getting creative with what they’re harvesting beyond photons.

“What used to involve just pilot projects for much of the industry is now part of how new plants are designed from the start. Dual-use is our expectation, not just an experiment,” Jesse Puckett, Enel North America’s director of sustainability projects and community affairs, told Factor This.

GO DEEPER: Listen to Harvesting sunlight: Agrivoltaics is winning over middle America, a Factor This podcast hosted by Paul Gerke featuring Ethan Winter of the American Farmland Trust, BlueWave Energy’s Jesse Robertson-Dubois, and Ed Baptista of Doral Renewables.

Hives for Heroes

Enel North America has quite an appetite for dual-use projects, which makes sense, considering how many mouths (much less stomachs) the company is now feeding. Last summer, the clean energy company announced a partnership with Texas Solar Sheep Company to deploy more than 6,000 sheep across eight Texas solar sites as part of the largest known solar grazing agreement executed in the United States. Since then, Enel has grown its flock to more than 13,000.

Data centers are booming. But there are big energy and environmental risks

Google recently courted the township of Franklin, Ind., so that it could construct a giant campus to house the computer hardware that powers its internet business. But the company needed to rezone more than 450 acres in the Indianapolis suburb, and residents weren't having it.

Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

Sponsor Message

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition "slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation," says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Shares of Bloom Energy soared early Monday after it made a deal with Brookfield Asset Management to install fuel cells in artificial intelligence data centers. Brookfield will spend up to $5 billion to use Bloom Energy’s technology. This is Brookfield’s first investment in its strategy to support large AI data centers with both power and computing infrastructure.Bloom Energy’s fuel cells are “fuel-flexible” and can run on natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen, according to the company. Brookfield and Bloom will collaborate to design and build “AI factories” around the world, including a site in Europe that will be unveiled before the end of the year, as stated by CNBC report. Bloom energy stock surgeBloom Energy shares jumped almost 30% in early trading after the announcement. Bloom’s fuel cells provide onsite power and can be installed quickly because they don’t rely on a connection to the electric grid.The company has already installed hundreds of megawatts of fuel cells through deals with utilities like American Electric Power and data center developers such as Equinix and Oracle , according to Bloom Energy, as mentioned in the report by CNBC.AI data centers need off-grid powerThe AI industry’s data center plans are growing fast. For example, Nvidia and OpenAI recently announced a partnership to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, which equals the power used by New York City during peak summer.AI companies face a problem: the U.S. electric grid is old and often slow to provide extra power. Building new data centers could also raise electricity prices for homes. Deploying “behind-the-meter” power solutions (off the grid) is essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories, said Sikander Rashid, Brookfield’s global head of AI infrastructure KR Sridhar, Bloom Energy CEO, said, “AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC last week, “Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that.” Huang added that the AI industry will need off-grid power to quickly meet demand and protect consumers from rising electricity prices.FAQsBecause Bloom Energy made a $5 billion deal with Brookfield to supply fuel cells for AI data centers.They will build “AI factories” using Bloom’s fuel cells to provide fast, off-grid power for AI data centers worldwide.

[TITLE]Critics Fear Financial Titans Have Found Trojan Horse For ‘Climate Mandates’:
[TEXT]
Major global asset managers including BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America in a move that some industry insiders warn could harm consumers, raise electricity costs and advance a climate-driven energy agenda.

In recent months, Blackstone reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy utilities in New Mexico and Texas all while a BlackRock-led group won approval Friday to purchase a major utility in Minnesota. While BlackRock and other huge asset managers have distanced themselves from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment practices in recent years, some energy experts and consumer advocates that spoke to the Daily Caller News Foundation are concerned that buying up utilities may represent a new frontier of financial giants orchestrating “climate mandates.”

“BlackRock isn’t just influencing utilities anymore, they’re buying them. After years of ESG-driven coercion that pushed utilities to abandon reliable energy in favor of China-dependent renewables, BlackRock is now taking direct control. The result will be more of the same: higher costs, weaker grids, and millions in unpaid bills, all driven by the very climate mandates they lobbied for,” Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, told the DCNF. “Minnesotans should brace for more unreliable power, rising rates, and a media narrative that blames Trump for ending taxpayer-funded handouts instead of holding the woke politicians and Wall Street elites responsible for the crisis.” (RELATED: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’)

Electricity demand is on the rise after years of stagnancy as the artificial intelligence (AI) race ushers in the build out of power-hungry data centers. Utility costs are also spiking as demand takes off in a trend that dates back to the Biden administration.

Against this backdrop, private investment titans like BlackRock and Blackstone are reportedly moving to buy power utility companies and invest in data center expansions and startups.

Minnesota recently granted the BlackRock-led group known as Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) approval to buy one of the state’s major power utilities, Allete. GIP is also reportedly on the cusp of acquiring the major energy company, AES, according to sources familiar with the matter that spoke with Reuters. The Financial Times reported that the deal may be for $38 billion.

BlackRock referred the DCNF to Allete’s statement on regulators approving its partnership with GIP and declined to comment further for this story.

Allete’s statement notes that the impending partnership with the BlackRock-led group includes “guaranteed access to capital to fund ALLETE’s five-year plan for advancing transmission and renewable energy goals [and a] $50 million Clean Firm Technology Fund to support regional clean-energy projects and partnerships.”

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) renewed BlackRock’s ability to own up to 20% of utility voting shares in April, with former FERC Commissioner Mark Christie stating that BlackRock “pledged not to use its holdings to influence utility management” and that utilities need the access to capital.

Christie also warned in September 2024 that “this is an issue that deserves much greater scrutiny” and that “the influence that large shareholders, BlackRock or otherwise, can potentially exert across the consumer-serving utility industry should not be underestimated.”

Blackstone has reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy out the Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power Co. recently, according to The Associated Press. The asset management giant also secured a 19.9% stake in a Northern Indiana public utility for over $2 billion in January 2024.

“Blackstone’s sustainability strategy prioritizes accelerating decarbonization by investing in the energy transition and driving value accretive emissions reduction in our portfolio,” Blackstone’s 2024 sustainability report states. “We believe the transition to cleaner energy creates meaningful investment opportunities for private capital. For over a decade, we have pursued attractive investments in companies and assets that are part of the global energy transition as part of our broader energy investing strategy.”

Blackstone also announced on Sept. 15 that private equity funds affiliated with Blackstone Energy Transition Partners will acquire the Pennsylvania-based Hill Top Energy Center natural gas plant for almost $1 billion. The company also announced in July that funds managed by Blackstone Infrastructure and Blackstone Real Estate would invest over $25 billion to help build out Pennsylvania’s energy infrastructure to support the AI “revolution.”

“Renewable” energy goals and ESG investment tend to align with emissions-reduction targets, with some power companies, utilities and states that set goals to cut emissions striving to retire conventional energy sources like coal plants. Isaac added that companies like American Electric Power, in which BlackRock owns a significant stake, have been decommissioning coal plants and replacing them with intermittent sources like solar.

“What happens is when the wind stops blowing and the sun stops shining, then you have to ramp those generational assets back up, and that’s when price spikes happen,” Isaac said. (RELATED: ‘A Huge Win’: Woke ‘Cartel’ Of Financial Giants Dealt Death Blow 11 Days Before Trump Takes Office)

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance Greg Brown told the AP that the reason behind these buyouts are “very simple. Because there’s a lot of money to be made.”

Other experts devoted to consumer protection like Executive Director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild told the DCNF that investment companies like BlackRock stand to gain more than just a profit from these purchases.

“There is no world in which BlackRock’s ownership of American energy benefits ordinary American consumers,” Hild told the DCNF. “This is the same firm that proudly brought us the radical ESG rules and Net-Zero nonsense that forced all our energy bills to skyrocket. We wouldn’t have the scourge of woke capitalism without Larry Fink, who already controls nearly $13 trillion in assets and has been sued for violating anti-trust laws.”

ESG investors weigh a company by its social and environmental choices as well as its finances in a move that critics say bogs down businesses with new costs while doing little to combat climate change. One August 2023 InfluenceMap report showed that as Republicans at the state level and in Congress ramped up their opposition to ESG-focused practices, BlackRock and other major U.S. asset managers decreased their support for climate-related resolutions.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also said in June 2023 that he no will no longer use the term ESG because it has been “politicized,” less than a year after he noted that climbing energy prices are “accelerating” the green energy transition.

“BlackRock has backpedaled on its ESG messaging and its aggressive, unapologetic imposition of ESG on everything they touch. But the leopard hasn’t changed its spots,” President of the Heartland Institute James Taylor told the DCNF. “It still has the same management group with the same values, and it’s still doing whatever it can to impose ESG on everything it touches, in actuality, if not in name.”

Taylor argued that whether BlackRock buys or acquires a large stake of a utility, it “can now assert itself over legislatures in dictating energy policy.”

Notably, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals in May.

The lawsuit, backed by 11 state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock and multiple other asset managers used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby hurting consumers by causing the price of coal to climb.

The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson previously told the DCNF. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.”

Blackstone did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.
