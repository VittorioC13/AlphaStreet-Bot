[TITLE]How Washington’s crusade against Russian oil went sideways:
[TEXT]
The US failed to woo India away from Russian oil, so it reached for its favorite weapon: sanctions. But coercion comes with a price.

Imagine a powerful suitor courting a young lady for months, only to have his advances meet resistance and indecision. With his clumsy attempts at courtship going nowhere, he impulsively kidnaps the girl and promptly announces an engagement. His entourage rejoices at the impending nuptials.

The suitor is, of course, the United States and the young lady whom it was unable to woo is India. Unable to convince New Delhi – and others for that matter – that it is in their interest to stop buying Russian oil, Washington resorted to coercion in the only way it knows how: sanctions and the threat of secondary sanctions.

Those cheering the Trump administration’s latest foray into trying to strong-arm Russia, by sanctioning oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil, seem entirely unbothered by the coercive and short-sighted nature of the victory – if, indeed, it even ends up being a victory, which is quite doubtful.

The explicit aim of the new sanctions, as articulated by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is to choke off “the Kremlin’s war machine.” Trump believes – or purports to believe – that he can impress Russian President Vladimir Putin enough that the latter agrees to an immediate ceasefire and, presumably, surrenders Russia’s national interests.

It should be apparent by now that Russia will not bow to such pressure. It should also be apparent that what we are witnessing is the latest installment of sanctions theater – although with a deep-level economic consequence of this posturing.

Oil remains the lifeblood of any industrial economy and is thus non-negotiable. Russian oil is fungible but indispensable to the global system. Removing it would require displacing hundreds of millions of barrels per year, which would have severe economic repercussions. As many have pointed out, there is a paradox at the heart of any serious attempt to restrict Russian barrels from reaching the market: doing so would simply push global prices higher, thus indirectly cushioning Russian earnings.

The effectiveness of the new restrictions will clearly depend on just how zealous the US is in enforcing them through secondary sanctions on entities that deal in Russian oil. But if past experience is any guide, Washington won’t be able to sustain a full-court press – if for no other reason than markets will force its hand for the very reason stated above.

Lax enforcement keeps the global market functioning and avoids a messy price spike. Western politicians are thus able to accrue political points for being tough on Russia while avoiding pressing too hard. Thus a sort of gray-zone equilibrium becomes the fallback position and system-level instability is avoided.

Yes, it is possible to raise the costs for Russia, which has happened before and will be unavoidable now as well. Volumes will likely remain suppressed for a while, discounts will widen, and logistical complexity will rise. But, as past experience has also shown, workarounds will be found. The template for these workarounds is already in place.

Ultimately, this performative endeavor merely creates a pressure valve: Russia feels friction, the Western powers maintain some semblance of credibility – at least among themselves – and, importantly, markets remain orderly.

It is true that reports have emerged that at least one major Indian refiner intends to “recalibrate” its purchases of Russian oil. It has also been reported that several Chinese state-owned oil companies are suspending their inbound supplies of Russian seaborne oil.

It remains to be seen how India will proceed. It will almost certainly cut purchases, possibly even significantly at first. India has generally been reluctant to directly cross the US and tends to be very cautious

[TITLE]Aussie Climate Minister Slams Queensland’s Reliance on Intermittent Coal:
[TEXT]
Essay by Eric Worrall

“Over reliance on coal and ‘sweating the asset’ of coal-fired power is [a] far more serious threat to reliability than renewables will ever be.”

Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen has ramped up his criticism of the Queensland government’s new energy policy, arguing its plans to indefinitely extend the closure of coal-fired power plants will raise electricity prices and lower reliability.

…

Mining billionaire and clean energy investor Andrew Forrest on Friday said Queensland had incredibly good renewable energy resources, but would be left behind if it remained wedded to old technologies.

…

Critics of renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar farms describe them as intermittent power sources because they can only generate electricity at certain times of day or in response to certain weather conditions.

But Bowen said a major outage at Queensland’s Callide C coal plant in 2021 had raised wholesale prices by $30 per megawatt hour and left half a million people without power, while the average level of coal capacity that was unavailable due to outages increased by 28 per cent in the second quarter of 2025.

…

“Over reliance on coal and ‘sweating the asset’ of coal-fired power is [a] far more serious threat to reliability than renewables will ever be.”

[TITLE]Oil Prices May Stabilise As Key OPEC Member Says Cartel May Raise Supply Post US Sanctions On Russia:
[TEXT]
OPEC is prepared to raise production further by rolling back its oil output cuts if necessary to address any market shortfall after the US imposed new sanctions on major Russian oil firms, Kuwait’s oil minister said on Thursday.

“I expect that any decision to impose sanctions will certainly have a positive impact on prices,” Kuwaiti Minister Tariq Al-Roumi said in response to a question from Reuters.

Al-Roumi added that he anticipates a shift in demand towards the Gulf and the wider Middle East as a result of the sanctions. “We are seeing signs now,” he said.

Kuwait is among seven OPEC+ members that have been gradually increasing oil production after years of output cuts aimed at supporting the market under the group’s agreement, which includes the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia, and several smaller producers.

The alliance, which accounts for around half of global oil supply, has reversed course this year to reclaim market share, responding in part to pressure from President Trump to boost production and help keep petrol prices in check.

OPEC+ has raised its oil output targets by more than 2.7 million barrels per day this year, equivalent to

[TITLE]More demand than supply gives companies an edge, Jim Cramer says:
[TEXT]
"Supply constrained," are the two of the most important words CNBC's Jim Cramer said he's heard so far during earnings season and explained why this dynamic is favorable for companies.

"When you're supplied constrained, you have the ability to raise prices, and that's the holy grail in any industry," he said.

Intel 's strong earnings results were in part because of more demand than supply, Cramer suggested. He noted that the company's CFO, David Zinsner, said the semiconductor maker is supply constrained for a number of products, and that "industry supply has tightened materially."

Along with Intel, other tech names that are also supply constrained and performing well on the market include Micron , AMD and Nvidia , Cramer continued.

These companies don't have enough product in part because the storage needs of artificial intelligence are incredible high, Cramer said. He added that he thinks demand has overwhelmed supply because semiconductor capital equipment companies didn't manufacture enough of their own machines as they simply didn't anticipate such a volume of orders.

Outside of tech, Cramer said he thinks airplane maker Boeing and energy company GE Vernova are also supply constrained, adding that he thinks the former will say it's short on most of its planes when it reports earnings next week. GE Vernova is supply constrained with its power equipment, like turbines that burn natural gas, he continued, which is the primary energy source for the ever-growing crop of data centers.

GE Vernova and Boeing are also set to be winners because they make big-ticket items that other countries can buy from the U.S. to help close the trade deficit, Cramer added.

"In the end, we have more demand than supply in a host of industries and that's the ticket for good stock performance," he said. "I don't see that changing any time soon."

[TITLE]Journey Medical Corporation Reports Combined Emrosi™ (DFD-29) Phase 3 Clinical Trial Efficacy Data Analysis Presented at the 2025 Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference:
[TEXT]
FDA-approved Emrosi (40 mg Minocycline Hydrochloride Modified-Release Capsules, 10 mg immediate release and 30 mg extended release) is available in the United States for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults

DFD-29 demonstrated superior efficacy in IGA success rates and inflammatory lesion counts versus both placebo and doxycycline (P<0.001 for all comparisons)

Poster Presented on Efficacy of Oral DFD-29, a Low-Dose Minocycline Formulation, in Patients with Rosacea: A Pooled Analysis of Two Phase 3 Trials

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Journey Medical Corporation (“Journey Medical” or “the Company”) (Nasdaq: DERM), a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company primarily focused on selling and marketing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)-approved prescription pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions, today presented efficacy data from a pooled analysis of the two Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-comparator and placebo-controlled clinical trials, Minocycline Versus Oracea® in Rosacea-1 (“MVOR-1”) and Minocycline Versus Oracea in Rosacea-2 (“MVOR-2”), evaluating DFD-29 (40 mg Minocycline Hydrochloride Modified-Release Capsules, 10 mg immediate release and 30 mg extended release) (or “Emrosi™”) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults, at the 2025 Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference taking place October 23-26, 2025, in Las Vegas, NV.

“These combined Phase 3 results, demonstrating Emrosi’s statistical superiority over both Oracea and placebo in achieving Investigator’s Global Assessment (“IGA”) treatment success and reducing total inflammatory lesion count, reaffirm the strong efficacy and safety profile that have established Emrosi as an important treatment option for patients with rosacea,” said Claude Maraoui, Co-Founder, President, and CEO of Journey Medical Corporation. “As we expand Emrosi’s reach and adoption, these data strengthen our position in the growing dermatology market and underscore our commitment to delivering clinically proven therapies that improve patient outcomes. We believe Emrosi has the potential to become the standard of care for rosacea.”

Combined Phase 3 Clinical Result Highlights

In the Phase 3 study, 62.7% of subjects treated with DFD-29 achieved IGA treatment success, compared with 39.0% in the Oracea group and 28.2% in the placebo group. The differences between the DFD-29 and both Oracea and placebo were statistically significant, each with a p-value of <0.001. The DFD-29 group also experienced a mean reduction of 19.2 inflammatory lesions from baseline to week 16, versus reductions of 14.8 lesions with Oracea and 11.3 lesions with placebo (p < 0.001 for each comparison).

Combined Phase 3 Clinical Results Summary

Combined MVOR-1 and MVOR-2 Analysis IGA Success at Week 16 Inflammatory Lesion Change at Week 16 DFD-29 (40 mg) 62.7% -19.2 Oracea (40 mg) 39.0% -14.8 Placebo 28.2% -11.3 P-value: DFD-29 versus Oracea P<0.001 P<0.001 P-value: DFD-29 versus Placebo P<0.001 P<0.001

A total of 653 subjects across two Phase 3 clinical trials were randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio to receive once-daily treatment with DFD-29, Oracea (Doxycycline Capsules, 40 mg) or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary objective of both studies was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DFD-29 compared to placebo for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea, with a secondary objective of comparing DFD-29 to Oracea. Both trials met all co-primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating that DFD-29 was statistically superior to Oracea and placebo in achieving IGA treatment success and reducing total inflammatory lesion count from baseline to week 16. DFD-29 was well tolerated, with no major safety issues or serious adverse events related to the study drug reported in either trial (MVOR-1 and MVOR-2). The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) were comparable across all treatment groups.

Emrosi is available by prescription at specialty pharmacy chains.

Indonesia–Brazil seal ethanol fuel pact to boost clean energy

Related news: Indonesia to provide incentives for ethanol plant development

Related news: RI Govt to mandate 10 percent ethanol blend in fuel by 2027

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Bahlil Lahadalia conveyed that the renewable energy development collaboration between Indonesia and Brazil targets environmentally friendly ethanol-based biofuels.The collaboration was sealed in a Memorandum of Agreement (MoU) signing, witnessed by Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva at the Merdeka Palace in Jakarta on Thursday (October 23)."This collaboration, among other things, encourages the development of new and renewable energy, particularly in the gasoline sector," Lahadalia informed on Friday.He explained that Brazil has implemented an ethanol blend in gasoline of up to E30 nationally. Several Brazilian states have even reached E100, or pure ethanol without any gasoline blend.The minister stated that Indonesia is committed to pursuing this path, by targeting the implementation of an E10 ethanol blend by 2027–2028, before moving to the E20 phase in the future.According to Bahlil, this initiative not only aims to produce cleaner energy but also to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels.Indonesia's success in the palm oil-based biodiesel program, from B10 to B40, has inspired the implementation of a similar program in the gasoline sector through ethanol, he continued."If biodiesel uses CPO (crude palm oil), then gasoline uses ethanol, where ethanol is sourced from corn, cassava, and then sugar cane," he explained.Lahadalia said that ethanol development will also be a strategy to increase farmers' incomes while encouraging downstreaming in the plantation sector.This program is expected to create new economic growth areas in various raw material-producing regions, he added."This will inevitably take place in the regions, not only in Jakarta. That way, we can cut imports and raise people’s incomes. In addition, we can reduce pollution by using higher-quality fuel,” he noted.Minister Lahadalia signed the MoU on energy and mining cooperation with representatives from Brazil's Ministry of Mines and Energy, on the sidelines of President Lula's working visit to Indonesia from October 22 to 24 as part of his Southeast Asia tour.

[TITLE]Canada's first 'nation-building' nuclear project relies on US suppliers:
[TEXT]
During a joint announcement with Ontario Premier Doug Ford in Bowmanville, Carney described the project as a generational investment aimed at extending Canada’s leadership in clean energy while ensuring long-term prosperity for Ontario workers and communities.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Thursday that the federal government will invest $2 billion in Ontario’s Darlington New Nuclear Project — a plan that has stirred controversy since the eruption of a trade war with the US.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

The $3-billion partnership includes $1 billion from Ontario’s Building Ontario Fund . Ontario Power Generation will remain the majority owner and operator, with the federal and provincial governments holding minority stakes.

In the weeks after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and critical minerals, demand grew for Ontario to cancel its contract with US-based GE Hitachi, the company supplying the small modular reactors (SMRs) and enriched uranium for the $21-billion project. Both Carney and Ford have promoted “buy Canadian” policies to shield domestic industry from US tariff threats. Yet, despite the project’s reliance on American suppliers, both leaders defended the investment as essential to meeting Ontario’s soaring energy needs.

“This investment will strengthen Ontario’s power grid and represents the kind of nation-building projects that defines Canada’s new economic approach,” Carney said. “This is a generational investment that will build lasting security, prosperity, and opportunities.”

Through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, Ottawa had earlier committed $970 million to the project.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

Carney said the project marks the start of a broader plan to fast-track large infrastructure and clean energy projects through Ottawa’s new major projects office as proof that “Canada can build big things again.”

Construction on the first reactor began in May, with completion expected in 2030. Once online, the four reactors will supply

This story is a partnership between Grist and Foreign Policy , with support from the Pulitzer Center.

As Paramaribo, Suriname, flooded with shin-high water during a rainstorm in June, hundreds of taxis jostled for space on a recently paved street on the outskirts of the capital city. Passengers in suits disembarked alongside an overgrown canal. The visitors, some of whom had come from as far away as Texas and Malaysia, were there to commemorate this small country’s entry into the ranks of the world’s major oil producers.

Paramaribo sits on the northeast coast of South America, at the edge of a relatively undisturbed section of the Amazon rainforest. This massive jungle covers more than 90 percent of Suriname’s landmass, making it the world’s most forested country by percentage. It also allows Suriname to claim itself as “carbon-negative,” meaning that the nation absorbs more greenhouse gases than it emits.

As a result, Suriname is one of the few countries that can make an unimpeachable claim to being on the right side of the climate crisis. But all that is

[TITLE]Covenant Logistics Group Announces Third Quarter 2025:
[TEXT]
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Covenant Logistics Group, Inc. (NYSE: CVLG) (“Covenant” or the “Company”) announced today financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. The Company’s conference call to discuss the quarter will be held at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time on Thursday, October 23, 2025.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David R. Parker, commented: “Our third quarter results of $0.35 per diluted share, or $0.44 per diluted share on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, reflect essentially flat year-over-year performance in our asset-light business units and lower performance in our Truckload business units, mainly attributable to higher costs and under-utilized equipment. It was a busy quarter internally as we continued to invest in the future while managing costs during a prolonged period of overcapacity and muted demand.

“We continued to invest in and grow within certain industries that our dedicated fleet services with new start-up contracts, which weighed on third quarter margins but are expected to improve over time. Meanwhile, we continue to evaluate contracts in the rest of our Truckload business for improvement or exit. Overall, we expect modest contraction in our combined Truckload fleet and growth in our asset light segments as we allocate capital toward better returning business units. This process may impact quarterly financial results as we grow and shrink certain segments, adjust staffing needs, and dispose of equipment in potentially volatile used equipment markets.

“Our 49% equity method investment with Transport Enterprise Leasing (“TEL”) contributed pre-tax net income of $3.6 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to $4.0 million, or $0.11 per share, in the prior year quarter. The decline in TEL’s earnings is a result of customer bankruptcies that have accelerated over the past twelve months. While TEL’s overall business model remains healthy, we expect this headwind to continue for the foreseeable short term.

“Finally, I would be remiss not to acknowledge the unexpected passing of Lew Thompson, founder of Lew Thompson and Son Trucking Company, which we acquired in April 2023. Lew was a great friend and business partner, and his wisdom, humor, and storytelling will be missed by all. Lew was also a great mentor to the team that assumed day-to-day management of the business. We are confident this talented team will continue to ensure an exceptional customer experience, and we will honor Lew by continuing to serve our customers in a manner that would make him proud.”

Mr. Parker continued, “The third quarter included approximately $0.1 million in net items that have been excluded from adjusted financial results. Among these items was a $3.8 million gain from discontinued operations relating to a litigation settlement associated with our factoring business that was exited in 2020. Offsetting this gain was $3.7 million of expenses in severance and abandonment of certain underutilized leased facilities and systems related to exiting a large Managed Freight contract and the planned exit of legacy Dedicated contracts not providing sufficient returns. While these decisions were difficult and created a cost headwind in the quarter, we believe they needed to be made to improve the long-term cost profile of the Company. A detail of these costs is summarized in the table below.”

Gain item: Gain proceeds from discontinued operations $3.8 million Expense items: Employee separation costs $1.4 million Lease abandonment and customer exit costs $0.4 million Abandonment of long-lived software $1.9 million Net third quarter adjustments $0.1 million

Combined Truckload Revenue

Paul Bunn, the Company’s President commented on truckload operations, “For the quarter, total revenue in our truckload operations increased 0.3%, to $199.7 million. The increase in total revenue consisted of $1.7 million more freight revenue and $1.1 million less fuel surcharge revenue, which varies with the cost of fuel. Freight revenue grew by $1.7 million, or 1.0%, as a result of a 4.6% increase in the average tractor fleet, partially offset by lower equipment utilization.”

Expedited Truckload Revenue

Mr. Bunn added, “Freight revenue in our Expedited segment decreased $7.2 million, or 8.2%. Average total tractors decreased by 31 units, or 3.4%, to 861, compared to 892 in the prior year quarter. Average freight revenue per tractor per week decreased 5.0% as a result of a 5.4% decrease in utilization, partially offset by a small increase in freight revenue per total mile.”

Dedicated Truckload Revenue

“For the quarter, freight revenue in our Dedicated segment increased $8.9 million, or 10.8%. Average total tractors increased by 136 units, or 9.7%, to 1,539, compared to 1,403 in the prior year’s quarter. Average freight revenue per tractor per week increased 1.0% as a result of a 7.0% increase in freight revenue per total mile, partially offset by a 5.7% decrease in utilization.”

Combined Truckload Operating Expenses

Mr. Bunn continued, “Rising operating costs in our Truckload segment negatively impacted operating margins compared to the prior year quarter. Higher costs primarily include salaries, wages and related expenses, insurance, and both variable and fixed expenses necessary to seat and operate our equipment. Some expense increases were expected, as they relate to growth in high-service and low-mileage operations. The expense increases were partially offset by a 5.0% increase in freight revenue per total mile.

“Salaries, wages and related expenses increased year-over-year by 5 cents, or approximately 4%, on a per total mile basis. The increase was driven primarily from the year-over-year impact of significant growth in our dedicated protein supply chain business as well as employee separation costs incurred during the quarter. As we grow our dedicated fleet in niche services, it requires hiring and retaining skilled drivers and maintenance professionals to operate and maintain specialized equipment on loads that typically move heavy weights on non-paved roads with shorter lengths of haul, resulting in higher costs on a per total mile basis. Additionally, as the freight market improves and the driver market tightens, we anticipate that driver pay will continue to rise.

“Safety continues to be our priority as we consistently strive to raise our own standards by hiring highly qualified drivers, implementing proactive training sessions, and investing in and implementing safety equipment and technology. For the past several years, our safety statistics have been at or near the best in our history. However, given the self-insured portions, potential additional premiums in certain layers based upon experience, and limits of our insurance program, and the risk of extremely large awards and settlements in our industry (so-called “nuclear verdicts/settlements”), the amount of expense recognized from period to period can fluctuate materially. Insurance and claims expense for the current quarter was 4 cents per mile, or 24% higher than the prior year on a per total mile basis as a result of the incurrence and development of certain large claims. At a minimum, we anticipate the fourth quarter insurance expense to remain elevated compared to historical amounts.

“Equipment related expenses, including Operations and maintenance and Depreciation and amortization, increased approximately 8 cents per total mile, or approximately 15%, compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to an increased amount of unproductive equipment. In addition, costs associated with seating our equipment, including recruiting and onboarding expenses, contributed to the increase compared to the prior year. Going forward, as the driver market tightens, we anticipate the cost of recruiting and onboarding to remain elevated.

“For the quarter, Warehousing’s results were fairly comparable to the prior year with reduced revenue of $0.4 million and operating income and adjusted operating income reduced $0.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter, we are anticipating growth in this segment from a large new facility start up with an existing customer scheduled to begin in November 2025.”

Capitalization, Liquidity and Capital Expenditures

Tripp Grant, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, added the following comments: “At September 30, 2025, our total indebtedness, composed of total debt and finance lease obligations, net of cash (“net indebtedness”), increased by $48.7 million to approximately $268.3 million as compared to December 31, 2024. In addition, our net indebtedness to total capitalization increased to 38.8% at September 30, 2025, from 33.4% at December 31, 2024.

“The increase to net indebtedness in the first three quarters of the year is primarily attributable to acquisition-related payments of $19.2 million and repurchasing approximately $36.2 million of common stock outstanding.

“At September 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $2.7 million. Under our ABL credit facility, we had no outstanding borrowings, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of $19.9 million, and available borrowing capacity of $90.1 million.

“At the end of the quarter, we had $1.2 million in assets held for sale that we anticipate disposing of within twelve months. The average age of our tractors increased to 23 months compared to 20 months a year ago.

“Our expectations for net capital equipment expenditures in the fourth quarter is $15 million to $20 million.”

Outlook

Mr. Parker concluded, “Our outlook is impacted by both short-term and long-term factors. In the short term, we expect our Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter to be sequentially lower than our Adjusted EPS for the third quarter. The reasons include expected lower profits from our minority investment in TEL attributable to credit losses in their small-carrier customer base, the impact of the U.S. government shutdown on our Department of Defense business, an expected increase in claims accruals, and loss of a large Managed Freight customer rolling off faster than the results of Star Logistics Solutions ramp. These negative factors are expected to more than outweigh our current expectation of a modest peak season boost to Expedited and Managed Freight.

“Over the intermediate to long term, I am more excited today than I have been in the last three years. From a freight environment perspective, capacity exits seem to be accelerating based on publicly announced bankruptcies of small carriers and our observation of TEL’s customer base, as well as increased enforcement of government policies concerning English language and non-domiciled drivers. In addition, there are potential demand drivers from unwinding excess inventories from import pull-forwards, tax and monetary policies, and clarification of trade policy. We have internal plans and opportunities to continue to grow certain dedicated and warehouse business that has the potential to yield acceptable margins and hold or downsize our other Truckload capacity until returns improve. To the extent we downsize capacity, we may experience severance, equipment disposal, and other costs that create uneven results in a given quarter but are expected to lead to stronger and more sustained results over time.

“In sum, we expect improving market conditions and our internal plan to produce operating leverage and higher earnings and return on capital over time, although individual quarters may be volatile. With an experienced team, an attractive business mix, and a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we believe Covenant is well-positioned for the future.”
