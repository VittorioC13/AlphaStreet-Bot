Alnylam Pharmaceuticals is set to invest $250m in the expansion of its facility in Norton, Massachusetts, US, to meet the growing global demand for RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics.

This is claimed to become the first fully dedicated small-interfering RNA (siRNA) enzymatic-ligation manufacturing facility.

The facility expansion is intended to increase capacity, lower production expenses, and enable support for future medicine launches from the company’s development pipeline.

As part of this, the company’s next-generation, scalable enzymatic ligation manufacturing platform, known as siRELIS, has been accepted into the US Food and Drug Administration’s Emerging Technology Program.

The programme is expected to facilitate discussions with global health authorities regarding manufacturing approaches for oligonucleotide-based medicines.

This acceptance comes after pilot-scale production of zilebesiran, which is under investigation for decreasing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in hypertension patients, and nucresiran, being developed for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR).

[TITLE]Halo Pharma Enhances Manufacturing Capabilities with Macro-Pactor® Investment:
[TEXT]
New addition enhances manufacturing continuity and supports seamless progression from early-phase development to late-stage production

Macro-Pactor® to be online in Q1 2026

WHIPPANY, N.J., Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Halo Pharma, a leading CDMO specializing in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services, is expanding its manufacturing capabilities at its Whippany, New Jersey facility with the addition of a Gerteis Macro-Pactor®, a versatile roller compactor that enhances the company’s ability to manage complex formulations, improve process efficiency, and deliver consistent solid-dose pharmaceutical products. The investment reinforces Halo Pharma’s position as a reliable partner for both development and commercial manufacturing as it allows for seamless scale up from Halo Whippany’s Gerties Mini-Pactor® currently used for development, clinical and small scall commercial manufacturing.

The Macro-Pactor is expected to be online in the first quarter of 2026. Its high throughput, superior dry-granulation performance, improved powder flow, and reduced variability will significantly expand Halo Pharma’s dry-granulation capabilities. It will improve formulation flexibility, process predictability, and granule quality. This technology is especially beneficial for the development of moisture-sensitive APIs, high-drug-load formulations, poor-flowing powders, potent compounds, and modified-release products within Halo Pharma’s portfolio.

“One of the major advantages of adding the Macro-Pactor is that the process parameters established during early-phase development translates almost directly into larger batch sizes,” says Satish Shetty, Senior Director, Product Development & Technical Services at Halo Pharma. “Since the equipment is engineered for both development and commercial throughput, it eliminates the typical disconnect between small-scale R&D and large-scale manufacturing, reducing scale-up risk, timelines, and the need for reformulation.”

Shetty adds that the Macro-Pactor’s closed, dust-contained design reduces operator exposure, minimizes product loss, and supports secure, regulatory-compliant handling. With fewer open processing steps, the system provides safer, more controlled operation for potent APIs and controlled substances.

Beyond scale-up, the Macro-Pactor supports Halo Pharma’s tech-transfer process. Its precise, data-rich control of critical process parameters enables smooth, low-risk transitions from lab-scale development to commercial manufacturing, strengthening the company’s Quality by Design (QbD) efforts. Fully compatible with existing upstream and downstream equipment, the system ensures efficient end-to-end processing and strengthens collaboration across R&D, process development, manufacturing, and quality teams.

"Investing in the Macro-Pactor reinforces Halo Pharma’s commitment to delivering high-quality, scalable manufacturing solutions for our clients. It ensures that they can confidently advance their programs with predictable outcomes and faster timelines," says Lee Karras, Group Chief Executive for the Noramco Group, parent company of Halo Pharma.

First commercial units to be delivered in March 2026

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeuroSigma, Inc., a Los Angeles-based bioelectronics company, today announced completion of an approximately $1 million investment into a high-volume manufacturing line for the second-generation Monarch external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (eTNS) device for treating pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). NeuroSigma’s manufacturing partner for the project is Singapore-based Armstrong Asia , a leading manufacturer for the medical, automotive and consumer electronics industries, with operations across Asia and partnerships around the globe. The investment was led by Checkmate Capital, a strategic advisory and investment group headquartered in Pasadena, California. The investment and manufacturing project are part of a collaboration between Armstrong and Checkmate, stemming from their July 2025 strategic memorandum of understanding (MOU) focused on the development and manufacturing of new technologies, particularly in the medical device industry.

“This investment enables cost-efficient and scalable manufacturing of the second-generation Monarch eTNS device,” said Colin Kealey, M.D., President and CEO of NeuroSigma. "As we move into 2026, we look forward to working with Armstrong Asia to deliver this innovative product to patients and families throughout the world."

“We would like to thank NeuroSigma and Checkmate for selecting Armstrong as their manufacturing partner for the second-generation Monarch eTNS device,” added Phyllis Ong, CEO of Armstrong Asia. “Armstrong’s engineering team is highly inspired to co-design and manufacture advanced medical devices, and we look forward to producing the device at scale to serve the millions of patients suffering from ADHD.”

In November 2025, NeuroSigma announced successful completion of its pilot commercialization program for the first-generation Monarch eTNS device. During the pilot phase, the company dispensed over 1,000 Monarch devices and over 100,000 of the daily disposable patches. Based on strong market demand, NeuroSigma is preparing to launch the second-generation Monarch eTNS device in late Q1 2026.

“Completion of this investment marks a significant milestone for NeuroSigma, Armstrong, and Checkmate,” said Tom Paschall, CEO of Checkmate Capital and NeuroSigma Director. “Within the medical device industry, we see favorable conditions for the external neurostimulation sector and the central nervous system therapeutics market in general. The Monarch eTNS device is a groundbreaking neuro-electronic product that provides patients, families, and physicians with an alternative to stimulant medications and the negative side effects associated with them.”

[TITLE]Activist Ananym Capital urges LKQ to sell its European auto parts business:
[TEXT]
Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.

Activist: Ananym Capital Management

Ownership: 0.39%

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.

What's happening

On Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

Behind the scenes

LKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers.

The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers.

Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint.

Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.

LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount.

The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000 . However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock.

In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.

Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment.

Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries.

Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.

The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA.

The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA.

The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price.

While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone , and Genuine Parts , may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that.

Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.

In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time.

If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders.

Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

[TITLE]'India Is Capital-Starved, PE Funds Must Invest In Banking System': Experts Decode Shriram-MUFG Deal:
[TEXT]
Discussing the landmark Shriram-MUFG deal, Ekambaram said that the stake deal is primarily a growth capital for the NBFC as it is a primary infusion into the company. The Kotak Mahindra Bank veteran explained that Japanese banks always look for long-term capital investment deals.

"If India wants to reach the $7 trillion economy goal by 2047, then the financial services will be at the center of it as raw material is money. Foreign capital is a confidence in India. The financial sector is at the core of any economy over the willingness for long term investment," she said.

The banker illustrated State Bank of India's share price as an example of the rising interest of foreign investors in the last 18 months, who have taken the stake in the PSU stock right up to the permitted amount.

"The Reserve Bank of India has brought in some new regulations in the last one year, which have made things easier for banks and NBFCs. The RBI is willing to work with them towards finally looking at credit growth and bring in more money into economy. The government has brought in new fiscal measures and is willing to bring in capital," she explained.

According to Ekambaram, India is a capital-starved country but the outlook is positive. "Which country in the world has over 8% GDP growth for two quarters? So, India has growth in the economy, changing demographics and hunger for consumption. Hence, the growth opportunities are possibly sustained for the medium-term," said the Kotak bank veteran.

"The Indian financial sector has not seen consolidation for a long time, while many other sectors have. So, maybe this is just the beginning, but I think capital infusion ensures growth and vote of confidence," she added.

[TITLE]North American Construction Group Strengthens its Presence in Western Australia with the Acquisition of Iron Mine Contracting, a Diversified Mining Services Contractor:
[TEXT]
ACHESON, Alberta, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- North American Construction Group Ltd. (“NACG” or the “Company”) (TSX:NOA/NYSE:NOA) today announced that it has entered into a definitive share purchase agreement to acquire Iron Mine Contracting (“IMC”), a privately owned Western Australian diversified mining services contractor. The acquisition is valued at approximately $115 million (“the Transaction”). Concurrent with this announcement, the Company is providing a year-end update on its infrastructure and fleet optimization initiatives, along with its 2026 financial outlook. All references to dollars are in Canadian dollars.

Acquisition of Iron Mine Contracting

IMC is a diversified mining services contractor headquartered in Western Australia. The company provides a full suite of services, including contract mining, crushing, civil and tailings services to a blue-chip customer base. Its operations span key commodity sectors such as gold, iron ore and lithium backed by an established track record of safe and profitable operations.

IMC boasts a strong order book, currently exceeding $1.0 billion and including a recently awarded lithium mining contract with a three-year term. This backlog is supported by a strong pipeline of large mining and civil projects.

Joe Lambert, President and Chief Executive Officer of NACG, commented: “IMC represents a natural and strategic extension of our business into the Western Australian market. The IMC team has built a high-quality business with strong margins sharing NACG’s core culture of operational and safety excellence. This acquisition provides a great foundation to fast track our Western Australia growth strategy which is considered a global powerhouse for base metals, precious metals and critical & rare earth minerals. Combined with the MacKellar Group, we are now an Australian Tier 1 contractor capable of executing complex scopes across the entirety of Australia. IMC is a well-run business in a great market presenting a clear opportunity for low-capital growth by leveraging our underutilized Canadian assets and our highly skilled in-house maintenance team experienced in major component and whole machine rebuilds.”

“Partnering with NACG and the MacKellar Group is a strategic accelerator for IMC, allowing us to meet our customers’ expanding needs within a strong market. This significantly scales our growth potential while preserving the strong culture, agility and customer focus that have always defined our business,” said Clinton Keenan, Chief Executive Officer of IMC. “We look forward to immediately leveraging NACG’s balance sheet and extensive equipment fleet to pursue a greater number of larger projects as this partnership will surely expand our client base and commodity market presence.”

Highlights of the Transaction

The total estimated consideration of $115 million represents 2.5x of expected EBITDA in 2026, calculated prior to any realized synergies. The acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive, increasing NACG’s incremental earnings per share by approximately 20% in 2026.

The Transaction will be fully funded by senior-secured bank financing (65% of the purchase price) and vendor-provided debt financing (35% of the purchase price).

The estimated upfront payment of approximately $40 million will be funded by the Company’s existing revolving credit facility. In addition, NACG plans to assume secured equipment financing of $35 million. The remaining $40 million of the consideration will be addressed through structured earn-out and deferred payment mechanisms payable to the vendors over the next four years.

Strategic Rationale for and Highlights of the Acquisition

The acquisition of IMC is immediately accretive and strategically transformative for NACG, delivering key benefits:

Increased exposure to rare earth & critical minerals in Western Australia: step-change in geographic and commodity diversification with Western Australia set to immediately grow from 5% to 15% of our total earnings;

[TITLE]Forman Capital Provides $37M Construction Financing for Houston-Area Retail Center – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Ferguson Family Partners has secured $37.1 million in construction financing to build The Oaks of District West, a 10-building mixed-use center outside of Houston, Texas, Commercial Observer can first report.

Forman Capital provided the construction loan, while Daniel Eidson of Concord Summit Capital arranged the transaction.

Scott Mehlman, chief investment officer and partner at Forman Capital, noted in a statement that the Richmond submarket of Houston, where The Oak of District West will be located, has experienced a surge in residential building in recent years, but retail has failed to keep pace.

“Our client is addressing a clear market gap, and the early leasing momentum speaks to both the strength of the location and the quality of the concept,” said Mehlman.

The open-air project is already 70 percent pre-leased in its 15 tenant spaces, even though construction is expected to last until the third quarter of 2027. Tenants include Pacific Coast Tacos, Virtual Golf Bar, Pecan Jack’s Ice Cream, and Picklr, a national indoor pickleball company.

Located at 21711 FM-1093 in Richmond, Texas, directly off the Westpark Tollway and South Peak Road, The Oaks of District West will span more than 87,000 square feet across 10 buildings on a site that sits 30 miles southwest of Downtown Houston.

Brett Forman, managing partner of Forman Capital, said in a statement that the new retail center will tap into the affluent residential community within the Richmond area.

“The Oaks of District West aligns directly with Forman Capital’s retail thesis of investing in necessity-driven centers in affluent residential markets,” he said.

[TITLE]Affinius Capital Provides $81M Construction Loan for Arizona State Student Housing – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Fields Holdings has secured $81.2 million to finance the construction of the Samuel, a 14-story student housing property that will boast 224 units on Arizona State University’s main campus in Tempe, Commercial Observer can first report.

Affinius Capital provided the construction financing, while CBRE’s Scott Williams arranged the transaction.

Affinius Capital Senior Vice President Tyler Figley described the Samuel in a statement as a “high-quality” student housing property that sits on a prime location within the sprawling Arizona State campus. Figley said the apartment complex will likely “capture demand” from the growing enrollment at ASU, which currently has roughly 56,000 students in Tempe.

“We look forward to working with Fields Holdings, which has the experience to execute on this caliber of project,” he added.

Located at 706 South College Avenue near Downtown Tempe, the Samuel will deliver 408 beds and also feature 8,500 square feet of ground-floor retail space. The units will be organized as studios to three-bedroom apartments, and the building will include a swimming pool, a basketball court, an outdoor courtyard, a fitness center, and several lounges with media spaces for students to access

Fields Holdings did not respond to requests for comment.

[TITLE]CAG: Railways lags in non-fare earnings, recovery of dues:

NEW DELHI: Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), in recent reports, flagged how railways failed to boost its non-fare revenue despite holding vast stretches of vacant land and how dues amounting to Rs 4,087 crore from 269 private siding owners remained unrecovered by different zones till March 2023, pointing to weak monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.CAG audit focussed on two activities of RLDA, the railway entity for development of its surplus land for commercial use and revenue generation, commercial development of vacant railway land and construction of multi-functional complexes (MFC), from 2018-19 to 2022-23. It found that as of March 2023, railways owned 4.88 lakh hectares of land, of which 62,740 hectares was lying vacant, with only 997.8 hectares (1.6%) having been entrusted to RLDA. During this period, the Railway Board had received 188 proposals for 657 hectares, and it entrusted 59 of the 188 proposals to RLDA, following which RLDA awarded 35 sites to developers.It found that despite availability of such quantum of land, RLDA, as of March 2023, could award only 8.8% (87.76 hectares) of land entrusted to it for development. It noticed that several sites were entrusted to RLDA despite unresolved land title issues, encroachments and other encumbrances, resulting in non-monetisation of such sites.It identified systemic and operational issues that had adversely affected timely monetisation of railway land and realisation of revenue.It observed that Railway Board, while processing proposals for entrustment of land to RLDA, should have ensured that the land parcels were free from encroachments and other encumbrances, noting that weak inter-agency coordination in Indian Railways had contributed significantly to delays. "Alarmingly, none of the awarded commercial sites were developed as of March 2023," the report added.In another report, it detected the failure of railway zones to recover dues outstanding from private siding owners. It has recommended the railways various measures to improve and track recovery of dues.
