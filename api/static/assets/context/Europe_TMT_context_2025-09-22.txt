[TITLE]Kimmel’s suspension shows media censorship is a structural problem:
[TEXT]
As corporate media accelerate their censorship of comedians and journalists, we must realize that we got to this dire situation because of old-fashioned, bipartisan corruption in Washington, D.C. The problem didn’t begin with President Donald Trump. It began long ago, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, when presidents of both parties and Congress decided to put the nation’s media system in the hands of a small number of ever-larger corporations.

Those corporations were big political donors to both parties. Enormous mergers were approved. Antitrust laws were ignored. Federal Communications Commission rules were changed, and caps on mega-ownership were relaxed or eliminated.

There was nothing natural or inevitable

[TITLE]The FCC Chair's Unprecedented, and Constitutionally Problematic, Response to Jimmy Kimmel:

On Monday Jimmy Kimmel said:

We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it. In between the finger-pointing, there was, uh, grieving on Friday − the White House flew the flags at half-staff, which got some criticism, but on a human level, you can see how hard the president is taking this. Yes, he's at the fourth stage of grief: construction. Demolition, construction. This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend; this is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish, OK? And it didn't just happen once. And then we installed the most beautiful chandelier. Responses you wouldn't believe. Who thinks like that, and why are we building a $200 million chandelier in the White House? Is it possible that he's doing it intentionally so he can be bad

[TITLE]Glilot Capital secures $500 million to boost cybersecurity and AI startups:
[TEXT]
Glilot Capital, an Israeli venture capital firm, has secured $500 million from major financial institutions in the United States, Europe, and Israel. The funds will be directed to Glilot Seed and Glilot Plus, which back startups in cybersecurity, enterprise solutions, and artificial intelligence. With this raise, Glilot’s assets under management have surpassed $1 billion.

Cofounder and managing partner Kobi Samboursky stated that the new funding “reflects the confidence global financial institutions have in our unique investment model and track record of performance.”

Glilot also named Rinat Remler as its fifth partner. The firm said she brings extensive operational and investment experience that will strengthen its leadership team. Founded in 2011, Glilot has become one of Israel’s most successful venture capital firms, with 22 exits to date.

All eight investments from its first fund achieved exits. Its portfolio includes companies such as AtBay, UpStream, and Cider Security. Among current portfolio companies, Noma recently completed a $100 million Series B round, while Appcharge and ScaleOps each raised $58 million in their latest funding rounds.

Samboursky emphasized that the latest fundraising will enable Glilot to continue investing in its core focus areas. “This new capital not only validates our past performance but also empowers us to continue and grow our Cyber and AI philosophy,” he said. “We deeply believe in the Israeli ecosystem and will continue to lead investments in the best local and global talent.”

The funds attracted mainly international investors, including pension funds and other financial institutions from the U.S. and Europe.

New funds to enhance AI security

This fundraising success indicates minimal adverse impact from the widespread criticism of Israel over its actions in Gaza. Samboursky indicated that each of the new funds aims to invest in 12 AI and cybersecurity startups over the coming years.

With more than $1 billion under management, Glilot has invested in eight companies so far this year, while its portfolio companies have secured $700 million in follow-on investment. “Cyber is now bigger than ever, and it’s not going to end anytime soon,” said Samboursky, a former officer in the Israeli military’s 8200 intelligence unit. He added that half of the new funding will go toward new investments, with the remainder allocated to follow-on investments.

Samboursky highlighted that the focus will be on startups that enhance the protection of companies’ AI technologies and address threats emerging from AI. He described this segment as having the potential to surpass cloud security in importance in the next five to six years. Israel has emerged as a global leader in cybersecurity, accounting for about half of all investments in Israeli tech startups.

In recent major deals, Palo Alto Networks acquired Israeli peer CyberArk Software for approximately $25 billion in July, and Alphabet purchased Israeli startup Wiz for $32 billion in March. Beyond financial backing, Glilot has built one of the industry’s most comprehensive value creation engines, actively supporting its portfolio companies with go-to-market strategies, partnerships with Fortune 1000 executives, and deep sector expertise. This approach has made the Value Creation department the largest at the firm.

With this raise, Glilot is well-positioned to continue its mission of identifying, funding, and accelerating the next generation of technology leaders, from early-stage innovators to high-growth disruptors transforming industries.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURES TRADING

Futures transactions involve high risk. The amount of the initial margin is low compared to the value of the futures contract, so that transactions are "leveraged" or "geared". A relatively small market movement has a proportionately larger impact on the funds that you have deposited or have to pay: this can work both for you and against you. You may experience the total loss of the initial margin funds as well as any additional funds deposited in the system. If the market develops in a way that is contrary to your position or if margins are increased, you may be asked to pay significant additional funds at short notice to maintain your position. In this case it may also happen that your broker account is in the red and you thus have to make payments beyond the initial investment.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRONIC TRADING

Before you begin carrying out transactions with an electronic system, you should carefully review the rules and provisions of the stock exchange offering the system, or of the financial instruments listed that you intend to trade, as well as your broker's conditions. Online trading has inherent risks due to system responses/reaction times and access times that may vary due to market conditions, system performance and other factors, and on which you have no influence. You should be aware of these additional risks in electronic trading before you carry out investment transactions.

How Net Rowdex Works: AI Signals, Algorithms & Automated Trading

Net Rowdex is designed to function as an AI-powered trading ecosystem where algorithms form the backbone of execution. The system begins by scanning live financial markets, analyzing large volumes of structured and unstructured data to identify emerging opportunities. Advanced machine learning models are embedded within the platform, processing variables such as price movement, historical data, and volatility indicators in real time.

Once signals are generated, the platform translates them into actionable strategies. These signals can be executed through the automated engine, which operates continuously without requiring manual approval. The automation module applies pre-set parameters that users define during account configuration, including risk levels, trade size, and asset categories. This ensures trades are conducted within controlled boundaries.

The algorithms are adaptive, refining their accuracy through ongoing exposure to new market data. This feedback-driven process allows Net Rowdex to enhance predictive modeling over time, optimizing trade signal reliability. The goal is not only speed but also precision—executing transactions at optimal points where opportunities are detected.

Security is woven into the workflow. Encrypted servers and real-time monitoring reduce exposure to breaches, while compliance protocols verify the legitimacy of transactions. With this layered design, Net Rowdex demonstrates how AI and automation can converge into a structured platform capable of handling market complexity in a controlled environment.

Through signals, automation, and algorithmic adaptation, Net Rowdex establishes a framework where trading is informed by continuous data processing rather than manual guesswork, aligning with the technological advancements shaping 2025 markets.
