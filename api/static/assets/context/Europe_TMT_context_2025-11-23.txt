Qualcomm quietly rewrote the terms of service for its newest acquisition, programmable microcontroller and SBC maker Arduino, drawing intense fire from the maker community for grabbing additional rights to user-generated content on its platform and prohibiting reverse-engineering of what was once very open software.

In a level of open criticism that's unusually frank for Microsoft's corporate-friendly business-networking site, hobbyist electronics vendor Adafruit published a stinging assessment of the rewritten terms and conditions for Qualcomm's new subsidiary Arduino, saying that "the changes mark a clear break from the open-hardware ethos that built the platform."

[TITLE]‘Vibe-coding‘ darling Lovable’s CEO says the company is targeting enterprise customers as its ARR doubles to $200 million in just four months:
[TEXT]
Swedish “vibe-coding” startup Lovable has reached $200 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), doubling its total from just four months earlier, cofounder and CEO Anton Osika told attendees at the Slush 2025 technology conference in Helsinki.

Lovable determines ARR by taking the prior month’s revenue, multiplying it by 12, and annualizing the result, according to Osika.

The Swedish company, founded in 2023, has experienced rapid growth since launching its AI-powered app-building product in late 2024. Now, Osika is eyeing a larger enterprise customer base.

“If you look at people who have accounts from enterprises, it’s like half [of customers],” he told Fortune. “Most of it is coming from an individual who starts using Lovable and then brings it into the company. And then, in some cases, it’s growing into a larger contract across the entire company and turning into multimillion-dollar deals.”

Osika describes Lovable’s mission as democratizing software engineering by leaning into “vibe-coding,” where a user describes in plain language the app they want to build or the function of a piece of software they want to create, and the AI takes care of actually writing the code to produce that result.

Lovable’s main product is an AI-powered development platform that turns natural-language prompts into full-stack web applications and websites, generating real front-end, back-end, and database code that users can run and edit. The platform runs on a subscription model, where users can opt to pay for more advanced features. The company targets both nontechnical users and developers, and offers a chat-based interface to help users build and deploy apps.

[TITLE]FCC rolls back cybersecurity rules for telcos, despite state-hacking risks:
[TEXT]
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has rolled back a previous ruling that required U.S. telecom carriers to implement stricter cybersecurity measures following the massive hack from the Chinese threat group known as Salt Typhoon.

The ruling came in January 2025 and took effect immediately under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), in response to Salt Typhoon's breaching multiple carriers to spy on private communications.

Along with Section 105 of the CALEA, the declaratory ruling included a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for telecom companies to:

Create and implement cybersecurity risk-management plans

Submit annual FCC certifications proving they were doing so

Treat general network cybersecurity as a legal obligation

Following lobbying from telecommunication firms - according to a letter from Senator Maria Cantwell, that found the new framework too cumbersome and taxing for their operations, the FCC has now deemed the prior rule inflexible, retracting it.

“The Federal Communications Commission today took action to correct course and rescind an unlawful and ineffective prior Declaratory Ruling misconstruing the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA),” reads the FCC announcement.

“The Order also withdraws an NPRM that accompanied that Declaratory Ruling, which was based in part on the Declaratory Ruling’s flawed legal analysis and proposed ineffective cybersecurity requirements.”

The FCC, which is now under new leadership, noted that communications service providers have taken important steps to strengthen their cybersecurity posture following the Salt Typhoon incidents, and have agreed to continue along this path in a coordinated manner, reducing risks to national security.

Disclosed in October 2024, the Salt Typhoon attacks were linked to a Chinese espionage campaign that impacted several companies, including Verizon, AT&T, Lumen Technologies [1], T-Mobile [2], Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications [3], and Windstream [4].

The hackers accessed core systems that U.S. federal government used for court-authorized network wiretapping requests, and potentially intercepted extremely sensitive information, up to the level of government officials.

FCC's plan met with criticism

Given that the risk for similar hacker operations remains unchanged, the FCC’s latest decision was met with criticism.

Commissioner Anna M. Gomez, the only one voting against the current decision, expressed frustration about the reliance on telecom providers for self-evaluating their cybersecurity stance and the effectiveness of the protective measures.

“Its [FCCs] proposed rollback is not a cybersecurity strategy,” stated Gomez. “It is a hope and a dream that will leave Americans less protected than they were the day the Salt Typhoon breach was discovered.”

“Salt Typhoon was not a one-off event but part of a broader campaign by state-sponsored actors to infiltrate telecommunications networks over long periods of time,” Gomez warned in her statement.

“Federal officials have stated publicly that similar reconnaissance and exploitation attempts are ongoing today, and that telecommunications networks remain high-value targets for foreign adversaries,” the official said.

Senators Maria Cantwell and Gary Peters have also sent letters to the FCC before the vote to urge the agency to maintain the cybersecurity safeguards.

BleepingComputer has emailed the FCC for a statement and will update the article when we get a reply.

[TITLE]UK backs next-generation satellite communications with £6.9 million investment:
[TEXT]
The funding will support five groundbreaking projects through the European Space Agency’s (ESA) ARTES (Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems) programme, part of the Directorate of Connectivity and Secure Communications. These projects showcase British expertise in next-generation satellite technologies and strengthen the UK’s role in advanced communications.

This investment underpins the UK’s Industrial Strategy priority capabilities: Satellite Communications, Position, Navigation and Timing, In-orbit Servicing and Manufacturing, Space Domain Awareness, and Space Data for Earth Applications.

With European demand for satellites up to 2033 forecasted to be worth £40 billion, even 2% of this would bring around £800 million in revenues for the UK economy alone.

Space Minister Liz Lloyd said:

Space technology and especially satellites, are essential to our daily lives. From the sat nav in your car to your mobile phone, from weather forecasts to your online banking – space is where it all happens. By backing our UK sector, we’re not only cementing our position as a European space leader – we’re creating high-skilled jobs, attracting investment, and ensuring space technologies can connect communities to the space-enabled services they need.

The five UK-led projects span critical areas of innovation in satellite communications, from refuelling satellites to extend their lifespans, to developing 5G networks and optical links that will improve global connectivity.

Orbit Fab will deliver the Advancing Satcom Technology with Refuelling and Logistics (ASTRAL) project with a total UK funding of up to £2.9 million. The contract for the first stage of the mission, worth £1.3 million, has now been awarded by ESA. This mission will prove the capability to refuel electric propulsion satellites using UK-developed technology, ensuring satellites can remain in orbit for longer or can manoeuvre away from threats.

Goonhilly Earth Station in Cornwall will lead the AGILE: Antenna Ground Interface and LunaNet Equipment project, supported by £1.6 million in funding. Amidst the growing number of lunar missions, this project will produce an interface unit that can be installed in global antennas to communicate with spacecraft using the internationally recognised LunaNet specification. This will allow missions to seamlessly connect to ground infrastructure, improving mission success rates.

Vicinity Technologies will receive £1.19 million for its 5G NTN-based Satellite Access Networks project. The team will design and develop a versatile 5G Non-Terrestrial Network regenerative payload system and user terminals, including the entire software stack for both space and ground segments. This technology will support uninterrupted and scalable internet services globally, from hard-to-reach areas to smart cities.

Archangel Lightworks, working with the support of Eutelsat will advance optical communications through the Space Optical Link Integration Study (SOLIS) project, funded with £356,000. This study, delivered under ESA’s Sunrise programme, will investigate use cases for deploying Free Space Optical Communications technology within Eutelsat’s OneWeb LEO global network.

Finally, Inmarsat Navigation Ventures Ltd (Viasat UK) will receive £881,000 for the International Virtual Satellite Operators Network (Phase 2) project. This initiative will develop a service that enables governments to plan, procure, manage and monitor satellite communications services from Viasat and other providers, ensuring secure and coherent management of critical communications.

Dr Paul Bate, CEO of the UK Space Agency, said:

Today’s investment shows how the UK’s space ambitions translate into real-world impact. By advancing satellite communications technology, we’re not only building a globally competitive sector but also ensuring that communities – even in the most remote corners of the UK – can access the services they need. This is space delivering for people and powering our future economy.

By helping businesses, universities and research institutions commercialise breakthrough technologies, the government is creating high-skilled jobs in the UK’s £18.9 billion space sector and delivering tangible benefits - from improved weather forecasting to enhanced national security.

Laurent Jaffart, Director of ESA’s Connectivity and Secure Communications, said:

ESA is committed to supporting a vibrant and striving telecommunications ecosystem in Europe, while achieving a zero-debris environment in space. This milestone, with support from the UK Space Agency, will further strengthen the European autonomy and sovereignty that we are collectively striving for with our Member States.

Dr Colin Baldwin, Executive Director of the UKspace Trade Association, said:

UKspace’s Satellite Telecommunications Committee, run jointly with techUK, has made a strong case that our industry has the expertise, technology and talent to capture a significant portion of the global satellite communications market over the coming decade. We are delighted to see so many of our member companies benefiting from and taking advantage of the UK Space Agency’s investment in the ARTES programme at the ESA Council of Ministers meeting in 2022 continuing to develop new innovations which will help to achieve this goal.

This funding comes ahead of the ESA Ministerial Council in Bremen on 26-27 November, where the Government will negotiate the UK’s investment into the future of Europe’s space ambitions, with a focus on economic growth and national security. Evaluation shows that every £1 invested in ESA returns £7.49 in direct benefits to the UK economy.

As well as ESA programmes, the UK space sector has access to a wider range of national space funding than ever before. To support national programmes and the UK’s membership of ESA, the government allocated the UK Space Agency a budget of £2.8 billion up to 2029/30.

From pioneering satellite refuelling to transforming connectivity in remote areas, these projects show how investment in space delivers real benefits for people’s everyday lives.

U.S. wireless giant Verizon has announced more than 13,000 job cuts in what will be the company’s biggest single round of layoffs, as part of a broad effort to streamline operations and reduce costs. The decision follows mounting market pressures and slowing growth in new wireless subscribers amid increased competition in the sector.In addition to the layoffs, Verizon will convert 179 corporate-owned retail outlets into franchised stores and shut down one location. The company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it expects to take a severance charge of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter. More than 80% of affected staff are expected to exit next month. Verizon shares fell 1% on Thursday following the announcement.CEO Dan Schulman told employees in a company memo that the workforce reduction would be accompanied by cuts to outsourced services and external labor expenses. “Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,” Schulman wrote in a note to employees seen by Reuters. “We must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers.”A spokesperson confirmed the move, calling it “an opportunity for Verizon to reset, restructure and realign our priorities on ways that will help us regain our leadership as a communications provider.”Reuters and other outlets had reported earlier that the company was planning job cuts totaling around 15,000, primarily within the U.S. workforce.Schulman also announced the creation of a $20 million career transition fund to support displaced employees, stating it would help workers build “the opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.” The company stressed that the layoffs were not tied to its use of artificial intelligence.Verizon is contending with fierce competition from legacy rivals and cable providers that have entered the wireless market with lower-priced offerings. Schulman, who joined the company as CEO in October from PayPal and has served on Verizon’s board since 2018, faces an industry environment in which AT&T and T-Mobile have ramped up promotions around new iPhone launches, offering aggressive discounts and trade-in deals.The carrier added just 44,000 monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers in the third quarter, trailing AT&T, while T-Mobile led the industry with more than 1 million net additions.Verizon had roughly 100,000 employees in the United States at the end of 2024, including

[TITLE]Red Sea chaos pushes global internet cables into dangerous delays as major tech firms scramble for new routes and safety:
[TEXT]
Delayed Red Sea subsea cables are tightening global bandwidth in already strained regions

Operators face dangerous conditions that stop vital installation crews from working safely

High-risk waters are forcing telecoms to abandon long-planned deployment timelines

Ongoing instability in the Red Sea has created severe obstacles for tech giants and subsea cable operators, who now face prolonged pauses in construction as security threats complicate every stage of deployment.

Cable-laying vessels require predictable access, stable waters, and political clearance, yet these conditions are no longer present in a zone where conflicts have disrupted routine maritime activity.

Companies involved in major systems expected to link Europe, Asia, and Africa have confirmed critical segments of their infrastructure cannot move forward because their ships and crews cannot operate safely.

Critical projects lose momentum

Meta’s 2Africa system and Google’s Blue-Raman project remain the most visible examples of stalled work, with Red Sea sections still incomplete despite years of planning and extensive investment.

Operators responsible for additional cables, including India-Europe-Xpress, Sea-Me-We 6, and Africa-1, have been unable to complete their planned routes, creating a bottleneck in a corridor that historically handled large volumes of global data traffic.

These delays add pressure to countries that rely on limited cable paths and continue to experience slower speeds and higher prices.

Telecommunications groups are now evaluating overland routes through Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq in an attempt to bypass the Red Sea entirely - ironically paths which were once dismissed as too expensive or politically complex.

AWS and HUMAIN Expand Partnership with NVIDIA AI Infrastructure and AWS AI Chip Deal to Drive Global AI Innovation

Expanded partnership includes deployment of up to 150,000 AI accelerators including the latest NVIDIA GB300s AI infrastructure and AWS’s Trainium chips.

Amazon Bedrock will provide customers access to best-in-class foundation models optimized across diverse, high performance AI chip infrastructures.

AWS becomes HUMAIN’s preferred AI partner with AWS and HUMAIN collaborating to bring AI compute and services to customers worldwide.

Washington--(ANTARA/Business Wire)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and HUMAIN, a Public Investment Fund (PIF) company delivering global full-stack AI solutions, announced today at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum their plans to provide, deploy and manage up to 150,000 AI accelerators in a data center facility known as an “AI Zone” in Riyadh. As part of the expanded partnership, AWS will become HUMAIN’s preferred AI partner globally, and the two companies will collaborate to bring AI compute and services from Saudi Arabia to customers worldwide.The first-of-a-kind AI Zone in Saudi Arabia will support cutting-edge AI training and inference workloads with access to the latest NVIDIA GB300 AI infrastructure and AWS’s Trainium AI chips.

This milestone advances the strategic partnership between the two companies and the joint plan announced in May 2025 to invest more than $5 billion in AI infrastructure, AWS services, and AI training and talent development in Saudi Arabia.“This marks a pivotal moment in our commitment to our partnership with HUMAIN,” said Tanuja Randery, Managing Director, Europe, Middle East & Africa, AWS. “By combining HUMAIN's local expertise and investment with AWS AI solutions—including our advanced infrastructure, hardware partnerships with NVIDIA, the transformative AI platform Amazon Bedrock, and AI solutions for business users including Amazon Quick Suite—we're establishing a world-class innovation hub that will serve customers across Saudi Arabia and around the globe. As an AWS Solution Provider, HUMAIN will empower organizations to unlock the full potential of generative AI and drive agentic transformation for businesses and government entities. Together, we're accelerating digital transformation and fueling economic growth—backed by a deep understanding of local needs and global-scale capabilities. This partnership demonstrates our unwavering commitment to investing in both cutting-edge infrastructure and the talent that will define the future of AI in the Kingdom and beyond.”“The AI Zone represents the beginning of a multi-gigawatt journey for HUMAIN and AWS. From inception, this infrastructure has been engineered to serve both national priorities and the world’s accelerating demand for AI compute,” said Tareq Amin, CEO of HUMAIN. “What truly sets this partnership apart is the scale of our ambition and the innovation in how we work together. Through a groundbreaking commercial model and a shared commitment to global market expansion, we are creating an ecosystem that will shape the future of how AI ideas can be built, deployed, and scaled for the whole world.”This AWS and HUMAIN collaboration is designed to accelerate AI adoption and advance the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s goal to become a global AI leader.Beyond infrastructure, AWS and HUMAIN will collaborate to accelerate AI adoption across the public and private sectors, develop advanced Arabic Large Language Models, including “ALLAM,” HUMAIN’s Arabic-first large language model, and create a unified AI agent marketplace for government services.To build a sustainable, future-ready workforce, AWS will train 100,000 Saudi citizens in cloud computing and generative AI through the Amazon Academy in collaboration with PIF and support a dedicated upskilling initiative to train 10,000 women. These efforts support the preparation of the workforce for an AI-powered economy projected to contribute $130 billion to the nation's GDP by 2030.Source: Amazon.com, Inc.
