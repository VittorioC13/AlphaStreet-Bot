[TITLE]O5 Group Buys Retail Building Across From Penn Station for $30M:
[TEXT]
O5 Group, a real estate investor and manager, has acquired a retail building across the street from Midtown’s Penn Station.

New York-based O5 Group, which rebranded from Oved Group in 2022 and specializes in apparel, real estate and finance, purchased the three-story building at 425 Seventh Avenue from United Pacific Development for $30 million, according to city records made public Wednesday.

Ralph Dweck, an attorney at Wachtel Missry, signed the deal for the buyer, which used the entity FO 425 Seventh Avenue, while Sze Chan signed for the seller, records show.

It’s unclear who brokered the deal. A spokesperson for O5 Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Chan could not be reached for comment.

United Pacific bought the property between West 33rd and West 34th streets — and across Seventh Avenue from Penn Station — in 2006 for $4.1 million, property records show. The low-rise building’s ground-floor retail space is currently home to Rose’s Pizza.

It’s unclear what O5 Group plans to do with its new property, but the company owns nearly 10 other retail properties throughout New York City in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, according to its website.

News of the deal also comes after a slew of big leasing news near Penn Station, an underground train and subway hub in New York City that is said to be the busiest transportation facility in the Western Hemisphere.

Earlier this month, fintech firm Robinhood signed a sublease for 125,392 square feet at Vornado Realty Trust’s Penn 2, which sits above the train hall, as Commercial Observer previously reported. At the same time, Dick’s Sporting Goods signed a lease for 125,284 square feet of office space at Penn 2, while fintech firm Current took more than 62,000 square feet at the property.

GAAP operating margin of 6.9% and adjusted (1) operating margin of 7.1%

operating margin of 7.1% GAAP diluted EPS of $0.70 and adjusted (1) diluted EPS of $0.71

diluted EPS of $0.71 Generated $50 million in operating cash flow for the quarter, triple last year's comparable period

Quarterly dividend increased 10% to $0.242, the 5th consecutive year of double-digit increases

Additional Strategic Initiatives :

Completed 15-store acquisition in southeast U.S. region; adding an estimated $80 million in annual Retail sales (approximately $40 million net to enterprise)

Announced planned exit of non-core businesses (Kincaid and American Drew casegoods and Kincaid upholstery)

Announced proposed closure of UK manufacturing facility

Strategically realigned leadership and corporate staffing to focus on core businesses

To be substantially completed by the end of the fiscal year, these initiatives combined will reduce sales by approximately $30 million, net, and increase margins by 75-100 bps

MONROE, Mich., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- La-Z-Boy Incorporated (NYSE: LZB), a global leader in the retail and manufacture of residential furniture, today reported second quarter results for the period ended October 25, 2025. For the quarter, sales totaled $522 million, up slightly against the prior year comparable period, reflecting growth in Retail and Wholesale segments, offset by a decline in Joybird sales. Operating margin was 6.9% for the quarter on a GAAP basis and 7.1% on an adjusted(1) basis. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.70 on a GAAP basis and $0.71 on an adjusted(1) basis.

Second quarter total written sales for the Retail segment (company-owned La-Z-Boy stores) grew 4% versus a year ago and written same-store sales (which exclude the impact of both newly opened stores and newly acquired stores) were down 2%. This represents a continued sequential improvement in written same-store sales trends over the last two quarters against a challenging consumer and macroeconomic environment.

Melinda D. Whittington, Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We were pleased to deliver modest sales growth, particularly in our Wholesale segment where we also again delivered margin expansion, continuing to create our own momentum in what remains a choppy landscape. We are investing in the business for the long term, as highlighted by the opening of 15 new company-owned stores in the last 12 months and the advancement of our distribution and home delivery transformation project. Furthermore, in the beginning of our third quarter, we completed the previously announced acquisition of a 15-store network in the southeast U.S. region. Our Century Vision strategy to grow our Retail store footprint and expand brand reach is working and positions us to disproportionately benefit when overall industry volumes rebound.”

Whittington added, “In addition to investing in our core, vertically integrated North American upholstery business, we are proactively taking steps to optimize our portfolio. We have announced plans to exit our non-core wholesale casegoods and upholstery businesses in the back half of the fiscal year, announced the proposed closure of our U.K. manufacturing facility, and strategically realigned our commercial leadership and corporate staffing to enhance operating efficiency. On top of this, leveraging our North American manufacturing base with ~90% of finished goods produced in the U.S., we are successfully navigating the current trade and tariff volatility. Our iconic brand, well positioned manufacturing base, strong balance sheet, and talented team provide the foundation for continued growth and margin expansion.”

Third Quarter Outlook :

Taylor Luebke, SVP and Chief Financial Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We expect fiscal third quarter sales to be in the range of $525-545 million (growth of 1-4% year-over-year) and adjusted operating margin(2) to be in the range of 5.0-6.5%, reflecting advancement of our Century Vision initiatives, friction costs related to portfolio and supply chain optimizations, and a measured view on the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.”

Fiscal 2026 Second Quarter Results versus Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter :

Consolidated GAAP operating margin was 6.9% versus 7.4% Consolidated adjusted (1) operating margin was 7.1% versus 7.5% last year, with change due to deleverage in Retail delivered same-store sales and investment in new stores, partially offset by 110 basis point benefit of lower warranty expense due to a change in our dealer warranty arrangements during the quarter

Sales: Written sales for the Retail segment (company-owned La-Z-Boy stores) increased 4% compared to the year ago period driven by new and acquired stores Written same-store sales decreased 2%, a sequential improvement versus the last two quarters, as lower traffic and conversion were partially offset by higher average ticket and design sales Delivered sales increased slightly to $222 million

Operating Margin: GAAP operating margin was 10.7% versus 12.6% Adjusted (1) operating margin was 10.7% versus 12.6%, with change due to fixed cost deleverage on lower delivered same-store sales and investment in new stores

Wholesale Segment:

Sales: Sales increased 2% to $369 million versus last year, driven by growth in our core North America La-Z-Boy branded wholesale business

Operating Margin: GAAP operating margin was 7.9% versus 6.7% Adjusted (1) operating margin was 8.1% versus 6.8%, with improvement driven by 160 basis point benefit of lower warranty expense due to a change in our dealer warranty arrangements during the quarter, partially offset by incremental expenses related to our distribution and home delivery transformation and increased advertising expenses

Corporate & Other:

Joybird written sales increased 1%, improving sequentially from last two quarters, and driven by strength in retail store performance

Joybird delivered sales decreased 10% to $35 million primarily due to lower delivered volume

[TITLE]Inside Crocs marketing: What they do differently on social media (and why it works):
[TEXT]
If there’s any brand that understands the power of the comeback, it’s Crocs. Its most recognizable product—lightweight, perforated clogs—were a fashion staple in the early to mid-2000s. However, the fallout from the 2008 global recession paired with overproduction left the American footwear business in a precarious state.

But nearly 20 years later, Crocs has emerged stronger than ever.

With the help of a new executive team and a refreshed marketing strategy (including social media marketing), Crocs increased its annual global revenue from $1.2 billion in 2014 to $4.1 billion in 2024.

The number of Crocs stores worldwide also hit its highest point in seven years as of 2024, with a total of 390 stores. Although the United States has the highest proportion of Crocs storefronts, the brand has expanded globally, with most of its international retail shops in South Korea (95), China (51) and Japan (21).

Crocs’ revival is undeniably impressive, and its social strategy has been a driving force in its overall marketing success.

In this guide, we’ll break down Crocs’ approach to social media and what you can learn from it.

Crocs’ marketing strategy is embedded in their brand ethos

Although its style can be polarizing, Crocs is unapologetic

Britain's finance ministry said on Friday that finance minister Rachel Reeves plans to raise around 500 million pounds ($655 million) a year by removing an exemption from tariffs for imports of individual goods costing under 135 pounds.Reeves has pledged not to increase the cost of living for British households in her annual budget on November 26, but retailers such as clothing chain Next and rival Primark-owner Associated British Foods have lobbied against what they see as unfair competition from overseas stores.While major retailers must pay tariffs on many goods they import in bulk, Britons who buy similar items direct from online retailers, often based in China, do not have to pay tariffs if they cost below a certain amount."It's time to make sure our local shops can compete fairly with overseas sellers and keep driving growth and good jobs across the UK," Reeves said in a statement.The finance ministry said that Reeves planned to scrap the exemption for imports of low-value items in her budget and launch a consultation on how to implement the new customs arrangements."Any impact on consumer prices will be modest," the finance ministry said.Reeves' actions follow in the footsteps of U.S. President Donald Trump - who scrapped tariff exemptions on imports worth under $800 in August - and the EU is bringing forward similar plans for imports worth under 150 euros ($172.65)."This move closes a loophole that has disadvantaged British business, damaged British high streets and allowed proper safety standards to be ignored and we hope it is implemented rapidly," ABF chief executive George Weston said in a statement alongside the finance ministry announcement.

[TITLE]Hot, Fast and Everywhere: The Rise of the Air Fryer in the American Kitchen:
[TEXT]
It's Wednesday, around 6 p.m. It's been a busy day, but I'm already carving a perfectly roasted chicken on my favorite ebony cutting board, the bird's juices spilling out from under crispy skin and filling up the board's reservoir like a moat.

For years, Ina Garten's roasted chicken — or some variation of it — has been something of a Sunday tradition for me. It's not particularly decadent or overly involved, but it's reserved for Sundays because of its 2-hour total cooking time. Now, the same recipe, but adapted for the air fryer, hits the table in well under an hour.

After months of owning an air fryer and experimenting mostly with versions of traditionally fried foods, such as wings, fries and chicken cutlets, I made my first air fryer roast chicken on a whim. Stunned by the speedy cooking time — 25% faster than traditional roasting — tender meat and impossibly crispy skin without the usual tablespoon of butter, I haven't put a bird in the oven since.

Of all the kitchen tools I've collected, and there are many, the air fryer has shifted my cooking paradigm the most, making cooking easier, faster and more foolproof. Few and far between are air fryer fails, and frequent are the discoveries of something I'd been "making wrong" all along until I roasted it quickly under spiraling superconvection heat.

Save for the rare batch of cookies or large cut of meat for a dinner party, the air fryer has all but replaced my oven. I plan meals around it: If a recipe calls for the use of my oven — meat loaf, roasted salmon, charred cauliflower — I consider how I might adapt it for the air fryer.

Celebrated chef and restaurateur Stephanie Izard shares my enthusiasm. "It's such a versatile tool," the James Beard Award winner tells me. "I use mine all the time for dinners," she adds, naming fried rice, marinated chicken and salmon as a few of her go-tos. "It's like making one-pot meals — but roasted!"

We're not alone.

According to a CNET survey, over 70% of US adults either own or plan to own an air fryer within the year. Additional studies estimate that

[TITLE]WeShop Launches in the U.S. After Strong Nasdaq Debut, Allowing Users to Earn Ownership through their Shopping:
[TEXT]
WeShop’s social commerce platform combines shopping and social interactions designed to drive product discovery, retailer growth, and community ownership

U.S. app launch includes leading brands across fashion, electronics, beauty, home, and lifestyle categories, including Bloomingdales, Walmart and Nike.

The app is available today on both the App Store and Google Play to start earning ownership through ShareBack™

NEW YORK, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeShop Holdings Limited (“WeShop” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: WSHP) the pioneering social-commerce platform allowing its users to earn ownership of the company through their shopping, today announced its entry to the U.S. market with the launch of the world’s first shareholder owned social commerce shopping app. Following the company’s strong Nasdaq debut on November 14 with hundreds of major retailers already available through the app, WeShop invites U.S. shoppers to participate in a new era of retail ahead of the 2025 holiday shopping season. WeShop has popular retail partners across multiple categories, including Bloomingdales, Walmart, and Nike.

WeShop allows users to explore over 1 billion products, recommend items to friends, and earn rewards for both shopping and referrals. Through WeShop’s signature ShareBack™ program, users can accumulate “WePoints” with every purchase or referral. WePoints can be converted into equity in WeShop itself, turning everyday shoppers into shareholders.

The U.S. launch follows a successful pilot in the United Kingdom, where WeShop partnered with major retailers across fashion, electronics, home goods, travel, and lifestyle categories. The platform generated more than $140 million in sales in the UK, demonstrating how strongly consumers respond to a model built on trust, community, and mutual benefit.

“With this launch, we’re giving U.S. consumers a completely new type of shopping experience, one where the community is rewarded for the value it creates,” said John Garner, Founder of WeShop. “Peer-to-peer recommendations consistently outperform traditional advertising, and with WeShop, shoppers can finally share in the upside of the network they power. This is the Retail Revolution: social, community-driven, and built on real ownership.”

The WeShop app, available to download today on both the App Store and Google Play, brings together social discovery, transparent incentives, and a vast retail network into a single platform designed for modern shopping behaviors. As the community grows, the company expects users will gain access to expanded features, deeper social integration, and increased opportunities to build equity.

With the global e-commerce market expected to surpass $8 trillion by 2027 and social commerce projected to exceed $2 trillion by 2026, WeShop’s entrance into the United States positions the company at the forefront of the next major shift in consumer retail.

[TITLE]Ultra-Processed Foods Nearly Double Colon Cancer Risk—Study:

New research links ultra-processed food with a higher colon cancer risk.

The risk jumped 1.5 times in people with diets heavy in ultra-processed foods.

Here’s what you need to know to help prevent colon cancer.

For years, healthcare providers have been puzzled by an increase in colorectal cancer cases in young people. Now, new research suggests the culprit may be more common than most people realize. A recent study linked ultra-processed foods to increased colon cancer risk in women.

These foods make up of the U.S. food supply and may be driving colon cancer rates in people under the age of 50, per the JAMA Oncology study.

For the study, researchers analyzed the diets of more than 29,000 female nurses under 50 years old and found that those who had the highest levels of ultra-processed foods (

[TITLE]Quick commerce goes beyond grocery to higher margin wares:
[TEXT]
Synopsis

Quick commerce platforms are shifting focus to higher-margin categories like electronics and fashion, now contributing 20-25% of gross sales, up from under 10% two years ago. This strategic pivot aims to boost margins and expand basket sizes, challenging larger e-commerce players. Companies like Swiggy's Instamart and Zepto are actively scaling these non-grocery offerings.

[TITLE]India’s four labour codes promise to lend our economy a sharper edge by forging a new social compact:
[TEXT]
India’s long-awaited labour reforms mark a defining moment for our economic and social trajectory. The consolidation of 29 Central labour laws into four Labour Codes represents one of the most forward-looking and inclusive transformations undertaken since Independence.

Apart from decades of economic learnings, extensive dialogue with workers, industry and state governments went into these. They reflect a recognition that the world of work has changed and India’s labour framework must evolve to match the dynamism of a rapidly modernizing economy.

India is at an inflection point. To become a $5 trillion economy by 2028-29, we need a robust workforce, for which the legal framework must deliver security, opportunity and flexibility for both workers and enterprises.

The four Labour Codes—on Wages, Industrial Relations, Social Security and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions—aim to do that by laying a foundation for a more secure workforce and a more competitive industry.

By consolidating 29 fragmented and often overlapping laws, India has replaced complexity with clarity. The new framework streamlines compliance, digitizes processes and enables transparent, predictable industrial relations.

For enterprises, particularly MSMEs that are engines of employment generation, this reform reduces administrative friction and allows businesses to scale, invest and innovate more confidently.

For workers, it guarantees uniform wage floors, timely wage payment, stronger social security and defined protections that safeguard dignity and well-being. The Codes reaffirm a core principle that CII has long emphasized: that when workers thrive, productivity rises and growth becomes more sustainable for all.

The new labour architecture comes at a pivotal moment. India is emerging as a global hub for manufacturing, services, technology and digital innovation. Investors look for stability, transparency and a responsive regulatory environment.

The Labour Codes deliver precisely that.

A unified wage system, simpler hiring frameworks, clearer dispute resolution mechanisms and strengthened safety norms build confidence across sectors such as IT/ITeS, textiles and apparel, electronics, logistics, ports, mining and exports. The assurance of stability not only enhances competitiveness, but incentivizes long-term investments that expand employment and support value creation.

A defining strength of the Labour Codes is their deep inclusivity. For the first time, India extends social security protections to gig and platform workers, securing a fast-growing workforce that powers digital commerce, mobility and on-demand services.

The Codes also advance gender equity by strengthening safeguards for women working across sectors, enabling night work with safety provisions, encoding maternity benefits and ensuring equal wages—steps that encourage greater female participation in India’s labour force.

Youth entering the workforce benefit from clearer pathways to apprenticeships, training and employment in high-growth sectors.

Meanwhile, MSMEs gain from simplified compliance and flexibility, enabling them to grow sustainably and formalize more jobs.

Importantly, the Labour Codes bring long-needed protections to traditional and vulnerable categories of workers, including beedi and cigar workers, plantation labour, mining and hazardous- industry workers, dock workers, textile and garment employees and professionals across audio-visual, broadcasting and digital media.

The emphasis on occupational safety and health ensures that every worker, whether in a high-risk mine or a cutting-edge digital studio, receives adequate protection, welfare facilities and a safe environment. This should enhance productivity by reinforcing human dignity at work.

Collectively, these reforms initiate a virtuous cycle for India’s economy: improved worker welfare promotes motivation and productivity, which strengthens enterprise performance and competitiveness, which attracts investment, which creates more jobs and expands formalization, which in turn draws more workers under the protective umbrella of social security.

Early indicators already show this transformation taking shape. India recorded its highest-ever provident fund (PF) enrolments in 2024-25, a sign of faster formalization across sectors. Notably, 61% of new PF subscribers are aged below 29 years. Women’s economic participation is also rising, with the female worker population ratio having risen to 40.3% in 2023-24, up from 28.7% four years earlier—a powerful signal of inclusive growth.

These trends affirm that India is moving steadily toward a high-trust, high-productivity workforce where protection and competitiveness reinforce each other.

In essence, the Labour Codes are far more than a legal consolidation; they represent a visionary redesign of India’s labour ecosystem. They strengthen the security of workers, agility of enterprises and confidence of investors. They empower workers and uplift them.

In all, they create a new social compact, one that aligns economic growth with social justice and competitiveness with compassion. They promise growth that’s not only faster, but also fairer, more inclusive and more sustainable.

The long-awaited labour codes announced by the Government of India represent a truly big-bang reform. For decades, labour regulation in the country was guided by a multiplicity of out-dated laws, many of them dating back to pre-independence era. Reforming this ‘fragmented framework’ had become an economic imperative. Reducing the number of labour laws and enforcement authorities, and aligning the overall regulatory ecosystem with present-day economic scenario, has been the main objective of the new labour codes.As such, the labour codes are expected to enhance the welfare of the workers and improve social security coverage for the informal workforce. For businesses, they aim to simplify procedures, reduce compliance burden, and decriminalize minor offences, among other improvements.From the perspective of industry, a critical question at this stage is: following the introduction of labour codes, how competitive is the Indian economy compared to peer nations such as Brazil, China, S Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand? While overall competitiveness depends on reforms across multiple domains - including land, labour, infrastructure, power, logistics and the cost of capital – the availability of skilled, efficient, and cost-effective labour force remains central to both the ease and cost of doing business.Labour law regulations and compliances in India have long been viewed as burdensome for investors and industry. Multiple licenses, registrations and return filings have often been cited by industry as contributing to this burden. The newly introduced labour reforms seek to streamline these processes through several measures, including single registration, single license, and single return for businesses; uniformity in definitions; greater flexibility to States to prescribe thresholds for lay-offs or retrenchments when required. Additionally, the provision for fixed-term employment (FTE) allows firms to hire workers based on evolving needs without fear of future legal complications. Taken together, these changes are expected to enhance competitiveness for Indian businesses.Given the comprehensive nature of the labour codes, and assuming effective implementation, India can anticipate increased investment, greater job-creation, and improved labour productivity. Although the requirement to extend social security coverage may raise the cost of business for firms in the short term, these can be expected to be offset over time through higher labour productivity, improved ability of the firms to attract talent, and enhanced hiring flexibility – all of which contribute to greater cost-efficiency in production.Overtime work regulations across countries constitute another factor in assessing labour-related competitiveness. The Economic Survey 2024-25 provides a comparative picture: India (Union) permits 75 hours of overtime per quarter, while the best performing State, Telangana, allows 156 hours. In comparison, Indonesia permits 182 hours, S Korea 156 hours, Vietnam 120 hours, Malaysia 312 hours, and Japan 240 hours. Under the labour codes, Indian States have the flexibility to determine their own quarterly overtime limits.This flexibility to raise overtime ceilings has the potential to reduce the cost, time and operational risks faced by Indian firms, while enabling them to reap greater economies of scale. It can also support the growth of smaller firms, while helping businesses fulfil seasonal export orders, and provide workers with the opportunity to earn more. Higher earnings, in turn, can strengthen household purchasing power and stimulate consumption demand within the economy.The combined advantages of flexible hiring under fixed-term employment (FTE), and higher permissible overtime limits will be especially beneficial for labour-intensive, export-oriented firms that receive seasonal orders, such as in garments, apparel, and textiles. Similarly, export-focussed businesses that deal in high value items, such as gems and jewellery, would gain from the ability to hire skilled workers with greater flexibility.Further, leveraging new age technology to simplify compliance for businesses and for timely payment of wages, will enhance transparency and accountability in enforcement, while reducing operational costs for businesses. Industry experts note that India is competitively positioned on the labour-related parameters – such as minimum wage rates, permissible working hours, and mechanisms for dispute resolution – when compared with countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Positive outcomes are likely, if States implement the rules in a standardized manner that aligns with the spirit of the labour codes.Labour codes bode well for India’s prospects of attracting larger volumes of domestic and foreign investments into manufacturing and services. They are expected to strengthen resilient supply chains, deepen integration with global value chains (GVCs), nurture globally competitive manufacturing, and enable the adoption of technology by firms in administrative operations. The reforms also hold significant promise for building a resilient, skilled, more productive labour force.At the same time, for India’s GDP to grow at 10 percent and more annually, major states and high-growth sectors will need to deliver on the promise of even higher growth trajectories. Achieving this would require continued reforms, improved infrastructure and logistics, enhanced facilities within industrial clusters - including residential dormitories for workers - better access to technology and markets for MSMEs, and deeper specialisation among Indian businesses to strengthen their presence in global markets.

[TITLE]Quick commerce goes beyond grocery to higher margin wares:
[TEXT]
Synopsis

Quick commerce platforms are shifting focus to higher-margin categories like electronics and fashion, now contributing 20-25% of gross sales, up from under 10% two years ago. This strategic pivot aims to boost margins and expand basket sizes, challenging larger e-commerce players. Companies like Swiggy's Instamart and Zepto are actively scaling these non-grocery offerings.

[TITLE]China Insight: Hitting 100 Million RMB in One Night — What Chicjoc Got Right:
[TEXT]
China’s Double 11 shopping period this year once again proved the scale of the country’s consumer market: online retail sales reached nearly 2.4 trillion yuan, or $337.69 billion, marking double-digit, year-over-year growth. While major platforms kept sales reports intentionally low-key, several breakout brands delivered performance that cut through the noise.

Among them was Chicjoc. Its “Super Fashion Launch 2.0,” a global livestream co-created with Taobao Clothing, ran for 30 continuous hours and generated more than 100 million yuan in sales — a milestone that has quickly become part of Double 11 lore.

The achievement offered a counterargument to recent pessimism
