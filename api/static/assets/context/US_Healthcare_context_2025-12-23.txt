[TITLE]Check out the exclusive pitch deck Valerie Health used to raise $30 million from Redpoint Ventures to automate healthcare faxes:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

When Valerie Health CEO Peter Shalek demos his product to clinicians, he has an unusual pitch: "This is a weird demo, because you'll never have to use this software."

Valerie Health, which Shalek cofounded alongside Uber Health founder Nitin Joshi, aims to fully automate time-consuming front-office tasks in healthcare, such as referrals and patient scheduling.

It's taking over those tasks for independent provider groups, a focus that's helping the startup rack up new revenue — and new venture funding.

Valerie Health just raised $30 million in Series A funding led by Redpoint Ventures, the company said Tuesday. The raise brings Valerie Health's total funding to $39 million since its 2024 founding.

Shalek said Valerie Health is already working with several of the nation's largest independent provider groups, in areas ranging from urology and podiatry to cardiology.

Across specialties, the front-office challenges for provider groups are often the same, Shalek said: juggling patient intakes and follow-ups against a backlog of referrals.

Those administrative burdens and related financial pressures can lead provider groups to be acquired by hospitals or consolidated by private equity firms. But those deals can mean higher costs for patients and lower satisfaction for the clinicians impacted. Shalek wants Valerie Health to help providers thrive independently.

"I think that there's an opportunity to make it so that independent practice is the easiest, the highest quality, the most profitable place to deliver care, which is really the core mission we have," he said.

Valerie Health takes over tasks for healthcare front offices with its own employees in the loop to review the software's autonomous actions.

Shalek said Valerie Health helps practices grow, too, by processing new and existing patients faster to increase the volume of patients coming in by 5% to 7% on average.

The startup has plenty of competition. More companies are setting out to automate administrative tasks for hospitals and healthcare practices, such as the Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup Tennr, which raised $101 million in Series C funding in June at a $605 million valuation to focus on automating patient referrals.

Shalek said Valerie Health is bringing in business through its singular focus on independent provider groups and its ability to automate tasks without healthcare practices lifting a finger.

"It takes a lot of work from our side, but it allows us to just solve these problems for our customers without saying, here's another piece of software for you to train your staff on. That's the last thing these practices want. They just want us to do the work," he said.

Valerie Health wants to move fast as the market fills. Shalek said the startup is focused on grabbing more customers next year while continuing to build front-office solutions, such as voice AI agents for patient follow-ups. Valerie Health started selling its tech earlier this year; its revenue tripled last quarter from the previous quarter alone, and given the customers already in its pipeline plus the demand it's seeing in the market, Shalek said he expects revenue to grow six to seven times next year.

The startup is also hiring across its teams, including engineering, product, and sales. Joshi also spent two years as an engineering manager at fintech startup Stripe, so Shalek said Valerie Health has been able to bring over talent from both Stripe and Uber as it expands.

Here's the pitch deck Valerie Health used to raise $30 million from Redpoint Ventures.

UST will offer a combined conditional funding of up to ₹45 lakh, along with go-to-market and other support.

Strategic leap

[TITLE]Google lines up collaborations, pledges funding for AI push in healthcare, agriculture:
[TEXT]
Google on Tuesday announced funding support of $8 million to India's AI Centers of Excellence for health, agriculture, education, and sustainable cities, and committed $4,00,000 to support development of India's health foundation model.

Google - - the architect of AI models, including Gemini and Gemma that are integrated for search enhancements, cloud services, and enterprise tools - - is also supporting Gnani.AI, CoRover.AI, and BharatGen with $50,000 grants each for building models serving Indic language solutions.

Google said it is providing Wadhwani AI with $4.5 million in funding to support multilingual AI-powered applications for health and agriculture, according to a release.

The announcements mark a slew of new collaborations and funding commitments by Google to bolster India's AI ecosystem, the company said.

"Google announced funding of $4,00,000 to support new collaborations that will leverage 'MedGemma' to build India's Health Foundation Models," the company said in a release.

Such models aim to raise the efficiency of healthcare providers and improve patient outcomes across India.

Google said Ajna Lens will work with experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to build models that will support India-specific use cases in Dermatology and OPD Triaging.

The resulting models, it said, will contribute to India's Digital Public Infrastructure and their outcomes will be made accessible to the ecosystem.

Additionally, researchers, AI experts, and clinicians from IISc will explore using AI models for broader clinical applications.

To push its inclusive AI agenda, Google announced a $2 million founding contribution to establish the new Indic Language Technologies Research Hub at IIT Bombay. The initiative aims to ensure global advancements serve India's linguistic diversity, Google said.

[TITLE]Windward Bio Expands Immunology Pipeline With WIN027, a Long-Acting, Clinical-Stage Bispecific Targeting TSLP and IL-13:
[TEXT]
Windward Bio and Qyuns Therapeutics announce licensing agreement for WIN027, a highly potent, long-acting bispecific antibody with best-in-disease potential in respiratory and dermatology

WIN027 blocks 2 well-validated and synergistic drivers of inflammation — TSLP and IL‑13 — that play integral roles in respiratory and dermatology diseases

WIN027 deepens the company’s immunology pipeline and is currently in Phase 1

BASEL, Switzerland, Dec. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Windward Bio AG, a private, clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to improving the lives of people living with advanced immunological diseases, today announced a licensing agreement between its affiliate, LE2025 Therapeutics AG, and Qyuns Therapeutics for the development and commercialization of WIN027 (also known as QX027N), a potential best-in-disease, long-acting bispecific antibody targeting TSLP and IL-13.

Under the terms of the agreement, Windward Bio will gain exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize WIN027 outside of China.* Total deal value is up to $700M, including upfront payment, equity, and milestones that may be paid to Qyuns Therapeutics, contingent upon the achievement of specific development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, as well as tiered royalties on product sales.

“We are excited to add WIN027 to our growing pipeline of immunology therapies,” said Luca Santarelli, MD, Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Board Chair of Windward Bio. “Its high potency against TSLP and IL-13, as well as an extended dosing interval, has the potential to provide people with respiratory and dermatology diseases enhanced efficacy, greater convenience, and better control over their disease.”

This marks the second licensing deal announced by Windward Bio in 2025, underscoring the company’s strategic focus on growing its immunology pipeline and accelerating the development of differentiated therapies for patients living with serious immunological diseases. The company’s lead program, WIN378, a long-acting anti-TSLP monoclonal antibody, is currently being evaluated in POLARIS, a global Phase 2 trial in asthma patients, with initial data expected in 2026. Together, WIN027 and WIN378 are complementary therapies that can address significant unmet needs across a broad array of immunological diseases, representing a market opportunity of more than $50B.

[TITLE]Goldman Sachs and KeyBanc are Bullish on Danaher (DHR):
[TEXT]
Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is one of the 14 Best Large Cap Stocks to Invest In Now. On December 9, Goldman Sachs started covering Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), giving the stock a Buy rating and setting the price target at $265.

The research firm pointed to the company’s strong $6 billion bioprocessing franchise. Despite a currently muted equipment market, this part of Danaher Corporation’s (NYSE:DHR) business is growing at a high single-digit rate. Goldman Sachs expects overhangs hurting equipment demand are starting to ease and the pharmaceutical industry now has a clearer view on funding.

Goldman Sachs and KeyBanc are Bullish on Danaher (DHR)

Goldman Sachs also sees a shift towards Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) outsourcing to address onshoring. This could boost bioprocessing equipment orders in the near term. The research firm expects Danaher Corporation’s (NYSE:DHR) 2026 Biotechnology organic growth at 9.2%, which is higher than the consensus of 6.1%. This view is supported by the firm’s US CDMO survey, where 68% of respondents suggested that they plan to buy more equipment than last year.

Earlier, on December 8, KeyBanc Capital Markets highlighted top picks in the Life Sciences Tools & Services industry for 2026. The research firm cited improved biopharma spending and the easing of policy concerns.

KeyBanc Capital Markets noted that after three tough years marked by limited funding and destocking, the sector showed signs of recovery in Q3 2025 earnings and large-caps like Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) led the stock price recovery.

The firm sees Danaher Corporation’s (NYSE:DHR) preliminary 2026 guidance of 3-6% core revenue growth as conservative. This view is supported by the significant increase in biotech funding in recent months.

Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is a leading global life sciences and diagnostics innovation company. The company is known for its professional, medical, research, and industrial products and services that help discover, develop, and deliver life-changing therapies.

While we acknowledge the potential of DHR as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you’re looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

(NASDAQ:CLDX) to $24 from $21 on December 17 and reaffirmed an Equal Weight rating on the stock.

Is Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX) the Best Cancer Stock to Invest in for Long-Term Gain?

In a separate development, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLDX) announced on December 9 that it initiated the global Phase 3 trial (EMBARQ-ColdU and SD) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of barzolvolimab in adult patients with cold urticaria (ColdU) and symptomatic dermographism (SD) who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment. Barzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody.

ColdU and SD are characterized by the presence of wheals or hives with an attributable associated trigger: rubbing/scratching the skin in SD and exposure to cold temperatures in ColdU. Management stated that advanced approved therapies to treat SD and ColdU do not exist, making barzolvolimab the only drug in development that exhibits clinical benefit in patients living with the conditions in a randomized, large, placebo-controlled study, with all primary and secondary endpoints met with high statistical significance at 12 weeks and sustained through end of treatment period (20 weeks) in Phase 2 study.

Management further reported that the initiation of the EMBARQ-ColdU and SD marks the second barzolvolimab Phase 3 program, with Phase 3 in CSU ongoing.

Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLDX) develops, manufactures, and commercializes novel therapeutics for human health care. The company’s pipeline includes Varlilumab, CDX-1140, CDX-301, and CDX-3379.

Management further reported that the FDA granted approval to a capsule formulation of ORLADEYO for prophylaxis for the prevention of HAE attacks in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older in December 2020, which now holds approval in over 45 countries across the globe.

[TITLE]Google lines up collaborations, pledges funding for AI push in healthcare, agriculture:
[TEXT]
Google on Tuesday announced funding support of $8 million to India's AI Centers of Excellence for health, agriculture, education, and sustainable cities, and committed $4,00,000 to support development of India's health foundation model.

Google - - the architect of AI models, including Gemini and Gemma that are integrated for search enhancements, cloud services, and enterprise tools - - is also supporting Gnani.AI, CoRover.AI, and BharatGen with $50,000 grants each for building models serving Indic language solutions.

Google said it is providing Wadhwani AI with $4.5 million in funding to support multilingual AI-powered applications for health and agriculture, according to a release.

The announcements mark a slew of new collaborations and funding commitments by Google to bolster India's AI ecosystem, the company said.

"Google announced funding of $4,00,000 to support new collaborations that will leverage 'MedGemma' to build India's Health Foundation Models," the company said in a release.

Such models aim to raise the efficiency of healthcare providers and improve patient outcomes across India.

Google said Ajna Lens will work with experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to build models that will support India-specific use cases in Dermatology and OPD Triaging.

The resulting models, it said, will contribute to India's Digital Public Infrastructure and their outcomes will be made accessible to the ecosystem.

Additionally, researchers, AI experts, and clinicians from IISc will explore using AI models for broader clinical applications.

To push its inclusive AI agenda, Google announced a $2 million founding contribution to establish the new Indic Language Technologies Research Hub at IIT Bombay. The initiative aims to ensure global advancements serve India's linguistic diversity, Google said.
