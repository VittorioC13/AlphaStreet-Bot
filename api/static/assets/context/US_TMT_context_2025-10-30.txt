Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company's GTC conference on Tuesday that its Blackwell graphics processing units — the company's fastest AI chips — are now in full production in Arizona. Previously, Nvidia's fastest GPUs were solely manufactured in Taiwan. Huang said that President Donald Trump had asked him nine months ago to bring manufacturing back to U.S. shores. "The first thing that President Trump asked me for is bring manufacturing back," Huang said. "Bring manufacturing back because it's necessary for national security. Bring manufacturing back because we want the jobs. We want that part of the economy." Earlier this month, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company announced that the first Blackwell wafers had been produced in a facility in Phoenix. Wafers are the base material on which semiconductors are etched. Nvidia said in a video that Blackwell-based systems will now be assembled in the U.S., too. Much of what the company announced on Tuesday at its conference in Washington was for an audience of policymakers to convince them of the essential role that Nvidia plays, and that it would hurt U.S. interests to restrict its exports. Huang said on Tuesday on a panel before his speech that Nvidia was holding its conference in Washington to allow Trump to attend, according to CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos, but the president is currently on a trip in Asia. Trump said on Tuesday that he planned to meet with Huang on Wednesday, according to a Reuters report. Demand for the company's GPUs remains high, with 6 million Blackwell GPUs shipped in the last four quarters, Huang said Tuesday. Nvidia expects $500 billion in GPU sales between the Blackwell generation and next year's Rubin chips combined, he added.

Cell networks 'built on foreign technologies'

Additionally, Huang Tuesday said Nvidia would partner with Finland-based Nokia to build gear for telecommunications, an industry that he said was worth $3 trillion. As part of the partnership, Nvidia will take a $1 billion stake in Nokia. Huang said that Nvidia is building chips for 5G and 6G base stations because it's important to have wireless networks based on American technology. "Thank you for helping the United States bring telecommunication technology back to America," Huang said to Nokia CEO Justin Hotard during his speech. The deal is an appeal to Western policymakers who have long had concerns about the amount of technology from China's Huawei that's used for cellular networks around the world. "Our fundamental communication fabric is built on foreign technologies," Huang said. "That has to stop, and we have an opportunity to do that, especially during this fundamental platform shift." Nokia will use Nvidia chips in its future base stations, which are the pricey computers that distribute cellular signals. Huawei, the market leader, was effectively banned in the U.S. in 2018, leaving Nokia and Ericsson as the primary equipment vendors for U.S. networks. Huang said that Nokia would be using a new product called Nvidia ARC that combines its Grace GPU, a Blackwell GPU and the company's networking parts. Huang said that AI delivered over next-generation 6G networks could help operate robots and deliver more accurate weather forecasts.

Stakes are high

The location of the conference carries significance as Nvidia makes the case that it is a core part of the "U.S. technology stack." Huang has argued that it would be better for American interests if Chinese AI developers got used to U.S. technology like Nvidia's chips, rather than forcing the Chinese to develop their own AI chips. "Nvidia is a proud American company building the U.S. AI infrastructure that will ensure our country leads the world in shaping the future of innovation," Kari Briski, Nvidia's vice president of generative AI software for enterprise, told reporters on a Monday call. The stakes are high for Nvidia. U.S. export restrictions have already cost Nvidia billions of dollars in lost sales. In April, the U.S. government informed Nvidia that its H20 chip, which was specially designed to comply with U.S. export controls, would require a license to ship to China. In May, Nvidia said it would have recorded about $10.5 billion in H20 sales over two quarters if the government hadn't made the license requirement. Then, in July, Huang visited Trump in Washington and again tried to persuade him and other administration officials that it's in U.S. interests to ship Nvidia chips to China. The Trump administration said it would approve license requests for the H20, but that Nvidia would have to pay the U.S. government 15% of China sales. Still, Nvidia's China business isn't yet back on track. Earlier this month, Huang said at a financial conference that Nvidia is currently "100% out of China" and has no market share there. While Nvidia said it would receive licenses for the H20 chip, the company hasn't revealed a newer chip for China based on the company's current generation of Blackwell GPUs.

Quantum computing

Many of Nvidia's announcements on Tuesday were partnerships intended to signal that the company works with a variety of U.S. companies. Among those announcements was NVQLink, a new way to connect quantum chips to Nvidia's GPUs. The U.S. having a lead in quantum computing is important to policymakers because military officials are worried that a foreign adversary may be able to spy on military communications if it gets a working quantum computer first. Nvidia officials said in a Monday call that its chips can be used to correct errors that pop up during quantum computing and advance the technology. Nvidia said that 17 different quantum computing startups would produce hardware compatible with NVQLink. "Researchers will be able to do more than just error correction," Huang said Tuesday. "They will also be able to orchestrate quantum devices and AI supercomputers to run quantum GPU applications." Nvidia also said it will partner with the Department of Energy to build seven new supercomputers. WATCH: Nvidia CEO: We brought GTC to DC so President Trump could attend

[TITLE]Nvidia invests $1 billion in Nokia to push AI to the edge:
[TEXT]
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday announced a partnership with Nokia to integrate AI technology into its mobile network infrastructure, bringing accelerated computing to the edge and paving the way for 6G-ready networks. As part of the deal, Nvidia will invest $1 billion in Nokia. Team Green's gear will boost spectral efficiency and make AI inference more accessible from mobile devices.

Speaking at the company's GTC conference in Washington, DC, Huang said, "This is a brand new opportunity. Remember, the internet enabled communications. But amazingly smart companies, AWS, built a cloud computing system on top of the internet. We are now going to do the same thing on top of the wireless telecommunications network. This new cloud will be an edge, industrial, robotics cloud."

Nvidia's deal with Nokia, one of the largest telecom equipment vendors in the world, will give the company access to Nvidia's AI-RAN products, which make AI available to radio access networks to improve spectral efficiency (AI for RAN) and also will make AI available via cloud computing for wireless communications (AI on RAN). And Nokia will ensure that its 5G and 6G software runs on Nvidia hardware.

The partnership comes with a $1 billion Nvidia investment in Nokia, which lifted the telecom company's shares more than 25 percent in the hours after the announcement. Nvidia has also recently announced investments in Intel ($5 billion) and OpenAI ($100 billion). The GPU biz has a lot of spare change lying around.

"Telecommunications is a critical national infrastructure – the digital nervous system of our economy and security," said Huang in a statement. "Built on Nvidia CUDA and AI, AI-RAN will revolutionize telecommunications – a generational platform shift that empowers the United States to regain global leadership in this vital infrastructure technology."

In conjunction with the partnership, Nvidia is rolling out Aerial RAN Computer Pro (ARC-Pro), a 6G-ready accelerated computing platform for telecommunication companies.

"ARC is built from three fundamental new technologies: the Grace CPU, the Blackwell GPU, and our Mellanox ConnectX networking designed for this application," said Huang during his keynote. "... Aerial is essentially a wireless communication system running atop CUDA-X."

Nvidia and Nokia expect to develop infrastructure that will allow telecom providers to run distributed edge AI inferencing workloads at scale. According to Nvidia, almost half of ChatGPT's 800 million weekly active users access the site via mobile devices.

"The next leap in telecom isn't just from 5G to 6G – it's a fundamental redesign of the network to deliver AI-powered connectivity, capable of processing intelligence from the data center all the way to the edge," said Nokia president and CEO Justin Hotard in a statement. "Our partnership with Nvidia, and their investment in Nokia, will accelerate AI-RAN innovation to put an AI data center into everyone's pocket."

Nokia and Nvidia say that they intend to work together on AI networking solutions, such as data center switching. This will involve Nokia's SR Linux software for the Nvidia Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform and adapting Nokia's telemetry and fabric management system to Nvidia AI hardware.

T-Mobile US intends to work with the two companies as part of its effort to deploy 6G wireless technology, scheduled to begin testing in 2026. And Dell will also be participating through the provision of Dell PowerEdge servers to run the AI-RAN system.

Nvidia suggests, with no small amount of self-interest, that investing in infrastructure to run AI workloads on mobile networks is like purchasing a money multiplication machine. "One estimate suggests that telco operators can earn roughly $5 in AI inference revenue from every $1 invested in new AI radio access network (AI-RAN) infrastructure," the company said in a blog post earlier this month.

Separately, Nvidia said it plans to work with Oracle to build an AI supercomputer for the US Department of Energy. The Solstice system is expected to incorporate 100,000 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs. It is not clear when that machine will debut, but Nvidia said another supercomputer, dubbed Equinox, fitted with 10,000 Blackwell GPUs, is scheduled to be ready during the first half of 2026.

Solstice and Equinox will be housed at Argonne National Laboratory, and the expectation is that they'll be connected via Nvidia networking to provide 2,200 exaflops of AI performance. That's a lot of hallucination. ®

[TITLE]Nvidia will build AI supercomputers for US Energy Department, announces total bookings of $500 billion:
[TEXT]
By Stephen Nellis, Alexandra Alper and Arsheeya Bajwa

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday that the artificial intelligence chip leader will build seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy, and said the company has $500 billion in bookings for its AI chips.

But Huang said the Chinese government has shut Nvidia out of its market, and that the company had not applied for U.S. export licenses of its newest chips because of the Chinese position. "They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now," he said at a news conference during the company's GTC event. "I hope that will change in the future because I think China is a very important market."

The world's most valuable company, worth close to $5 trillion, Nvidia is at the core of the global rollout of AI. It is striking deals around the world while also navigating a U.S.-China trade war that could determine which country's technology is most used around the world.

Investors have been looking for clarity on what chips the tech company will be able to sell to the vast Chinese market, but Huang did not offer a timeline. He kicked off a keynote address at the company's GTC event in the U.S. capital by praising policy by U.S. President Donald Trump while announcing new products and deals. These included network technology that will let Nvidia AI chips work with quantum computers.

The supercomputers Nvidia is building for the Energy Department will in part help the United States maintain and develop its nuclear weapons arsenal. The supercomputers will also be used to research alternative energy sources such as nuclear fusion. The largest of the supercomputers for the Department of Energy will be built with Oracle and contain 100,000 of Nvidia's Blackwell chips.

"Putting the weight of the nation behind pro-energy growth completely changed the game," Huang said. "If this didn't happen, we could have been in a bad situation, and I want to thank President Trump for that."

Nvidia shares closed 5% higher at $201.03 on Tuesday.

Nvidia also announced new details with Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia to target the AI communications market. Nvidia will invest $1 billion for a 2.9% stake in Nokia and it also introduced a new product line called Arc, designed to work with telecommunications equipment. Huang said Nvidia will work with Nokia to improve the power efficiency of the company's base stations for 6G, the next generation of wireless data technology.
