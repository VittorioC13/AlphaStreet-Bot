[TITLE]HUTCHMED Announces Expanded Coverage on National Reimbursement Drug List and Inclusion in the First Commercial Insurance Drug List in China:
[TEXT]
HONG KONG and SHANGHAI and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“HUTCHMED”) (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) today announces that following the contract renewal with the China National Healthcare Security Administration (“NHSA”), the updated National Reimbursement Drug List (“NRDL”) effective on January 1, 2026 will continue to include ELUNATE®, ORPATHYS® and SULANDA®. In addition, TAZVERIK® will be included in the first edition of the National Commercial Health Insurance Innovative Drug List (“Commercial Insurance Drug List”).

ELUNATE® (fruquintinib) is included for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial cancer with Mismatch Repair proficient (pMMR) tumors that have failed prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, in combination with TYVYT® (sintilimab injection). It is also renewed for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and those who have previously received or are not suitable for receiving anti-VEGF therapy or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy (RAS wild-type).

ORPATHYS® (savolitinib) is included for treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with MET exon 14 skipping alteration.

SULANDA® (surufatinib) is renewed for the treatment of patients with unresectable; locally advanced or metastatic; progressive non-functional, well-differentiated (G1 or G2) pancreatic and non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

TAZVERIK® (tazemetostat) is included in the Commercial Insurance Drug List for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma with EZH2 mutation who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. In July 2025, the NHSA issued the 2025 Adjustment Work Plan for the NRDL and the Commercial Health Insurance Innovative Drug List, announcing the establishment of the new Commercial Insurance Drug List. This list, together with the NRDL, forms a key component of China’s multi-level medical insurance system. This new list focuses on medicines with high innovation and significant clinical value that fall beyond the scope of basic medical insurance, including certain high-cost oncology drugs, gene therapies, and rare disease therapies, enabling reimbursement through commercial health insurance products such as high-limit medical insurance, inclusive health plans (“Huiminbao”) and group health insurance. This multi-layered reimbursement framework enhances patient access to breakthrough treatments while supporting the sustainable development of China’s innovative pharmaceutical sector.

[TITLE]UK and US agree zero-tariff deal on pharmaceuticals:
[TEXT]
The UK has secured a 0 per cent tariff rate for all UK medicines exported to the US for at least three years, officials have said, in return for the UK spending more on new medicines.

Under the deal, the US agreed to exempt UK-origin pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical ingredients, and medical technology from import taxes, the officials said on Monday.

The Trump administration said in return UK drugs firms committed to invest more in the US and create more jobs.

The UK government said the 0 per cent rate on all of its pharmaceuticals exports was the lowest offered to any country. As part of the deal, it said the country's National Health Service will spend around 25 per cent more in new and effective treatments — the first major increase in such spending in over two decades.

Officials said that means UK health authorities will now be able to approve medicines that deliver significant health improvements but might have previously been declined purely on cost-effectiveness grounds, including breakthrough cancer treatments or therapies for rare diseases.

"This vital deal will ensure UK patients get the cutting-edge medicines they need sooner, and our world-leading UK firms keep developing the treatments that can change lives," said Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall.

The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said the deal was "an important step towards ensuring patients can access innovative medicines needed to improve wider NHS health outcomes".

"It should also put the UK in a stronger position to attract and retain global life science investment and advanced medicinal research," said ABPI chief executive Richard Torbett.

US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement "strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to US-UK pharmaceutical trade".

AstraZeneca is among pharmaceutical giants that have cancelled or paused their investments in the UK in recent months. US ambassador Warren Stephens recently warned said American businesses will cut future investments if "there are not changes made and fast".

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer agreed on a framework for a trade pact that would slash US import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for US products, including beef and ethanol. (AP) DIV DIV

[TITLE]Adaptive Biotechnologies Showcases Leadership in Hematology-Oncology MRD with New clonoSEQ® Data Driving Treatment Interventions at 2025 ASH Annual Meeting:
[TEXT]
SEATTLE, Dec. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation (Nasdaq: ADPT), a commercial stage biotechnology company that aims to translate the genetics of the adaptive immune system into clinical products to diagnose and treat disease, announced growing interventional use of its clonoSEQ® test among the 90 abstracts featuring clonoSEQ data at the 67th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, taking place Dec. 6–9, 2025, in Orlando. Notably, 17 abstracts utilizing Adaptive’s clonoSEQ® test exemplify how next-generation sequencing-based measurable residual disease (MRD) status is guiding clinical actions to improve blood cancer patient care.

Practice-changing data from the phase II EndRAD study support the use of NGS MRD status prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to guide the selection of non-total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning approaches to reduce long-term toxicities in children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), without compromising outcomes. The study showed outstanding event-free and overall survival outcomes in 51 patients who were NGS MRD negative and received a non-TBI regimen. The study also enrolled a comparator cohort who received TBI and showed equivalent survival in NGS MRD negative patients who received TBI (the current standard of care) compared to non-TBI approaches (oral presentation, abstract 163).

“For young people facing leukemia, the impact of treatment doesn’t end when therapy does,” said Michael Pulsipher, M.D., Division Chief of Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation at Primary Children’s Hospital and Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah. “The EndRAD results demonstrate that, for NGS MRD-negative patients, we may be able to choose transplant approaches without radiation that support both survival and long-term well-being—an advancement with real, lasting impact for patients and their families.”

Across hematologic malignancies, clonoSEQ MRD status is used by health care providers as an interventional tool to guide clinical decisions at key points in care. The presentations below show how investigators are applying clonoSEQ MRD results to tailor treatment intensity or duration with greater precision.

Multiple Myeloma (MM)

A total of 32 abstracts will be presented (31 MM, one smoldering MM), with a focus on MRD assessment of treatment response, real-world data demonstrating the link between MRD status and clinical outcomes, and several studies describing how clonoSEQ MRD results are being used to guide treatment decisions.

A presentation focused on MRD dynamics in the phase III AURIGA study of 200 newly diagnosed MM patients demonstrated that deep MRD responses and sustained MRD negativity correlated with improved progression free survival. The study shows that use of intensified maintenance in MRD-positive patients post-transplant doubled MRD negativity rates (oral presentation, abstract 97).

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)

Fifteen abstracts in NHL will be presented, focusing on use of MRD to better understand depth of response and to guide therapy.

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), results from a phase II Wisconsin Oncology Network study which used clonoSEQ to de-escalate therapy in frail older adults with DLBCL will be presented (poster presentation, abstract 1964). Additionally, data supporting the integration of ctDNA into post–CAR T surveillance will be presented (oral presentation, abstract 941).

Results from a phase II, MRD-guided study in older mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients demonstrate the use of clonoSEQ to guide duration of frontline BOVen therapy (zanubrutinib, obinutuzumab, venetoclax) (oral presentation, abstract 888).

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)

Seven abstracts utilizing clonoSEQ MRD will be presented, with the majority leveraging the test to assess treatment response and guide treatment discontinuation.

Data from a Phase II study of 80 patients with previously untreated CLL showed that time-limited pirtobrutinib, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab (PVO) achieved notably deep and durable remissions based on MRD assessment at a threshold of 10-6. MRD positive status using clonoSEQ was used to identify patients who may continue therapy, highlighting clonoSEQ as a potential tool for guiding treatment duration in this regimen (oral presentation, abstract 680).

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)

In addition to the EndRAD trial, 30 ALL abstracts will be presented describing the use of clonoSEQ to assess treatment response in investigator studies and real-world data, as well as analyses describing comparisons of bone marrow and peripheral blood MRD by clonoSEQ.

“The unprecedented volume and diversity of data at ASH this year further solidifies clonoSEQ’s leadership in the field of blood cancer MRD monitoring,” said Susan Bobulsky, chief commercial officer, MRD, Adaptive Biotechnologies. “Our unmatched body of clinical evidence and real-world patient experience, together with meaningful updates across lymphoid cancer clinical practice guidelines over the past year, reflect clear recognition of the test’s value in accelerating therapeutic progress and strengthening MRD-informed patient management.”

[TITLE]TScan Therapeutics Announces Positive Updated Data from the ALLOHA™ Phase 1 Heme Trial at the 67th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition:
[TEXT]
Treatment arm continues to demonstrate favorable relapse-free survival (HR=0.50; p=0.23) and overall survival (HR=0.61; p=0.52)

3/3 (100%) of TSC-101-treated patients who reached two-year follow-up remained relapse-free vs. 1/4 (25%) in the control arm

TSC-101 was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities observed

Company to host virtual KOL event featuring Ran Reshef, M.D., M.Sc. on Monday, December 8, at 8:00 a.m. ET

WALTHAM, Mass., Dec. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TScan Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: TCRX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cell (TCR-T) therapies for the treatment of patients with cancer, today announced updated results from the ongoing ALLOHA™ Phase 1 trial ( NCT05473910 ) of TSC-101 in patients with heme malignancies undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The data is being featured in a poster presentation at the 67th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition.

“These updated data from our Phase 1 study continue to highlight a positive safety and efficacy profile of TSC-101 in patients with heme malignancies undergoing allogeneic HCT. All three patients who reached two years of follow-up have no detectable disease as they have remained relapse-free and in complete donor chimerism,” said Chrystal U. Louis, M.D., Chief Medical Officer. “Additionally, there have been no dose-limiting toxicities and patients who received TSC-101 continue to show improved relapse-free and overall survival compared to control-arm patients. We remain focused on enrolling the remaining patients necessary to support our fixed-dosing regimen and look forward to initiating our pivotal study in the second quarter of 2026.”

“Bone marrow transplantation is currently the only curative treatment for patients with AML and MDS. Unfortunately, roughly 40% of these patients relapse within two years of transplant, at which point their prognosis is very poor and the majority will die due to their disease,” added Gavin MacBeath, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer. “We are excited to see durable responses to TSC-101 and continued positive data, in the hopes of addressing this unmet need. We look forward to expanding our heme program in 2026 with product candidates designed to double the addressable patient population.”

Key Presentation Highlights:

Patients in the treatment arm of the ALLOHATM Phase 1 trial (NCT05473910) receive TSC-101 post standard of care HCT, whereas control-arm patients receive standard of care HCT alone. As of the September 19th, 2025 data cut, 42 patients (23 in the TSC-101 treatment arm and 19 in the control arm) were eligible for inclusion in the safety analysis set. The key endpoints in the trial are safety and efficacy, with exploratory endpoints including donor chimerism and minimal residual disease (MRD) status.

Relapse-free survival (RFS) (HR=0.50; p=0.23) and overall survival (OS) (HR=0.61; p=0.52) were improved in the treatment arm relative to the control arm. 4 of 19 (21%) treatment-arm patients relapsed compared to 6 of 18 (33%) control-arm patients. One treatment-arm patient with AML experienced disease relapse on day 161 and was given a third dose of TSC-101 without lymphodepletion. The additional administration of TSC-101 resulted in a complete response including complete donor chimerism that was maintained for 5 months. The hazard ratio for probability of relapse was 0.46 (p=0.22). 8 of 37 (22%) patients had TP53 mutations, with 6 cases in the treatment arm and 2 cases in the control arm. Of the 6 patients in the treatment arm, only 1 has relapsed. Both patients with TP53 mutations in the control arm have relapsed and subsequently succumbed to their disease. The first patient with a TP53 mutation to receive TSC-101 has now reached two years of follow-up and remains relapse-free.

All 3 (100%) TSC-101-treated patients that reached two years of follow-up remained relapse-free as of the data cutoff, compared to 1 of 4 (25%) patients in the control arm, consistent with effective elimination of residual cancer cells post-HCT and durable remission with TSC-101 infusion.

TSC-101 infusions were well-tolerated at all dose levels, with no dose-limiting toxicities. Observed adverse events were similar across the treatment and control arms and were generally consistent with post-HCT adverse events.

Mixed chimerism or relapses following TSC-101 infusions were found to be significantly associated with greater ex vivo expansion of TCR-T cells during the manufacturing process. A new commercial-ready process reduces the manufacturing time from 17 days to 12 days and has a significant reduction in ex vivo expansion.

A copy of the presentation materials will be available in the “Publications” section of the Company’s website at tscan.com.

The Company recently announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has agreed to a pivotal study design for TSC-101 that mirrors the current ALLOHA™ Phase 1 trial using a biologically assigned internal control arm.

Virtual Key Opinion Leader (KOL) Event

The Company will host a virtual KOL event featuring Ran Reshef, M.D., M.Sc., on Monday, December 8, at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss the data presented at ASH, its improved commercial-ready manufacturing process, and the unmet medical need and potential market opportunity for TSC-101 and follow-on product candidates.

Details for attending the event can be found here.

[TITLE]HUTCHMED Announces Expanded Coverage on National Reimbursement Drug List and Inclusion in the First Commercial Insurance Drug List in China:
[TEXT]
HONG KONG and SHANGHAI and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“HUTCHMED”) (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) today announces that following the contract renewal with the China National Healthcare Security Administration (“NHSA”), the updated National Reimbursement Drug List (“NRDL”) effective on January 1, 2026 will continue to include ELUNATE®, ORPATHYS® and SULANDA®. In addition, TAZVERIK® will be included in the first edition of the National Commercial Health Insurance Innovative Drug List (“Commercial Insurance Drug List”).

ELUNATE® (fruquintinib) is included for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial cancer with Mismatch Repair proficient (pMMR) tumors that have failed prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, in combination with TYVYT® (sintilimab injection). It is also renewed for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and those who have previously received or are not suitable for receiving anti-VEGF therapy or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy (RAS wild-type).

ORPATHYS® (savolitinib) is included for treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with MET exon 14 skipping alteration.

SULANDA® (surufatinib) is renewed for the treatment of patients with unresectable; locally advanced or metastatic; progressive non-functional, well-differentiated (G1 or G2) pancreatic and non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

TAZVERIK® (tazemetostat) is included in the Commercial Insurance Drug List for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma with EZH2 mutation who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. In July 2025, the NHSA issued the 2025 Adjustment Work Plan for the NRDL and the Commercial Health Insurance Innovative Drug List, announcing the establishment of the new Commercial Insurance Drug List. This list, together with the NRDL, forms a key component of China’s multi-level medical insurance system. This new list focuses on medicines with high innovation and significant clinical value that fall beyond the scope of basic medical insurance, including certain high-cost oncology drugs, gene therapies, and rare disease therapies, enabling reimbursement through commercial health insurance products such as high-limit medical insurance, inclusive health plans (“Huiminbao”) and group health insurance. This multi-layered reimbursement framework enhances patient access to breakthrough treatments while supporting the sustainable development of China’s innovative pharmaceutical sector.
