[TITLE]Consumer goods play: Bharti, Warburg buy 49% stake in Haier India for $2 bn:
[TEXT]
For Chinese firms, there are very few opportunities in India to get a strategic partner in a financial investment capacity. "The last time we saw something this big happen was the MG-JSW deal," this person added. In March 2024, a clutch of Indian investors, led by billionaire Sajjan Jindal’s conglomerate, picked up 51% of MG Motor India to create JSW MG Motor India Pvt. Ltd. China’s SAIC Motor Corp. until then owned 100% in the maker of Hector and Windsor cars. Deal details were not disclosed then.

[TITLE]Samsung Biologics to Acquire First U.S. Drug Manufacturing Facility in $280M Deal – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
A South Korean biomanufacturing giant is set to purchase its first drug production facility in the U.S. for a sum worthy of its tech giant parent.

Samsung Biologics’ American subsidiary will pay $280 million to acquire biopharmaceutical company Human Genome Sciences from GSK, in a deal expected to close early next year. The deal secures Samsung Biologics’ first manufacturing base in the U.S., at a two-building campus in Rockville, Md., with a combined 60,000 liters of capacity.

Samsung Biologics is the world’s largest contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) by capacity, with 785,000 liters of current capacity across its two major biomanufacturing campuses in Incheon, South Korea. The company specializes in monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, mRNA therapies and next-generation treatments.

The Maryland industrial/life sciences campus at 9911 Belward Campus Drive will support the production of both clinical and commercial production of pharmaceuticals. Samsung Biologics is expected to retain 500 employees at the sites. The company also plans to further upgrade the facilities and bolster their production capacity.

“This landmark acquisition is a testament to our unwavering commitment to advancing global healthcare and bolstering our manufacturing capabilities in the U.S.,” John Rim, Samsung Biologics president and CEO, said in a statement. “The investment will enable us to deepen our collaboration with federal, state and local stakeholders to best serve our customers and partners while ensuring a reliable and stable supply of life-saving therapeutics.”

The Maryland Life Sciences Corridor, between Rockville, Gaithersburg and East Baltimore — as well as the DMV in general — is among the country’s largest hubs of biotechnology development. Frederick, Md.-based developer Matan Companies earlier this month, for example, secured a 161,500-square-foot lease with Montgomery County Public Schools at the landlord’s two-building industrial/life sciences complex in Gaithersburg. Though it wasn’t immediately clear how the school system plans to use the facility.

AstraZeneca in July meanwhile announced a $50 billion boost to its U.S. investments by 2030. Chief among the pharma giant’s plans is a new $4.5 billion manufacturing facility in Albemarle County, Va., its largest ever built. AstraZeneca will also use the funds to expand its already 1.3 million-square-foot life sciences campus in Gaithersburg, not far from the property owned by Matan. GSK made a similar, $30 billion investment pledge in September.

“Along with GSK’s recent commitment to invest $30 billion in R&D and manufacturing in the US over the next five years, the [Samsung Biologics] deal enables us to further focus on building the agility, capacity and capability needed in our manufacturing network to deliver the next generation of specialty medicines and vaccines. I am confident in a positive partnership and future for the Rockville site,” Regis Simard, GSK’s president of global supply chain, said in a statement.

MatX, PolyX, FFoodi, Spark Labs, ISG Intelligence, and Gilboa Nexus selected to lead accelerators under “Transition from Manufacturing to Development” program

JERUSALEM, ISRAEL, December 24, 2025 / EINPresswire.com / -- The Israel Innovation Authority announced today the selection of six winners through a competitive procedure for the establishment and operation of MOFET accelerators. These accelerators will assist in advancing breakthrough research and development in the manufacturing industry, under the new “Transition from Manufacturing to Development” program of the MOFET Fund.

The initiative, the first of its kind in Israel, is designed to drive structural transformation across Israeli industry by pairing advanced, market-oriented technological development with robust industrial manufacturing infrastructure. Through this combined approach, the program seeks to help manufacturing companies build advanced R&D capabilities and strengthen their competitiveness in global markets.

The selected accelerators will serve as dedicated professional support entities for manufacturing companies, providing complementary R&D infrastructure and hands-on guidance across the product development journey. Support will span market mapping, opportunity identification and ideation; techno-economic feasibility validation; prototype development and piloting; and the development of market-ready industrial products, including preparation for entry into international markets.

The Israel Innovation Authority’s total investment in the establishment and operation of the accelerators amounts to approximately NIS 30 million. The program is intended for manufacturing companies whose core activity is based on manufacturing in Israel and whose R&D investment is below 7% of annual turnover, enabling a meaningful shift toward R&D-oriented industrial activity.

A study conducted by the Israel Innovation Authority found that a key barrier to expanding R&D in these companies is the absence of a structured process for building product strategy, alongside insufficient dedicated R&D infrastructure. The MOFET accelerators are designed to close these gaps by providing both practical tools and sustained professional support throughout product development.

Dror Bin, CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, said: “The objective of the MOFET accelerators is to accelerate the transformation of manufacturing-oriented companies into companies that conduct R&D, namely, into high-tech companies, and to support them throughout all stages of this journey, from ideation to the development of a globally competitive innovative product. Over time, the ability of Israel’s manufacturing companies to compete with global industry leaders depends on technological innovation and the development of breakthrough products.”

Through the accelerators, participating companies will be exposed to innovative solutions and advanced technologies, including access to leading researchers and domain experts; physical infrastructure for experimentation and techno-economic feasibility testing; as well as comprehensive business support for company management during the development of technological products. The program will also help companies build in-house R&D capacity, train leadership and teams, and connect to strategic partnerships, investors, and additional stakeholders in Israel and globally.

The selected consortia include partnerships with leading strategic consulting firms, such as EY, Shaldor Consulting, Arieli Group, and Goldratt Group, as well as prominent investors including Dr. Shimon Eckhouse (founder of the Alon MedTech Ventures incubator and the global medical aesthetics companies Lumenis and Syneron), Shani Shenhav Group (supporting operations and investment activity with approximately 4,000 clients worldwide), Amir Zaidman (co-founder of The Kitchen Foodtech Hub incubator), and Dagan Eshel (co-founder of the Alpha Strauss initiative). The program also brings together R&D laboratories and academic institutions, including the Institute for Advanced Materials at the Technion, the Plastics and Rubber Center at Shenkar, Daron Laboratories, Taga, FoodLab, PlasticApp by Kafrit, and Gevasol Group.

Companies seeking to participate in the new “Transition from Manufacturing to Development” program may do so through three flexible and independent stages: Ideation, Techno-economic Feasibility, and Product Development. Companies are not required to complete all stages and may enter the program at any stage based on their business and technological needs, while receiving close professional support from the selected accelerators.

[TITLE]Embattled Target feeling heat from hedge fund investor Toms Capital following sales slump:
[TEXT]
Activist investor Toms Capital Investment Management (TCIM) has made a significant investment in Target, the Financial Times reported Friday, intensifying pressure on the struggling retailer after years of lagging performance compared with its rivals.

The size of the stake was not disclosed, and the report did not specify what demands the New York–based firm may bring forward.

Target’s shares rose 2.6% on the news. Its stock has lost more than 28% of its value this year after the Minneapolis-based chain posted three straight quarters of falling comparable sales.

In August, the retailer appointed veteran company executive Michael Fiddelke to revive growth, as the business faces pressure from strained household budgets and tariff uncertainties.

“We maintain a regular dialog with the investment community. Target’s top priority is getting back to growth,” Target said in a statement to Reuters on Friday. TCIM did not respond to requests for comment.

Hedge fund TCIM is a relatively unknown entity in the retail industry but recently gained attention after taking a stake in Tylenol maker Kenvue before its sale to Kimberly-Clark last month for $40 billion. It has also pushed for changes at Pringles maker Kellanova and US Steel.

For Fiddelke, the activist stake represents his first major test ahead of assuming the CEO role in February. His appointment has already sparked investor concerns, as he will continue reporting to current CEO Brian Cornell, who is set to become executive chairman of the board.

That structure has drawn criticism, with the nonprofit shareholder activist group The Accountability Board tabling a shareholder proposal in October urging Target to appoint an independent chairman.

“To us, this (TCIM stake) signals that investors are hungry for change , and means our shareholder proposal likely has an even stronger chance of passing,” said Matt Prescott, president of the Accountability Board, which owns Target shares.

To help assuage investor concerns and reinvigorate its business, Target laid out plans to spend an additional $1 billion in 2026 on new store openings and remodels. The company, which operates nearly 2,000 stores also cut 1,800 corporate roles as part of a broader restructuring.

The move by TCIM won’t be Target’s first encounter with an activist investor. In 2009, the company fought a high-profile proxy battle with Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman, who sought board seats to push through a real-estate spin-off amid declining profits.

Despite Ackman’s sizable stake, shareholders rejected his plan and backed Target’s incumbents. Pershing Square did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

[TITLE]Target jumps after FT reports activist Toms Capital took stake:
[TEXT]
Jonathan Roeder

(Bloomberg) — Target Corp. shares rose on Friday after the Financial Times reported that an activist investor built up a stake in the big-box retailer, citing people it didn’t identify.

Toms Capital Investment Management has made a significant investment in Target, the FT said, without disclosing further details.

Target shares jumped as much as 6.7% on Friday. The stock is headed for an annual decline of about 25% following a difficult year in which the company lost market share and sales slumped.

In response to a request for comment, Target said it maintains “regular dialogue with the investment community” and its top priority is “getting back to growth.” The company said its plan to improve its merchandise, shopping experience and technology “will drive the business forward and deliver sustained, long-term value for shareholders.”

A representative for Toms Capital couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

[TITLE]Northwind Group Provides $33M Acquisition Financing for 291 Broadway:
[TEXT]
William Macklowe Company has secured $33 million to purchase 291 Broadway, a historic 19-story office building that spans 127,000 square feet in Lower Manhattan.

Ran Eliasaf’s Northwind Group provided the acquisition financing out of the firm’s Northwind Debt Fund III, a closed-end fund.

Newmark’s Jordan Roeschlaub, Adam Spies and Josh King arranged the transaction.

Billy Macklowe, founder of William Macklowe Company, described Northwind in a statement as “a proven entrepreneurial counterparty,” and described the deal as “a bespoke financing solution.”

Eliasaf, founder and managing partner of Northwind Group, said in a statement that his firm provided acquisition debt “at an attractive basis” and added that 291 Broadway benefits from both positive in-place cash flow and an efficient layout.

“We look forward to partnering with William Macklowe Company on the successful execution of this investment and are confident in their ability to position the property for its highest and best use,” he added.

291 Broadway is a Beaux Arts building that opened in 1910 during the height of the initial skyscraper boom. The office was known as the East River Savings Bank Building and served as the national headquarters and site of the historic library for the YMCA from 1949 to 1980.

Today the office building at the busy intersection of where Reade Street meets Broadway in the Tribeca neighborhood is only steps away from numerous subway stations, including Chambers Street, Park Place and City Hall.

“The property benefits from a diverse in-place tenant base and adaptable physical configuration, supported by enduring demand for Tribeca real estate, constrained supply and proximity to major transportation hubs,” said Northwind in a statement.

[TITLE]Motive files for IPO, signaling next phase of fleet-tech arms race:
[TEXT]
Fleet telematics provider Motive has filed paperwork to go public, a move that could intensify competition in the commercial trucking technology market amid a prolonged freight downturn.

San Francisco-based Motive disclosed Tuesday that it filed a registration statement for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MTVE, according to company statements and regulatory filings. The company has not yet set a share price or offering size.

Motive provides AI-powered tools for fleet tracking, driver safety, compliance, equipment monitoring and spend management. Founded in 2013 as KeepTruckin, the company says it now serves nearly 100,000 customers across transportation, logistics, construction, energy and manufacturing.

Motive’s competitors in the fleet telematics market include Samsara (NYSE: IOT), Geotab (NYSE: GEO), Fleetio and Trimble (Nasdaq: TRMB), all offering comprehensive solutions for GPS tracking, ELD compliance, driver safety, fuel management and maintenance.

In September, Motive won a legal case against Samsara, with a judge ruling that Motive did not infringe on any valid Samsara patents.

Motive is backed by Alphabet’s venture capital arm, GV (Google Ventures).

For the trucking industry, Motive’s move toward public markets underscores how telematics and automation have evolved from optional add-ons into core infrastructure. Carriers continue to face thin margins, elevated insurance costs and tighter regulatory oversight — pressures that have driven adoption of dashcams, automated reporting and real-time vehicle data.

[TITLE]MEDIROM Partners with World:
[TEXT]
TOKYO, Dec. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MEDIROM Healthcare Technologies Inc. (Headquarters:Minato-ku, Tokyo; CEO: Kouji Eguchi; NASDAQ: MRM, MEDIROM or the “Company”), a diversified healthcare company, is collaborating with World Foundation and Tools for Humanity to deploy Proof of Human technologies such as World ID throughout Japan. The World project was co-created by Sam Altman and Alex Blania.

In preparation for the full-scale rollout of the World project in Japan, MEDIROM has entered into a Master Service Agreement (“MSA”) with Tools for Humanity (“TFH”) and World Foundation (“WF”). Under the MSA, the MEDIROM Group will be responsible for the operation of “Proof of Human” verification locations in Japan. This initiative is expected to contribute to MEDIROM’s revenue through operation fees and related services over time. Leveraging MEDIROM’s nationwide network of approximately 300 physical locations and operational expertise, the collaboration enables rapid and trusted deployment of Proof of Human technology at scale. To support this effort, MEDIROM will newly establish a dedicated special task force, the “MEDIROM World Proof of Human Task Force,” and will strengthen its organizational structure to promote the nationwide rollout of Proof of Human technology powered by World.

■ Background and Purpose of the Collaboration

In recent years, advances in generative AI have made it extremely difficult to distinguish between “humans” and “AI” online, creating a global challenge to establish trust online. To address this challenge, Sam Altman and Alex Blania co-created World. World aims to provide a mechanism, utilizing blockchain technology, that allows anyone worldwide to safely and fairly prove they are human (“Proof of Human”) without revealing their identity.

MEDIROM shares this vision and established a special task force, the “MEDIROM World Proof of Human Task Force.”

The Company will begin full-scale collaboration in Japan with TFH and WF to bring the World Proof of Human verification technology to people throughout Japan. MEDIROM will drive access across diverse fields beyond its existing footprint of relaxation and wellness retail locations. The Company expects such expansion to contribute to a future where everyone can participate in the digital society with confidence through the social implementation of “Proof of Human.”

■ Key Initiatives

・Availability of Orbs, an advanced camera deploying privacy-preserving technologies to verify humanness, in approximately 300 Re.Ra.Ku Group locations

・Establishment and operation of flagship locations offering Proof of Human verification services

・Deployment of Proof of Human verification pop-up stores in commercial facilities and public spaces

◼︎Comment from Koji Eguchi, President and CEO of MEDIROM

We are excited to launch this collaboration in Japan with Tools for Humanity and World Foundation. As generative AI rapidly permeates society, we firmly believe that this new social infrastructure for “proving one's humanness” will become an indispensable foundation for the future digital society.

Through this collaboration, we seek to broaden our reach with new approaches, such as establishing flagship locations and pop-up stores, to build an authentication environment that more people can use with confidence. We intend not only to grow this initiative into a new revenue model but also to contribute to building trust within Japan's digital society, further accelerating our evolution as a health tech company.

■ Comment from Tomoe Makino, General Manager of Japan at Tools For Humanity

“Japan has long been a global leader in adopting technology that improves everyday life, and we believe Proof of Human will become essential digital infrastructure in the age of AI,” said Tomoe Makino, General Manager of Tools for Humanity Japan. “By collaborating with MEDIROM, which has deep roots in communities across the country, we can bring World ID to people in trusted, familiar spaces and support a future where everyone can participate in the digital society with greater confidence.”

If 2026 is your target retirement year, the countdown has likely begun. But before filing that paperwork, it’s worth taking a hard look at what living on Social Security alone actually means. For millions of Americans, those monthly checks form the backbone of retirement income. For some, they are the only source.The mechanics of Social Security adjustments are designed to protect seniors, yet many find their standard of living slipping. By 2026, the average benefit of $2,013 will face the "Medicare Cliff." Because Medicare premiums are often deducted directly from Social Security checks, a $50 increase in monthly benefits can be almost entirely consumed by a $40 hike in healthcare premiums. This leaves the recipient with a negligible net gain to combat the rising prices of groceries and utilities.Furthermore, the Consumer Price Index used to calculate these raises often fails to weigh senior-specific expenses, like prescription drugs and home maintenance, as heavily as the real-world market demands.Living on $24,000 a year requires a level of fiscal discipline that borders on hardship in many U.S. ZIP codes. After accounting for basic necessities, a retiree relying solely on this income has very little margin for emergencies. Data suggests that housing remains the largest hurdle; with average rents and property taxes climbing, a fixed income of roughly $2,000 a month barely covers shelter and basic insurance in most urban areas. This financial ceiling forces many to choose between essential medications and nutritional quality.In 2026, the gap between "average benefits" and a "living wage" is expected to widen, making Social Security a safety net that is stretched dangerously thin.Delaying your Social Security claim from age 67—the Full Retirement Age for those born in 1960 or later—to age 70 can materially strengthen retirement income in 2026. Each year you wait earns Delayed Retirement Credits worth 8%, adding up to a permanent 24% increase if you delay the full three years. That higher benefit becomes your new base for all future cost-of-living adjustments. Using the projected 2026 average benefit of $2,071 after the 2.8% COLA, the monthly check rises to

[TITLE]Stardust Power Secures Financing To Advance Oklahoma Lithium Refinery Toward Construction:
[TEXT]
GREENWICH, Conn., Dec. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stardust Power Inc. (NASDAQ: SDST) (“Stardust Power” or “the Company”), an American developer of battery-grade lithium carbonate, today announced it has executed a Securities Purchase Agreement with a single institutional investor providing for up to $15.0 million in senior secured convertible debt financing to support early-stage construction activities at its lithium refinery project in Muskogee, Oklahoma.

The facility includes an initial $4.0 million drawdown and provides the Company with flexible capital to advance detailed engineering, infrastructure, and procurement activities as it progresses toward construction. The financing has a 24-month term, includes an initial repayment moratorium, and provides the Company with the option to repay the facility in cash or common stock. The facility is intended to support near-term development activities and may serve as bridge financing as the Company advances toward project-level construction financing.

“This facility marks an important step as we prepare for construction and provides optionality and meaningful flexibility as we execute the next phase of the Muskogee project,” said Roshan Pujari, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Stardust Power. “We are building a robust capital stack with flexibility and shareholder value in mind and are focused on keeping our capital structure aligned with upcoming project milestones.”

The Company plans to fund construction of its 50,000 metric ton per annum refinery through a combination of asset-level equity and asset-level debt financing, designed to minimize public equity dilution and maximize shareholder value, with early stage investor engagement reflecting interest in the project’s shovel-ready status.

[TITLE]BMO Capital Sees Impressive Guidance and Construction Cloud Momentum at Autodesk (ADSK):
[TEXT]
Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) is one of the best growth stocks to buy in 2026. On November 26, BMO Capital raised the firm’s price target on Autodesk to $343 from $333 and kept a Market Perform rating on the shares. Despite a difficult sales environment, Autodesk delivered strong Q3 2025 results marked by improving growth and impressive Q4 guidance. BMO Capital remains optimistic due to the continued success of Construction Cloud and the company’s ongoing efforts to unify siloed workflows for its industrial and construction clients.

A day before this rating, the company announced its Q3 2025 earnings results. Autodesk reported non-GAAP EPS of $2.67, which exceeded analyst expectations of $2.50. Total revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $1.85 billion. This performance was supported by a $124 million contribution from the company’s new transaction model; excluding this impact and currency fluctuations, underlying revenue growth remained a healthy 12%.

BMO Capital Sees Impressive Guidance and Construction Cloud Momentum at Autodesk (ADSK)

Strategic momentum at Autodesk was driven by the convergence of design and make workflows within the Autodesk Construction Cloud/ACC and the integration of AI-powered automations. In the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations/AECO segment, revenue remained strong as investments in data centers and infrastructure offset softness in commercial sectors. Management highlighted that AI adoption is yielding tangible productivity gains, noting that the acceptance rate for AI-powered auto-constraints in Fusion has surpassed 60%, with 90% of those sketches becoming fully constrained.

Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) provides 3D design, engineering, and entertainment technology solutions worldwide.
