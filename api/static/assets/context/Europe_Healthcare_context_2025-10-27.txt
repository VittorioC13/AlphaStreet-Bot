German pharmaceutical giant Bayer plans to adopt a strong tiered pricing approach worldwide to make its drugs and therapies affordable. However, Stefan Oelrich , head of Bayer's pharmaceuticals division, in an interview with Vikas Dandekar and Teena Thacker underlined the need for returns on its investments for the risks it takes for research . Edited excerpts:I am in favour of rule-based trade around the world. Free trade has been the basis for an incredible creation of wealth for the entire world, independent of regions. On pharmaceuticals, an (US) investigation is ongoing when it comes to trade, and we'll have to see what the outcome is. There have been some trade deals between the EU and the US, given that we have a lot of reciprocal trade. That at least gives us some planning certainty, but the rest must be seen. It's a little bit in flux.Traditionally, we have been strong in cardiovascular and metabolic areas, so all of these are connected. We don't have a specific obesity pipeline project today, but that doesn't mean we're not interested in the overall connection of what's happening in terms of your immune system. In fact, obesity is ultimately an inflammatory process. We target other inflammatory processes, for example protecting the kidney, the heart, and all of this come together. So, reducing weight is one important factor, but not the only one. We are happy where we are. And in R&D, it's like a good sports game: you don't want all the kids on one ball; but you want them distributed along the field to score the most goals.Take our presence in India: more than 120 years, making us probably one of the oldest brands in the country. This holds true in many regions of the world. Investment into innovation goes where there's a good reception for it, and also some level of acceptance of returns on those innovations. Europe was traditionally the "pharmacy of the world." Then it shifted more to the US. Today we have more balance across regions, which now includes China.I would like to characterise it with three As: We need to accelerate, attract, and access. These words essentially sum up my agenda in this presidency. Europe needs to be attractive for investment, both in capital and in terms of people. Europe needs to be faster in approvals, faster in reducing bureaucracy and faster in creating better regulation. We need to accelerate and ultimately, it must ensure strong access to all citizens. One of the most important tasks that we have as innovators is that innovation translates into demand. These three together should make Europe competitive with any region in the world.I think time has never been better for breakthroughs than today in our industry. The increase in knowledge around biology, combined with digital advancements and chemistry, has never been better. Knowledge growth in our sector is almost second to none. In IT, we always talk

[TITLE]PMV Pharmaceuticals Announces Updated Rezatapopt Monotherapy Interim Data From Ongoing PYNNACLE Phase 2 Trial Across Multiple Solid Tumors With a TP53 Y220C Mutation:
[TEXT]
Data presented today as an oral presentation at 2025 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics

Confirmed responses observed in eight tumor types spanning ovarian, lung, breast, endometrial, head and neck, colorectal, gallbladder, and ampullary carcinoma

34% overall response rate (ORR) observed among 103 evaluable patients across all cohorts with a median duration of response of 7.6 months

46% ORR observed among 48 evaluable patients in ovarian cancer cohort with a median duration of response of 8.0 months

Rezatapopt New Drug Application submission for platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer planned in first quarter of 2027

PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PMV Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“PMV Pharma” or the “Company”; Nasdaq: PMVP), a precision oncology company pioneering the discovery and development of small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies targeting p53, today announced updated data from the Phase 2 pivotal portion of the ongoing PYNNACLE clinical trial. Results were presented today in an oral presentation by Alison M. Schram, M.D., Medical Oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and PYNNACLE Study Investigator, at the 2025 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics taking place in Boston, Massachusetts. The ongoing Phase 1/2 PYNNACLE clinical trial is evaluating rezatapopt in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation.

“Patients with TP53 Y220C-mutated advanced solid tumors are in need of better treatment options, particularly those with platinum-resistant and refractory ovarian cancer. The rezatapopt data presented today demonstrate very encouraging clinical activity, reinforcing the potential for rezatapopt to target the underlying biology of these cancers and providing a potential shift in the current treatment paradigm,” said Dr. Schram.

The Phase 2 clinical trial data below are summarized as of a September 4, 2025 data cutoff date:

The safety population consisted of 112 patients treated with at least one dose of rezatapopt 2000mg daily as monotherapy. Median number of prior lines of systemic therapy was three (range: 1-10)

The efficacy population consisted of 103 patients treated with at least one dose of rezatapopt as of the data cutoff date and either had ≥1 post-baseline tumor assessment or discontinued early.

Efficacy

Confirmed responses were observed in patients whose tumors were TP53 Y220C mutated and KRAS wild-type in eight tumor types including ovarian, lung, breast, endometrial, head and neck, colorectal, gallbladder cancers, and ampullary carcinoma.

Overall response rate (ORR) of 34% (35/103 patients) per investigator assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, including confirmed and unconfirmed responses.

The cohort-specific ORRs were as follows: Ovarian cancer: 46% ORR (22/48 patients, including one confirmed complete response, 18 confirmed partial responses, and three unconfirmed partial responses [uPR]) Breast cancer: 17% ORR (2/12 patients) Endometrial cancer: 60% ORR (3/5 patients, including one uPR) Lung cancer: 21% ORR (4/19 patients, including one uPR) Other solid tumors: 21% ORR (4/19 patients)

Across all cohorts, the median time to response was 1.3 months and the median duration of response was 7.6 months.

In the ovarian cancer cohort, the median time to response was 1.3 months and median duration of response was 8.0 months.

Post the September 4, 2025 data cutoff date, four uPRs were confirmed and one uPR (ovarian cancer) remains on treatment.

Safety

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were mostly Grade 1-2 with the most frequent TRAEs observed (>15%) being nausea, fatigue, blood creatinine increased, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased. The rates of individual Grade 3 TRAEs were ≤6%. All Grade 3 TRAEs resolved on treatment and there were no discontinuations due to Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT elevations.

Rezatapopt administration with food led to an improvement in gastrointestinal tolerability relative to Phase 1 data.

Lab abnormalities were manageable, with the majority of cases being transient and reversible.

The rate of drug discontinuations due to a TRAE was 3.6%.

“We are pleased to share these updated results from the pivotal portion of the ongoing PYNNACLE trial, which continue to enhance our understanding

[TITLE]OpenAI backs a new venture trying to thwart AI bio attacks:
[TEXT]
It’s a nightmare scenario: A terrorist without much training uses an artificial intelligence program to engineer a supervirus combining the incubation period of HIV, the contagiousness of measles and the mortality rate of smallpox. This is a worst-case outcome for the AI revolution, the Center for AI Safety wrote in a recent report. It’s also what’s keeping Kathleen McMahon up at night.McMahon is the cofounder and chief executive officer of Valthos , a New York-based biosecurity software startup building tools to defend against bioweapon attacks, which could be hastened by AI advancements. On Friday, the nine-person startup is officially emerging from stealth, with $30 million in funding from OpenAI Founders Fund and Lux Capital Valthos’s software pulls together biological data from commercial and government sources — such as air and wastewater monitoring — and then uses AI tools to identify emerging threats and characterise the risks. The company is also developing AI systems to update the designs of medical countermeasures for evolving threats, and plans to bring on partners like pharmaceutical companies for manufacturing and distribution.“The only way to deter an attack is to know when it’s happening, update countermeasures, and deploy them fast,” said McMahon, who was previously the longtime leader of Palantir Technologies Inc.’s life sciences division. McMahon started Valthos with Tess van Stekelenburg, a venture partner at Lux Capital with degrees in computational neuroscience and biology. Van Stekelenburg said that she’d been searching for a biodefense company to back for years before deciding to launch her own with McMahon.Defense tech has become a hot area for venture capital investing, as Silicon Valley investors plow billions into autonomous drones, advanced nuclear systems and other national security endeavors. But funding for biotech, a category that includes bioweapons defense, sank this year to its lowest point in more than a decade, according to data from researcher PitchBook.At the same time, advances in well-funded AI research has increased the stakes for biotech innovation. Earlier this year, the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology issued a report on the sector, calling for more investment. “There will be a ChatGPT moment for biotechnology,” the authors wrote, “and if China gets there first, no matter how fast we run, we will never catch up.”Large language model companies have said they’re performing their own risk assessments and working to build countermeasures to identify and prevent criminal use of their tech. OpenAI Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon, said Valthos is the first biosecurity investment that OpenAI has discussed making, though he suggested the company’s work in the area could increase.“There needs to be a system of countervailing technologies out there to make the system robust,” Kwon said. He added that OpenAI is “constantly evolving” safeguards to prevent the misuse of ChatGPT, and that effective biosecurity requires a large network of diverse stakeholders. “We have to build an ecosystem.”The federal government has recently cut funding for biodefense projects at the same time as the private sector has slowed its own spending — partly because biotech hasn’t always paid off for investors. “The question is whether this is the right amount of money and whether we can implement these solutions in the right way,” said Daniel Regan, a senior fellow at the Council on Strategic Risks who specializes in biosecurity. “It’s hard for these companies with private dollars to make it out of the investment valley of death and to find the pathway of success.”But AI and a greater focus on defense technology could be changing the calculus, and boosting companies like Valthos. Founders Fund Partner Delian Asparouhov has known van Stekelenburg since her firm Lux backed Varda Space Industries, the space manufacturing drug company he founded. He said backing Valthos wouldn’t have made sense, or even been possible a few years ago, but since then tech breakthroughs have increased the ability to create AI bioweapons along with the opportunity to prevent it.“Pre-2025 there were murmurs, but now it’s really come to the forefront,” Asparouhov said.Because the US government will be a primary customer for Valthos technology, CEO McMahon said that the startup will apply many of the same principles she learned at Palantir about working with officials as well as commercial customers. “We need to meet operators where they are,” she said.Lux Capital partner Brandon Reeves said there were few startups building tools in the biosecurity space, but predicts Valthos will be the first of many companies to focus on the sector. “We are in the early innings,” Reeves said. “We believe this should be on the same threat level as nuclear or cyber.”
