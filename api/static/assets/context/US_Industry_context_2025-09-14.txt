[TITLE]NKGen Biotech, Inc. Announces Completion of NKMax Co., Ltd. Acquisition; Gains Full Control of Global Manufacturing and Intellectual Property Assets:
[TEXT]
NKGen acquires controlling stake in NKMax, marking a pivotal moment in its transformation into a fully integrated, self-sustaining, cell therapy company with global manufacturing and IP control.

Approximately $16.9 million paid to acquire 65% equity stake in recapitalized debt-free NKMax, with NKMax operations now expected to be funded through 2026.

Funding provided by AlpineBrook Capital GP 1 Limited and NKGen CEO Dr. Paul Y. Song.

SANTA ANA, Calif., Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NKGen Biotech, Inc. (OTC: NKGN) (“NKGen” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative autologous and allogeneic natural killer (“NK”) cell therapeutics, today announced the successful completion of its acquisition of a majority equity stake in NKMax Co., Ltd. (“NKMax”), a Korean biotechnology company, out of bankruptcy. This acquisition marks a transformative step for NKGen, granting full control over key global manufacturing infrastructure, intellectual property (“IP”), and exclusive commercialization rights, while solidifying the Company’s position as an independent and vertically integrated leader in NK cell therapeutics.

This transaction is a culmination of a multi-year journey that has seen NKGen overcome significant challenges, emerge stronger, and continue its unwavering commitment to advancing groundbreaking cell therapies. Originally founded as a subsidiary of NKMax in 2017, NKGen has long benefited from its parent’s financial backing to drive the development of its innovative NK cell therapy platform. In October 2023, NKGen made the pivotal decision to go public in the U.S., securing a $25 million backstop commitment from NKMax to fund clinical development of NKGen’s flagship Alzheimer’s treatment. However, NKMax ultimately provided only $10 million of the $25 million backstop initially committed, marking the start of financial challenges for NKGen.

There were several unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances which led to the suspension of trading of NKMax shares on the KOSDAQ Korean Stock Exchange, and NKMax’s subsequent collapse into bankruptcy in 2024. This created significant financial challenges and uncertainty for NKGen which negatively impacted its own stock, ability to raise funds and eventual delisting from Nasdaq. In response to these challenges, NKGen’s leadership acted swiftly, with the support of AlpineBrook Capital GP 1 Limited (“AlpineBrook”), which recognized the potential of the combined companies. AlpineBrook provided the majority of the $17 million funding to NKGen for the purchase of NKMax shares. The entirety of the funding for the NKMax shares was provided by AlpineBrook and NKGen CEO Dr. Paul Y. Song, with terms to be finalized and disclosed in due course. This strategic partnership and infusion of capital are a testament to AlpineBrook’s confidence in the long-term growth and success of NKGen, now poised to leverage its newly acquired assets to drive future commercialization.

“This is more than an acquisition, it’s a turning point in our company’s history,” said Paul Y. Song, M.D., Chairman and CEO of NKGen. “The past couple of years have been incredibly challenging, but we had an unwavering belief in the science behind our therapy and its true potential to change lives. This belief drove each of us, at every level of the company, to make sacrifices, stay committed, and keep building even though our future was very uncertain. With the support of AlpineBrook, who recognized our dedication and scientific promise, we have been blessed with the chance to now fully integrate NKMax’s capabilities and expertise into NKGen while taking full control of all IP and global distribution rights. We believe removing the uncertainty of the parent company overhang has also begun to generate renewed interest from U.S. and international investors alike and will allow us to enter a new era of opportunity and long-term growth. We believe the acquisition of NKMax will also allow us to rapidly expand and forge partnerships throughout Asia and the Middle East.”

Dr. Song continued, “I am incredibly optimistic

[TITLE]Will big investment promises bring back US manufacturing?:
[TEXT]
Listen to the article 10 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Many Fortune 500 companies have announced multibillion-dollar investments since Trump took office in January, but time will tell whether the administration’s policies are truly supporting domestic manufacturing.

Some of these multibillion-dollar pledges come from prominent manufacturing companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple and AstraZeneca, promising to establish or expand operations in the United States.

The White House has taken credit for these announced commitments, calling it the “Trump Effect.” The Trump administration claims that its tariff policies “have generated significant investment,” leading to “incentivizing manufacturing,” according to a Sept. 5 White House fact sheet.

However, some of these investments have either already been announced or have been in the works since the Biden administration, The Wall Street Journal reported in July. For example, defense startup Anduril Industries raised $1.5 billion in a series F funding round in August 2024 to scale autonomous weapon system manufacturing. Fast forward to Jan. 16, four days before Trump’s inauguration, and Anduril announced it chose Ohio to build its $1 billion manufacturing facility.

Another company on Trump’s credit list, recycled paper and packaging company Pratt Industries, pledged a $5 billion commitment to “reindustrialize America.” However, the company committed to the multibillion-dollar investment in November 2022.

While these investments — new or old — aim to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and create thousands of jobs, it remains to be seen how long it will take for these commitments to come to fruition. Many of Trump’s tariffs have gone into effect, with more to be negotiated.

Additionally, Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” into law, which allows bonus depreciation for qualifying equipment and offers research and development deductions.

Different sectors, big gambles

Whether the most recent investments and high-fee tariffs are bringing back manufacturing depends on the industry, experts said.

“From the time a company decides to build a new factory, and the time it’s open, it could be three to five years, and the policies could be completely changed,” said Susan Spence, chair of the Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Business Survey Committee.

Changes may come to the tariffs already in place. Last month, a federal appeals court ruled that Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose broad tariffs was illegal, but delayed any action until mid-October in anticipation of a Supreme Court review. The Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to an expedited hearing on the legality of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners.

On a micro-industry level, it also depends on factors such as competition within sectors like semiconductors, said Brian Albrecht, chief economist at the International Center for Law and Economics.

“There's even a difference between what Texas Instruments is doing and what TSMC is doing,” Albrecht said. While large investments such as Texas Instruments’ $60 billion investment are always a big gamble, it’s too early to tell how successful it will be. In Texas Instruments’ case, it holds 15% of the global analog chips market share, according to AInvest.

A company like TSMC, for example, has mastered what it’s doing in Taiwan, Albrecht added. In March, TSMC announced it was adding $100 billion to the previously pledged $65 billion investment to expand its manufacturing footprint in Arizona.

TSMC dominates the semiconductor sector, holding 70.2% of the world’s market share per a Sept. 1 report from market research firm Trend Force. However, it’s still a gamble for TSMC to go outside of Taiwan and replicate that success in the U.S. as it could encounter supply chain risks such as natural disasters and a volatile geopolitical climate.

“That’s one of the reasons that you have things like the CHIPS [and Science] Act and other investment incentives to try to encourage this, especially domestically,” Albrecht said.

TSMC finalized $6.6 billion in CHIPS Act funding in November 2024 and Texas Instruments finalized $1.6 billion the following month.

Still, if it were a completely bad idea, even with or without incentives like the CHIPS Act, TSMC would have never taken the chance.

“But it's obviously not a guarantee. Otherwise, everyone would be trying to do it,” Albrecht said.

‘People stay still’

Since March, Trump has announced and implemented tariffs on several global trade partners and various sectors.

Duties on imports from Mexico and Canada have been delayed for the second time. While semiconductors and related products are exempt from reciprocal tariffs, the Trump administration in April initiated a Section 232 investigation into semiconductor imports. Trump said last month he would be imposing 100% tariffs on semiconductors but has not yet set a date on when the levies will be put into action.

The word “whiplash” is often used in ISM surveys, Spence said.

“There’s uncertainty. People stay still. They don't invest,” Spence said. “They don't hire if they can possibly get away with holding on, because if they're gonna have to take a [loss], then they want to look at their other controllable costs, and labor is a big one, right? So I don't see that going away until the certainty happens.”

Spence said she doesn’t think things will pay off if manufacturers are not confident in what the economic policies are going to be, if they’re going to stick.

“The other question is, when tariffs finally do get settled and get into play, is it a one-time hit or not? There are more questions than answers,” she said.

Colin Grabow, associate director at the Cato Institute’s Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, said at a Brookings Institution panel in July that the current tariff “is entirely antithetical to a vibrant manufacturing sector,” as it’s far removed from “manufacturing in the 21st century.”

“I suppose that some of the logic that animates the Trump administration’s approach is that it's pretty straightforward,” Grabow said. “You put tariffs on foreign goods, put them at a competitive disadvantage, that creates space for American manufacturers to fill that void.”

Adam Hersh, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said at the same Brookings Institution panel that Trump’s tariff actions and his “One Big Beautiful Bill” will not fix any of manufacturing’s problems, such as regulation costs and investing in human capital.

He added that businesses do not invest because capital costs are low, but rather, they invest where there’s a demand for the product.

“Just lowering the cost of capital is not going to do anything to stimulate investment in manufacturing, particularly when the policies of this administration have created so much economic uncertainty, as well as undermining the consumptive power,” Hersh said.

Moreover, Hersh said tariffs can be and have been used as an important tool to support manufacturing and industrial development, but that the levies “have to be done right” in a way that supports key industries and not impact “downstream industries.”

The ongoing need for raw materials and components imports

Although companies — foreign and domestic — are establishing and expanding operations and pivoting their supply chain to the U.S., manufacturers still rely on access to global markets for raw materials, components and parts to sustain their operations.

Companies that have operations scattered across the world benefit from each location’s “comparative advantage to efficiently produce and manufacture,” Grabow said.

“So when you increase tariffs, you are raising the cost of these vital inputs for American manufacturers and putting them on the back foot,” Grabow added.

A 2022 Commerce Department report found that U.S. manufacturers sourced 69% of their intermediate inputs from domestic suppliers, while nearly one-third of intermediate inputs were imported. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative reported that approximately 94% of U.S. merchandise imports by value are industrial goods.

For example, Apple announced a commitment to invest an additional $100 billion to the previously announced $500 billion, which will fund expansions across 10 states.

While a lot of the components for Apple’s products will be made in the U.S., final assembly will still be completed “elsewhere for a while,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at a White House event.

Cook has explained in the past why much of Apple’s production is done overseas, particularly in China, stating that the quantity and certain skills are necessary to manufacture its products.

“Much was made and discussed

[TITLE]Tim Cook details how Apple will put its $600 billion domestic manufacturing investment to work:
[TEXT]
In an interview Friday with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Apple CEO Tim Cook discussed the Phone maker's plans to follow through with its enormous investment in domestic manufacturing, emphasizing semiconductor production in the U.S.

"You can add a lot by making it global and then stitching together the end-to-end supply chain in semiconductors," Cook said. "I can't stress how important this is and how much that will add to what we're doing."

In total, Apple has said it will spend $600 billion on manufacturing in the U.S. over the next four years, including a $2.5 billion expansion of its partnership with Corning , which makes glass for iPhones and Apple Watches at its factory in Kentucky. Apple also said it would work with a number of different companies to grow domestic semiconductor production, including Taiwan Semiconductor , Texas Instruments and Applied Materials .

According to Cook, Apple already does "business with 9,000 different partners across the U.S." and "is in all 50 states with these suppliers," adding that this work has created 450,000 jobs. Cook said the tech giant is "very proud to be expanding that further this year to the $600 billion level."

Apple is taking steps to train more manufacturing workers, Cook said, mentioning that the company opened its own "Manufacturing Academy" in Detroit last month. According to a

[TITLE]Skechers Is Officially a Private Company After $9 Billion Deal With 3G Capital Closes:
[TEXT]
Skechers U.S.A., Inc. is now a private company.

On Friday, the Fortune 500 company and the third largest footwear company in the world announced the completion of the go-private acquisition by 3G Capital.

In May, Skechers announced a $9 billion go-private deal with Brazilian private-equity firm 3G Capital — the biggest shoe buyout in history.

The deal structure has one election at $63 a share and the other at $57 a share in cash and one unlisted, non-transferable equity unit in a newly formed entity that will become the parent of Skechers upon the closing of the transaction.

The blockbuster move is a reflection of the business prowess of Robert and Michael Greenberg, the father-son duo that has taken the company from family start-up to global powerhouse during the past three decades.

As a result of the completion of the transaction, Skechers’ shares will no longer trade on the NYSE with the ticker symbol “SKX” as of Sept. 12.

The company will continue to be led by its executive management team, including chief executive officer Robert Greenberg and president Michael Greenberg.

On Aug. 28, the transaction, first disclosed on May 5, received the clearance to proceed with the closing following all regulatory approvals required to complete the deal were marked complete.

3G Capital is a Brazilian private-equity firm founded in 2004 by Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Herrmann Telles. It includes in its portfolio consumer brands Kraft Heinz, Burger King, Tim Horton and Hunter Douglas. The private equity firm’s playbook includes boosting margins through cost-cutting and efficiencies. TD Cowen retail analyst John Kernan expects that Skechers won’t remain private for long. He believes Skechers will become “public again in the distant future,” the analyst said at the time the deal was announced.

Last month, the shoe firm reported net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 of $2.44 billion, a 13.1 percent increase from $2.16 billion the same time last year. These results beat analyst expectations, which called for net sales between $2.3 billion and $2.38 billion in Q2, according to Yahoo Finance.

Skechers noted that the second quarter’s net sales include a favorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rates of $33.9 million. The company also said that its wholesale sales grew 15.0 percent in Q2, while its direct-to-consumer sales increased 11.0 percent in the period.

[TITLE]How Student Loans Became America’s Financial Catastrophe:
[TEXT]
Yves here. Student loans are one of those background issues, like stagnating/falling lifespans, that we highlight occasionally and wish we could focus on more but suffer from being on the receiving end of an informational firehose. The same way debt-financed housing has made homes increasingly unaffordable, so to have student loans turbo-charged the increase in college costs and created a largely parasitic adminisphere. And of course, there’s a political issue, in that university staffers overwhelmingly vote Democrat, feeding right-wing antipathy to higher education on political as well as ideological grounds.

Another not-sufficiently acknowledged abuse is that financially unsophisticated students are regularly, if not pervasively, given unrealistic information

[TITLE]UAW workers reach tentative deal with GE Aerospace at Ohio, Kentucky plants:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) - Members of the United Auto Workers union at GE Aerospace's Evendale, Ohio, and Erlanger, Kentucky, facilities have reached a tentative agreement with the company, the union said on Friday.

Workers secured victories on all fronts - job security, health care costs, and time off, the UAW said in a statement on Saturday. It said GE will cover nearly all health care premium increases over the term of the contract and workers will receive additional vacation time.

The tentative agreement covers a five-year term and secures strong job security protections for both Erlanger and Evendale locations, including minimum headcount and new work, the statement said.

On Friday, the UAW said in an X post that members will vote on ratification on September 19. Until then, all picket lines will continue.

"We are pleased to have reached a tentative agreement with the UAW covering employees at our Evendale and Erlanger facilities and we look forward to continuing to work side-by-side to serve our customers," a GE Aerospace spokesperson said in response to a Reuters query.

In late August, over 600 workers from the union went on strike after failing to reach a new contract agreement with the company.

The strike marked the latest flashpoint in a broader wave of labor actions across the aerospace and aviation industries, where unions have sought to leverage demand for skilled workers into better contracts.

Pilots, flight attendants, machinists and engineers have all pushed for higher pay and tougher job protections in recent years.

GE's Evendale plant builds marine and industrial engines for the U.S. Navy, while the Erlanger facility supplies parts to some of the company's engine plants.
