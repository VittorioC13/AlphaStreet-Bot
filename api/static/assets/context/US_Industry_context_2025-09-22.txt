[TITLE]Barfresh Enters into Stock Purchase Agreement for Strategic Acquisition of Manufacturing Company: Arps Dairy:
[TEXT]
Company Increases Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue Guidance to Range of $14.5 million to $15.5 million

Company Issues Preliminary Fiscal Year 2026 Pro Forma Revenue Guidance of $30 million to $35 Million; a 126% increase compared to the high range of fiscal 2025 guidance

Acquisition Dramatically Increases Bottling Production Capacity and is Expected to be Accretive to Earnings in Fiscal 2026

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barfresh Food Group Inc. (the “Company” or “Barfresh”) (Nasdaq: BRFH), a provider of frozen, ready-to-blend and ready-to-drink beverages, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding capital stock of Arps Dairy, Inc., an Ohio-based dairy processing company, for approximately $1.6 million in debt repayment, which the company was able to do by increasing its line of credit. The strategic acquisition positions Barfresh to significantly enhance its manufacturing capabilities while reducing operational costs and improving margins. The acquisition includes Arps Dairy's existing processing facility in Defiance, Ohio, consisting of 15,000 square-feet as well as an almost completely constructed 44,000-square-foot state-of-the-art manufacturing facility that Barfresh plans to complete construction and install processing equipment during 2026, creating a modern production hub that will serve as a cornerstone of the Company's expanded manufacturing strategy. In addition, Arps Dairy has been preliminarily approved for a $2.3 million government grant to be used towards finalizing the construction and equipment installation of the additional 44,000 square-foot facility.

Riccardo Delle Coste, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, "This manufacturing transaction represents a transformational step in our operational evolution and growth trajectory. By bringing the majority of our manufacturing in-house, we’re eliminating third-party manufacturing fees, reducing freight costs, and gaining greater control over our supply chain while positioning ourselves for accelerated growth and expanded market opportunities. The manufacturing facility acquisition provides us with the operational foundation and cost efficiencies necessary to scale our business profitably. The synergy of this acquisition will attract production opportunities and position us to capture significant value creation opportunities in 2026 and beyond, while delivering enhanced returns to our shareholders through improved operational efficiency and expanded market reach."

Barfresh is purchasing Arps at a discount to the projected completion value of its net assets, in addition to the benefit of an expected $2.3 million government grant, and has already commenced manufacturing certain products at Arps Dairy’s existing facility and expects to expand production immediately upon closing of agreement. This acquisition delivers multiple operational advantages including elimination of third-party manufacturing fees, more efficient ingredient procurement and reduced freight costs, lower cold storage costs through integrated operations, and enhanced oversight of production processes. Based on the expected operational benefits from the manufacturing capacity expansion and new market expansion opportunities enabled by the Arps acquisition, Barfresh is raising its fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance to $14.5 million to $15.5 million, representing an increase from the previous guidance range of $12.5 million to $14.0 million. The Company is also providing preliminary fiscal year 2026 revenue guidance of $30 million to $35 million, reflecting the full-year impact of the enhanced manufacturing capabilities, operational synergies and expanded market reach from the increased production capacity.

The acquisition is structured as a stock purchase for approximately $1.6 million, representing the repayment of certain existing Arps Dairy debt, including an asset-based revolving facility, with closing subject to customary conditions.

Barfresh expects the transaction to close by October 1, 2025.

[TITLE]Construction Spending Strategic Business Report 2025: Market to Reach $5 Trillion by 2030 - Growth in Public-Private Partnerships Spurs Investment in Large-Scale Projects:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Construction Spending - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Construction Spending was estimated at US$4.0 Trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$5.0 Trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.5% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Construction spending refers to the total expenditure on construction projects over a specific period. It encompasses a broad range of activities, from residential and commercial building to infrastructure development such as roads, bridges, and utilities. This measure is an important economic indicator, reflecting both public and private sector investment in building and infrastructure works. The figures are closely monitored by economists, investors, and policymakers because they provide insights into the health of the construction industry, which is a significant component of gross domestic product (GDP) and directly correlates with the overall economic health of a country.

In recent years, the landscape of construction spending has been shaped by a variety of trends and shifts in both residential and commercial sectors. Residential construction has seen a notable upswing driven by low interest rates, increasing demand for housing, and an evolving preference for suburban and rural homes - a trend accelerated by the global shift towards remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the commercial front, there has been a significant transformation with increased investments in industrial facilities, especially those related to e-commerce and logistics. Conversely, the office and retail construction sectors have faced declines, as businesses reevaluate their space needs in response to increasing online shopping and ongoing adjustments to where and how people work.

The growth in the construction spending market is driven by several factors, including technological advancements in building materials and construction methods. The adoption of green building practices, aimed at reducing carbon footprints and enhancing energy efficiency, has spurred new projects that adhere to stricter environmental regulations. Furthermore, government fiscal policies, particularly public spending on infrastructure projects, significantly influence construction spending.

Economic recovery packages, often including substantial allocations for infrastructure, can lead to surges in sector activity. Consumer behavior, particularly the increased demand for customized and luxury residential properties, also plays a critical role in driving construction spending. These multifaceted growth drivers ensure that the construction industry remains robust and capable of adapting to evolving economic and environmental landscapes.

[TITLE]GE Aerospace reaches five-year labor deal with 600 striking UAW workers:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) - GE Aerospace reached a five-year labor agreement with more than 600 striking workers of the United Auto Workers union at its Ohio and Kentucky distribution facilities, the aircraft engine supplier said on Friday.

The agreement ends a three-week strike at GE Aerospace's Evendale plant in Ohio that produces marine and industrial engines for the U.S. Navy and its Erlanger facility in Kentucky that supplies parts to some of the company's engine plants.

The tentative deal outlined by the union includes a base wage increase ranging from 3% to 5% through 2029, along with about $3,500 in cash payments per employee to help offset rising healthcare costs.

"With these contracts in place, we look forward to our UAW-represented employees returning to work and resuming normal operations," said Christian Meisner, chief human resources officer at GE Aerospace.
