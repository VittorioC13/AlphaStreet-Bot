One key to this strategy might be an idea floated by Japan's government to buy a fleet of American Ford F-150trucks.Trump spent Sunday in Malaysia as part of his ongoing trip through Asia to discuss mostly trade with world leaders, aiming to highlight America's influence on the global economy.Trump says Takaichi as Japan's first female prime minister is 'a big deal'The president offered especially effusive praise to Takaichi, telling her, "Anything I can do to help Japan, we will be there.""You're going to do a fantastic job, and we're going to have a fantastic relationship," he said.Trump also hailed Takaichi being the first woman to hold the post, saying, "That's a big deal," before adding, "You will be one of the great prime ministers."The president told Takaichi that his offer to support Japan in all situations extended to any "favors you need."Takaichi mentions her mentor's bond with TrumpTakaichi used her early remarks to mention former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, her archconservative mentor who forged a strong bond with Trump during the U.S. president's first term."As a matter of fact, Prime Minister Abe often told me

[TITLE]China asks U.S. to protect ‘hard-won’ results before Xi-Trump meeting:
[TEXT]
The Chinese Communist Party’s official mouthpiece called on the world’s biggest economies to “jointly safeguard hard-won achievements” from their latest trade talks, ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.

Trade negotiators from China and the U.S. announced Sunday that they’d struck a slew of agreements on issues spanning tariffs, shipping fees, fentanyl and export controls over two days in Malaysia. That marked a significant cooling of tensions, after a recent volley of tariff threats and fresh export curbs threatened to derail the bilateral relationship.

Striking a conciliatory tone, the People’s Daily said Monday the progress showed Beijing and Washington were capable of handling their differences. “Neither side was blindsided by these issues, instead they focused on solving the problems,” according to the commentary penned by Zhong Sheng, a Chinese homonym for “Voice of China” that’s often used to set out Beijing’s foreign policy views.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose as much as 1.3% on Monday, while the broader MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index advanced 1.5% to a new intraday record. China’s 10-year government bond yields edged up, as demand for safety assets ebbed following the positive results of trade talks.

Xi and Trump are expected to sign off on the terms this week in South Korea when they sit down in person for the first time since the U.S. president returned to power. That meeting could reveal details around issues such as China’s purchases of U.S. soybeans, Washington’s plans for shipping fees on Chinese vessels and Beijing’s rare earth export controls.

“We expect the leaders to approve the deal, but whether it will bring lasting relief to markets is less clear—the new reality for U.S.-China ties appears to be one of frequent ruptures and short-term fixes,” Chang Shu, David Qu and Jennifer Welch of Bloomberg Economics wrote in a note.

From Beijing’s perspective, fewer external uncertainties will buy policymakers’ time to focus on supporting the domestic economy and enhancing its tech sufficiency, they added. While Chinese industrial companies saw their earnings surge the most in nearly two years last month, the job market remains gloomy and a years long housing crash is lingering.

The People’s Daily commentary called on the U.S. to stick to the trade and economic consultation mechanism led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Export curbs announced by U.S. officials outside that framework have derailed the system several times in recent months, prompting Beijing to jam its rare earth supply chain that’s critical to American manufacturing.

Bessent said he believed China would delay its latest rare-earth restrictions “for a year while they reexamine it” after the latest talks. It had been unclear how Beijing would enforce its proposed curbs asserting control over any global shipment containing even a trace of certain rare metals from China, a move that had sparked outcry in Europe, too.

Another potential area for a quick win is the 20% fentanyl tariff the U.S. has imposed on Beijing to pressure authorities into halting the flow of precursor chemicals used to make the deadly drug. Relief on that levy—which stacks on top of Liberation Day tariffs—could be a boon for the Asian nation at a time when domestic demand is weak.

China and the U.S. have held five rounds of talks since Trump unveiled the highest U.S. tariffs since the 1930s in April, which ended with Chinese exports to America facing a 55% levy. The People’s Daily piece said those talks were proof that neither nation wanted to decouple.

“The two sides should meet each other halfway, cherish outcomes of every dialogue and continuously build mutual trust and manage differences,” the publication said.

Despite the latest dovish language from both sides, global investors are learning to embrace the new normal of “tension, escalation and truce,” Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. wrote in a Monday note.

“It’s good for the world’s top two largest economies to dial down tensions,” he added, “but we believe the superpower rivalry will likely escalate in the future.”

[TITLE]In a world of crypto and ‘exotic instruments’, traditional exchanges are thinking about how they ‘stay relevant’:
[TEXT]
Good morning, Asia editor Nick Gordon, filling in for Allie Garfinkle.

Fortune just wrapped up its Global Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The agenda featured several financial sector luminaries: Barclays CEO C. S. Venkatakrishnan, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, DBS CEO Tan Su Shan and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio.

I had to enjoy the Forum remotely this year due to another mega-event (the APEC CEO Summit in South Korea). But I made sure to tune in to Monday’s mainstage session with Eng. Khalid Abdullah Al Hussan, CEO of the Saudi Tadawul Group; Bonnie Chan, CEO of HKEX; and Bob McCooey, vice chair of Nasdaq.

After a couple of down years, blockbuster IPOs have come back this year. The U.S. was home to two of the year’s biggest listings: CoreWeave on the Nasdaq and Figma on the NYSE, which raised $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion respectively. Hong Kong’s listings are dwarfing those in the U.S.: battery maker CATL’s secondary listing in the Chinese city is still the year’s largest IPO, raising $5.5 billion back in May.

The global competition for IPOs can seem cutthroat at times, as exchanges pitch friendly regulations, investor knowledge, and deeper pools of capital to win listings from their competitors.

But Nasdaq’s McCooey on Monday claimed that he spent a lot of time suggesting that executives look at home first, before looking abroad.

“I believe that most companies belong in their local markets. I firmly do,” he said. “I don’t go to Hong Kong, China, Tokyo, Singapore, Argentina, and try to convince companies not to list in their local markets, because most companies do belong there.” (Lest one think McCooey was being too charitable, he also said Nasdaq has “the strongest value proposition” for those companies that do decide to list overseas.)

Exchanges aren’t just competing against each other anymore. “The pace of change–on the alternative platforms, on the sophistication of investors–it’s unheard of,” Al Hussan, from Tadawul, said. “I have been in this business for the last 18, 19 years. You wake up every morning, there’s a new channel, there’s a new way of doing things, there’s a new requirement.”

Chan, from HKEX, agreed, noting that budding investors have a lot more options, like cryptocurrency, commodities and other “exotic instruments.”

“We’re entering into a stage where exchanges are not really competing with one another,” she said. “We’re working together with one another to make sure that we all stay relevant.”

Still, Chan can certainly feel secure

[TITLE]HSBC third-quarter profit slides on Madoff charges:
[TEXT]
HSBC Holdings has today reported a 14% decline in third-quarter pretax profit, hurt by a $1.1 billion charge after losing part of an appeal in a lawsuit tied to Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, history's biggest-ever such fraud.

But the bank also upgraded its income forecast for the year, reflecting the view that rate cuts in key markets such as Hong Kong and Britain will be slower than initially thought.

It now expects to make $43 billion in net interest income in 2025, up from a forecast of around $42 billion in June.

"The intent with which we are executing our strategy is reflected in our performance this quarter, despite taking legal provisions related to historical matters," chief executive Georges Elhedery said in a statement.

HSBC posted a pretax profit of $7.3 billion for the third quarter. Before the surprise news of the provision, expectations were for a pretax profit of $7.66 billion, according to a consensus estimate from analysts compiled by the bank.

In addition to the Madoff provision, the bank also logged an additional $300m in legal charges relating to historical trading activities in HSBC Bank plc.

The bank also lifted its return on equity target to the mid-teens or better, from an earlier estimate of mid-teens.

That said, the results show how Elhedery's drive to improve profit continues to be hampered by major litigation, ongoing restructuring, and property sector-related charges.

HSBC has booked $5 billion in writedowns on its China bank holding over the last few quarters and losses from deteriorating Hong Kong commercial real estate loans have climbed.

The worsening commercial real estate market in Hong Kong has prompted HSBC to upgrade its credit loss model, it said in the statement.

In the first nine months of this year, it logged an increase of $900m in charges for non-performing loans compared to the same period last year, with two-thirds of that amount arising from exposure to Hong Kong property.

The losses reflected "higher allowances for new defaulted exposures, the impact of an over-supply of non-residential properties that has put continued downward pressure on rental and capital values", HSBC said.

A career HSBC insider, Elhedery has shaken up the bank since assuming the chief executive role a year ago by reorganising operating divisions along East-West lines, shedding sub-scale investment banking units and slashing the ranks of senior managers.

As well as announcing exits from 11 underperforming markets and businesses so far this year, Elhedery has signalled a willingness to invest where he thinks the bank can further grow.

HSBC, which has a market value of $226 billion, announced in October it has offered $13.6 billion to buy out other shareholders in its majority-owned Hang Seng Bank, a Hong Kong lender hit hard by its local property exposure.

It has decided to pause share buybacks for about three quarters to build up the capital required for the deal.

The bank said it would pay an interim dividend of 10 cents a share - its third payment in 2025 following a total of 20 cents announced earlier.

HSBC to take $1.1 billion hit after Luxembourg court ruling in Madoff case

HSBC Holdings said yesterday it would book a $1.1 billion provision in its third-quarter results after losing part of an appeal in a long-running lawsuit tied to Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, history's biggest ever such fraud.

HSBC acted as a service provider to several funds that invested with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. Herald Fund SPC sued HSBC's Luxembourg unit in 2009 seeking restitution of assets it said were lost in the fraud.

Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme was the biggest-ever such fraud

Last Friday, the Luxembourg Court of Cassation rejected an appeal by HSBC's unit over the restitution of securities claimed by Herald, although it accepted its appeal on a separate cash restitution claim, the bank said.

Herald had alleged that HSBC failed in its duties as a custodian to protect it from the fraud, previous court documents from the case show.

HSBC now plans to lodge a second appeal with the Luxembourg Court of Appeal and, if unsuccessful, the bank said it would contest the amount to be paid.

It added that the eventual financial impact could differ significantly from its current estimate.

Europe's largest bank by assets said in July that Herald, which is in liquidation, was seeking the restitution of securities and cash worth $2.5 billion plus interest or damages of $5.6 billion plus interest.

The bank estimated that the provision would have an impact of around 15 basis points (or 0.15 of a percentage point) on its common equity tier 1 capital ratio, meaning little lasting impact on the key measure of financial strength, which stands at 14.6%.

That would come on top of a 125 basis points impact arising from its $13.6 billion deal to take its majority-owned Hong Kong unit Hang Seng Bank private.

The charge could weigh on sentiment slightly but the impact should be limited as HSBC has already suspended share buybacks for the next three quarters due to the acquisition of Hang Seng Bank, said Lorraine Tan, director of equity research (Asia) for Morningstar.

Madoff's fraud was estimated as much as $64.8 billion, making it the biggest-ever Ponzi scheme, a kind of fraud whereby old investors are paid off with funds from newer ones while the organiser siphons off some of the money for themselves.

It went undiscovered for years until Madoff confessed to his sons in December 2008, one day after his firm's Christmas party. Madoff eventually pleaded guilty to 11 criminal counts. He died aged 82 in April 2021 while serving a 150-year prison sentence.

HSBC in 2012 settled with Kalix Fund for an undisclosed amount, also over losses the fund had suffered during the collapse of Madoff's financial empire. The fund had sued the bank for $35.6m.

[TITLE]HSBC to take $1.1 billion hit after Luxembourg court ruling in Madoff case:
[TEXT]
By Rishav Chatterjee, Selena Li and Lawrence White

LONDON (Reuters) -HSBC Holdings said on Monday it would book a $1.1 billion provision in its third-quarter results after losing part of an appeal in a long-running lawsuit tied to Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, history's biggest ever such fraud.

HSBC acted as a service provider to several funds that invested with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Herald Fund SPC sued HSBC's Luxembourg unit in 2009 seeking restitution of assets it said were lost in the fraud.

Last Friday, the Luxembourg Court of Cassation rejected an appeal by HSBC's unit over the restitution of securities claimed by Herald, although it accepted its appeal on a separate cash restitution claim, the bank said.

Herald had alleged that HSBC failed in its duties as a custodian to protect it from the fraud, previous court documents from the case show.

HSBC PLANS TO APPEAL FURTHER

The adverse ruling for HSBC dragged its shares down 1%, threatened to mar its quarterly earnings due on Tuesday, and showed how banks are still vulnerable to long-running litigation, often tied to the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis.

HSBC now plans to lodge a second appeal with the Luxembourg Court of Appeal and, if unsuccessful, the bank said it would contest the amount to be paid.

It added that the eventual financial impact could differ significantly from its current estimate.

Europe's largest bank by assets said in July that Herald, which is in liquidation, was seeking the restitution of securities and cash worth $2.5 billion plus interest or damages of $5.6 billion plus interest.

HSBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the separate securities and cash amounts that Herald is seeking. The principal liquidators of Herald also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bank estimated that the provision would have an impact of around 15 basis points (or 0.15 of a percentage point) on its common equity tier 1 capital ratio, meaning little lasting impact on the key measure of financial strength, which stands at 14.6%.

That would come on top of a 125 basis points impact arising from its $13.6 billion deal to take its majority-owned Hong Kong unit Hang Seng Bank private.

FALLOUT LINGERS FROM HISTORY'S BIGGEST EVER FRAUD

The charge could weigh on sentiment slightly but the impact should be limited as HSBC has already suspended share buybacks for the next three quarters due to the acquisition of Hang Seng Bank, said Lorraine Tan, director of equity research (Asia) for Morningstar.
