Walmart is betting big on its membership program. Nearly five years into its Walmart+ program, the retail giant has quietly built one of the most wide-ranging membership packages in the market — keeping the price flat at $98 a year (or $12.95/month) while stacking on benefits that extend well beyond grocery aisles.

The headline draw remains free delivery from local stores on orders over $35 , a service that has become a lifeline for shoppers looking to cut down on errands. In addition to fresh produce, members can get same-day drop-offs on everything from kitchen gadgets to vitamins and electronics, with no delivery fee attached. Walmart+ also touts free shipping on Walmart.com purchases, with no order minimums and two-day or next-day arrival on thousands of items.

But what sets the membership apart in today’s streaming-heavy, perk-laden economy is how far the benefits now reach outside of retail. As part of their membership, members can choose between Peacock Premium or Paramount+ Essential at no added cost. And at the pump, Walmart+ unlocks 10¢-per-gallon savings at Exxon, Mobil, Walmart and Murphy stations, along with member pricing at Sam’s Club. Even Burger King® is part of the mix, with exclusive savings built into the app for members on the go.

The growing roster of add-ons positions Walmart+ as more than a shopping tool; it’s a lifestyle subscription designed to compete with broad, all-in-one memberships as well as niche, sector-specific ones. By tying together grocery delivery, streaming, fuel savings and dining benefits, Walmart is betting that convenience across categories can deepen loyalty and drive frequency.

For consumers, the appeal lies in how the savings stack up. A choice of streaming subscriptions along with regular fuel purchases and free delivery easily justifies the $98 annual fee. As other platforms raise prices, Walmart’s pitch is that it hasn’t — instead, the company has quietly padded the offering without tacking on extra cost.

[TEXT]
Five Below announced in October 2025 that it has entered the Pacific Northwest for the first time, opening eight new stores across Washington and Oregon as of November 7, 2025, with locations spanning both malls and neighborhood shopping centers.

This move provides access to an entirely new regional market and comes just ahead of the critical holiday shopping season, suggesting Five Below is intent on accelerating national expansion and brand recognition.

We’ll explore how Five Below’s entry into the Pacific Northwest with multiple store openings could shape its growth and long-term investment outlook.

We've found 17 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.

Five Below Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Five Below, you have to believe the company's steady expansion into untapped markets, such as the Pacific Northwest, will continue to drive store traffic and broaden its addressable market, especially as value-focused shopping habits persist. While the recent news of eight new store openings aligns with its aggressive growth strategy and comes at a crucial time ahead of the holidays, it does little to change the company's biggest short term catalyst: sustained comp sales momentum. The primary risk remains margin pressure from import tariffs, which could limit net earnings if costs escalate further.

Among recent announcements, the appointment of Daniel Sullivan as Chief Financial Officer in early October is particularly relevant as Five Below continues rapid expansion and manages costs in a competitive retail environment. This leadership transition positions the company to navigate both the financial complexities of opening more stores and the persistent risks from tariffs and wage pressures.

Yet, in contrast to its growth story, investors should be aware that store expansion on this scale carries real risks, especially if...

[TITLE]Andrew Korge cancels $28M offer for former Rishi Kapoor dev site:
[TEXT]
Andrew Korge terminated his firm’s $28.2 million offer for a stalled mixed-use project site in Coconut Grove tied to disgraced developer Rishi Kapoor.

An affiliate of Korge’s Miami-based KOR Development walked away from the potential purchase of the development site at 3120-3170 Commodore Plaza, a year after reaching an agreement with Bernice Lee, the court-appointed receiver overseeing the liquidation of assets belonging to defunct Location Ventures, previously led by Kapoor, and its related entities, according to an Oct. 15 notice in Miami federal court.

Last year, Lee was appointed Location Ventures’ receiver stemming from a pending civil lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against the firm and Kapoor that alleges he misappropriated $93 million in investor funds meant for real estate projects. In November, the SEC and Kapoor reached a settlement, but Lee is still in the midst of selling properties in order to pay creditors.

In a phone interview, Korge said finalizing the deal was taking too long, and he has shifted careers from real estate to technology. “We made that offer in what feels like the last century,” Korge said. “I regret that this didn’t move a little more smoothly. I would have bought it, but I just can’t wait. Life goes on.”

[TITLE]Why the L’Oréal-Kering Tie-in Could Change the Playbook for Armani:
[TEXT]
Updated 3:24 p.m. ET Oct. 21

The playbook for Giorgio Armani could change now that L’Oréal has a blooming partnership with Kering.

As previously reported, news broke Sunday night that Kering Beauty is being sold to L’Oréal for 4 billion euros. Concurrently, Kering and L’Oréal are forming a long-term strategic partnership in beauty and wellness.

Might this partnership expand into fashion? Only time will tell. But it could make good sense when it comes to Armani.

Wills of the late designer Giorgio Armani, who died on Sept. 4 at age 91, opened the possibility of L’Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and EssilorLuxottica as potential buyers of his namesake company.

RELATED: L’Oréal’s Sales Growth Accelerated in Q3

L’Oréal and EssilorLuxottica are licensees for fragrance and beauty, and eyewear, respectively.

“I continue to expect L’Oréal and EssilorLuxottica as the most probable acquirors of their respective Armani businesses,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein. “With apparel and leather goods likely licensed to a third party long-term — same as Estée Lauder has done with Tom Ford.

“I wonder if in this context Kering could be the third-party licensee,” Solca continued. “Having said that, Kering is more likely to concentrate on getting its core business back on an even keel.”

Armani’s two wills, dated March 15 and April 5, were made public Sept. 12. After 12 months from their opening and within 18 months at the most, an initial 15 percent of his company could be sold to either L’Oréal, LVMH or Essilor Luxottica, they stipulate. Armani did not rule out other companies, as long as they are operating in the world of fashion and luxury, and of equal standing.

The same buyer would have the right to purchase a 30 percent to 54.9 percent stake in Armani between the third and fifth years, or in five years and within eight to consider a public listing in Italy as a priority or on other markets of equal standing.

Following even a potential listing, the Armani Foundation would keep a 30.1 percent stake of the group to ensure its control.

Regarding the Armani company, Nicolas Hieronimus, chief executive officer of L’Oréal, during a call Tuesday evening with analysts and journalists to discuss third-quarter and nine-months results reiterated sadness in the passing of Giorgio Armani, with whom the group collaborated for 40 years.

“We are very honored that in his success and in the instructions that he left with his heirs, L’Oréal is considered as a potential acquirer, at least of the first 15 percent,” Hieronimus said. “We said we would consider all the options. It’s a bit too soon. The family is mourning and focused also on driving this business.

“The only important thing that I can confirm today is that the deal we just did with Kering does not prevent us from considering any of the options that are on the table with Armani,” he continued. “So we will rediscuss it in the future.”

L’Oréal generally sticks with its core competency of beauty, but has ventured into fashion in the past — first with Lanvin, which it owned between 1994 and 2001, and more recently with Mugler, which became part of the French giant’s portfolio as part of the deal when it acquired the Mugler brands and Azzaro fragrances from Groupe Clarins in 2020.

Most recently, in early February, L’Oréal joined forces with Jacquemus, linking a long-term beauty license and taking a 10 percent stake in the fashion business.

Fashion and beauty are very different animals, even if they share some brand DNA, so it is considered unlikely L’Oréal would want to run Armani fashion itself.

No doubt, L’Oréal desires to keep the Armani fragrance and beauty license past 2050. That’s where the partnership with Kering could come in. And in the late ’90s, rumors swirled for years that Gucci wanted to buy Armani, although a deal never materialized.

The Armani fragrance and beauty license is a jewel in the crown of L’Oréal’s Luxe division, where it has been a “billionaire” brand since 2017. Blockbuster Armani products such as Sì fragrances and Maestro foundation have attracted A-list brand ambassadors like actress Cate Blanchett and Hanni, the lead singer of NewJeans, who helped transform Armani beauty into a sustainable, global powerhouse.

In March 2018, L’Oréal and Armani renewed that license until 2025, after having worked together since 1988. It was among Armani’s first licenses.

At the time of the renewal, Giorgio Armani said in a statement that “over the years our mutual trust has constantly generated excellent results.”

Kering, for its part, could merit from adding at least one more powerful fashion holding at this time when it’s struggling to turn around its star Gucci brand. Gucci has Demna as a new designer, which energized buyers with his debut display there at the recent Milan Fashion Week in September. But a turnaround at Gucci will take time.

Meanwhile, Kering’s newly appointed CEO Luca de Meo has sprung into action to revive the ailing company. The Kering Beauty announcement — coming just one month after his official arrival — was a surprise to the beauty and fashion industries. But financial analysts have lauded the move.

The Kering Beauty deal will be a windfall for Kering, whose net debt amounted to 9.5 billion euros on June 30. However, whether Kering would want to make a major acquisition like Armani remains to be seen.

HSBC cited 2024 filings that show Armani generated 2.3 billion euros in sales from fashion and

[TITLE]Dynamic pricing modeling and inventory management in omnichannel retail using Quantum Decision Theory and reinforcement learning:
[TEXT]
Abstract In the world of omnichannel retail, where customers seamlessly switch between online and offline channels, pricing and inventory management decisions have become more complex than ever. Customer purchasing behavior is influenced by uncertainty, market fluctuations, and competitive interactions, which traditional models fail to accurately predict. In such conditions, the need for intelligent and adaptive decision-making frameworks is more critical than ever. For the first time, this study presents a novel approach combining Quantum Decision Theory, Quantum Markov Chains (QMC), Quantum Dynamic Games, and Reinforcement Learning to optimize dynamic pricing and inventory management. By leveraging concepts such as superposition, observer effect, and quantum interference, the proposed model overcomes the limitations of classical models and provides a deeper understanding of customer behavior in uncertain environments. Additionally, a Quantum Multi-Level Markov Process (QMLMP) is employed to model market variations and enhance predictions. The results of this study demonstrate that the innovative model improves the accuracy of purchase behavior predictions, optimizes pricing and inventory management strategies, and helps retailers make more competitive and profitable decisions. This research introduces a transformative approach to tackling retail challenges in the digital age and paves the way for future studies in this domain.

1. Introduction The retail industry is considered one of the most important and active sectors of the global economy. In the United States, this industry contributes $3.9 trillion to the annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and supports one-quarter of American jobs (Rios and Vera, 2023). E-commerce has brought transformations in omnichannel retailing. Many traditional retailers are entering the digital world. By adopting dual-channel and multi-channel strategies, retailers seek to increase their market share. On the other hand, customers no longer differentiate between various channels and expect to seamlessly switch between online and offline platforms. As a result, the boundaries between physical and digital channels are fading, and retail is moving towards a seamless omnichannel experience [1]. For example, Walmart has not only launched online stores but has also partnered with e-commerce platforms. Meanwhile, many online retailers are expanding their physical presence. For instance, in October 2016, The Idle Man, a UK-based online menswear retailer, opened its first physical store in London [1]. From the customer’s perspective, the omnichannel model enables shopping through various methods, such as buying online and picking up in-store, buying online and shipping from a store, reserving online and purchasing in person, and in-store shopping with home delivery. However, from the retailer’s perspective, these changes present both opportunities and challenges, as they require a reevaluation of sales channel structures, strategies, and operational decisions [1]. Omnichannel retailers must make a wide range of decisions that impact their profitability and competitiveness. Demand is one of the key factors in sales for any organization or company. Researchers have proposed dependent demand functions for modeling demand, such as the price-dependent demand function [2,3] and the inventory-dependent demand function [4,5]. Therefore, the joint management of pricing and inventory is considered a fundamental issue in supply chain management [6]. Numerous studies have simultaneously addressed the importance of these two factors, and interested readers can refer to them [7–12]. Pricing of products is one of the most important decisions for companies and organizations. Setting the right price for products and services significantly impacts profitability and business success. According to Utility Theory, customers seek to maximize utility in their purchasing decisions; therefore, pricing should align with their perceived value of the product. In other words, the price acceptance level represents the maximum amount a customer is willing to pay for a product or service, and price acceptance is one of the consequences of customer satisfaction [13,14]. Furthermore, the Price Elasticity of Demand theory indicates that customers respond differently to price changes. For some products, a price reduction leads to increased demand, while for others, price changes have a minimal impact. For this reason, multichannel retailers should adjust their pricing strategies based on the demand elasticity in each channel [15]. According to Reference Price Theory, customers have a reference price in mind for each product, which is shaped by past experiences and advertisements. If a product’s price exceeds the customer’s mental reference price, demand may decrease. Therefore, maintaining price consistency across different channels and using targeted discounts can be effective in attracting customers [16]. The impact of price on customers’ purchasing decisions is crucial, as appropriate pricing can either encourage customers to buy or deter them from making a purchase. Customers generally seek good value for their money—if the price of a product does not match its perceived value and quality, they may look for alternatives. Moreover, discounts and price increases can directly influence customer decisions. Proper pricing strategies help improve business profitability: if the price is too high, sales volume may decrease, reducing overall profit; conversely, if the price is too low, profit margins may shrink. Therefore, setting a balanced and strategic price is essential for sustained profitability. Unlike traditional retail, where pricing is determined independently for each store, online customer interactions have blurred physical boundaries, making pricing strategies more complex. Multichannel retailers must consider inventory and demand across the entire network to determine optimal pricing for each channel and geographic region. Implementing unified pricing and joint order fulfillment policies can reduce the average order processing cost compared to separate pricing and fulfillment strategies [7]. E-commerce retailers employ various marketing strategies to boost sales. One common strategy is offering price discounts by temporarily lowering the regular price of a product [14]. Additionally, most retailers adopt dynamic pricing policies, where the initial price changes based on sales performance over time. The main pricing challenges in retail include: Monitoring and analyzing sales behavior over time and adjusting prices on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Coordinating prices across different store locations to prevent arbitrage, where resellers exploit price differences between stores. Managing inventory while considering product substitutes and complements. Optimizing final prices for remaining stock at the end of a sales period [17]. Inventory management in omnichannel retailing is a constant challenge. The efficiency and profitability of retail businesses largely depend on proper inventory management. Inventory-related issues play a crucial role in supply chain and logistics, as they directly impact a company’s financial performance. This area involves various challenges, such as reducing lost sales due to stock shortages, managing perishable products, and controlling inventory with random replenishment times [17,18]. Inventory levels also influence customer purchasing behavior—particularly when stock is low, customers may feel a greater sense of urgency to buy. One of the key challenges in pricing and inventory management in omnichannel retailing is complex customer behavior, market fluctuations, and uncertainty in purchase decisions. Customers expect consistent pricing across all channels, yet intense competition and rapid market changes make dynamic pricing essential. Additionally, accurate demand forecasting is difficult due to fast-changing trends, seasonal shopping patterns, and diverse product options. As a result, inventory management becomes increasingly complex. To mitigate rising costs, prevent customer dissatisfaction, and maintain profitability, retailers must leverage data analytics and advanced technologies to optimize their pricing and inventory strategies. Selecting the optimal pricing strategy and inventory management approach requires accurate forecasting of customer behavior. However, real customer behavior is often irrational and unpredictable. Traditional models, such as Markov models and classical reinforcement learning, assume that customers always make rational decisions. However, recent research has shown that this assumption is not always valid. Recent research in cognitive psychology focuses on probabilistic theories that best describe human decision-making uder uncertainty. Three main theories have been proposed in this field: Classical Probability Theory (CPT): Assumes rational and logical decision-making. Heuristics and Biases: Describes human behavior based on intuitive and fast decision-making rules. Quantum Probability Theory (QPT): A novel approach for analyzing uncertain decision-making, which can address the limitations of CPT in explaining customer cognition. Traditional pricing and inventory models, such as those based on classical Markov processes or reinforcement learning, often assume that customers make decisions rationally, consistently, and based on utility maximization principles. However, empirical observations in omnichannel retail environments reveal that real-world customers often behave unpredictably. For example, a customer may view a product multiple times, abandon it, and then suddenly decide to purchase after seeing a social media post or a temporary discount. These irregularities — driven by emotions, external stimuli, and mental hesitation — cannot be adequately modeled using classical deterministic frameworks. Such models treat indecisive behavior as disinterest and ignore the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of customer cognition. Therefore, a more flexible and realistic approach is needed. Quantum Decision Theory (QDT) provides this by allowing for probabilistic states of decision-making, where a customer can simultaneously exist in both “buy” and “not buy” cognitive states until an external interaction collapses this uncertainty into a final decision. This quantum perspective better captures the ambiguity, non-linearity, and interference effects inherent in modern consumer behavior. Quantum Probability Theory (QPT) has emerged as a new paradigm in recent years, gaining widespread application in psychology, cognitive science, and decision-making analysis [19]. Cognitive quantum research suggests that QPT can better explain cognitive biases and decision-making deviations in customers. While CPT assumes that a customer always exists in one specific state, QPT allows a customer to exist in multiple cognitive states simultaneously. QPT provides a mathematical probabilistic model where a customer can be in an infinite number of potential states at any given moment, accessing all possible options [20]. In recent years, quasi-quantum decision theories have demonstrated their ability to explain inconsistencies in human behavior using quantum probabilities [21]. Quantum Decision Theory (QDT) introduces a new framework for modeling customer behavior, naturally incorporating cognitive uncertainty. In this framework, customers remain in multiple probabilistic states until they make a final decision. Their final choice is influenced by quantum superposition and interference effects. Unlike classical models, which assume that a customer either purchases or does not purchase, the quantum model allows a customer to be in both states (buying and not buying) simultaneously—until an external interaction (such as a price change or advertisement) triggers their final decision. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is an important concept in marketing management and customer relationship management, representing the profit a customer generates for a business over their lifetime. This metric is crucial for organizations because retaining existing customers is less costly than acquiring new ones. Considering CLV is particularly important when delivering goods to various regions. If only current demand is considered, businesses may meet short-term needs but miss out on long-term growth opportunities. By focusing on CLV, companies can look to the future and make decisions that help retain customers and increase profitability in the long run. Customers with high CLV tend to make more purchases and generate higher profits for the company. Therefore, even if current demand is low in some regions, paying attention to CLV can help businesses optimally allocate resources and provide better services to these customers, keeping them loyal [22–24]. Customer satisfaction and loyalty are key factors that lead to business success in competitive markets [25,26]. Customer loyalty refers to something that influences customer behavior to ensure ongoing, long-term purchases. The costs of acquiring new customers are higher than retaining them, so service organizations must find ways to retain their customers. Loyal customers buy from a business and may recommend it to others, but this does not mean they are always satisfied. For example, disloyal customers may change their purchasing location if a better option is available. However, satisfied customers may continue to buy from their current suppliers. The consumer is the core of organizations around which marketing activities revolve. Retaining consumer loyalty is what organizations aspire to achieve. The highly competitive and broad market with numerous brands is a harsh reality that marketing managers face today, and acquiring a new customer is more expensive than serving an existing one. Therefore, consumer loyalty is considered the most desirable phenomenon for companies, as commitment leads to repeat buying behavior and positive word-of-mouth advertising, thus resulting in a more significant market share and superior financial performance for the company [27]. Dynamic games are a powerful tool for modeling interactions between economic agents over time. This framework is particularly useful in scenarios where past decisions influence the current state and future choices. In the field of retail and dynamic pricing, numerous studies have utilized dynamic game theory to analyze optimal pricing strategies, inventory management, and customer responses [8,28,29]. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical model used for decision-making in stochastic or uncertain environments. This model is specifically designed for problems where the decision-maker cannot predict future outcomes with certainty. MDP has significant applications in fields such as reinforcement learning, robotics, game design, and resource management. Many studies have applied MDP-based approaches to dynamic pricing and inventory control [30,31]. In general, MDP provides a mathematical framework for decision-making in uncertain environments, where state transitions occur probabilistically based on the actions taken. This model is particularly useful for analyzing dynamic games, where state changes occur in a probabilistic manner. Common dynamic pricing methods include Markov chains, reinforcement learning (PPO, Q-learning), and dynamic game theory. These methods have been successful in various economic problems but have limitations. They assume that customers always make rational and deterministic decisions, whereas in reality, purchase decisions are influenced by emotions, social factors, and random interactions. This scientific gap creates the need for a new approach that can account for these complexities in modeling. Traditional pricing and inventory management models, based on Markov chains and classical reinforcement learning, assume that customers always make logical and definite decisions. However, recent research in quantum cognition suggests that customer decision-making can exist in multiple cognitive states simultaneously and be influenced by quantum superposition. Despite this breakthrough, few studies have applied this concept to omnichannel retailing and dynamic pricing. Recent findings in psychology and behavioral economics show that customer decisions are affected by irrational factors, emotions, advertisements, and even discounts. These unexpected and fluctuating behaviors cannot be accurately modeled using classical methods. Thus, there is a growing need for a new framework to analyze and predict customer behavior in omnichannel retailing. This scientific gap led us to explore Quantum Markov Chains (QMC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to better model customer purchasing behavior and optimize pricing strategies and inventory management. In this study, we use Quantum Decision Theory (QDT) to model customer purchasing behavior. Unlike classical models, quantum theory enables more accurate predictions of customer behavior. In this framework, decisions are modeled using quantum concepts such as superposition and the observer effect, rather than traditional probabilities. In this model, customers can exist in multiple decision states simultaneously until an external factor, such as an advertisement or price change, collapses the state and determines their final decision. This research aims to answer: How can Quantum Decision Theory, combined with Reinforcement Learning, optimize pricing and inventory management in omnichannel retailing? Specifically, we focus on: Quantum Markov Chains (QMC) for predicting customer purchasing behavior. Quantum probabilities in pricing models, integrating price dynamics with market conditions. Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize pricing and inventory management policies. Pricing formulation using Schrödinger-like quantum equations. Modeling customer-seller interactions as a Quantum Game Theory framework. Using Quantum Markov Chains (QMC) to enhance purchasing behavior predictions. This study introduces a new framework for dynamic pricing and inventory management in omnichannel retail by integrating quantum-based models with machine learning techniques. Our proposed model, leveraging quantum concepts, overcomes the limitations of traditional methods such as classical Markov chains and classical reinforcement learning. This approach better models the cognitive uncertainty of customers, leading to more accurate predictions of purchasing behavior. Furthermore, by integrating quantum probabilities and reinforcement learning (RL), our model enables the simultaneous optimization of pricing and inventory management, ultimately enhancing the profitability of retailers in an omnichannel environment. The remaining structure of the paper is as follows: In Section 2, the literature review is presented. In Section 3, the mathematical modeling is introduced. In Section 4, the solution method is examined. In Section 5, the implementation and execution process of the model is discussed. In Section 6, the results of the model are presented. In Section 7, a comparison of the model with traditional models is made. Section 8 covers sensitivity analysis, and Section 9 provides the conclusion and outlines future research directions.

2. Literature review Joint pricing and inventory management is a fundamental issue in supply chain management [6]. With the expansion of supply chains and the rise of e-commerce and omnichannel retailing, this area has garnered increasing attention, leading to numerous studies. Managing pricing and inventory in omnichannel retailing presents significant challenges due to the complex interactions between sales channels, the uncertain behavior of customers, and intense competition. Many studies have attempted to model these challenges using classical approaches, such as Markov chains, reinforcement learning (RL), and game theory. To address the complexities of pricing and inventory management, researchers have increasingly relied on reinforcement learning (RL) and advanced algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Q-learning [11,30]. These models can learn optimal policies in dynamic environments, outperforming traditional models. However, reinforcement learning models still assume rational customer behavior. Recent research has shown that customers exhibit unpredictable behaviors under uncertainty, which cannot be fully captured by traditional RL models. Dynamic pricing has emerged as a key strategy for increasing profitability in retail. Many studies have utilized Markov chains and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to determine optimal pricing policies [7,8]. These models assume that the decision-maker can observe the market conditions and, based on this information, adopt optimal pricing strategies. However, these models have a fundamental limitation: they assume that customers always make rational decisions based on economic utility, whereas behavioral psychology studies have shown that purchase decisions are influenced by irrational factors, such as emotions, mental perceptions, and social effects [32,33]. Cognitive psychology research has shown that customer decision-making is not always rational and is often influenced by factors such as intuition, emotions, and social effects [34,35]. One of the emerging theories proposed to explain these behaviors is Quantum Probability Theory (QPT), which, instead of deterministic models, uses superposition and probabilistic interference to predict decisions [20]. While QPT has been successful in cognitive sciences and psychology, few studies have applied this approach to retail and dynamic pricing. This paper aims to bridge the gap in customer behavior modeling by utilizing quantum modeling, dynamic games with quantum concepts, and Quantum Markov Chains (QMC). Table 1 presents a summary of research on dynamic pricing and inventory management. PPT PowerPoint slide

Literature Review. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333068.t001 By reviewing the literature, it became evident that traditional models, such as Markov processes and reinforcement learning in dynamic pricing and inventory management, assume that customers act rationally. However, recent research in cognitive sciences has shown that customer decisions can be irrational and uncertain. In this paper, for the first time, quantum modeling, quantum dynamic games, and Quantum Markov Chains (QMC) are utilized to model customer purchasing behavior and optimize pricing and inventory policies in omnichannel retail. This approach can enhance prediction accuracy, improve decision-making efficiency, and provide innovative solutions for sales management under uncertainty.

4 Approach to solving the problem 4.1 Combining the Quantum Model with reinforcement learning To optimize pricing policies and inventory management, reinforcement learning (RL) has been utilized. This approach, leveraging quantum dynamic games and quantum Markov chains, enables learning optimal decisions in an uncertain environment. In this model, demand levels, discounts, inventory levels, and market competition are simultaneously analyzed within a quantum wave function. Due to the mathematical complexity of the proposed model—incorporating quantum Markov chains, superposition effects, and quantum interference in customer behavior—an exact analytical solution is highly challenging. The model consists of nonlinear equations and complex probability distributions, which traditional mathematical methods struggle to solve. Moreover, random factors such as advertising, market fluctuations, and the uncertain behavior of customers necessitate the use of numerical methods and simulations. Therefore, to optimize pricing and inventory management, reinforcement learning methods such as the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm will be used. This allows the model to learn from empirical data and market interactions to determine the most effective decision-making policies. The advanced PPO reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to optimize decision-making in inventory and pricing management. In this framework, dynamic games are employed to more accurately simulate competitor reactions and market interactions, leading to improved system dynamics and decision-making. Additionally, adaptive memory plays a crucial role in the learning process and decision optimization. This memory enables the system to retrieve past experiences over different time periods and make better decisions based on that information. In other words, the system can dynamically update current conditions and learn from past events, resulting in continuous performance improvement. In this model, Random Search is used to fine-tune key parameters such as learning rate, gamma, lambda, clipping parameter (clip_param), entropy coefficient, and the number of episodes. Instead of performing an exhaustive search across the entire parameter space, this method randomly selects a set of parameter values and evaluates the model accordingly. 4.2 Quantum dynamic game for market interactions In a competitive environment, retailers and customers participate as players in a Quantum Dynamic Game. In this game, prices, discounts, and competitor decisions interact simultaneously and are analyzed using quantum models. The proposed model integrates Quantum Decision Theory, Quantum Markov Chains, Reinforcement Learning, and Quantum Dynamic Games to more accurately model customer behavior and retailer decisions in an uncertain environment. Compared to traditional methods, this model offers higher accuracy in predicting purchasing behavior and optimizing pricing and inventory management. By adopting this approach, retailers can develop more competitive and profitable strategies in complex markets. The dynamic game includes intricate interactions between customers, sellers, and competitors, aiming to simulate strategic decision-making in a competitive market. All components of the dynamic game are detailed in Table 2. PPT PowerPoint slide

Quantum Dynamic Game. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333068.t002 This quantum game model introduces uncertainty, entanglement, and probabilistic decision-making to dynamic market interactions, allowing for more flexible and unpredictable outcomes. To clarify the practical implementation of Quantum Dynamic Games in this study, we provide a step-by-step explanation of how the model was operationalized: Definition of Players and Actions: The retailer, customers, and competitors were modeled as agents in the quantum dynamic game. Retailer actions: Pricing, discounting, advertising strategies.

Customer actions: Purchase decision modeled as a quantum superposition state (buy/ not buy).

Competitor actions: Dynamic pricing and discounting modeled as entangled quantum states influencing customer decisions. Quantum State Representation: Each agent’s decision state (e.g., retailer price levels or customer purchase intent) was represented by a quantum wave function. The quantum dynamic game allowed these wave functions to interfere, creating constructive or destructive effects on final outcomes. Integration with Reinforcement Learning (PPO): The quantum dynamic game was integrated with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) so that: The PPO agent (retailer) learns optimal strategies based on the quantum probability distributions of customer and competitor behaviors.

Actions were selected not deterministically but based on evolving quantum probability amplitudes, updated in each learning episode. Markov Quantum State Transitions: The game incorporated Quantum Multi-Level Markov Processes (QMLMP) to model staara_Ite transitions between different market conditions (e.g., normal, competitive discount war, boom/recession). Transition probabilities were determined by quantum amplitudes rather than classical fixed probabilities. Practical Computation: The game was simulated using numerical solvers to evolve the quantum states over time (Schrödinger-like equations) and PPO for learning. Key practical steps included: Initial parameter estimation from Kaggle data (e.g., price sensitivity, loyalty).

Running simulations with different competitor strategies to capture entanglement effects.

Using random search to tune PPO hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, entropy coefficient). Outputs: The quantum dynamic game produced pricing and inventory policies that adaptively responded to competitor moves and customer quantum states, validated through simulations showing improved profit and reduced stockouts. 4.3. Utilizing Quantum Markov Chains (QMC) In many systems and models, especially in reinforcement learning and dynamic games, uncertainty and randomness in various behaviors play an important role. These uncertainties are usually caused by the unpredictability of states and future behaviors. One of the powerful tools for modeling such systems is the Markov process. Quantum Markov Chains (QMC), compared to classical Markov models, enable probabilistic and dynamic modeling of customer decisions. This model simultaneously considers different customer decision-making states and helps optimize pricing. Simply put, the Markov process means that the system is in one state at any given moment, and its transition to the next state depends only on the current state and has no connection to previous states. This feature is known as the Markov property, meaning that the system’s future depends only on its present state and not on its history. This property is very useful in many games and decision-making models, as optimal decisions can be made using the probabilities of transition from one state to another. In the real world, especially in dynamic games, players (such as sellers, competitors, and customers) usually cannot precisely predict each other’s future behaviors. For example, a seller does not know what decisions competitors will make in the future or where the market is heading (whether it will move towards growth or enter a recession). These situations change randomly, and decision-making in such environments is accompanied by uncertainty. In such conditions, the Markov process can help model these probabilistic changes. Specifically, in the Markov process, each player or decision-making agent (such as a seller) examines its current state and, based on it, decides which state (and decision) to transition to. The probability of transitioning to the next state is determined using probabilistic models. In reinforcement learning methods such as PPO, which are used in dynamic games and complex decision-making, an agent (e.g., a seller) must use past decisions and the rewards received from them to optimize future decisions. In other words, past rewards and decisions guide the agent towards optimal strategies, even if it cannot precisely predict future states. In general, Markov processes allow us to model transitions between probable states more accurately under uncertainty and thus make better decisions. Especially in complex reinforcement learning models aimed at improving long-term strategies, the Markov process is a useful tool for managing uncertainty and predicting future behaviors. Algorithm 1 provides an overview of the problem-solving approach. PPT PowerPoint slide

Hybrid Model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333068.t014 The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is a reinforcement learning method that helps the agent (here, the seller) find optimal decision-making policies through interaction with the environment. At each step, the seller observes the market conditions (such as competitor prices, demand levels, and economic conditions) and selects an action (e.g., changing prices, offering discounts, or adjusting inventory). After taking the action, a reward is received, indicating the success or failure of that decision (e.g., increased sales or reduced profit). Then, PPO uses these experiences to update the decision-making policy (Policy Update). However, unlike traditional methods, it clips changes to ensure more stable and effective learning. In this model, a Quantum Multi-Level Markov Process (QMLMP) is used to predict future states. PPO processes this data and dynamically and competitively optimizes the seller’s strategies.

Data-driven identification of quantum superposition and decision collapse In order to empirically validate the assumptions of our quantum decision-making framework, we utilized specific features from the real-world dataset to identify customer cognitive states and behavioral transitions. The process involved a multi-step interpretation of behavioral data to detect quantum phenomena such as superposition, the observer effect, and wave function collapse. Identifying Cognitive Superposition: We analyzed customers who exhibited repeated interest in a product but delayed the purchase decision. For example, the variables Product_Category, Product_Brand, Purchase_Channel, Date, and Total_Purchases allowed us to detect patterns where customers revisited the same product multiple times across different dates without making a transaction. This behavior — frequent but inconclusive engagement — was interpreted as a cognitive superposition, where the customer simultaneously considers both buying and not buying. Unlike classical models, which assume non-purchase indicates disinterest, our quantum model captures the uncertainty and hesitation inherent in such behavior. Detecting External Stimulus (Observer Effect): To determine when a customer’s decision wave function collapses into a final state (e.g., a purchase), we observed changes in Amount, Order_Status, Shipping_Method, and Date. A sudden drop in purchase price (recorded in the Amount column), especially when deviating from the average price range for that product, was taken as a sign of promotional activity or discount. Simultaneously, a change in Shipping_Method to “Same-Day” or “Express” implied urgency in decision-making, often triggered by a campaign or push notification. When such changes were followed by a purchase event (Order_Status = Completed), it indicated that the customer had received an external stimulus that collapsed their probabilistic state into a definite decision — consistent with the quantum observer effect. Confirming Wave Function Collapse (Final Decision): The final confirmation of a decision collapse was based on the simultaneous presence of the following: a non-zero Amount, a valid Payment_Method, a completed Order_Status, and an updated Purchase_Channel. These fields together confirm that the customer transitioned from indecision to a completed transaction, supporting the quantum model’s prediction. Additionally, positive feedback recorded in the Feedback or Ratings columns post-purchase helped reinforce the presence of satisfaction and loyalty shifts as modeled through quantum interference effects. By integrating these behavioral indicators, the quantum model was able to interpret indecisive customer behavior more effectively than classical deterministic frameworks. This approach not only validated key theoretical assumptions (such as superposition and observer effect) but also demonstrated how real-world behavioral data can be used to inform quantum-based decision modeling in omnichannel retail contexts. To demonstrate how the proposed quantum decision model interprets customer behavior more accurately than classical models, we analyze a real instance from the Kaggle dataset. Customer ID 94823, a 28-year-old female with low income, repeatedly visited a Zara shirt product via the mobile app across five different days over a two-week period. Despite this engagement, she made no purchase initially. In classical models, this pattern is interpreted as low intent to buy, and the probability of purchase is reduced accordingly. However, under our quantum decision framework, such repeated yet inconclusive interactions indicate that the customer is in a cognitive superposition — simultaneously inclined to both buy and not buy. Shortly after the last visit, a significant price drop was recorded (from $350 to $320), alongside a “Completed” order status within 24 hours. This behavioral shift suggests an external stimulus — likely a push notification or promotional discount — which, according to the quantum model, acts as an observation event, collapsing the customer’s wave function into a definite decision state (purchase). Our model predicted a 68% likelihood of purchase after the intervention, compared to only 12% under the classical model. This case clearly illustrates the applicability of the quantum observer effect and superposition in modeling real customer behavior. The customer’s transition from indecision to purchase, triggered by a contextual stimulus (e.g., discount or targeted ad), cannot be effectively captured by deterministic models. In contrast, the quantum model inherently accommodates cognitive uncertainty and external influences, enabling more accurate behavioral prediction and strategic decision-making. 5.3. Integrating quantum concepts into the Dynamic Game Model The dynamic game in this model incorporates quantum decision-making principles alongside traditional economic interactions among customers, vendors, and competitors. In this framework, customer decisions are not strictly deterministic but rather exist in a quantum superposition of choices until an interaction (such as a price change or advertisement) collapses the decision into a final state. Quantum Dynamic Game & PPO Integration Quantum Superposition in Customer Decisions: Unlike classical models where a customer either buys or does not buy, the Quantum Decision Theory (QDT) allows customers to be in multiple potential states simultaneously (e.g., “interested in buying” and “not interested”).

A purchase decision collapses to a specific choice only after external factors (like promotions or competitor strategies) influence their probability wave function. Quantum Interference in Competitor Reactions: Competitors’ pricing and discount strategies interfere constructively or destructively with the seller’s decisions.

For example, if two competitors reduce prices simultaneously, their influence may cancel each other out for a segment of customers, akin to quantum wave interference. Quantum Markov Chain for State Transitions: The transition between market states is modeled using a Quantum Markov Process (QMP), where a seller’s pricing strategy probabilistically influences the next state.

Instead of transitioning deterministically, state changes are influenced by a probability amplitude, accounting for market uncertainty. Quantum Game Theory in Dynamic Market Competition: The interaction between the seller and competitors follows Quantum Game Theory, where each player’s strategy exists in a mixed quantum state rather than a fixed classical choice.

The seller’s pricing adjustments and advertising strategies affect the probability distribution of competitor reactions, rather than a single deterministic response. Quantum-Enhanced PPO for Seller Decision-Making In the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, the seller acts as a quantum-learning agent, dynamically adapting strategies based on probabilistic interactions in the market. Quantum Market State (Quantum State Representation): The seller does not exist in a single discrete market state but rather in a quantum superposition of states, representing multiple possible outcomes based on competitors’ actions.

Observing competitor actions or customer preferences collapses the quantum state, leading to an updated pricing or inventory strategy. Quantum Action Selection: The seller selects pricing, discounting, and advertising actions, not from a fixed set of choices, but from a probability distribution of optimal strategies.

The PPO model refines this distribution over multiple iterations using reinforcement learning. Quantum Reward Function with Entanglement Effects: Rewards are influenced by entangled relationships between customer behavior, pricing decisions, and competitor responses.

For example, if a competitor raises prices, the probability of a seller’s sales increasing also rises due to entanglement in the competitive pricing space. Quantum Policy Updates: Instead of deterministic policy updates, quantum-inspired policy gradients guide the seller’s adaptation.

◦PPO’s clipped objective function is adjusted to include quantum uncertainty corrections, ensuring smoother convergence toward optimal strategies. An example of a dynamic game is shown in Table 6. PPT PowerPoint slide

Integrating quantum concepts into multi-level Markov process In a quantum-enhanced dynamic game, the seller must make decisions based on different market conditions (such as boom or recession) and the behavior of competitors. Unlike classical models, where decisions are deterministic and history-independent, the Quantum Multi-Level Markov Process (QMLMP) incorporates superposition, interference, and entanglement, allowing the seller to account for non-classical decision-making patterns in an uncertain market. The Quantum Multi-Level Markov Process (QMLMP) enables the seller to predict future market conditions in a probabilistic yet non-deterministic manner, ensuring that quantum state transitions capture complex interdependencies. Furthermore, reinforcement learning techniques such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) leverage these quantum transitions to develop dynamic strategies that adapt to competitive behaviors and market fluctuations. In this system, the Quantum Multi-Level Markov Process, dynamic games, and reinforcement learning (PPO) interact seamlessly, enabling the seller to make optimal decisions under uncertainty and competitive pressures. How the Quantum Multi-Level Markov Process Helps the Seller in Dynamic Games: Quantum Modeling of Future Market States: In a dynamic game , the seller is in a quantum state composed of multiple potential market conditions (e.g., boom, recession, or stagnation).

, the seller is in a quantum state composed of multiple potential market conditions (e.g., boom, recession, or stagnation). Unlike classical models where the seller is in a single discrete state, quantum superposition allows them to exist in a combination of different market states simultaneously.

allows them to exist in a combination of different market states simultaneously. The measurement of the quantum state (such as new competitor pricing strategies or economic shifts) collapses the seller’s state into a definite market condition, influencing their next decision. Quantum Probabilistic State Transitions with Interference Effects: In the classical Markov process , a transition from “boom” to “recession” is modeled with fixed probabilities.

, due to . This means that some transitions are enhanced while others are suppressed, allowing the seller to leverage interference effects to predict shifts in the market more accurately. Reducing Complexity and Enhancing Decision-Making with Quantum Memory: Unlike classical Markov models, which assume memoryless state transitions , quantum Markov processes allow quantum memory effects where entangled historical states influence future transitions.

, quantum Markov processes allow where influence future transitions. This means that, rather than assuming past states do not affect future outcomes, the seller can utilize quantum correlations to retain past influences on decision-making.

to retain past influences on decision-making. As a result, the seller does not need to track all past market states but instead relies on entangled probability distributions, which encode past decision-making dynamics. Enhancing Reinforcement Learning with Quantum Transitions The Quantum Multi-Level Markov Process provides the state transition probabilities for the PPO reinforcement learning model.

provides the for the PPO reinforcement learning model. PPO then updates policies based on quantum-derived state transitions, ensuring that market fluctuations, competitive reactions, and customer behaviors are dynamically integrated into pricing and inventory decisions .

. Quantum-inspired PPO optimization adapts dynamically to new market conditions by refining quantum probability distributions, allowing for faster convergence and more accurate strategy formulation. Key Advantages of Quantum Multi-Level Markov Process in Dynamic Markets: More Accurate Market State Predictions: By leveraging quantum probability amplitudes and interference effects, state transitions are predicted with greater precision than classical models.

Accounts for Non-Deterministic Decision-Making: Customers, competitors, and the overall market do not follow purely rational, deterministic choices, making quantum models more realistic.

Enhances PPO Learning Efficiency: By incorporating quantum state transitions, the reinforcement learning process adapts more dynamically to sudden market shifts and uncertainty.

Encodes Historical Dependencies Without Increasing Complexity: Unlike classical Markov models, which require tracking long histories, quantum models store past influences through entanglement without increasing computational burden. In summary, by integrating Quantum Multi-Level Markov Processes (QMLMP) into PPO-based dynamic decision-making, the seller can optimize pricing and inventory strategies with unprecedented adaptability, precision, and robustness to uncertainty.

8. Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity Analysis is a key component in evaluating decision-making models, showing how changes in key parameters affect pricing policies, inventory levels, and customer behavior. In this study, sensitivity analysis was conducted based on the following parameters: Price Elasticity of Demand: Examining customer sensitivity to price changes and its impact on sales volume. Advertising Intensity: Analyzing the effect of increasing or decreasing advertising efforts on customer purchase behavior and decision-making probability. Market Volatility: Assessing sudden demand fluctuations and their impact on model performance. Initial Inventory Level: Evaluating how changes in the initial inventory affect profitability and inventory management costs. Competitive Interactions: Studying the impact of competitor pricing changes on retailer pricing strategies. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the proposed model maintains optimal performance even with increasing market volatility and changes in price elasticity. Through adaptive learning, it dynamically adjusts its strategies under varying conditions. This is a key advantage of the quantum model over traditional methods, as conventional models typically require manual adjustments and redesigns when facing sudden market changes. However, the proposed model can automatically and intelligently optimize its strategies, making more dynamic decisions. Table 10 demonstrates the stability and effectiveness of the quantum model.

[TITLE]California union proposes one-time tax on billionaires to offset Medicaid cuts:
[TEXT]
By SOPHIE AUSTIN

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A major union announced a proposal Thursday to impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires in California to address federal funding cuts to health care for low-income people.

Proponents, including the Service Employees International Union, hope to place the statewide measure before voters next year. The tax would be on the net worth of California’s richest residents. A small portion of the money would also help fund K-12 education since the federal government has threatened to withhold grant money from public schools.

Backers of the measure sent a request to Attorney General Rob Bonta this week to get approval to start collecting signatures. The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it’s not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, has opposed tax hikes in the past, including those specifically targeting the rich.

Proponents of the initiative said it was critical to backfill cuts to Medicaid because lives are at stake.

“If we do not do this, millions of people are going to lose health care, an untold number of people will go without treatment and there will be tragedy after tragedy,” said Dave Regan, president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West.

Billionaires would have to pay for tax year 2026, and the money could start being appropriated in 2027. The tax would generate $100 billion in revenue for the state, backers say. The initiative says it’s “designed to make the State tax system more equitable.”

The big tax and spending cuts law President Donald Trump signed earlier this year will cut more than $1 trillion over a decade from Medicaid and federal food assistance.

The California Budget and Policy Center, a think tank in Sacramento, estimated the state could lose $30 billion in federal funding a year for Medicaid, which would result in up to 3.4 million people losing their coverage.

Newsom said earlier this month that people enrolled in Covered California, the state’s health insurance marketplace, could see their monthly health care bills nearly double next year as a result of the spending cuts law.

“California has led the nation in expanding access to affordable health care, but Donald Trump is ripping it away,” he said.

Proponents of the proposed ballot initiative say billionaires have an obligation to do their part.

“We hope that some and perhaps hopefully a large number of billionaires will recognize that it’s important in the state where they’ve grown their fortune that they have a responsibility to society to preserve the future of California,” said Emmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.

[TITLE]Ermenegildo Zegna Group Sees DTC Growth Accelerate in Q3:
[TEXT]
MILAN — The Ermenegildo Zegna Group’s strategic decision to invest in its direct-to-consumer network of stores continues to pay off and delivered an acceleration in sales in the third quarter of the year.

In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, group organic revenues rose 3.6 percent to to 398.2 million euros, compared with 397.3 million euros in the same period last year, excluding the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. At reported rates, sales rose 0.2 percent.

In the third quarter, the direct-to-consumer channel outperformed and grew 9.1 percent organically compared with 6 percent growth in the first half of the year. In the third quarter, all three brands recorded solid organic growth in the channel: Zegna was up 7.4 percent to 210.3 million euros; Thom Browne sales rose 10 percent to 38.2 million euros, and Tom Ford Fashion revenues jumped 16.4 percent to 48 million euros.

In the nine months, organic revenues were in line with the same period last year, amounting to 1.33 billion euros. At reported rates, sales decreased 2.3 percent.

Gildo Zegna, chairman and chief executive officer, touted the acceleration of the direct-to-consumer channel in the third quarter, and said he was “pleased with the continued growth of the Zegna brand’s direct-to-consumer channel, led by the Americas and the EMEA region, and also delighted to see the outstanding performances of Tom Ford Fashion and Thom Browne, whose DTC channel grew by double digits on an organic basis this quarter.”

He admitted that “looking ahead, we expect the environment to remain challenging for our industry, with ongoing uncertainties in consumer demand and currency fluctuations.” However, he continued, “the success of the recent Tom Ford and Thom Browne shows, the good reception of the fall drops at Zegna and the many projects in our pipeline give me confidence that we will continue to deliver on our mid-term targets.”

In the nine months, the Zegna brand reported organic growth of 3.6 percent to 819.8 million euros. Thom Browne sales decreased 17.8 percent to 177.3 million euros and Tom Ford Fashion was up 3.9 percent to 218.7 million euros. Textile revenues were down 4.6 percent to 96.8 million euros.

“The work we’ve done over the past months — strengthening our leadership team, building on our brands’ equity and staying focused and consistent with our strategic vision — is starting to bear fruit,” the executive told WWD. “I know our journey to exploit our brands’ full potentials is still at the beginning. Early positive signs are encouraging, however we still have important work to do in front of us. We are ready, the team is built, the actions are clear. We are working united as family and as a group.”

Organic sales of the direct-to-consumer channel in the nine months were up 7 percent to 994.7 million euros, accelerating in the third quarter, up 9.1 percent. The wholesale channel fell 23.4 percent to 221.2 million euros.

As of Sept. 30, the group had 670 stores, of which 472 were directly operated.

Brands’ Performances

“I’ve been pleased with the beautiful Tom Ford fashion show in Paris, the second by Haider Ackermann, and with the brand’s DTC performance this quarter, which grew by 16 percent,” Zegna said. Ackermann was named creative director of Tom Ford Fashion in September last year, succeeding Peter Hawkings.

He added that the fall collection was “well-received, and the work we’re doing to elevate our retail and CRM capabilities — while building a stronger team — is starting to pay off. We are just at the beginning of our journey. We know it might require time, and the path may not be linear. But the vision is clear. Now, our focus must be on execution.”

Zegna took on Ford’s fashion as part of the Estée Lauder Cos. deal to buy the brand in 2022, which valued the beauty and fashion brand at $2.8 billion.

Zegna touted the progress made at Thom Browne, underscoring how the brand’s recent spring show this month in Paris and the events held in Tokyo to celebrate the opening of its new Ginza flagship “not only highlight the strength of Thom Browne’s community — well beyond the Japanese market — but also confirm the brand’s evolution into a broader lifestyle proposition, while remaining true to its DNA.”

Referring to the brand’s CEO Sam Lobban, Zegna said he “has just begun his journey, focusing on elevating the retail experience and enhancing the merchandising offer. It will take time, but I know he brings a clear vision and a well-defined plan to execute.”

As reported, Thom Browne CEO Rodrigo Bazan exited the brand on Aug. 31, succeeded by Lobban, previously executive vice president and general merchandising manager for apparel and designer at Nordstrom. Bazan had been leading Thom Browne since 2016, growing its sales threefold.

Performance by Geography

In the third quarter, all key regions showed improved performances in organic terms. The Americas continued to outperform the rest of the regions with 13 percent organic growth.

In the nine months, the Europe, Middle East and Africa market posted an organic decrease of 0.6 percent to 480 million euros, representing 36 percent of the total. In the third quarter, organic sales in the area were up 2.6 percent, mainly driven by double-digit growth in the DTC channel at Zegna and Tom Ford Fashion, partially offset by the negative performance in the wholesale channel.

“We’ve just reopened our completely renewed Zegna store in Dubai, now home to our fourth Salotto — following Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore. This by-appointment-only concept marks a significant milestone. Dubai is the first store in our network, and I’m confident that this refurbishment, together with the Salotto, will further reinforce its global leadership. The Gulf region remains a key strategic area for us and for the sector — it’s one of our pillars for growth,” the executive said.

The U.S. market for Zegna “remains one of the fastest markets and a pillar of our strategy. The new store in the Miami Design District luxury mall is another key asset that will further strengthen our growth in the region,” the executive said.

In the nine months, organic sales in the Americas rose 10.4 percent to 384.1 million euros, representing 29 percent of total revenues.

The Greater China region recorded an organic decrease of 12.7 percent to 300.5 million euros, accounting for 23 percent of the total. The third quarter showed a sequential improvement, decreasing 6.5 percent compared to the second quarter, mainly driven by Thom Browne’s robust recovery in the region.

The rest of Asia-Pacific rose 3.3 percent to 159.1 million eros, with Japan and South Korea sequentially improving in the third quarter.

“China showed encouraging signs of improvement in the third quarter across all our brands,” Zegna said. “However, consumer demand remains volatile, and we continue to approach planning with caution — especially for 2026. Looking ahead, we assume the market is entering a ‘new normal’ phase, where growth rates will be more balanced compared to the exceptional levels seen before 2024. This shift calls for thoughtful execution and long-term commitment, and we are prepared to navigate it with clarity and discipline.”

Shares of KPR Mill Gokaldas Exports and other textile stocks climbed up to 13% in morning trade on Thursday, October 23, as investors pinned hopes on a possible breakthrough in the highly anticipated India-US trade deal This comes after US President Donald Trump said he loves India and both countries are working on a trade deal. The President had phoned Prime Minister Narendra Modi to wish Happy Diwali. The development gains significance as Donald Trump recently said that negotiations for a trade deal with India were underway. On Tuesday, Trump also said he had received assurance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a phone call that New Delhi would scale back purchases of Russian oil.In the morning, Gokaldas Exports led the surge, rallying 13% to their day’s high of Rs 899 per share.

Welspun Living soared 8% to Rs 132 per share.Other major triggers that could benefit the textile majors include the India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The deal is expected to aid textile exporters by removing the 10–12% duty that had previously hurt them against competitors. The deal now gives India parity with Cambodia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, which already enjoy duty-free access.In addition, the new GST rate on readymade garments priced up to Rs 2,500 has been reduced to 5% from 12%. Man-made fibres, yarns, handloom, handicrafts, and carpets will also face a lower uniform rate of 5%.In a recent report, Crisil Ratings said India’s home textile makers could be staring at a 5-10% decline due to Trump tariffs.

[TITLE]Party City Opens a Pop-Up in NYC for Halloween:
[TEXT]
Party City is officially rising from the retail graveyard—and its first stop is Union Square. Less than a year after shuttering all of its U.S. stores amid bankruptcy, the country’s onetime king of confetti and costumes is back in New York City with a limited-time Halloween pop-up.

Now open at One Union Square West through October 31, the temporary store is a nostalgia hit wrapped in orange and black. Inside, it’s wall-to-wall wigs, costumes, décor and balloons—the sort of glorious chaos that once defined the chain’s pre-party rush. Whether you’re trick-or-treating through the Village, heading to a themed rooftop bash or simply haunting your apartment with faux cobwebs and animatronic skeletons, this comeback kid has you covered.

The return comes after Party City’s dramatic downfall in late 2024, when the company, burdened by debt, online competition and post-pandemic malaise, announced the closure of all 700 stores. But this year, the brand found new life thanks to Hillside, New Jersey-based New Amscan PC LLC, which scooped up Party City’s intellectual property and wholesale operations in a bankruptcy auction for $20 million. The new owners have since rolled out an e-commerce platform, partnered with DoorDash for same-day delivery and opened a handful of franchise and pop-up locations nationwide.

“At Party City, we’re making it easier, faster, and more fun than ever to celebrate,” said Ad Populum CEO Joel Weinshanker when the acquisition was announced. “We are excited to lead the transformation of the Party City and Amscan brands.”

The Union Square shop, which will be open daily until Halloween night, marks a symbolic return to the brand’s party capital roots. Monday through Thursday hours run 10am–9pm, Friday and Saturday until 10pm, and Sunday 10am–7pm. Those who’d rather skip the line can still score everything from inflatable Grim Reapers to glittery vampire capes at PartyCity.com, where DoorDash can deliver the festivities straight to your door.

So yes, New York, Party City is alive—and just in time for your last-minute costume panic.

[TITLE]Wagyu Beef Market Size, Forecast Trends and Growth Analysis Report 2025-2034 - Rising Demand for Premium, Traceable Meats in Upscale Settings Across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Wagyu Beef Market Size and Share Outlook - Forecast Trends and Growth Analysis Report (2025-2034)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global Wagyu beef market was valued at USD 25.50 Billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.70% during the forecast period of 2025-2034. Rising demand for traceable, hormone-free premium meat in upscale hospitality chains is positioning Wagyu as a key product in luxury menus across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. In turn, the market is expected to reach a value of USD 48.77 Billion by 2034.

Factors like premiumization trends, evolving protein demands, and robust government-supported food safety initiatives have significantly propelled the market growth. As of 2024, Japan exported over 282 tons of Wagyu beef, with the United States, Hong Kong, and Australia among its largest buyers. In response, countries like Australia and the United States have aggressively ramped up domestic production. As per the Wagyu beef market analysis, Australian Wagyu beef exports jumped 12% in 2023, fuelled by government grants under the AgriFutures Emerging Industries programme aimed at improving genetic breeding technologies.

The market growth depends on the growing global demand for gourmet delicacies. Customers pay a premium for Wagyu's incomparable flavour, softness, and excellent marbling properties. This growing preference for high-quality, opulent dining experiences has resulted in the product's growing acceptance among upscale hotels, fine dining chains, and high-end retailers, over the forecast period. In Australia, Wagyu cattle herd numbers crossed 300,000 in 2023, while exports from the United States grew by 9% year-over-year due to increasing demand from affluent Asian markets.

Moreover, traceability technologies are gaining momentum, accelerating the overall Wagyu beef market development. In March 2024, Japan's National Livestock Breeding Center launched a blockchain-based ID system for Wagyu cattle, which guarantees authenticity and enhances export credibility. This kind of innovation resonates with B2B buyers keen on transparency and supply chain accountability. In addition, key players are increasingly investing in digital direct-to-chef models, AI-powered breeding, and lab-cultivated Wagyu fat for enhanced flavour replication.

Investments are also widening the scope of Wagyu beef market expansion. Japanese firm ZEN-NOH invested USD 40 million in a new processing plant in California in 2024 to localize Wagyu processing and distribution. Simultaneously, the EU funded a USD 15 million initiative aimed at enhancing protein production capacity in Germany and France. These developments are expected to streamline logistics, improve product availability, and help producers cater better to evolving B2B demand patterns across global gourmet and hospitality sectors.

Key Trends and Recent Developments

AI-Driven Cattle Breeding Systems

The integration of AI in Wagyu cattle breeding is disrupting the traditional supply chain, boosting further Wagyu beef market opportunities. According to the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, farms using AI-assisted genetics have reported a 15% increase in yield grades. These advancements reduce genetic bottlenecks and align production with export demand, providing a competitive edge. For B2B buyers, this trend offers consistency in quality and better ROI. Companies across Australia and the United States are now testing similar systems to boost international competitiveness.

Blockchain for Meat Authentication

Blockchain is redefining the Wagyu beef market dynamics. For example, Vietnam rolled out a nation-wide blockchain traceability framework for Wagyu in Japan, enabling buyers to verify lineage, feed inputs, and slaughter conditions with a QR scan. This technological advancement addresses rising concerns over food fraud, where mislabelled meat can severely undermine brand credibility. For example, in 2023, Vietnam Blockchain Corporation (VBC) implemented a blockchain-based traceability system for Wagyu beef in Japan. This initiative, part of the Agridential.vn project, aimed to enhance transparency in the beef supply chain by allowing consumers to verify product authenticity through QR codes. For B2B distributors and gourmet buyers, such transparency is becoming a deciding factor for procurement and menu pricing strategies.

Lab-Cultivated Wagyu Fat Integration

Hybrid meats are making inroads into luxury markets, appealing to affluent consumers seeking sustainable yet premium protein alternatives, accelerating the Wagyu beef demand. These hybrid products, which blend Wagyu genetics with other premium breeds, are designed to deliver the signature marbling and tenderness of Wagyu while enhancing yield, sustainability, and cost-efficiency. In high-end markets like Singapore and the UAE, chefs and distributors are embracing hybrid Wagyu for its versatility and culinary appeal. This trend is elevating consumer experience and also allowing producers to scale Wagyu offerings without compromising on quality.

Premiumization of Wagyu Beef Products

The premiumization trend in the Wagyu beef market is reshaping the way high-value protein is marketed and consumed across B2B sectors. Luxury-focused innovations are at the forefront of this movement. For instance, Japanese A5-grade Wagyu, often reserved for ultra-fine dining, is now being curated into branded, traceable packages with blockchain-backed origin tracking, especially for export to Europe and North America. Moreover, companies are introducing value-added Wagyu formats like dry-aged cuts, Wagyu charcuterie, and smoked brisket kits aimed at gourmet retailers and boutique butchers.

Export-Driven Government Incentives

Several governments now see Wagyu as a cultural export and economic asset. Japan's 2024 policy update under the Export Expansion Strategy allocated JPY 3.2 billion to support overseas promotions and logistics subsidies for meat exporters. Meanwhile, Australia's AgriFutures programme funds for genetic innovation and international trade shows further contributed to expanding the global footprint. The United States included Wagyu beef in its Export Credit Guarantee Program, enabling exporters to explore emerging markets like Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.

Global Wagyu Beef Market Regional Analysis

Asia Pacific Registers the Leading Position in the Market

The continued dominance of the Asia Pacific Wagyu beef market is powered by Japan and Australia. Japan's Wagyu exports hit JPY 45 billion in 2024, with South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong as top buyers. Emerging markets like Thailand and Vietnam are growing, aided by rising disposable incomes. Regional trade agreements like RCEP further ease cross-border transactions. Government-backed breeding stations in Australia and genetic R&D hubs in Japan ensure quality consistency, reinforcing APAC's stronghold in the global market.

Competitive Landscape

The Wagyu beef market players are investing in AI-enhanced breeding, blockchain for traceability, and hybrid meat technologies to distinguish their product offerings. They are employing direct-to-chef and e-commerce strategies to reduce reliance on intermediaries and personalize customer engagement. Regulatory compliance and global certifications have become key concerns especially as more buyers demand verifiable genetics and sustainable practices.

Most of the Wagyu beef companies find opportunities in emerging Asian and Middle Eastern markets, where luxury dining trend is growing fast. Additionally, collaborations with culinary schools and digital food influencers are opening up new revenue streams. Brands are also leveraging data analytics to track consumer behaviour, optimize distribution routes, and forecast demand spikes during festive or event-driven seasons.

[TITLE]This Luxury Laundry Detergent Wants to Take the Place of Your Beloved Perfume:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

Innovation has been the modus operandi of the perfume industry as of late, what with Dolce & Gabbana’s first-ever fragrance for dogs; the Instagram-viral perfume brand Ffern pioneering a production model that launches bespoke perfumes only four times a year and only for those whose names are on its ledger; as well as similar developments that inspire both curiosity and a mad rush to acquire such creations.

Fabric care company The Laundress, though, is approaching things in an even more unique way. Its premise is simple: Traditional perfume should be completely optional if your laundry detergent can take its place (and do a better job at elevating your mood through aromatic concoctions). The eco-conscious laundry brand was founded all the way back in 2004 by two fashion executives, at which point its mission was to provide customers with dry-cleaning alternatives in the form of products that “treat your clothes like heirlooms” with “fabric-loving ingredients.”

Now, The Laundress is putting how your clothes smell first: transforming dirty laundry into pieces you can both wear and treat as a stand-in for that bottle of Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia you have on hand at all times. The brand just cut the ribbon on its Indulgent Collection, which includes three laundry detergents-cum-fine fragrances that operate on the basis of BioRadiance enzyme technology — which not only infuses fabrics with a potent scent that lasts up to a week but also boosts their tensile strength and ensures they’re spared from dullness.

The Laundress’ latest laundry detergent releases want to dethrone your favorite perfume. Courtsy The Laundress

Flora Luna (which our editors already tested and can only describe as “stepping into a lush garden at midnight, where each flower bud is wrapped in mist”) is a detergent made for all those who prefer scents that are powered by florals without venturing into saccharine territory. “Not polite, not powdered; Flora Luna is a floral with teeth,” the company says on the product’s landing page, which tracks well with its blend of jasmine, vetiver, gardenia, centifolia rose, and more. Because each part of the Indulgent Collection is meant to generate a distinctive mood, what you’ll be getting here is sensuality and daringness (think sneaking out from your window to have a moonlight tryst with your lover, à la Romeo and Juliet).

Soft Focus, on the other hand, is more grounded and enigmatic. Its fusion of sandalwood, cardamom, ambrette seed, and other notes is ideal for days when you feel the need for a stabilizing force. And while it is hard to believe a laundry detergent, out of all things, can affect moods to such an extent, countless studies have proven that our olfactory receptors send signals generated by every inhalation of a particular scent directly to the amygdala, which is the emotional center of the brain.

And in case the impending gloom of winter is making you crave a reset of sorts, replete with newfound energy and vibrancy, look no further than The Laundress’ new Fresh Take detergent. Its purpose is already in the name: to not only help your white t-shirts and button-ups feel fresher but extend the same effect to their wearer. You’ll be surprised by the luminosity of ingredients like bergamot, turmeric, and peppercorn that come with this offering, whose sharpness is cut through by the sweetness of fig and the citrusy woodiness of petitgrain.

Need an uplifting force in your life? The Laundress’ Fresh Take Laundry Detergent promises to invigorate your spirits for as long as it clings to your clothes. The Laundress

All three of the selections in The Laundress’ Indulgent Collection are good for approximately 15 medium loads and come meticulously wrapped (it’s fine time for something as integral in our lives as laundry detergent to acquire the status of a gift). Don’t want to go overboard with your pour, no matter how tempted you are to do so? Don’t forget to add The Laundress’ handy laundry measuring cup to cart.

Gone are the days of laundry detergent fragrances that go by names like “Super Fresh Blast” or, worse, the cryptic “Original.” You deserve to feel pampered at every point of your day, separating lights from darks included.

[TITLE]Is It Just Us? Or Are Engagement Rings Getting Bigger?:
[TEXT]
19 min read

This year has established the fact that our collective fascination with engagement rings—their cuts, their sizes, and their costs—is endless. While diamonds have always (and probably forever will be) a point of intrigue, 2025 alone has brought us Zendaya’s widely imitated 5.02-carat cushion-cut ring, disbelief over Georgina Rodríguez’s mammoth 35-carat rock, and some genuine moral panic over the .089-carat ring Belly Conklin received on The Summer I Turned Pretty. Then, of course, there was also the engagement heard around the world (hint: your English teacher and your gym teacher), which ushered in even more rock analyses
