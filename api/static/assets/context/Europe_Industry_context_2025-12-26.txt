[TITLE]Central SOEs urged to push upgrading:

China will push its centrally administered State-owned enterprises to pursue both the upgrading of traditional industries and the development of emerging sectors in 2026, as part of efforts to support overall economic growth and better serve public needs, the country's top State assets regulator said.

Speaking at a meeting of heads of central SOEs held in Beijing earlier this week, Zhang Yuzhuo, chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, or SASAC, said the government will continue to sustain momentum in key fields such as new energy, electric vehicles, new materials, aerospace, the low-altitude economy, quantum technology and 6G next year.

Zhang said that the SASAC will foster and expand new consumption scenarios in areas including culture and tourism, the digital economy and healthcare to cultivate new growth drivers and underpin overall economic development.

Backed by advances in artificial intelligence, central SOEs will roll out a new round of digital transformation across a wide range of sectors, while accelerating the tiered development of smart factories.

"These efforts will be accompanied by continued investment in technological upgrading and large-scale equipment upgrades, as well as more rigorous energy-saving and carbon-reduction retrofits in key industries, to speed up the overall transition," he added.

At the same time, policymakers will promote more integrated development models, encouraging companies to move from pure manufacturing toward integrated manufacturing-and-services operations, and to upgrade service activities from labor-intensive to knowledge-intensive segments.

Zhang said that strategic and specialized restructuring, and high-quality mergers and acquisitions will also be advanced to strengthen central SOEs' competitiveness and efficiency in 2026.

As the government has sharpened its focus on the real economy and core business activities, and moved to optimize the structure and allocation of State-owned assets this year, resources have increasingly been channeled into areas related to national security, critical sectors of the economy and essential public needs, according to the commission.

For example, strategic and specialized restructuring has continued this year, marked by the establishment of China Yajiang Group Co Ltd and China Changan Automobile Group Co Ltd, alongside asset integrations in power batteries by China FAW Group Corp and cruise operations by China Tourism Group, improving the efficiency of resource allocation.

During the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period, central SOEs invested more than 5 trillion yuan ($711 billion) in research and development, delivered a steady flow of major innovation breakthroughs, and posted average annual investment growth of over 20 percent in emerging industries, said the SASAC.

Over the same period, the government carried out six strategic restructurings involving 10 central SOEs, and established nine new groups with different functions.

China Changan Automobile Group, one of three centrally administered State-owned automotive groups, was established in July through a restructuring of the former Changan Automobile and some other companies.

Building on the production base of its predecessor operations, the group saw its 30 millionth vehicle roll off the production line early this month, just over four years after reaching the 20 millionth milestone.

Zhu Huarong, the group's chairman, said that in addition to expanding sales in overseas markets, the Chongqing-headquartered group will step up its transition toward electrification, connectivity and intelligent systems in 2026.

Chen Wenjian, chairman of China Railway Group Ltd, a Beijing-headquartered railway and infrastructure project contractor, said the central SOE will sharpen its focus on integrating technological and industrial innovation to strengthen core competitiveness during the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) period.

"We will focus on upgrading traditional sectors rather than simply expanding capacity," said Chen. "In the construction business, this means accelerating a shift toward smarter, greener and more integrated models, with artificial intelligence deployed to deliver practical, scenario-based applications across our projects."

[TITLE]New England unions push back against Trump admin’s move to freeze offshore wind projects:
[TEXT]
Worker unions and politicians in New England are pushing back against the Trump administration’s move to implement a 90-day freeze on five industrial-sized offshore wind projects off the East Coast, including the Vineyard Wind 1 windfarm off of Nantucket.

Ironworkers Local 7, which represents over 3,600 workers across New England, including a total of 50 who were contracted to work on the affected offshore wind projects, has called on the administration to reverse its decision.

“We are thoroughly disgusted and furious that this administration has chosen to put hard-working tradespeople out of work just before the holidays and put the prosperity of middle class union members in peril. The Trump administration’s cancellation of several New England offshore wind projects is destroying American jobs. Fifty union ironworkers have been laid off and their families are now facing an uncertain future,” the union said in a written statement.

“Whatever your political ideology, it is undeniable that Vineyard Wind is already providing much needed power to 400,000 homes and businesses across Massachusetts. We need energy diversification to lower bills for working Americans and Vineyard Wind is a shining example of a project that is working,” the union added.

But according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, just one natural gas pipeline would produce substantially more power than the five offshore wind projects combined.

“This is the most expensive form of energy we’re producing is offshore wind. It’s not reliable, it only works when the wind is blowing, it is expensive, and of course, it depends on foreign suppliers almost completely for this industry,” Burgum explained Monday during an interview on Fox News. “And we have a solution in New England, right there, which is natural gas from Pennsylvania, which would generate power five-to-ten times more than all these five wind projects together.”

Burgum’s comments come just a week after Gov. Maura Healey again changed her stance on if she’s responsible for stopping two natural gas pipelines from coming to Massachusetts when she was attorney general. It’s a topic that has turned into a game of political football between Healey and her three Republican challengers in 2026, with the governor now acknowledging she stopped the pipeline projects.

“They were a lousy deal for ratepayers and I’ve got to stand up for people in Massachusetts. I thought it was wrong for ratepayers, people, residents, taxpayers in Massachusetts to foot the bill for those pipelines, instead of the pipeline companies,” Healey said.

Healey is now joining other Northeast governors reacting to the decision to pause the wind farm projects.

On Tuesday, Healey, Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issued a joint-statement against the Trump admin’s move, saying it will result in higher costs for American ratepayers.

“The Trump administration’s announcement yesterday pausing offshore wind leases is its latest egregious attack on clean energy and it lands like a lump of dirty coal for the holiday season for American workers, consumers, and investors. Pausing active leases, especially for completed and nearly completed projects, defies logic, will hurt our bid for energy independence, will drive up costs for America ratepayers, and will make us lose thousands of good-paying jobs. It also threatens grid reliability that is needed to keep the lights on,” the group of governors said.

“This baseless, reckless and erratic action from the Department of Interior will also inject further uncertainty into the markets, making it harder for states and private companies to secure financing for public works projects if investors know they can be stopped at any time despite having gone through all the necessary local and federal approval processes,” they said.

The Trump admin says the temporary pause on the projects are due to national security concerns and will allow the Interior Department, which oversees the projects, the necessary time it needs to work with the Defense Department on mitigating security risks.

No specific national security risks have been mentioned by the administration. However, the Interior Department has said unclassified documents show the spinning of the massive turbine blades paired with the reflection from the towers causes issues with radar systems, according to the Associated Press.

“Modern warfare is drone warfare and the radar interference caused by these massive, gargantuan projects, understanding that a single one of these towers can be one-and-a-half times taller than the Washington Monument. The blades themselves, the diameter of the blades is bigger than the Statue of Liberty, two-and-a-half football fields,” Secretary Burgum also said during his Monday interview on Fox News.

“These things are moving at 150 miles-per-hour and our ground-based radar is designed to pick up movement. If you wanted to attack a population center on the East Coast of our country, you would send a swarm of drones right through one of these wind farms,” he said.

U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey are demanding access to the classified documents and reports cited by the Trump admin. In a letter Tuesday to Burgum and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, the senators demanded they respond by the end of the week to set up a date and time when “we can view these documents.”

“These purported lease pauses will have the effect of putting Americans out of work, destabilizing our energy grid, and causing electricity prices to soar during the expensive home heating season. According to our regional grid operator, Independent System Operator-New England (ISO-NE), ‘canceling or delaying these projects will increase costs and risks to reliability in our region,’ ” Warren and Markey said.

The Vineyard Wind project had been using the Port of New Bedford as a wind turbine manufacturing hub, offering a close and direct route to the Vineyard Sound for installation, employing hundreds of workers in the area. Mayor Jon Mitchell sounded off Tuesday on the impact the decision will have on his city.

“People can debate whether offshore wind is a cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change. But my concerns are primarily parochial. There is literally hundreds of millions of dollars of new port investment here that wouldn’t have happened if offshore wind hadn’t been in the offing,” Mitchell said on local radio outlet WBSM.

“And so when the president, in a swipe of a pen, says, stop the project, it kicks people off the job three days before Christmas, and says it’s about national security, even though the national security implications of that development have been vetted decisively over the last 15 years, to me it’s a shame,” he said.

The Vineyard Wind project is located 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket and claims it could power 400,000 homes and businesses while reducing carbon emissions by over 1.6 million tons per year.

[TITLE]Activist Ananym Capital urges LKQ to sell its European auto parts business:
[TEXT]
Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.

Activist: Ananym Capital Management

Ownership: 0.39%

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.

What's happening

On Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

Behind the scenes

LKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers.

The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers.

Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint.

Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.

LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount.

The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000 . However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock.

In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.

Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment.

Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries.

Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.

The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA.

The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA.

The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price.

While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone , and Genuine Parts , may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that.

Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.

In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time.

If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders.

Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

[TITLE]Stocks See Support from Economic Confidence After Strong US GDP Report:
[TEXT]
The Wall Street sign is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange by hapabapa via iStock

The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Tuesday rose +0.46%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) rose +0.16%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) rose +0.50%. March E-mini S&P futures (ESH26) rose +0.42%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH26) rose +0.49%.

Stock indexes closed higher on Tuesday on reinforced confidence in US economic fundamentals after the stronger-than-expected US Q3 GDP report of +4.3%, although most of the other economic reports were weaker-than-expected. In any case, stocks were undercut as the odds for a Fed rate cut at the next meeting on Jan 27-28 dropped to 13% from 20%. Also, the 10-year T-note yield rose slightly.

US Q3 real GDP rose +4.3% (q/q annualized), stronger than expectations of +3.3% and the Q2 rate of +2.5%. The Q3 GDP Price Index rose +3.8% (q/q annualized), much stronger than expectations of +2.7% and up from Q2’s +2.1%. The Q3 core PCE Price Index rose +2.9% (q/q annualized), in line with expectations but up from Q2’s +2.6%.

The Conference Board’s Dec US consumer confidence index fell by -3.8 points to 89.1 from Nov’s revised level of 92.9 (preliminary 88.7), weaker than expectations for a report of 91.0.

The Dec Philadelphia Fed non-manufacturing index fell by -0.5 points to -16.8 from -16.3 in Nov, which was weaker than expectations for a rise to -15.0.

Oct durable goods orders fell -2.2% m/m, which was weaker than expectations of -1.5%. Oct durable goods orders ex-transportation rose +0.2% m/m, slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.3%. Oct core capital goods orders (ex transportation and defense), a proxy for capital spending, rose +0.5% m/m, which was slightly stronger than market expectations of +0.3%.

Nov US industrial production fell -0.1% m/m, slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.1%. Nov manufacturing production fell -0.4% m/m, weaker than market expectations of +0.1%.

The Dec Richmond Fed manufacturing index rose by +8 points to -7 from Nov’s -15, and was stronger than market expectations of -10.

Seasonal factors are bullish for stocks. According to data from Citadel Securities, since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, climbing 1.3% on average.

The markets are discounting a 13% chance that the FOMC will cut the fed funds target range by 25 bp at the next FOMC meeting on January 27-28.

Overseas stock markets rose slightly on Tuesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.10%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.07% for the fifth consecutive daily gain. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.02%.

Interest Rates

March 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) on Tuesday fell by -1.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose by +0.2 bp to 4.165%. T-note prices fell on the stronger-than-expected US Q3 GDP report of +4.3%, although most of the other economic reports released Tuesday were mildly weaker than expected on balance.

T-note prices were also undercut by supply overhang. The Treasury on Tuesday sold $70 billion of 5-year T-notes and $28 billion of 2-year floating rate notes. The Treasury will sell $44 billion of 7-year T-notes on Wednesday.

European government bond yields ended lower. The 10-year German bund yield on Tuesday fell back from Monday’s 9-month high and ended the day down -3.6 bp at 2.862%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell by -2.7 bp to 4.509%.

Swaps are discounting a 0% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on February 5.

Riot Platforms (RIOT) fell by more than -5%, and Strategy (MSTR) fell by nearly -4%. Coinbase Global (COIN) and Mara Holdings (MARA) fell by more than -2%.

Miners saw support as gold, silver, and copper all posted new record highs on Tuesday. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) closed up +2.5%, and Newmont Mining (NEM) closed up +0.35%.

Sable Offshore Corp (SOC) soared by +36% after news that the US Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration approved the company’s Las Flores pipeline restart plan.

• Revenue was $95.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $66.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Gross profit was $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $2.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Loss from operations was $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 116.6% from $1.1 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Net income was $0.04 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 96.9% from $1.3 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.01 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $0.05 for the same period of the last fiscal year.

Revenue

Total revenue was $95.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 42.11% from $66.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. This increase was mainly attributable to a increase in demand for liquid sugar from our customers, compared to the same corresponding period.

• Revenue from sales of sugar was $60.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 35.4% from $44.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was mainly due to stronger sales of liquid sugar in the China market and higher demand for Brazilian sugar from the Africa region. • Revenue from sales of rice was $19.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 41.3% from $14.0 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was mainly attributable to market development efforts in the Africa region, as well as lower rice prices from the end of last year to mid-2025, which encouraged higher sales volume. • Revenue from sales of oil and fat products was $14.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 81.0% from $8.0 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to lower oil prices during the first half of 2025, which stimulated demand and sales growth. • Revenue from sales of others was $0.01 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to nil for the same period of the last fiscal year. The sale of others represented random sales of creamer based on customer requests and orders.

A breakdown of revenue in terms of geographic regions for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2025 is summarized below:

For the six months ended June 30, (US$’000) ($ thousands) 2024 % 2025 % Variance Change (%) Africa $ 40,112 60.0 $ 66,162 69.6 26,050 64.9 China 5,762 8.6 15,232 16.0 9,470 164.4 Vietnam 2,734 4.1 1,252 1.3 (1,482 ) (54.2 ) Thailand 8,662 13.0 1,589 1.7 (7,073 ) (81.7 ) Singapore 4,923 7.4 4,825 5.1 (98 ) (2.0 ) Other countries 4,683 7.0 5,976 6.3 1,293 27.6 Total revenue $ 66,876 100.0 $ 95,036 100.0 28,160 42.1

• Revenue from Africa was $66.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by $26.1 million, or 64.9%, from $40.1 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The growth was primarily due to the Company’s continued market development efforts and successful engagement of new customers, particularly in the West and East African regions. These initiatives expanded the customer base and strengthened the Company’s market presence. • Revenue from the China was $15.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which rose significantly by $9.5 million, or 164.4%, from $5.8 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The sharp increase was mainly attributed to the Company’s growing market share in liquid sugar, which continues to gain traction among food and beverage manufacturers in China. The Company also benefited from improved supply chain efficiency and strong customer retention in this segment. • Revenue from Vietnam was $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by $1.5 million, or 54.2%, from $2.7 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to regulatory changes following China’s ban on premix sugar imports from Vietnam in March 2025. • Revenue from Thailand was $1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased sharply by $7.1 million, or 81.7%, from $8.7 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The decrease was mainly due to regulatory changes following China’s ban on premix sugar imports from Thailand effective December 2024, which significantly affected trading activities. • Revenue from Singapore was $4.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased slightly by $0.1 million, or 2.0%, from $4.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The Company’s local operations remained relatively stable, supported by steady customer demand in its home market. • The overall global prices and regulatory changes can significantly impact the revenue.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue was $92.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 44.5% from $64.0 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the increased in revenue as described above, which was contributed by higher demand for the Company’s sugar, rice and oil products from customers.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit was $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 9.8% from $2.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. Sugar prices held relatively firm during the period; however, rising purchase and transportation costs compressed margins, leading to a decrease in gross profit despite continued demand strength. Global supply for rice hit record highs, pushing prices down. Many traders still held older, higher-cost inventories, and logistics and packaging costs stayed elevated, which leading to narrower profit margins even though raw rice costs weren’t rising. Production of oils and fats products increased and demand softened, causing weaker selling prices while increased in upstream costs has narrowing the margin.

Overall gross margin was 2.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to 4.4% for the same period of the last fiscal year. Although sales volume increased, gross profit and gross margin decreased as higher raw material and logistics costs were not fully passed on to customers. Lower selling prices for rice and oils and fats products further squeezed margins, resulting in a decline in overall profitability despite revenue growth.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses were $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 57.9% from $1.8 million for the same period of the last fiscal year.

• Selling and marketing expenses were $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 92.5% from $0.4 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to increase in sales commissions payable arising from the increase in revenue, along with business developments cost and the amortization of prepaid consultancy fees. • General and administrative expenses were $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increased of 46.6% from $1.3 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was mainly attributable to higher legal and professional fees incurred in connection with additional regulatory filings and fees paid to external consultants for listed-company and capital market advisory services, amounting to approximately $0.5 million. In addition, the Company recorded approximately US$0.2 million in impairment losses, primarily relating to provision of expected credit loss, reflecting a more prudent assessment of credit risk during the period.

Other Income and Interest Expense

Other income was $0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 27.8% from $0.6 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The decrease in other income was mainly attributable to the absence of ECL reversals and a reduction in government grants recognized during the year. This was partially mitigated by write-back of trade credit balances no longer payable.

Interest expense was $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 113.3% from $0.1 million for the same period of last fiscal year. The increase was mainly as a result of interest and associated charges from newly activated bank facilities that began at the beginning of the year.

Profit before Tax and Income Tax Expense

Profit before tax was $0.04 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 96.9% from $1.6 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. Correspondingly, income tax was nil for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by $0.3 million from $0.3 million for the same period of last fiscal year.

Net Income

Net income was $0.04 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 96.9% from $1.3 million for the same period of last fiscal year.

Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.002 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $0.05 for same period of the last fiscal year.

Financial Condition

As of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 million, compared to $0.7 million as of December 31, 2024.

Net cash used by operating activities was $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025. The cash outflow from operating activities primarily reflected (i) non-cash adjustments of approximately $0.1 million, mainly comprising depreciation of property, plant and equipment, unrealized gain on derivative contracts, allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, unpaid interest expenses and interest income, and (ii) changes in working capital that resulted in a net outflow of approximately $2.3 million. The movements in working capital were mainly due to a significant increase in accounts payable and accruals of $17.4 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts and other receivable of $20.0 million, as well as a decrease in inventories and increase in margin call amounting to $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

Net cash used in investing activities was $0.001 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily attributable to the purchase of property, plant and equipment.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025. The cash inflows were mainly contributed by new bank borrowings of $12.6 million and proceeds from a related party of $0.4 million, partially offset by repayment of bank borrowings of $9.1 million, repayment of amount due to related parties of $0.6 million, and principal payments on finance lease liabilities.

[TITLE]AMCS losses triple to €60m as it books costs linked to takeover:
[TEXT]
Revenues soared in 2024 at Limerick-based tech firm

Limerick-based tech firm Advanced Manufacturing Control Systems (AMCS) saw its losses almost triple to €60.4m last year as it incurred a total of €45m in transactions associated with the sale of a majority stake in the business in November 2024.

Last year, Swedish private equity firm EQT bought a majority stake in AMCS in a deal that valued the Irish company at €2.1bn.

The Irish business, which employs more than 1,200 people, is a supplier of cloud-based AI-enabled planning, performance and safety software that is used in the waste management and recycling sectors, as well as in other resource-intensive industries.

As part of the deal with EQT, AMCS co-founder and CEO Jimmy Martin, management and other existing investors, including Insight Partners, Clearlake Capital, Highland Europe and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, all retained minority stakes.

Newly-filed accounts for AMCS show that turnover jumped to €68.3m last year from €56.5m in 2023.

Recently-filed accounts for the group holding company, Arctic Topco, note that AMCS delivered a “robust financial performance” in 2024, underpinned by what it said was impressive growth in both annual recurring revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), “signalling sustained momentum and operational discipline”.

The adjusted Ebitda for AMCS last year was €7.9m. That was a 47pc increase compared to 2023. The adjusted figure excludes foreign exchange gains and losses and includes the margin on revenues flowing through from opening deferred revenue on acquisitions made during the year.

AMCS reported a 15pc year-on-year increase in annual recurring revenue (ARR) last year, reflecting new customer acquisition, high retention rates and strong upsell activity within its existing customer base.

“This surge in recurring revenue underscores the resilience of AMCS’ business model and the value of its solutions provided in the market,” note the Arctic Topco accounts.

Those accounts note that the margin improvement seen during 2024 reflects disciplined cost management, optimised sales and marketing spend, and increasing operating leverage as the business grows.

“With a strong ARR base and improving Ebitda margins, AMCS is well positioned to continue its growth trajectory,” they added.

Last year, AMCS acquired US-based solutions provider Qv21 Technologies. Qv21 Technologies is a software service solutions provider for short-haul, bulk commodity transportation.

In April this year, AMCS acquired Selected Interventions and Mandalay Technologies. Selected Interventions is a UK-based, global resource management software company and Mandalay Technologies is an Australia-headquartered provider of modular cloud-based weighbridge and data management solutions.

[TITLE]Central SOEs urged to push upgrading:
[TEXT]

China will push its centrally administered State-owned enterprises to pursue both the upgrading of traditional industries and the development of emerging sectors in 2026, as part of efforts to support overall economic growth and better serve public needs, the country's top State assets regulator said.

Speaking at a meeting of heads of central SOEs held in Beijing earlier this week, Zhang Yuzhuo, chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, or SASAC, said the government will continue to sustain momentum in key fields such as new energy, electric vehicles, new materials, aerospace, the low-altitude economy, quantum technology and 6G next year.

Zhang said that the SASAC will foster and expand new consumption scenarios in areas including culture and tourism, the digital economy and healthcare to cultivate new growth drivers and underpin overall economic development.

Backed by advances in artificial intelligence, central SOEs will roll out a new round of digital transformation across a wide range of sectors, while accelerating the tiered development of smart factories.

"These efforts will be accompanied by continued investment in technological upgrading and large-scale equipment upgrades, as well as more rigorous energy-saving and carbon-reduction retrofits in key industries, to speed up the overall transition," he added.

At the same time, policymakers will promote more integrated development models, encouraging companies to move from pure manufacturing toward integrated manufacturing-and-services operations, and to upgrade service activities from labor-intensive to knowledge-intensive segments.

Zhang said that strategic and specialized restructuring, and high-quality mergers and acquisitions will also be advanced to strengthen central SOEs' competitiveness and efficiency in 2026.

As the government has sharpened its focus on the real economy and core business activities, and moved to optimize the structure and allocation of State-owned assets this year, resources have increasingly been channeled into areas related to national security, critical sectors of the economy and essential public needs, according to the commission.

For example, strategic and specialized restructuring has continued this year, marked by the establishment of China Yajiang Group Co Ltd and China Changan Automobile Group Co Ltd, alongside asset integrations in power batteries by China FAW Group Corp and cruise operations by China Tourism Group, improving the efficiency of resource allocation.

During the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period, central SOEs invested more than 5 trillion yuan ($711 billion) in research and development, delivered a steady flow of major innovation breakthroughs, and posted average annual investment growth of over 20 percent in emerging industries, said the SASAC.

Over the same period, the government carried out six strategic restructurings involving 10 central SOEs, and established nine new groups with different functions.

China Changan Automobile Group, one of three centrally administered State-owned automotive groups, was established in July through a restructuring of the former Changan Automobile and some other companies.

Building on the production base of its predecessor operations, the group saw its 30 millionth vehicle roll off the production line early this month, just over four years after reaching the 20 millionth milestone.

Zhu Huarong, the group's chairman, said that in addition to expanding sales in overseas markets, the Chongqing-headquartered group will step up its transition toward electrification, connectivity and intelligent systems in 2026.

Chen Wenjian, chairman of China Railway Group Ltd, a Beijing-headquartered railway and infrastructure project contractor, said the central SOE will sharpen its focus on integrating technological and industrial innovation to strengthen core competitiveness during the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) period.

"We will focus on upgrading traditional sectors rather than simply expanding capacity," said Chen. "In the construction business, this means accelerating a shift toward smarter, greener and more integrated models, with artificial intelligence deployed to deliver practical, scenario-based applications across our projects."

[TITLE]Georgia Regulators Approve Huge Electric Generation Increase for Data Centers:
[TEXT]
Georgia’s only private electric utility plans to increase power capacity by 50% after state regulators on Friday agreed 5-0 that the plan is needed to meet projected demand from data centers.

It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence. The construction cost would be $16.3 billion, but staff members say customers will pay $50 billion to $60 billion over coming decades, including interest costs and guaranteed profit for the monopoly utility.

Georgia Power Co. and the Public Service Commission pledge large users will more than pay for their costs, and that spreading fixed costs over more customers, could help significantly cut residents’ power bills beginning in 2029.

“Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that’s a great result for Georgians,” Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said in a statement after the vote.

But opponents say the five elected Republicans on the commission are greenlighting a risky bet by the utility to chase data center customers with existing ratepayers left holding the bag if demand doesn’t materialize.

“The need for 10,000 megawatts of new capacity resources on the system in the next six years isn’t here,” said Bob Sherrier, a lawyer representing some opponents. “It just isn’t, and it may never be.”

The approval came less than two months after voters rebuked GOP leadership, ousting two incumbent Republicans on the commission in favor of Democrats by overwhelming margins. Those two Democrats won in campaigns that centered on six Georgia Power rate increases commissioners have allowed in recent years, even though the company agreed to a three-year rate freeze in July.

Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson — the Democrats who will take office Jan. 1 — opposed Friday’s vote. But current commissioners refused to delay.

Electric bills have emerged as a potent political issue in Georgia and nationwide, with grassroots opposition to data centers partly based on fears that other customers will subsidize power demands of technology behemoths.

Georgia Power is the largest unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. It says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity — enough to power 4 million Georgia homes — with 80% of that flowing to data centers. The company has 2.7 million customers today, including homes, businesses and industries.

Whether the company’s projections of a huge increase in demand will pan out has been the central argument. Georgia Power and commission staff agreed Dec. 9 to allow the company to build or acquire all the desired capacity, despite staff earlier saying the company’s forecast included too much speculative construction.

In return, the company agreed that after the current rate freeze ends in 2028, it would use revenue from new customers to place “downward pressure” on rates through 2031. That would amount to at least $8.50 a month, or $102 a year, for a typical residential customer. That customer currently pays more than $175 a month, including taxes.

“So we’re taking advantage of the upsides from this additional revenue, but allow it to shift the downside and the risk over to the company. And I’m real proud of that,” Commission Chairman Jason Shaw said after the vote.

But “downward pressure” doesn’t guarantee a rate decrease.

“It doesn’t mean your bills are going down,” said Liz Coyle, executive director of consumer group Georgia Watch. “It means that maybe they’re not going up as fast.”

Existing customers would pay for part of the construction program that doesn’t serve data centers. More importantly, opponents fear Georgia Power’s pledge of rate relief can’t be enforced, or won’t hold up over the 40-plus years needed to pay off new natural-gas fired power plants.

In a Monday news conference, Hubbard likened it to a mortgage “to build a massive addition to your home for a new roommate, big tech.”

“If in 10 years, the AI bubble bursts or the data centers move to a cheaper state, then the roommate moves out, but the mortgage doesn’t go away,” he said.

Staff members say the commission must watch demand closely and that if data centers don’t use as much power as projected, Georgia Power must drop agreements to purchase wholesale power, close its least efficient generating plants and seek additional customers.

Many opponents oppose any new generation fueled by natural gas, warning carbon emissions will worsen climate change. Some opponents were escorted out of the commission meeting by police after they began chanting “Nay! Nay! Nay! The people say nay!”

“Increased natural gas output for the sake of these silicon billionaire kings seems like a lose-lose,” opponent Zak Norton told commissioners Friday.

During the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period, central SOEs invested more than 5 trillion yuan ($711 billion) in research and development, delivered a steady flow of major innovation breakthroughs, and posted average annual investment growth of over 20 percent in emerging industries, said the SASAC.

Over the same period, the government carried out six strategic restructurings involving 10 central SOEs, and established nine new groups with different functions.

China Changan Automobile Group, one of three centrally administered State-owned automotive groups, was established in July through a restructuring of the former Changan Automobile and some other companies.

Building on the production base of its predecessor operations, the group saw its 30 millionth vehicle roll off the production line early this month, just over four years after reaching the 20 millionth milestone.

Zhu Huarong, the group's chairman, said that in addition to expanding sales in overseas markets, the Chongqing-headquartered group will step up its transition toward electrification, connectivity and intelligent systems in 2026.

Chen Wenjian, chairman of China Railway Group Ltd, a Beijing-headquartered railway and infrastructure project contractor, said the central SOE will sharpen its focus on integrating technological and industrial innovation to strengthen core competitiveness during the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) period.

"We will focus on upgrading traditional sectors rather than simply expanding capacity," said Chen. "In the construction business, this means accelerating a shift toward smarter, greener and more integrated models, with artificial intelligence deployed to deliver practical, scenario-based applications across our projects."

[TEXT]
Hyderabad, Dec. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to Mordor Intelligence, the investment banking market is valued at USD 112.47 billion in 2025, is projected to reach USD 138.62 billion by 2030, registering a 4.27% CAGR. Improving interest-rate conditions in the United States, easing inflationary pressures, and strong corporate balance sheets are reviving mergers, acquisitions, and capital-market activity.

Regional Market Outlook

North America continues to dominate the investment banking landscape, supported by deep capital-market liquidity, favorable monetary policies, and evolving regulatory conditions. Corporates are actively refinancing debt and pursuing new equity offerings, while activity from Canada and Mexico adds strength in sectors like energy, mining, and cross-border supply chains.

Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific is emerging as the fastest-growing market, driven by structural reforms and expanding local capital markets. Banks in the region are investing in digital trade-finance solutions to capture business from SMEs and mid-sized companies, with contributions from Japan, South Korea, and Australia further bolstering technology ventures, shareholder initiatives, and infrastructure-related underwriting opportunities.

Key Market Insights

Global M&A Momentum Strengthens

Global M&A activity is gaining momentum as financing conditions improve and corporate confidence rises. Major banks expect overall deal values to grow by XX–XX% in 2025, driven by increased cross-border transactions in technology, healthcare, and industrial sectors. Private equity firms are re-entering the market to address delayed exits, supporting stronger advisory pipelines and sustained deal activity.

Revival of Public Listings and SPAC Deals

Equity-market optimism is boosting initial public offerings and SPAC activity, with technology and biotech companies leading the way, supported by strong investor interest in emerging sectors like artificial intelligence and life sciences. The return of major banks to SPAC sponsorship reflects growing confidence in regulatory frameworks and deal structures.

Tomahawk missiles are coveted by militaries around the world because they can hit a target 1,000 miles away. That accuracy is possible because their fins use powerful magnets made of samarium -- a rare-earth metal that can tolerate high heat.When China put restrictions on some rare-earth exports this year, it cut off the supply of samarium to U.S. defense contractors that sell to Raytheon, the maker of Tomahawk missiles. Samarium is processed almost exclusively in China, where more than 85% of the world's rare-earth magnets are made.A carefully orchestrated deal involving two European companies gave U.S. defense contractors access to a new source of samarium, allowing production to continue for now. But that supply -- made from material that had been sitting in a factory in France since the 1970s -- is limited. Now the Trump administration is racing to develop a new source before the European stockpile runs out.China began requiring export licenses for samarium and six other rare-earth metals in April after President Donald Trump rolled out tariffs against China and several other nations. A spokesperson at the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in an email that the export controls had been instituted to "defend world peace." Foreign companies that use samarium for military purposes are no longer allowed to buy it."No defense contractor will be able to use the same path to buy samarium metal that we've used in the past," said an executive for one of Raytheon's suppliers, who asked for anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. "You're on the naughty list. You're not getting that material."Most rare-earth magnets are made of neodymium, which is used in everyday applications such as cellphones, auto parts and electronics. But the defense industry requires samarium-cobalt magnets, which can withstand extreme heat.The stakes for finding alternatives are enormous. Unless new sources of samarium or a substitute material can be found, American manufacturers won't be able to build fighter jets or precision-guided missiles. They may be forced to sacrifice precision if they can't get the right magnets, said Aisha Haynes, a former Defense Department official responsible for supply chain issues.New systems in development -- such as hypersonic missiles -- also depend on securing non-Chinese sources of samarium."You never want to give any one nation that much power," said Haynes, who retired in April. "They can turn that source on and off whenever they want."The situation would be more dire if not for the foresight of people experienced in magnet making. Arnold Magnetic Technologies, a Rochester, New York-based manufacturer of samarium-cobalt magnets with factories in Switzerland, Thailand and China, had more than a year's supply of the metal on hand when China announced its export controls on April 4, said Aaron Williams, the company's chief commercial officer.As the summer wore on, Arnold's customers began to worry
