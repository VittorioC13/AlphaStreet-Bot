[TITLE]From Oil to Lithium: Texas's Next Energy Revolution:
[TEXT]
Major oil companies are drilling in East Texas again, but not for oil. This time, they're after lithium for batteries and other rare elements.

Chevron and Halliburton announced East Texas projects this summer. Exxon has acreage across the border in Arkansas. Smackover Lithium, a joint venture of a Norwegian oil giant and a Canadian miner, announced in late September the discovery of the most lithium-rich fluids ever reported in North America, measured deep beneath its Texas claims in a massive brine deposit called the Smackover Formation.

"It's ripe for development," said Jamie Liang, a former Wall Street banker and founder of Houston-based lithium startup TerraVolta, which is developing a lithium refinery on the Smackover with federal support. "There's tremendous growth potential."

Lithium mining is one of several mineral industries emerging in Texas as part of broad federal efforts to urgently establish American production of the materials required for advanced manufacturing, from batteries and solar cells to wind turbines, microchips and cruise missiles.

Competition with China looms over this effort. For much of this year, the world's two largest economies have been locked in trade tensions— and much of the ire is linked to minerals used in technology. This month, China announced new export controls on critical mineral products, including lithium battery components. President Trump, in social media posts, described China as "very hostile" and threatened to impose export controls on critical software and add 100 percent tariffs to Chinese imports.

Near Texarkana, the chase for lithium is backed with robust federal support. Liang's TerraVolta received $225 million from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2024 for its lithium refinery complex. This year the project was selected for fast-tracked permit review.

It will pump up the naturally metallic super-salty fluids from the Smackover, extract lithium and other minerals and then inject the leftover liquids back underground. At least two other lithium refineries are planned in the area and companies have leased tens of thousands of acres for drilling. More will likely follow as long as lithium prices stay strong.

"There's going to be a very large-scale infrastructure buildout," Liang said. "You're going to be drilling wells. You're going to need those service companies. You'll need pipelines."

Elsewhere in Texas, a mine is planned near El Paso for the rare metals used in magnets for electric motors. On the rural Gulf Coast, the Department of Defense has invested almost $300 million in a project that would process rare metals like samarium, used in jet engines, guided munitions and stealth technology. From Houston's petrochemical complex to the Permian Basin, a flurry of startups, oil majors and mining giants intend to recover minerals from industrial waste like coal ash, discarded electronics, mine tailings and oilfield wastewater in hopes of accelerating U.S. mineral supplies.

Presently, the United States produces a dribble of the raw materials. China broadly owns the global production lines, following decades of investment and securing a dominance that has raised national security concerns as well as financial risk.

The United States has just one operating lithium mine, in Nevada, where a second mine with government backing expects to begin production in 2027. Only one lithium refinery operates in the country, on the Gulf Coast of Texas.

"Our exposure to China is unacceptable," said Douglas Wicks, a former program director at the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Energy Department. It raises threats that the outbreak of conflict could leave the United States cut off from essential supply chains.

That's the biggest reason why federal agencies are pushing so hard to play catch-up and boost American mining, Wicks said. As geopolitical tensions squeeze the flow of globalized commerce, Washington hopes to challenge Beijing's monopolies in a battle of extraction.

"I think American industry can outproduce them," said Wicks, who retired this year. The United States has "the deposits to do this."

However, the United States has to contend with China's gargantuan economy where the state owns key industries and provides subsidies, preferential finance schemes and other market support. Still, Wicks said, the United States knows how to move quickly. Just consider the recent evolution of American oil and gas. Technical innovations and loosened environmental standards in the shale revolution turned the United States from the world's largest importers of oil and gas to a major exporter in barely over a decade. Wicks believes the United States can transform again.

In 2023, under the Biden administration, the Pentagon was ordered to establish mineral supply chains independent of China. Since then, billions of dollars have flowed to mining and processing projects across the country, spurring a rush of prospectors and entrepreneurs hoping to cash in on federal grants.

Wisk said, "Now there's a big push in Texas to ask: 'Is there something else under the ground other than oil and gas?"

Tiny Concentrations, Big Mines

In the desert of far-west Texas, a company called Texas Mineral Resources Corp. (TMRC) had plans to dig for rare earth elements at a 950-acre Round Top Mountain site. The company won its first Defense Department contract in 2015. In January it reported a "breakthrough," producing a sample of high-purity dysprosium, which is used in semiconductors and electric vehicle motors. .

These rare elements aren't actually hard to find. They're all over the world, but they exist in tiny concentrations that require a tremendous amount of effort to extract in significant volumes. The process also generates large waste streams.

TMRC had said it would crush up 20,000 tons of rock a day. The material then would soak for a month in pools of diluted acid and undergo a series of electromagnetic processes to separate and cull the much-desired minerals. According to TMRC, the rocks hold 15 rare earth elements and other metals including lithium, gallium, hafnium, zirconium and beryllium.

Some processed byproducts "are expected to show hazardous waste characteristics," and "the waste may contain naturally occurring radioactive material," according to a 2019 economic assessment by TMRC. It noted "potential impacts to water quality resulting from mine operations and the storage of mine waste." The operations are located in Hudspeth County, home to

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced on Tuesday that NRG Energy will build a $360 million natural gas facility in Harris County.

The 456-megawatt plant at the TH Wharton Generating Station qualifies for the state’s Jobs, Energy, Technology, and Innovation program. The expansion addresses surging electricity demand in Houston, the nation’s fifth-largest metropolitan area. Construction aims to bolster grid reliability as Texas faces growing energy needs from population growth and industrial development.

“Texas energy powers our state’s booming economy,” said Abbott. “This $360 million investment by NRG in Harris County is a significant advancement in Texas’ energy infrastructure.”

The facility will serve the Houston Load Zone, including Pasadena and The Woodlands. Operations are expected to begin by summer 2026.

Abbott emphasized the project’s role in grid stability.

“By investing in reliable, dispatchable energy, we will add more power and better fortify our grid.”

The Public Utility Commission of Texas approved a Texas Energy Fund loan agreement for the project in August. The simple-cycle plant will create construction jobs and permanent positions once operational.

Robert Gaudette, NRG’s executive vice president, praised the public-private partnership.

“Moving Texas forward to meet surging energy demand involves public-private partnership, and NRG is grateful the TH Wharton new build project is part of Governor Abbott’s innovative JETI program.”

The Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District supports the expansion.

“The TH Wharton project will accommodate the growing energy demand in the district and Houston area,” said district Chief Financial Officer Karen Smith.

Natural gas plants provide quick-start power generation critical for grid stability. The facility adds to Texas’s dispatchable energy resources amid concerns about renewable intermittency.

[TITLE]Crude Oil Rallies on Possible US-India Trade Deal and Unexpected Draw in EIA Inventories:
[TEXT]
December WTI crude oil (CLZ25) today is up +1.17 (+2.04%), and December RBOB gasoline (RBZ25) is up +0.0352 (+1.99%).

Crude oil and gasoline prices are up sharply today, reaching one-week highs. Crude prices jumped today after India's Mint newspaper reported that the US and India are nearing a trade deal that could see India gradually reduce its imports of Russian crude, which would boost oil demand from alternative suppliers. Crude prices extended their advance after weekly EIA crude inventories unexpectedly declined.

Crude also has carryover support from Tuesday, when the Trump administration announced plans to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by 1 million bbl in December and January.

[TITLE]India to cut Russian oil purchases, U.S. to slash tariffs as they near trade deal: Indian media report:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 13, 2025.

The U.S. could substantially slash tariffs on Indian exports as the two countries near a trade deal that could see New Delhi cutting oil purchases from Russia, Indian media outlet Mint reported Wednesday.

As part of the trade deal, Washington could slash tariffs on Indian exports to 15%-16% from the current 50%, Mint reported citing three unnamed sources aware of the matter.

India is also considering raising its import quota for non-genetically modified corn from the U.S. — currently 0.5 million tonnes annually — even with a import duty of 15%, while pushing for a mechanism under which both sides can revisit tariffs and market access over time, the report said.

On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he had received assurance from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a phone call that New Delhi would scale back purchases of Russian oil.

"He's not going to buy much oil from Russia. He wants to see that war end as much as I do. He wants to see the war end with Russia, Ukraine, and as you know, they're not going to be buying too much oil," Trump told reporters abroad Air Force One, while threatening that New Delhi would keep paying "massive" tariffs if it did not do so.

In a post on X on Wednesday morning local time, Modi confirmed the phone call with Trump, adding that he hoped the two countries continue to "stand united against terrorism in all its forms," without mentioning India's stance on Russian oil.

Trump last week also said that Modi in a call had agreed to cut Russian oil purchases. India's foreign ministry spokesperson said the following day that he was not aware of any call between Trump and Modi.

On the question of cutting oil imports from Russia, the spokesperson said Thursday, "India is a significant importer of oil and gas. It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective."

[TITLE]National Fuel to Acquire CenterPoint’s Ohio Natural Gas Utility Business:
[TEXT]
WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y., Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National Fuel Gas Company ("National Fuel" or the "Company") (NYSE: NFG) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement with CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (“CERC”), a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) (“CenterPoint”) to acquire CenterPoint’s Ohio natural gas utility business (“CNP Ohio”).

National Fuel is acquiring the equity interests in CNP Ohio for total consideration of $2.62 billion on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to customary closing adjustments, representing an acquisition multiple of approximately 1.6x estimated 2026 rate base of $1.6 billion. Upon closing, National Fuel will also acquire a dedicated team of employees that operate approximately 5,900 miles of distribution and transmission pipeline and serve approximately 335,000 residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers that consume approximately 60 Bcf of natural gas per year. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of calendar 2026, pending completion of a notice filing and review with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, Hart-Scott-Rodino review, and other customary closing conditions.

This acquisition will add significant regulated scale for National Fuel, doubling the size of the Company’s gas utility rate base, while expanding its operations into the neighboring state of Ohio, a jurisdiction that is both highly supportive of natural gas and maintains a constructive regulatory framework. This significant increase in regulated cash flows, alongside National Fuel’s unique ability to fund future growth capital with free cash flow from its integrated upstream and gathering operations, will further support the Company’s investment grade balance sheet.

“Our acquisition of CNP Ohio aligns with National Fuel’s strategic objective to increase the scale of our regulated operations through the addition of high-quality assets in a favorable regulatory and political jurisdiction. Gaining a strong presence in a neighboring service territory, with a similar workforce culture, and operations that mirror our existing gas utilities in New York and Pennsylvania is an added benefit for our Company as well as our customers, employees, and shareholders,” said David P. Bauer, President and Chief Executive Officer of National Fuel.

“Acquiring a natural gas utility of this quality, with a long runway of capital investment pathways, is a great opportunity to reinvest free cash flow from our integrated upstream and gathering operations, further enhancing the long-term outlook for regulated growth,” Bauer continued. “In addition, our prudent approach to financing this acquisition, combined with our increased scale and larger proportion of regulated cash flows, will further strengthen our investment grade credit profile which, in the long-term, should support further avenues for growth on both the regulated and non-regulated sides of our business.”

Compelling Strategic and Financial Benefits

Increased Scale of Gas Utility Business Balances Portfolio: Pro forma for CNP Ohio, National Fuel’s gas utility business will now serve approximately 1.1 million customers across three contiguous cold-weather states – New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Given the relative size of this acquisition, National Fuel’s gas utility rate base is expected to double to approximately $3.2 billion. As a result, the Company’s business mix will significantly rebalance, with an increasing share of earnings and growth from its stable and predictable regulated businesses.

[TITLE]mBank and PGGM enter into PLN 3.8 billion credit risk sharing transaction backed by financing to the renewable energy sector:
[TEXT]
WARSAW, Poland, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- mBank and PGGM have entered into a credit risk sharing transaction referencing a PLN 3.8 billion portfolio of corporate loans in Poland. Approximately 75% of the portfolio is backed by financing of wind-farms and photovoltaic installations. The remainder of the portfolio references project finance lending in the areas of health care, telecommunications, and other industries of strategic importance to the lender.

This is the first large-scale project finance significant risk transfer transaction (SRT) from the CEE region, primarily backed by a portfolio of renewables. It is also the third transaction in three years between mBank and PGGM.

The transaction represents an important milestone for mBank and is executed shortly following the announcement of mBank’s new strategy for 2026-2030 titled “Full Speed Ahead!”. The transaction will help the bank advance its sustainability agenda. In the strategy, the bank aims to allocate 15% of its corporate credit portfolio to sustainable finance by 2030, contributing to the energy transition of the Polish economy.

For PGGM and its end investor PFZW, the transaction offers a unique opportunity to support the energy transition in Central and Eastern Europe. It reflects PGGM’s and PFZW’s long-standing commitment to contribute to Sustainable Development Goals in the context of PFZW’s 3D investment approach, while strengthening the strategic relationship with mBank.

The transaction has been structured in accordance with the European Union’s regulatory framework for significant risk transfer (SRT), ensuring compliance with capital relief requirements.

Luca Paonessa, Lead Portfolio Manager, Credit Risk Sharing at PGGM: “This is the third transaction we execute with mBank, and the first with a strong focus on sustainability and energy transition. We are particularly proud of this project, as it reinforces two of our investment principles: the focus on partnerships with like-minded banks, and the belief that banks can play a critical role in the energy transition. Ultimately, this shows that credit risk sharing is an effective tool for mobilizing private capital for sustainable development. It therefore fits perfectly in PGGM’s 3D investment approach where we aim for an optimal balance between risk, return and sustainability for PFZW’s pension assets.”

Karol Prażmo, Managing Director - Treasury & Investor Relations at mBank: “We are proud to be once again writing SRT market history together with PGGM—this time through the first large-scale project finance SRT from the CEE region, backed by a portfolio of renewable energy projects. The transaction strengthens our capital base, builds on our position as a leading bank in the renewables sector, increases our capacity for new business, and more broadly supports Poland’s energy transition. It reflects the shared strategic focus of both mBank and PGGM on sustainability and ESG. I would like to thank the entire PGGM and mBank team for successfully closing this landmark transaction.”

Climate-related disruption and shifting adaptation requirements inject alarming levels of uncertainty into traditional business models, while a surge in amazing engineering breakthroughs and innovations simultaneously present irresistible opportunities for enhanced efficacy and resilience.

COMMENTARY

Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is one of those innovations. And while it promises revolutionary new capabilities and efficiencies that energy providers and utilities desperately need to meet modern customer needs, it also demands enormous amounts of power to fuel its evolution, which energy providers and utilities are scrambling to provide.

Within this vortex, there’s the added complexity of synthesizing the tech world’s cloud-driven, subscription-based services structured on operational expenditure (OpEx) within highly regulated energy utilities that still function heavily on capital expenditure (CapEx) frameworks. That incongruity alone tends to inhibit the type of technological agility displayed in other industries, and helps explain why utilities often find themselves ensnared in a web of legacy systems, siloed data, and operational complexities that make AI implementation seem more like science fiction than business reality.

And yet, real transformation is happening, even in a rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment. For example, one of the nation’s largest distribution cooperatives serving more than a million customers recently proved that modernization doesn’t have to take years or require a massive technology overhaul if you focus on the right fundamentals.

By establishing a modern cloud data platform as their foundation and redesigning ingestion and transformation patterns across critical pipelines, they accelerated their ability to integrate data, support analytics, and enable AI-ready workflows—all in a matter of months. Crucially, the initiative also invested heavily in enablement and adoption training so internal teams could sustain and scale those workflows long after the initial project wrapped.

The lesson here is that even large, highly regulated utilities can modernize quickly, reduce operational drag, and break open the potential for advanced analytics and AI when the right strategy, technology, and expertise come together.

So … what’s preventing everyone else from making similar headway?

Data Liquidity

The most significant barrier to leveraging AI in the energy industry isn’t a lack of technological sophistication. Utilities and energy providers are already using cloud infrastructure, and already employing digital and mobile and smart-sensor tools, along with GIS technology that would blow the average person’s mind. The fundamental challenge in adding AI to the toolbox is data fragmentation.

Any effective AI implementation requires models built on clean, fluid, and integrated data streams—data liquidity. That often presents a series roadblock. A utility executive may oversee 18 different state-of-the-art systems, but still be unable to triangulate the organization’s van data with machine data, much less customer information, since many of those systems do not “talk” to each other. Their data is not liquid. It is fragmented.

Data fragmentation isn’t inherently a technology issue. In most businesses, including those in the energy industry, it’s an organizational byproduct. Consider a standard electric utility’s breakdown:

Operational personnel managing day-to-day grid functions.

Safety departments tracking compliance and risk.

Geolocation specialists handling mapping and territory management.

Financial teams focused on business metrics.

Each group is essential, but generally works within its own ecosystem, often using platforms and data formats that are great for their specific day-to-day needs but resistant to integration with other platforms and formats used elsewhere in the business. That fosters operational silos and, inevitably, data fragmentation.

The Hidden Complexity of Utility Operations

The public often underestimates the operational complexity of modern utilities. Depending on the age, size, and location of the energy organization, critical systems may operate from basement servers, field workers may rely on paperwork or sensor networks or even mobile applications that don’t directly communicate with central operations, financial dashboards may exist separately from work order management systems that don’t sync with ESRI applications, and so on and so forth. Even if a utility is running the whole business on cloud services from major providers like AWS or Microsoft, it doesn’t mean that all their fragmented data is automatically transformed into functional AI-ready streams.

The Path Forward: A Three-Tier Approach

Utilities aiming to leverage AI need to assess their organization’s data fragmentation status to know whether they can crawl, walk, or run. A pragmatic structured approach generally maps out in three tiers:

Base Level: Data Consolidation—The foundation involves getting all organizational data into a single, accessible location. This isn’t just a technical challenge—it requires breaking down organizational silos and creating shared data governance frameworks.

Intelligent Level: AI-Powered Upgrades—Once data is unified, utilities can begin incorporating AI solutions into their systems to address pain points for specific use cases such as automated safety audit documentation and analysis, predictive maintenance scheduling, or grid load balancing.

Disruption Level: Personalized Energy Ecosystem—Full data control turns utilities into Netflix-like personalized service providers, facilitating agentic systems that can optimize neighborhood-level grid performance based on usage patterns, for example, or adjust thermostats for customers and supply personalized energy-saving recommendations, incentives, and/or service options.

Capturing AI’s potential starts and ends with data. Utilities and energy providers that succeed in mastering their data and how it flows stand to gain more than improvements in operational efficiency—they can redefine their business.
