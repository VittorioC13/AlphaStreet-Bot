[TITLE]AI Energy Crunch: Hyperscalers Turn to Small Nuclear Reactors:
[TEXT]
Despite global momentum and policy support, the SMR revolution faces substantial execution risks, including cost control, supply chain maturity, regulatory bottlenecks, and the need for robust financing structures to ensure timely and on-budget delivery.

Key industry players such as NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy are moving SMRs from conceptual designs to billion-dollar commercial projects, with notable advancements in deployment programs, industrial heat applications, and corporate energy strategies.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are experiencing a significant comeback, driven by their scalability, siting flexibility, and ability to provide carbon-free baseload power, crucial for rising AI energy demands and industrial decarbonization.

After decades of stagnation, nuclear energy is staging a comeback — and it’s no longer the gigawatt-scale reactors of the past leading the charge. Small modular reactors, once dismissed as niche or speculative, have moved to the center of a global energy and geopolitical pivot. Their appeal lies in scalability, siting flexibility, and the promise of dedicated, carbon-free baseload power—a vital ingredient in an era defined by the AI energy demand surge and industrial decarbonization.

The shift from ambitious blueprints to billion-dollar commercial projects is officially underway, driven by key industry announcements throughout 2025. Some of the leading stakeholders include NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy.

NuScale Power: From De-Risking To Gigawatt-Scale Deployment

NuScale Power has cemented its role as the bellwether of the SMR movement, but its commercial success will depend on disciplined financing. In early September 2025, the company announced a landmark collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority and ENTRA1 Energy to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of its SMR technology within the TVA service region — the largest SMR commitment in U.S. history.

The structure of this deal is as important as its scale. Rather than placing the full “first-of-a-kind” financial and regulatory burden on TVA, ENTRA1 will reportedly finance, own, and operate the facilities, selling power back to TVA through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement. This off-balance-sheet approach could prove pivotal, unlocking institutional investment and moving SMRs from demonstration projects into a bankable, utility-scale asset class.

[TITLE]Analysts Eye Big Oil's Spending and Acquisition Plans:
[TEXT]
Despite lower international oil prices and predictions of a supply overhang, Big Oil is expected to increase oil and gas output in both the current and coming year, indicating a belief in demand resilience that contrasts with some other forecasts.

Natural gas, particularly LNG, is a major focus for these companies, with Shell, BP, TotalEnergies, Exxon, and Chevron all making significant investments and plans for expansion in response to rising global electricity demand.

Big Oil is reporting third-quarter results this week and next. No surprises are expected—Big Oil has been having an eventful year featuring tariffs, sanctions, and glut predictions—and these events will be reflected in financial reports. Yet analysts are already looking ahead to 2036 and what Big Oil plans to do next.

So far, two big oil companies have reported third-quarter figures: Norway’s Equinor and Italy’s Eni. Both demonstrated the dominant trends in the industry, likely to be seen in the reports of BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, Exxon, and Chevron in the coming days. Equinor missed analyst expectations because of lower prices, despite higher oil and gas production, while Eni enjoyed better revenues and profits thanks to higher oil and gas production, despite lower prices. Shell and TotalEnergies today reported strong performance on higher oil and gas production.

What analysts appear to be interested in, according to a preliminary earnings season overview by Reuters, is what Big Oil plans to do in 2026 in terms of spending, production, and maybe acquisitions. They would want to hear how Chevron’s merger with Hess Corp. is going, what Exxon’s next acquisition target is going to be, and how European Big Oil will handle its share buybacks and dividends in a lower-price environment. Last but by no means least, analysts would want to hear

President Donald Trump has hinted at a potential oil and gas deal between Alaska and China after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

China’s Renewed Interest In US Energy

Trump took to Truth Social on Thursday to suggest a significant energy transaction involving Alaska. He wrote, “China also agreed that they will begin the process of purchasing American Energy. In fact, a very large scale transaction may take place concerning the purchase of Oil and Gas from the Great State of Alaska.”

Trump also mentioned that Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, and their respective energy teams, will be meeting to explore the potential energy deal.

Trump Pushes For Arctic Alaska Oil Lease Sale

This announcement comes in the wake of China’s significant reduction in U.S. oil imports earlier this year. In April, Chinese refiners cut their U.S. oil imports by approximately 90% amid escalating trade tensions with the U.S. This led to a surge in Canadian crude imports, with China importing 7.3 million barrels of crude from Canada’s Vancouver port in March.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been pushing for an Arctic Alaska oil lease sale despite the government shutdown. The pending lease is in accordance with Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in July, which entails the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) holding a minimum of five lease sales, offering at least 4 million acres each, over the next decade.

The potential Alaska gas deal with China could be a significant development in this context.

Trump’s meeting with Xi Jinping was also marked by decisions on trade, soybeans, and resources. The reduction in fentanyl tariffs from 20% to 10% was among the key outcomes of the meeting, indicating a potential thaw in the U.S.-China trade relations.

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

[TITLE]EU nation to seek exemption from US sanctions on Russian oil giants – PM:
[TEXT]
Russian crude is essential for the Hungarian economy due to the country’s landlocked geographical position, Viktor Orban has said

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has announced his intention to persuade US President Donald Trump to grant Budapest an exemption from the latest sanctions on Russian oil companies during his visit to Washington next week.

Last week, the US administration introduced restrictions against Russian energy majors Rosneft and Lukoil, alleging a lack of commitment by Moscow to the Ukraine peace process. Hungary, along with neighboring Slovakia, remains particularly exposed to the curbs as most of its crude imports arrive from Russia via pipeline due to lack of access to seaborne shipments.

Speaking on state radio on Friday, Orban reiterated that landlocked Hungary has no viable alternatives to Russian crude, and that replacing it would push the country toward an economic crisis.

“We have to make them [the US administration] understand this strange situation if we want exceptions to the American sanctions that are hitting Russia,” Orban said.

He specified that the energy issue must be resolved in the wake of the economic cooperation package currently being negotiated between Washington and Budapest, which includes requests and proposals for further US investment in Hungary.

Hungary, Slovakia, and EU aspirant Serbia – which, unlike most other members of the bloc, maintain a neutral stance on the Ukraine conflict and continue to purchase Russian oil – face pressure from Brussels and Washington to reduce their energy reliance on Moscow.

Earlier this year, EU energy ministers backed a European Commission proposal to completely phase out Russian oil and gas by 2028 as part of sanctions against Moscow. Budapest and Bratislava have condemned the plan, saying they would continue to import Russian crude due to national security interests.

[TITLE]Exxon, Chevron report increases:
[TEXT]
Let us read it for you. Listen now. Your browser does not support the audio element.

Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. outperformed Wall Street expectations after new oilfield projects and acquisitions boosted crude output.

Exxon's adjusted third-quarter profit per-share was 7 cents higher than analysts forecast, while Chevron posted an almost 20-cent surprise on Friday. For Exxon, it was the sixth-consecutive beat, buoyed by the startup of the explorer's latest Guyana development.

Chevron stock ended Friday trading in New York with a 2.7% rise. Exxon's stock had a turbulent day before closing daily trading with a dip of -0.29%.

Regarding earnings, Exxon earned $7.55 billion, or $1.76 per share, for the period ended Sept. 30. It earned $8.61 billion, or $1.92 per share, in the prior-year period. Chevron reported third-quarter earnings of $3.54 billion, or $1.82 per share. Earnings, adjusted for pretax expenses, were $1.85 per share.

North America's largest oil companies are pursuing divergent paths as global oil markets slip into what is widely expected to be a hefty supply glut. As Exxon presses ahead with a raft of expansion projects despite slumping crude prices, Chevron is positioning itself to wring cash from operations to weather the market downturn.

This is all happening against the backdrop of efforts by the OPEC+ alliance to recapture market share by unleashing more crude onto global markets. Brent crude, the international benchmark, already is on pace for its worst annual decline in half a decade.

The U.S. supermajors followed European rival Shell Plc in posting stronger-than-expected results. TotalEnergies SE reported profit that was in line with expectations. BP Plc is scheduled to disclose results next week.

For Exxon, eight of the 10 new developments slated for this year have already started up and the remaining two are "on track," Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said in a statement.

Woods is betting Exxon's low debt level means he has ample capacity to fund growth projects that span from crude in Brazil to chemicals in China while maintaining a $20 billion annual buyback program despite weak oil prices. His goal is to be ready to capitalize on an upturn in commodity prices, which analysts say could come as soon as next year.

Exxon's third-quarter earnings benefited from the start-up of Yellowtail, a 250,000 barrel-a-day development in Guyana, the country's biggest yet.

Exxon spent $2.4 billion on "growth acquisitions" during the period that included several acreage deals in the Permian Basin, where production amounted to a record 1.7 million barrels a day. Free cash flow was $6.3 billion.

Having struggled for years to arrest declining output, Exxon is now ramping up fossil-fuel production, with analysts forecasting a roughly 5% increase in oil and natural gas output next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Much of that is seen coming from Guyana, where Exxon made the biggest discovery in a generation in 2015.

Its plans include adding three more floating production vessels in the country through 2029, boosting Guyana's daily production capacity to nearly 1.5 million barrels, the equivalent to the current output of OPEC member Nigeria. Quarterly production from the South American country surpassed 700,000 barrels a day, a record.

Exxon is also banking on output growth in the U.S. Permian Basin at a time when rivals are pulling back, as well as refining investments in Singapore, Rotterdam and the U.K. The company recently signed exploration deals with Iraq and Trinidad and Tobago.

Woods' focus on growth seems at odds with a market that's more than saturated with oil. But the CEO maintains that he's adding lower-cost production that will be needed for decades to come, even if crude demand plateaus or drops due to an energy transition. Developments in Guyana and the Permian break even if oil falls below $35 a barrel.

Chevron's global production rose 21% to the equivalent of 4.1 million barrels a day, boosted by the addition of Hess Corp.'s 30% stake in the Stabroek Block, the Exxon-operated discovery off the coast of Guyana. Cash flow from operations was up 20% from a year earlier despite tumbling oil prices.

Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth has taken a series of steps to turn the company into a steady cash generator that can better withstand oil's notorious boom-and-bust cycles.

Excluding the addition of Hess' assets, Chevron was already on course to expand production by 7% this year and a further 5% in 2026 with high-margin output from fields in Kazakhstan and the Gulf of Mexico that turn profits even if crude were to dip to $20 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark price, known as West Texas Intermediate, has been trading around the $60 level for the past month.

Chevron is also working to boost cash flow by reining in production growth in capital-intensive shale fields in places like the Permian Basin and the Denver-Julesburg region, while cutting 20% of the company's global workforce.

"We talked before about the cash flow inflection that was coming, and we saw that in the third quarter," said Chief Financial Officer Eimear Bonner. The Hess assets "are significantly impacting the results already."

[TITLE]EU nation limits fuel exports to bloc members amid Lukoil sanctions:
[TEXT]
The major Russian oil producer owns Bulgaria’s biggest refinery, over 200 gas stations, and an extensive fuel transport network

Bulgaria has partly restricted fuel exports to EU states amid security and supply concerns following the recent US sanctions on Russia’s Lukoil. The oil major controls the Baltic country’s largest refinery, Neftochim Burgas, and over 200 gas stations under Lukoil Bulgaria.

Washington imposed sanctions on Lukoil and another Russian energy major, Rosneft, last week, alleging a lack of commitment by Moscow to the Ukraine peace process. Russia says it remains open to talks but wants a comprehensive deal addressing the root causes of the Ukraine conflict.

Bulgaria’s parliament approved a temporary ban on Friday on exports of certain fuels – mainly diesel and jet fuel – to other EU nations. It passed with 135 votes in favor, 4 against, and 42 abstentions.

Lawmakers called it a preventative step to protect domestic supplies, curb speculation, and avert shortages linked to sanctions. They warned that Lukoil’s holdings in key Bulgarian energy assets could fall under US sanctions, limiting their access to global banking and dollar-based supply chains.

The ban excludes gasoline, as national output exceeds domestic demand, as well as the refueling of aircraft, ships, and military deliveries for EU and NATO forces. The customs agency was instructed to enforce the restrictions but may authorize limited exports in special cases.

Some lawmakers opposed the decision, calling it a panic reaction, while others urged consultation with Brussels to ensure there would be no countermeasures affecting Bulgaria’s fuel imports from the wider EU. The ban will take effect upon publication in the State Gazette, though the duration remains unclear.

Earlier this week, Lukoil announced it had accepted an offer from global commodity trader Gunvor to purchase its subsidiary, Lukoil International GmbH, which manages all its foreign assets – a move it said is part of the company’s efforts to shield its operations from further restrictions.

Russia has condemned the Western sanctions, calling them politically motivated and illegal, while warning that they will backfire. The Kremlin maintains that sanctions targeting energy are contrary to the principles of free trade, arguing that they could destabilize global energy markets and drive fuel prices higher.

[TITLE]Carbon capture pipelines have struggled to advance. A project in Nebraska found success:
[TEXT]
BISMARCK, N.D. — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it's released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that," said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. "And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn't easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn't been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don't want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota's legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company's agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass' cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass' line crosses his family's land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously," he said, "and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of."

Exxon's third-quarter earnings benefited from the start-up of Yellowtail, a 250,000 barrel-a-day development in Guyana, the country's biggest yet.

Exxon spent $2.4 billion on "growth acquisitions" during the period that included several acreage deals in the Permian Basin, where production amounted to a record 1.7 million barrels a day. Free cash flow was $6.3 billion.

Having struggled for years to arrest declining output, Exxon is now ramping up fossil-fuel production, with analysts forecasting a roughly 5% increase in oil and natural gas output next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Much of that is seen coming from Guyana, where Exxon made the biggest discovery in a generation in 2015.

Its plans include adding three more floating production vessels in the country through 2029, boosting Guyana's daily production capacity to nearly 1.5 million barrels, the equivalent to the current output of OPEC member Nigeria. Quarterly production from the South American country surpassed 700,000 barrels a day, a record.

Exxon is also banking on output growth in the U.S. Permian Basin at a time when rivals are pulling back, as well as refining investments in Singapore, Rotterdam and the U.K. The company recently signed exploration deals with Iraq and Trinidad and Tobago.

Woods' focus on growth seems at odds with a market that's more than saturated with oil. But the CEO maintains that he's adding lower-cost production that will be needed for decades to come, even if crude demand plateaus or drops due to an energy transition. Developments in Guyana and the Permian break even if oil falls below $35 a barrel.

Chevron's global production rose 21% to the equivalent of 4.1 million barrels a day, boosted by the addition of Hess Corp.'s 30% stake in the Stabroek Block, the Exxon-operated discovery off the coast of Guyana. Cash flow from operations was up 20% from a year earlier despite tumbling oil prices.

Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth has taken a series of steps to turn the company into a steady cash generator that can better withstand oil's notorious boom-and-bust cycles.

Excluding the addition of Hess' assets, Chevron was already on course to expand production by 7% this year and a further 5% in 2026 with high-margin output from fields in Kazakhstan and the Gulf of Mexico that turn profits even if crude were to dip to $20 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark price, known as West Texas Intermediate, has been trading around the $60 level for the past month.

Chevron is also working to boost cash flow by reining in production growth in capital-intensive shale fields in places like the Permian Basin and the Denver-Julesburg region, while cutting 20% of the company's global workforce.

"We talked before about the cash flow inflection that was coming, and we saw that in the third quarter," said Chief Financial Officer Eimear Bonner. The Hess assets "are significantly impacting the results already."

[TITLE]Carbon capture pipelines have struggled to advance. A project in Nebraska found success:
[TEXT]
BISMARCK, N.D. — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it's released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that," said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. "And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn't easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn't been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don't want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota's legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company's agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass' cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass' line crosses his family's land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously," he said, "and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of."

[TEXT]
NE can power India’s green future: Union Minister Pralhad Joshi champions renewable revolution in Guwahati workshop”

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) organised a Regional Workshop on Renewable Energy Transition for the Northeast Zone in Guwahati on Friday, focusing on accelerating the region’s shift toward clean energy and addressing implementation challenges.

Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi inaugurated the workshop in the presence of MNRE Secretary Santosh Sarangi, energy ministers and representatives from northeastern states, and senior central and state officials.

In his keynote address, Joshi said the government is committed to ensuring that the benefits of renewable energy reach even the remotest parts of the country, including the Northeast. He described the region as having immense potential in solar, small hydro, and biomass-based power, and urged states to expedite projects under key schemes such as the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana (PM-SGMBY) and PM-KUSUM.

The minister highlighted India’s economic growth, noting that the country’s GDP had doubled from $2 trillion to over $4 trillion in the past decade and is on track to reach $5 trillion by 2027–28. He said this growth reflects the “New India’s” pace of progress and the government’s vision of inclusive development.

Underlining the Prime Minister’s focus on the Northeast, Joshi said the region had seen unprecedented attention through the Act East Policy, with the Prime Minister making more than 65 visits and Union Ministers over 700 visits. He said the region’s law and order situation had improved significantly, with insurgency declining, and infrastructure development gaining momentum through the construction of 81,000 kilometres of rural roads under PMGSY.

Joshi announced that the MNRE would soon launch a new Small Hydro Policy, with higher subsidies for states in the Northeast to help overcome terrain-related challenges. He encouraged states to work closely with the Centre and contribute their share to ongoing renewable energy schemes to achieve tangible results.

The minister praised Tripura for its performance under the PM-KUSUM scheme and Assam for leading rooftop solar installations under PM Surya Ghar. He noted that nearly half of all households with rooftop solar systems are now receiving zero electricity bills. “These schemes are empowering citizens and farmers to become energy entrepreneurs,” he said.

MNRE Secretary Santosh Sarangi highlighted the current renewable energy status in the region, stating that the Northeast has an estimated renewable potential of 113 GW. He said that while the region currently has about 5 GW of installed capacity, it can play a vital role in achieving India’s target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based energy by 2030. He added that Assam, which currently imports power, has the potential to become an energy exporter by maximising its solar and hydro resources.

Assam Power Minister Keshab Mahanta spoke about the state’s efforts in expanding renewable energy adoption. He said the Assam Energy Development Agency (AEDA) is implementing ten floating solar projects that generate power while enhancing fish production. Arunachal Pradesh’s APEDA Chairman Taba Tedir urged the Centre to enhance subsidies under the PM-KUSUM scheme due to the state’s difficult terrain.

Sikkim MLA and Advisor (Power) Sanjit Kharel said the state plans to install solar-powered streetlights in all urban and rural areas and sought MNRE’s support. Meghalaya Power Minister Metbah Lyngdoh emphasised the state’s growing potential in wind and solar power, while Tripura Power Minister Ratan Lal Nath thanked MNRE for its continued support in implementing renewable energy schemes.

During the award ceremony, Tripura was recognised as the best-performing state under the PM-KUSUM scheme for solar pump installations, followed by Arunachal Pradesh. Assam was awarded for its leadership in rooftop solar installations under PM-SGMBY, with Dhubri, Barpeta, and Hojai named as the best-performing districts in the state.

Technical sessions at the workshop focused on green hydrogen potential, small hydro development, decentralised renewable energy, and financing and skill development initiatives. Participants discussed best practices and success stories from across the region.

The workshop concluded with a call for stronger collaboration between the Centre, states, financial institutions, and industry to accelerate renewable energy deployment in the Northeast. Joshi said such cooperation would ensure that the region not only meets its energy needs but also contributes significantly to India’s sustainable and energy-secure future.

[TITLE]Simply Blue secures investment from Japan’s Kansai Electric to drive offshore wind expansion:
[TEXT]
Hugh Kelly, co-founder and chief executive of Simply Blue Group with Toru Kuwahara, executive vice-president and general manager of global EX division of Kansai Electric Power Company.

Simply Blue Group, a multinational developer of renewable energy projects, has secured strategic investment from the Japanese-owned Kansai Electric Power Company (Kepco), which will facilitate expansion of its large-scale offshore wind projects.

Kepco has signed a share subscription agreement with Simply Blue’s offshore wind development arm, marking its first investment involving management participation in an offshore wind developer. It will acquire a majority stake in Simply Blue Energy Offshore Wind Ltd through its wholly owned subsidiary, KPIC Netherlands BV.

The Cork-headquartered company is engaged in offshore wind projects across Europe and elsewhere, specialising in development from the early stages of project formation.

Simply Blue Group co-founder and chief executive Hugh Kelly said on Friday that Kepco support provided the resources needed to scale operations and advance offshore wind. “Together, we are poised to deliver significant contributions to the clean energy transition.

“This investment will help further the development of our offshore wind portfolio in Ireland, supporting national renewable energy targets and strengthening our clean energy leadership.

“However, continued momentum now depends on timely Government action to unlock the full potential of these projects.”

Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the collaboration would help decarbonisation efforts in Ireland and elsewhere.

“Simply Blue has been a significant international actor in the fast-growing offshore renewable energy sector and this collaboration with Kepco will further bolster its capacity. Together they will help drive the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, in Ireland and further afield,” he added.

Kepco executive vice-president Toru Kuwahara said they were honoured to form a partnership with “a developer possessing a pioneering spirit and extensive expertise in the field of offshore wind power”.

“We aim to further advance offshore wind development for both companies and contribute to achieving a carbon-neutral society,” he said. Their investment reflected the Japanese utility’s long-term vision “to ensure the sustainable, stable supply of clean energy worldwide”.

Through its offshore subsidiary, Simply Blue Energy is developing a significant renewable energy portfolio, including 8 gigawatts (GW) of floating offshore wind and 4GW of fixed-bottom wind projects across multiple markets.

It has two European projects; in Spain through the Iberblue Wind partnership and in Portugal, with the Creoula and Botafogo projects using innovative floating offshore wind technologies to produce zero-carbon electricity. It is also involved in another pipeline development as part of a joint venture in Greece with Archirodon, branded as ArcoBlue.

Through Octopus Energy Generation, it is engaged sustainable fuels project targeted at aviation and marine transport in Nova Scotia, Canada.

[TITLE]How Japan’s 4.5MW Bitcoin mining project could redefine ‘clean crypto’:
[TEXT]
Key takeaways

What is Japan doing with Bitcoin mining?

Japan’s state-linked utility has started mining Bitcoin using Canaan’s 4.5 MW Avalon rigs to balance renewable energy on its power grid.

Why does this matter globally?

It’s the first time a major developed nation has tied Bitcoin mining to national energy management.

A major Japanese utility (partly government-owned) has begun mining Bitcoin [BTC] using specialized Canaan machines plugged directly into its power grid.

The initiative aims to utilize surplus renewable energy during periods of low demand, preventing waste and helping stabilize the grid.

If this approach scales, Japan could become one of the few countries where the government plays a role in Bitcoin mining, not for ideological reasons, but to optimize energy usage.

Such a model could also position Japan as a pioneer in promoting ‘clean crypto’, where sustainable energy use becomes central to blockchain operations.

Canaan’s grid balancing bet in Japan

Canaan’s new 4.5 MW deployment in Japan marks a significant shift in integrating BTC mining operations with real-world energy infrastructure.

The company’s hydro-cooled Avalon machines will be used like an on-off buffer, powering down when grid demand spikes, and switching back on when there’s surplus renewable energy available.

It’s a modest-sized setup, but the timing matters. Canaan just escaped a NASDAQ delisting and followed that with its largest miner order ever. Nangeng Zhang, chairman and CEO of Canaan, said,

“With our Avalon hydro-cooled servers equipped with a smart control chip and Bitcoin mining technology, utilities can leverage Bitcoin mining as a digital load balancer, improving both energy sustainability and grid efficiency.”

This partnership is Japan’s first government-linked project using Bitcoin mining to help manage the power grid.

A list of state-aligned miners

Building on that, this deal also settles a long-running industry rumor.

VanEck’s Mathew Sigel noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post, that traders have whispered for years about utilities like TEPCO mining BTC in the background.

However, there was never public confirmation.

With Canaan securing a 4.5 MW order from a major regional utility – one with partial government ownership – Japan now effectively steps into the same bucket as other state-linked mining jurisdictions.

This makes Japan the 11th country (outside the U.S.) where government-affiliated infrastructure is directly involved in Bitcoin mining.

Why this matters

When a developed, tightly regulated market like Japan treats Bitcoin mining as a legitimate grid-balancing instrument, it starts a conversation.

If a highly regulated energy market like Japan can justify Bitcoin mining as a flexible load asset, it shifts the narrative from viewing it as “energy waste” to recognizing it as an “energy buffer.”

That opens doors.

Other utilities – in Europe, in APAC, in fossil-heavy grids – now have a policy example to point to.

[TITLE]AI Energy Crunch: Hyperscalers Turn to Small Nuclear Reactors:
[TEXT]
Despite global momentum and policy support, the SMR revolution faces substantial execution risks, including cost control, supply chain maturity, regulatory bottlenecks, and the need for robust financing structures to ensure timely and on-budget delivery.

Key industry players such as NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy are moving SMRs from conceptual designs to billion-dollar commercial projects, with notable advancements in deployment programs, industrial heat applications, and corporate energy strategies.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are experiencing a significant comeback, driven by their scalability, siting flexibility, and ability to provide carbon-free baseload power, crucial for rising AI energy demands and industrial decarbonization.

After decades of stagnation, nuclear energy is staging a comeback — and it’s no longer the gigawatt-scale reactors of the past leading the charge. Small modular reactors, once dismissed as niche or speculative, have moved to the center of a global energy and geopolitical pivot. Their appeal lies in scalability, siting flexibility, and the promise of dedicated, carbon-free baseload power—a vital ingredient in an era defined by the AI energy demand surge and industrial decarbonization.

The shift from ambitious blueprints to billion-dollar commercial projects is officially underway, driven by key industry announcements throughout 2025. Some of the leading stakeholders include NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy.

NuScale Power: From De-Risking To Gigawatt-Scale Deployment

NuScale Power has cemented its role as the bellwether of the SMR movement, but its commercial success will depend on disciplined financing. In early September 2025, the company announced a landmark collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority and ENTRA1 Energy to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of its SMR technology within the TVA service region — the largest SMR commitment in U.S. history.

The structure of this deal is as important as its scale. Rather than placing the full “first-of-a-kind” financial and regulatory burden on TVA, ENTRA1 will reportedly finance, own, and operate the facilities, selling power back to TVA through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement. This off-balance-sheet approach could prove pivotal, unlocking institutional investment and moving SMRs from demonstration projects into a bankable, utility-scale asset class.

[TITLE]$110 Billion Hydrogen Boom Meets Bureaucratic Bottlenecks in Europe:
[TEXT]
The global hydrogen industry came into view, specifically from importing countries’ perspective, at European Hydrogen Week earlier this month in Brussels.

There was a palpable sense of frustration with what many consider an overbearing regulatory framework causing delays. But also a sense of inevitability, with hydrogen mandates in place and pipeline construction now underway. Europe is set to be the world’s largest demand center for low-carbon hydrogen.

There was also a sense of determination in the face of a growing number of project cancelations.

“The tourists are gone,” said Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, CEO, Hydrogen Europe, an industry group based in Brussels. As weaker projects have fallen by the wayside, he emphasized the need for realism with policies such as mandatory minimum offtake requirements for large industries.

Hydrogen, he said, is now at a crossroads and there is a need to relax regulations to allow the clean hydrogen market to take shape.

Projects and progress

Progress on a few big projects was highlighted, such as the recent offtake agreement between the German energy company RWE AG and the French oil major TotalEnergies. Some 30,000 metric tons green hydrogen, produced at RWE's 300-megawatt electrolysis plant in Lingen, will move annually by pipeline 600km to Total’s refinery in Saxony-Anhalt beginning in 2030.

Progress was also reported at Port of Rotterdam, where Shell is building electrolyzer capacity of 200 MW to produce some 22,000 metric tons green hydrogen annually. This will move from the production site on Maasvlakte
