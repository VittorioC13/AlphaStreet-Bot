[TITLE]Enugu, EU deepen partnership to boost education, energy, infrastructure:
[TEXT]
The Enugu State Government and the European Union have renewed commitments to deepen cooperation across key sectors of the state’s economy, including education, energy, infrastructure, and youth development.

This followed a courtesy visit to Governor Peter Mbah at Government House, Enugu, by a high-powered EU delegation led by the EU Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Mr Gautier Mignot, according to a statement released by the governor’s media office on Saturday.

The team also included the Belgian Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Pieter Leenknegt; the Portuguese Ambassador, Mr Paulos Martins dos Santos; and several senior European diplomats.

Speaking during the meeting, Ambassador Mignot said the EU was eager to expand a partnership that aligns directly with the transformational policies of the Mbah administration.

“The purpose of our visit is to meet you, pay our respects, and discuss how to strengthen the partnership between the European Union and Enugu State. We are very interested in areas where our projects meet your administration’s expectations and long-term vision,” he said.

Mignot highlighted ongoing collaborations in the education and energy sectors, describing Enugu as one of the EU’s key beneficiary states.

“In the energy sector, the Solar for Health project is already under implementation. Under this programme, Enugu will receive technical assistance and funding for 20 solar microgrids to power 20 primary healthcare centres and 124 small and medium-sized enterprises,” he explained.

He also noted that the Small Hydro Power for Agro-industrial Sectors Project, implemented by UNIDO, and the Nigeria Energy Support Programme of GIZ were supporting electrification efforts, investment advisory services, and capacity building.

“Three interconnected minigrids of up to 1 MW capacity will also be funded to electrify at least 1,000 beneficiaries,” Mignot added.

On education, he announced that Enugu had been selected as one of the states to benefit from the Education and Youth Empowerment in Nigeria (EISS) programme implemented by UNESCO.

“The programme will train teachers in Smart Green Schools until June 2028. Building resilience and capacity among teachers is central to our goals,” the EU envoy said.

He also referenced the EU’s support for the Eastern Nigeria International Film Festival (ENIFF), describing it as a key platform for creative and cultural exchange.

“The 2025 edition in Enugu provided training for aspiring filmmakers and awarded grants for short film projects. We value this growing partnership with the creative industry,” Mignot noted.

Belgian Ambassador Pieter Leenknegt pointed to Belgium’s long-standing economic footprint in Enugu, particularly through Emenite Limited — a joint venture established in 1961.

“Emenite has over 300 employees from this region. It remains a shining example of Belgian–Nigerian cooperation. We want to continue strengthening this relationship,” he said.

Portuguese Ambassador Paulos Martins dos Santos emphasised Portugal’s wide-ranging interest in Nigeria’s energy, agricultural, and infrastructure sectors.

“The footprint of the European Union in this country is huge and multidimensional. Portugal looks forward to enhancing its contribution to this partnership, especially in areas that complement Enugu’s development plans,” he stressed.

In his remarks, Governor Mbah praised the EU for aligning its programmes with his administration’s development priorities.

“I see a strong synergy between our vision in Enugu and the EU’s programmes across Africa. Our investment of over 33 per cent of our total budget in education is deliberate. If we fail to equip our children today, we will pay ten times more in the future,” he said.

He also invited EU member states to explore emerging investment opportunities in Enugu’s aviation, natural gas, and energy sectors.

“We have launched Enugu Air, and the international wing of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport will soon become operational. We encourage you to speak to your home carriers to begin to consider direct flights to Enugu,” the governor announced.

On the state’s gas infrastructure ambitions, Mbah added: “We are working with the Federal Government to expand the gas pipeline infrastructure. This will unlock enormous economic opportunities in the gas subsector. Enugu is open for business, and we will do everything necessary to ensure investments succeed.”

The visit ended with both parties reaffirming their commitment to sustained collaboration aimed at accelerating development and improving livelihoods across Enugu State.

[TITLE]Geothermal networks let cities warm and cool as one:
[TEXT]
Troy in New York state is one of the first cities to use an innovative type of heat pump.Credit: TW Farlow/Getty

The half-a-dozen nineteenth-century commercial buildings huddled beside the Hudson River that make up an arts centre in Troy, New York, are destined for a distinctly twenty-first-century energy makeover. The same goes for an apartment building across the street and a department store-turned-technology hub a few blocks away.

The plan — hatched by Troy’s economic-development office to revitalize the downtown area and now driven by regional utility company National Grid — is to combine the buildings’ heating and cooling systems in a single high-efficiency, low-carbon network. The hope is that more buildings will join the scheme before the thermal network begins operating in 2027. Ultimately, it might wean all of the Central Troy Historic District off natural gas.

Heat pumps installed in the buildings will do most of the work. But these are not the same heat pumps commonly used to maintain the temperature of individual homes and businesses.

[TITLE]Hydrogen Generation Industry Research 2025 - Global Market Size, Share, Trends, Opportunities, and Forecasts, 2020-2030F:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Hydrogen Generation Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Hydrogen Generation Market, valued at USD 173.65 Billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.26% to reach USD 236.19 Billion by 2030.

Hydrogen generation involves producing hydrogen gas from feedstocks such as natural gas, coal, biomass, and water using technologies including steam methane reforming, partial oxidation, and electrolysis.

Market growth is strongly driven by global decarbonization initiatives, rising demand for low-emission industrial feedstocks, and extensive government support through incentives and national hydrogen strategies. According to the Hydrogen Council, clean hydrogen projects reaching final investment decisions increased from 102 in 2020 to 434 in 2024, with committed investment rising from USD 10 billion to USD 75 billion during this period. However, the sector faces a major challenge in the form of high capital expenditure for production facilities, storage systems, and distribution networks, as well as uncertainties in evolving regulatory frameworks, both of which can slow deployment and broader adoption.

Key Market Drivers

The global hydrogen generation market is primarily propelled by escalating decarbonization efforts and supportive government policies. Countries and industries are accelerating the shift toward low-carbon energy sources to meet climate targets, driving demand for clean hydrogen across refining, chemicals, steelmaking, and heavy-industry applications. The IEA's Global Hydrogen Review 2024 reported global hydrogen demand reached 97 million tonnes in 2023, up 2.5% from 2022, reflecting strong momentum toward cleaner industrial operations.

Complementing this, government-driven incentives and structured hydrogen strategies are reducing investment risks and supporting early-stage market development. One example is the European Commission's April 30, 2024 announcement of the European Hydrogen Bank pilot auction, which awarded €720 million to seven projects expected to produce 1.58 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen over a decade. Such initiatives strengthen investor confidence and accelerate infrastructure build-out, supported by rising electrolyzer deployment, which reached 1.4 GW of installed capacity in 2023 and is projected to grow to 5 GW by the end of 2024.

Key Market Challenges

A major challenge hindering the expansion of the Global Hydrogen Generation Market is the substantial capital expenditure required for hydrogen production, storage, and distribution infrastructure. Large-scale facilities and pipeline networks involve high upfront costs, making financial closure difficult and slowing project execution.

These challenges limit the pace at which planned hydrogen projects become operational. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2024 only USD 39 billion of the USD 570 billion in announced hydrogen-related investments had secured financing beyond the initial proposal stage. This gap illustrates the difficulty developers face in accessing the vast funding required to build a comprehensive hydrogen economy. As a result, supply growth remains constrained despite rising demand, delaying large-scale commercialization and the broader adoption of hydrogen as a clean fuel and industrial feedstock.

Key Market Trends

Technological advancements in electrolyzer systems are a defining trend in the hydrogen generation market, with ongoing improvements aimed at enhancing efficiency, lowering costs, and increasing operational durability. Rapid innovation is making green hydrogen more competitive, supporting its scalability. Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center's 2023 Industry Trends Report projects annual electrolyzer capacity additions to surge from 4.9 gigawatts in 2023 to over 300 gigawatts by 2030, highlighting the central role of technology in expanding clean hydrogen production.

Another key trend is the diversification of hydrogen's industrial applications. Beyond refining and ammonia production, hydrogen is increasingly being explored for steelmaking, heavy transportation, and aviation. A 2024 study published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy projected that green hydrogen-based steel could account for 2% of current total steel production by 2030. This widening application base reinforces hydrogen's long-term potential as a critical enabler of global decarbonization.

[TITLE]Russia's Putin seeks to boost energy, defence exports with India visit:
[TEXT]
NEW DELHI, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin starts a two-day visit to India from Thursday, pitching for more sales of Russian oil, missile systems and fighter jets in a bid to restore energy and defence ties hit by U.S. pressure on the South Asian nation.

Russia has supplied arms to India for decades, with New Delhi emerging as its top buyer of seaborne oil despite Western sanctions after Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

But India's crude imports are set to hit a three-year low this month, after the tightening of sanctions on Russia that coincide with its growing purchases of U.S. oil and gas.

On his first visit in four years to the Indian capital for a summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Putin will be accompanied by his defence minister, Andrei Belousov, and a wide-ranging delegation from business and industry.

"Putin's visit offers an opportunity for Delhi to reassert the strength of its special relationship with Moscow, despite recent developments, and make headway in new arms deals," said Michael Kugelman of the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington.

New initiatives were likely to be announced, he added, even if they mostly related to low-hanging fruit in ties.

THE TRUMP FACTOR

But Indian officials worry that any fresh energy and defence deals with Russia could trigger a reaction from U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubled tariffs to 50% in August on Indian goods, as punishment for New Delhi's purchases of Russian crude.

Ahead of Putin's visit, officials of both sides held talks in areas from defence to shipping and agriculture. In August, they agreed to launch talks for a free trade deal between India and the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union.

They are also in talks to expand their partnership in civilian nuclear energy, Indian analysts have said.

Putin's delegation includes the chief executives of dominant Russian lender Sberbank and state arms exporter Rosoboronexport, as well as the heads of sanctioned oil firms Rosneft and GazpromNeft, an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter said.

Ahead of the visit, Sberbank said it was interested in investing in Indian infrastructure projects making use of rupees, in which a big chunk of two-way trade is settled.

India CEO Ivan Nosov said Sberbank was also extending rupee loans to Russian exporters and local units to boost Indian sales of Russian products.

Moscow is likely to seek India's help to get technical equipment for its oil assets, as sanctions have choked access to key suppliers, said the industry source and a separate Indian government source.

The spoke on condition of anonymity as the matter is a sensitive one.

India is likely to pitch for the restoration of a stake of 20% for state gas explorer ONGC Videsh Ltd in the Sakhalin-1 project in Russia's far east, the government source added.

India hopes to sign a U.S. trade deal by year end, as most of its refiners have stopped buying Russian oil, though widening discounts are now drawing in some state refiners.

The sources sought anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media.

INDIA LOOKS TO RUSSIA FOR DEFENCE SPARES

Unlike crude, India does not plan to freeze defence ties with Moscow anytime soon as it requires support for the many Russian systems it operates, Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said last week.

Russian Sukhoi-30 jets make up the majority of India's 29 fighter squadrons and Moscow has also offered its most advanced fighter, the Su-57, which is likely to figure in this week's talks, said two Indian officials familiar with the matter.

India has not yet made a decision on buying the jet, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

But India is likely to discuss buying more units of the S-400 air defence system, Singh said last week.

Recent U.S.-Russia talks to end the Ukraine war could help make it easier for Indian officials to engage with Moscow, said Harsh Pant, head of foreign policy studies at India's Observer Research Foundation think tank, though ties appear strained.

"A large part of the trading relationship was based on energy, which is now losing traction under the threat of sanctions from the United States," he added.

"And at the end of the day, only defence remains, which continues to bind the two together."

A major challenge hindering the expansion of the Global Hydrogen Generation Market is the substantial capital expenditure required for hydrogen production, storage, and distribution infrastructure. Large-scale facilities and pipeline networks involve high upfront costs, making financial closure difficult and slowing project execution.

These challenges limit the pace at which planned hydrogen projects become operational. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2024 only USD 39 billion of the USD 570 billion in announced hydrogen-related investments had secured financing beyond the initial proposal stage. This gap illustrates the difficulty developers face in accessing the vast funding required to build a comprehensive hydrogen economy. As a result, supply growth remains constrained despite rising demand, delaying large-scale commercialization and the broader adoption of hydrogen as a clean fuel and industrial feedstock.

Key Market Trends

Technological advancements in electrolyzer systems are a defining trend in the hydrogen generation market, with ongoing improvements aimed at enhancing efficiency, lowering costs, and increasing operational durability. Rapid innovation is making green hydrogen more competitive, supporting its scalability. Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center's 2023 Industry Trends Report projects annual electrolyzer capacity additions to surge from 4.9 gigawatts in 2023 to over 300 gigawatts by 2030, highlighting the central role of technology in expanding clean hydrogen production.

Another key trend is the diversification of hydrogen's industrial applications. Beyond refining and ammonia production, hydrogen is increasingly being explored for steelmaking, heavy transportation, and aviation. A 2024 study published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy projected that green hydrogen-based steel could account for 2% of current total steel production by 2030. This widening application base reinforces hydrogen's long-term potential as a critical enabler of global decarbonization.

Renewable energy company Low Carbon has gained a significant investment from CVC DIF, aimed at driving the next stage of the company’s growth.

The CVC DIF investment, together with additional funding from current shareholder MassMutual, as well as the refinancing of existing project finance debt and a new holdco facility, brings the company’s total committed capital to around £1.1bn ($1.45bn).

Low Carbon said that the new investment from CVC DIF will support the delivery of several gigawatts of renewable energy.

This capital injection is intended to enable Low Carbon to support its transition into a diversified independent power producer, contributing to the ongoing energy transition in the UK and Europe.

CVC DIF’s primary equity investment, which includes both common and preferred shares, will result in a majority controlling stake in Low Carbon.

According to Low Carbon, the UK government’s Clean Power 2030 plan, announced last year, which includes doubling onshore wind capacity and tripling solar photovoltaic (PV), requires £40bn of annual investment.

In parallel, the EU has set a new renewable energy target of 42.5%.

The partnership between CVC DIF, its investors, and Low Carbon is expected to position the company to play a central role in delivering clean and affordable electricity across these regions.

Low Carbon currently manages a 16GW pipeline and has 1GW of highly contracted operational and in-construction assets.

The latest capital is said to support growth in key markets such as the UK, Germany, and Poland, where the company plans to bring a 3GW portfolio of operational utility-scale solar, battery storage, onshore wind, and colocated assets online in the coming years.

Low Carbon said that MassMutual, which formed a strategic collaboration with the company in 2021, remains a significant shareholder and will continue supporting the company’s growth with further investment.

MassMutual will collaborate with CVC DIF to expedite the development of Low Carbon’s renewables pipeline.

The CVC DIF investment will be made through DIF Infrastructure VIII and is expected to close this year, contingent on customary closing conditions.

Evercore served as the adviser to Low Carbon on the transaction.

Low Carbon chief executive and founder Roy Bedlow said: “I would like to thank CVC DIF and their investors for the confidence they have placed in Low Carbon and our ability to develop, build and operate high-quality renewable assets in the UK and Europe.

“In addition, MassMutual’s continued investment in Low Carbon underlines our shared ambition of delivering long-term value across the full investment cycle of renewables that will help accelerate our goal to deploy renewable energy at scale to help tackle climate change.”

[TITLE]Shareholder Frustration Kills Massive UK Renewable Infrastructure Fund Merger:
[TEXT]
HICL's portfolio includes UK infrastructure like the High Speed 1 rail link, while TRIG specializes in renewable assets across Britain and Europe, with both boards remaining convinced of the strategic rationale for the combination.

The deal was called off because HICL's board determined it could not proceed without substantial support from its own investors, who were reportedly frustrated with the terms.

HICL Infrastructure and The Renewables Infrastructure Group (TRIG) have abandoned their planned merger, which would have created the UK's largest infrastructure investment firm.

A plan to merge two FTSE-listed funds to form the UK’s largest infrastructure investment firm has been abandoned after shareholders expressed frustration with the terms of the deal.

HICL Infrastructure said it will no longer be proceeding with its planned merger with The Renewables Infrastructure Group (TRIG) after its board “determined that it cannot progress the transaction without a substantial majority of support from its own investors”.

“Both boards remain convinced of the strategic rationale for the combination,” HICL added.

As part of the terms of the deal, TRIG shareholders would have had the option of a partial cash exit of up to £250m in aggregate, representing approximately 11 per cent of TRIG’s share capital.

Assuming full take-up of the partial cash option, HICL shareholders were expected to hold 56 per cent, and TRIG shareholders 44 per cent, of the combined company.

But the deal, first announced on 17 November, attracted significant pushback from shareholders.

“We see multiple reasons for TRIG shareholders to be excited by the proposal, but fewer for HICL shareholders, where a liquidity opportunity is lacking despite a material shift in strategy and portfolio,” analysts at Peel Hunt said.

“Whilst we applaud the boards of both companies for working on a transformative transaction, we are concerned by the balance of incentives for each set of shareholders.”

TRIG shares fell 3.8 per cent to 71p following the announcement, while HICL shares rose 4.2 per cent to 118p.

Government and energy assets

HICL was listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange in 2006 and was originally set up to invest in infrastructure projects developed under the UK’s private finance initiative (PFI).

HICL’s portfolio includes a host of UK infrastructure assets such as the High Speed 1 rail link, the Westminster headquarters of the Home Office, The Northwood headquarters of the Ministry of Defence and Lewisham hospital.

TRIG, which was formed in 2013 to specialise in renewable infrastructure, operates a portfolio comprising stakes in several dozen wind and solar projects across Britain as well as further afield in Germany, France and Spain.

[TITLE]The EV Truck Reality Check and Why Edison Motors’ Hybrid Might Be What Actually Works:
[TEXT]
The infrastructure problem is fundamental. Charging a passenger EV at home overnight is one thing. Charging Class 8 trucks that need megawatt-level power to recharge massive battery banks in timeframes that don’t obliterate productivity is something else entirely. The US doesn’t have that infrastructure. Building it requires grid upgrades, utility coordination, real estate acquisition, and capital investment measured in billions. Nobody figured out how to fund that at scale, so we’re left with announced initiatives, pilot programs, and scattered charging stations that don’t add up to functional networks.

The United States took the opposite approach. Throw tax credits at manufacturers, announce ambitious electrification targets, mandate technology adoption timelines, and assume infrastructure and economics will somehow sort themselves out. It’s the regulatory equivalent of throwing EVs at the wall to see what sticks, and, surprise, most of it didn’t stick.

The UK’s relative success with commercial EVs didn’t happen by accident. They coordinated between government, utilities, fleet operators, and charging infrastructure providers before pushing mandates. They built charging networks that match operational needs. They focused deployment in applications where current technology actually works, shorter hauls, predictable routes, and operations that return to base for overnight charging. They planned the rollout based on what the technology could do rather than what they wished it could do.

But before we get to Edison, let’s talk

[TITLE]Challenges and Prospects in the Global Power Rental Market, 2025-2030: Data Centers and Grid Instability Drive Growth:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Power Rental Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Power Rental Market, valued at USD 22.83 Billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.39% to reach USD 37.02 Billion by 2030. Growth is primarily driven by rapid industrialization, ongoing global infrastructure development, rising energy demand across multiple sectors, and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that necessitate emergency power.

Key Market Drivers

The increasing need for continuous and reliable power supply is a crucial driver of the global power rental market, as industries rely on uninterrupted energy to maintain productivity and prevent financial losses. Data centers, for example, require consistent power beyond what traditional grids can reliably provide. The International Energy Agency's March 2024 Electricity 2024 report indicates that global electricity consumption from data centers is expected to more than double, rising from 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh by 2026.

Simultaneously, grid instability caused by aging infrastructure, extreme weather, and integration challenges with renewable energy sources drives demand for temporary power solutions. According to NERC's June 2024 State of Reliability report, wind resources experienced forced outage rates of 18.9% in 2023, up from 18.1% in 2022, contributing to grid unreliability. Strong industry performance reflects this demand: Aggreko reported annual sales of USD 2.85 billion for the year ending December 28, 2024, a 14% increase over 2023, as noted by International Rental News in April 2025.

Key Market Challenges

A major challenge to the global power rental market lies in the substantial capital expenditure required to procure, maintain, and upgrade fleets of power generation and distribution assets. These investments significantly strain profitability and can restrict the competitive capabilities of smaller firms. The high capital intensity creates barriers to entry and inherently favors large, established players with stronger financial capacity.

According to the European Rental Association, equipment investment across the European rental market was expected to remain flat in 2023 following a 4.2% increase in 2022, illustrating the constraining financial environment. These conditions limit innovation and expansion opportunities, ultimately slowing broader market growth.

Key Market Trends

Growing Adoption of Hybrid and Renewable Energy Solutions is a pivotal trend shaping the global power rental market. Companies increasingly deploy hybrid systems that combine conventional generators with battery storage or solar power, driven by stricter environmental regulations and rising corporate sustainability goals.

Aggreko invested over USD 140 million across 2023 and 2024 to expand its Greener Upgrades fleet, including battery systems designed to reduce emissions and optimize fuel consumption. This shift is reinforced by declining renewable energy costs; according to IRENA's 2025 Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2024 report, total installed costs for most renewable power technologies fell by more than 10% from 2023 to 2024.
