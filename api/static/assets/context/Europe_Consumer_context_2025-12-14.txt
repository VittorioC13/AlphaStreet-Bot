[TITLE]Freedom Holding Considers Entering the Turkish Market:
[TEXT]
Freedom Holding Corp. is examining the possibility of expanding into the Turkish market, CEO and majority shareholder Timur Turlov announced in Almaty. While no agreements have been finalized yet, the company views Turkey as a strategic addition to its broader regional development plan, especially given the dynamic growth of digital finance and increasing regional interconnectedness.

According to Turlov, Freedom has been studying regulatory requirements, competitive dynamics, and potential models of entry, but prefers to avoid premature statements until any deal is officially confirmed. He noted that entering a new jurisdiction requires careful analysis of long-term operational conditions, not just short-term opportunities.

“I would not want to spoil the news and announce a deal before it is signed. We have not signed anything so far, but overall we are interested in organic expansion,” he said. At the same time, Turlov acknowledged that various scenarios may be evaluated, depending on the strategic fit — a remark that neither confirms nor rules out options reported by international media.

Turkey: A Market of Strategic Interest, Not Large Acquisitions

Turlov clarified that Freedom is not targeting major acquisitions in Turkey. The potential strategy is focused on organic entry through licensing, rather than purchasing a substantial banking institution. This method would allow Freedom to introduce its digital-first model without the burden of integrating outdated infrastructure. He emphasized, however, that the company remains open to opportunities that align with its technological and operational philosophy.

“This is more an attempt to obtain a license than to buy a large institution. In this regard, I think we are quite similar to our competitors in our fundamental approach,” he noted, referencing the recent activity of Kaspi.kz and Rabobank Turkey.

This approach aligns with Freedom’s broader philosophy: developing financial ecosystems on top of its own technological stack, rather than integrating inherited legacy systems that may limit future scalability and slow development.

Which Bank Could Freedom Acquire?

Although Turlov did not name a specific bank, Bloomberg previously reported that Freedom Holding had shown interest in TurkishBank AS. Turlov’s public comments do not directly address these reports, except for underscoring that the company evaluates different formats of market entry and does not intend to pursue any “large-scale” acquisition. His remarks leave room for interpretation, while keeping the company’s official position conservative and consistent.

TurkishBank AS, part of the TurkishBank Group, has a long history in Turkey, beginning operations in 1982 with the launch of a branch by the Cypriot TürkBankası. In 1991, it became a separate Turkish legal entity, marking a new phase in its development and distancing it from the status of a foreign bank.

Its core business areas include corporate and commercial banking, retail and private banking, project financing, fund management, and agency services via Turkish Securities.

According to the Association of Banks of Turkey, TurkishBank operates six branches, holds €132 million in assets, and currently reports zero net profit.

For comparison, Rabobank, targeted by Kaspi.kz, holds €45 million in assets and only one branch, yet generated €6 million in net profit as of September 30, 2025. This contrast highlights the diverse financial profiles of smaller Turkish banks and illustrates why different investors may consider different entry strategies.

Freedom’s Expansion Across the Post-Soviet Region

In recent years, Freedom Holding has been consistently expanding across the post-Soviet space. Turlov noted that the company completes around ten M&A transactions annually. These deals may vary in scale, but they reflect Freedom’s deliberate strategy of strengthening its presence in strategically important markets where digital infrastructure is rapidly evolving.

The group also recently received approval to open a bank in Georgia, reinforcing its position as one of the most technologically advanced financial ecosystems in Eurasia.

“I am confident this will not be the last deal we complete across the post-Soviet space,” Turlov said.

Freedom’s Technology as an Exportable Asset

Turlov emphasized that technology remains Freedom Holding’s core advantage. The company continues to upgrade its internal processes, digital infrastructure, and integrations to ensure that its solutions can be exported and implemented in new jurisdictions with minimal adaptation.

Freedom’s strategic ambition is to form a regional network of digital banks that share a unified technological foundation. This model allows faster scaling, easier compliance updates, and seamless integration of payment services across borders — something traditional banks struggle to achieve due to fragmented systems.

The company aims to become a financial bridge for Central Asia and the wider Turkic region.

“We want to enable people to transfer money across the entire Turkic world without heavy dependence on Western, Russian, or any other external infrastructure,” Turlov highlighted.

[TITLE]This HP laptop with 16GB RAM and Copilot+ is a steal for $550:
[TEXT]
Something weird is happening in the nebulous corporate space between Best Buy and Hewlett-Packard. HP and BB seem to be BFFs, at least when it comes to affordable laptops, as they’ve been offering fantastic discounts lately. Take this OmniBook model, which features a fold-back touchscreen, an Intel Core Ultra 5 processor capable of handling Windows 11’s Copilot+ AI features, and 16GB of RAM. It’s $549.99 today, $350 off the retail price.

The OmniBook X Flip 16 is a big ol’ 16-incher, which is kind of rare in the convertible market, but nice if you like a combination of touchscreen and plenty of space. (It comes with a stylus in the box.) The “2K” screen descriptor is, I have to say, a bald-faced lie — it’s 1920×1200, which is in no way double standard HD resolution. Still, it’s a decent panel for a mid-range machine. The real highlight of this spec list is 16GB of DDR5 RAM, combined with 512GB of storage, both of which are hard to find in this price range.

The laptop also uses a Core Ultra 5 226V processor from Intel. That comes with 8 total cores (four full-power, full efficiency) and Arc 130V integrated graphics. That combo should blast through anything you can do with a browser or an office program, and be at least passable at gaming up to about a Minecraft level. Ports are plentiful — as they darn well should be, on a bigger, heavier design — with double USB-C, double USB-A, and HDMI, plus a headphone jack. Battery life is solid, but not mind-blowing, with HP claiming “up to 23 hours” of video playback. Expect 10+ with standard browsing.

For more details, check out PCWorld’s review of the OmniBook X Flip 16. But please be aware that that review is a higher-specced model with a faster processor, more RAM, more storage, and an upgraded screen.

Best Buy is offering this deal as a standard sale with no time limit, though of course it won’t stick around forever. I’m also showing it as in stock at several retail locations around me, so if you happen to be near a store you can check it out in person, or pick up without shipping. If it’s not quite what you’re looking for, be sure to check out PCWorld’s roundup of the best laptops on the market.

[TITLE]Stock market today: Dow jumps 650 points to post record, S&P 500 climbs above 6,900 for first time:
[TEXT]
The Dow and S&P 500 notched new records on Thursday as US stocks mostly rose, with tech stocks under more pressure after Oracle (ORCL) earnings revived AI overspending worries.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), gained around 1.3%, or nearly 650 points, to set a new all-time high, even as the likes of component Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also notched a fresh record close at 6,900, adding to Wednesday's rally that followed the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid by 0.3%.

Stocks largely continued on Wednesday's rally despite a nearly 11% slide from Oracle (ORCL). The company's earnings late Wednesday brought AI spending fears back with a vengeance, after the software giant missed on cloud sales and hiked its already aggressive data center spending by $15 billion.

But Wall Street's mostly upbeat mood continued after a split Fed voted to lower rates for the third time this year. Policymakers signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate hike would be off the table for January, while talking up the US economy's strength.

Powell said the Fed is "well positioned to wait and see" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures that the central bank sees as a "one-time" increase.

That put the spotlight on a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, which came in significantly higher than expected at 236,000. That was the biggest jump since 2020, after dipping to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week. The next signal on the labor market will come from the delayed November jobs report, set for release next Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the US trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed to its smallest in over five years as exports surged, potentially reflecting a boost to the wider economy in the third quarter.

Also, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

Higher Demand for Dairy-Based and Convenient Options is helpful for the Growth of the Whole Milk Powder Industry

The whole milk powder market has been growing recently due to rising demand in the food and beverages and bakery industries for various purposes. Higher shelf life and higher demand for dairy-based products are other major factors driving market growth. The market also sees growth as whole milk powder is rich in essential nutrients, such as healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals.

The manufacturing process of whole milk powder involves removing water from full-fat and fresh milk through spray-drying. It helps in producing a dry, nutritional product with all the essential nutrients for the bakery, food, and beverage industry. Easy availability of the product across various platforms in different quantities is another major factor driving the market's growth.

Impact of AI on the Whole Milk Powder Market

Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the whole milk powder market by improving production consistency, enhancing quality control, and strengthening supply chain performance. In dairy processing plants, AI models monitor and adjust key parameters, including evaporation rate, spray dryer inlet temperature, airflow, and moisture content. By learning from historical production runs, these systems recommend precise settings that maintain uniform powder particle size and prevent issues such as scorching, clumping, or uneven drying. This level of control is especially important for whole milk powder, which is more sensitive to heat and oxidation due to its higher fat content.

Quality assurance has also become more accurate. Computer vision systems inspect powder color, density, and flow characteristics, flagging deviations that may indicate fat separation, contamination, or improper drying. Spectroscopy tools powered by AI evaluate chemical profiles in real time, ensuring that fat, protein, and lactose levels meet specifications for infant formula, bakery use, confectionery production, and reconstitution applications.

Trade Analysis for the Whole Milk Powder Market

What is Actually Traded (product forms and HS proxies)

Bulk industrial WMP for food manufacturers and reprocessors, normally shipped in 25 kg bags or large bulk containers. (HS 040221 / 040229).

Consumer-packed WMP in retail tins and sachets for direct sale. (Often recorded within the same HS lines but differentiated by trade statistics metadata where available).

Specialty/fortified WMP for infant nutrition or clinical use. These flows are smaller and have additional compositional and certification requirements. (See Codex and national standards).

Top Exporters (supply hubs)

New Zealand. Pasture-based milk production and large-scale cooperatives give New Zealand structural export strength in WMP. New Zealand remains the primary source for many Asian markets.

European Union. Several EU countries export processed milk powders, supported by integrated dairy industries and logistics to Mediterranean and African markets.

United States and selected South American suppliers. The United States, Argentina and Uruguay supply niche volumes and specialised product forms to global markets. National statistics and USDA reporting provide supplier-level detail.

Top Importers (demand centres)

China. Historically the largest volume importer of WMP and a structural demand centre for Oceania and EU exporters. Recent years saw variances as domestic production and inventory cycles changed import needs.

Southeast Asia and North Africa. Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Algeria and nearby markets import WMP for food processing and consumer markets. Population growth and preferences for processed dairy inputs drive demand.

Middle East and some Latin American markets. Import demand here is for both consumer-packed powder and industry-grade powder for confectionery and dairy blends. National procurement programs and government food security purchases can be material.

Typical Trade Flows and Logistics Patterns

Major flow: Oceania (New Zealand, Australia) → East and Southeast Asia (China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam). New Zealand exporters use deepwater ports and container and bulk-bag shipments routed via feeder hubs.

EU exports move to North Africa, the Middle East and intra-Europe via short-sea and container routes. Export logistics often require a cold chain for derivative products, though WMP itself is a shelf-stable dry commodity.

Re-export and co-packing hubs exist where wholesalers rebag, fortify or re-label WMP for regional markets. Processing shifts in origin countries can change where milk solids are converted into powder versus other dairy ingredients.

Trade Drivers and Structural Factors

Milk supply cycles at the origin. Weather, herd numbers, and farm economics determine the availability of milk solids for powder versus other uses.

Demand-side compositional change. Growth in processed foods and infant nutrition influences demand for specific powder grades.

Price sensitivity and inventory cycles in large importers such as China. Large domestic inventories or increased local production can sharply reduce import volumes.

Trade policy and market access. Tariffs, sanitary lists, and recognition of export establishments shape supplier competitiveness.

Regulatory, Quality, and Market-access Considerations

Codex standards: WMP composition, labeling, and testing guidance are set out in Codex Stan 207 for milk powders. Exporters should comply with Codex where importing markets reference it.

Importing country rules: The EU, China, and other countries require approved exporting establishments, veterinary controls, and documentary evidence via systems such as TRACES for the EU. Certification and establishment listing are mandatory for many markets.

Food safety testing: Heavy metals, mycotoxins, antibiotic residues, and microbiological criteria are commonly checked. Buyers frequently require certificates of analysis and traceability back to the batch level.

Government Initiatives and Public-Policy Influences

Export facilitation in producer countries. Governments and trade agencies in New Zealand and EU member states support exporters through export certificates, market access negotiations, and SPS capacity building.

Importer policies. China and some large importers adjust tariff and procurement policies and may prioritise domestic suppliers under food security initiatives. These moves materially affect WMP trade volumes.

[TITLE]Welfare measures and distributed growth behind Tamil Nadu’s economic growth, says Industries Min TRB Rajaa:
[TEXT]
Welfare measures or ‘freebies’ are a key driver for Tamil Nadu’s standout economic growth and are driving the local economies, pushing money back into the system, State Industries Minister TRB Rajaa said. With a recent RBI report pegging Tamil Nadu’s nominal Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) growth at 16 per cent in FY25 (the highest among all top states), the minister told businessline that inclusive distributive growth is the key. The State gets its investments from not just the US but also Germany, UK, Japan, and other countries, making us more resilient to geopolitical shocks, he added.

The Minister discussed emerging area of shipbuilding, GCCs, competition from other States, and more .

Edited Excerpts:

Doubt-digit GDP growth and highest among top states for TN in FY25. Is it only manufacturing or something more that’s pushing growth?

Targeted welfare measures, not some blanket measures, are giving us really good results. Mobility is everything and when half of your population is enabled with free mobility (via CM’s scheme of free bus travel for women), that is a massive push. Close to 1.5 crore women who are getting ₹1,000 every month- they’ve all contributed to the GDP growth. So every single rupee spent on welfare measure comes back to the coffers of the State, and the wheels of economy keep churning. It takes decades of work for the results to come out.

The manufacturing sector seems to have particularly outperformed in FY25. What are the drivers besides electronics?

In Tamil Nadu, we are at a position where we can manufacture anything under the sun. Our capabilities are immense. The next focus is R&D. We are consistently focusing on high-end, high value manufacturing set ups and jobs. Our impetus on education has given us a huge human capital, and these are high quality talent and that is why we focus on emerging sectors for this pool.

We have seen successive shipbuilding investments come into TN. What is the potential you see?

For every job created by a shipbuilder, 7 ancillary jobs are created. It is a sector with one of the biggest multiplier effects. We have the second largest coastline in India and blue economy needs to be tapped in a big way. And we did not play an incentive game with shipbuilding MoUs, it’s more for the infrastructure and talent pool. We gave the companies’ the true picture and took them to all these destinations. They were happy with what they saw, the speed of governance, and the decision making. Particularly for Thoothukudi, this is going to be a complete transformation. As an anchor company, Vinfast has helped us in positioning the district.

What has been the impact of the tariffs on the export-heavy TN economy?

We are a very resilient State. Our bets and sectors are varied. I think we can manage the storm. Right now, the textile sector is taking a hit and we’ve asked the Union to step in and help. We are hoping they will do more to help them. The seafood sector also needs help. The Union said that UK FTAs will help and we agree, but the US is such a massive market that we just can’t discount them. Tamil Nadu’s investments also come from a variety of regions and not just the US. I will also be going to Korea next.

Will Tamil Nadu have a Fab? Are you seeking one?

Our pitch for Fabs was never for jobs, but it was always for national security because a Fab in the northern borders is not a very smart move. It is also because we have the manufacturing ecosystem here needed for the Fabs. We still definitely want a Fab and we are working around the Union’s blockade. We are working to put up a small training ecosystem fab to train our design talent. A Fab coming into Tamil Nadu will have much better productivity than in any other State in India.

Disney Signs Landmark Character Agreement With OpenAI, Tells Google to Cease and Desist – On Thursday, December 11, generative artificial intelligence (AI) developer OpenAI announced that it had entered into a three-year licensing agreement with media entertainment conglomerate The Walt Disney Company involving a $1 billion equity investment by Disney into OpenAI for the use of its application programming interfaces (APIs) while opening a vast portfolio of more than 200 characters from Disney brands including Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars. Recent news reports indicate that, the evening before the OpenAI announcement, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google ordering the Internet services giant to stop its massive infringement of Disney’s copyrighted characters and other works in its own AI platforms.

CAFC Finds No Assignment in Gross in Transfer of Trademark With Associated Goodwill – On Wednesday, December 10, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a precedential decision in Game Plan, Inc. v. Uninterrupted IP, LLC affirming the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board’s (TTAB) cancellation of Game Plan’s trademark registration and dismissing Game Plan’s opposition to six intent-to-use applications filed by Uninterrupted for its “MORE THAN AN ATHLETE” marks. The Federal Circuit found that a 2019 assignment of common law rights to Uninterrupted trademark applications, including “all of the goodwill of the business related to” the marks, gave priority in the use of the contested marks to Uninterrupted, and also ruled that the assignment, which was executed after Game Plan filed its opposition, was not invalid under 15 U.S.C. § 1060(a)(1)’s restriction against assignment of intent-to-use trademark applications because the assignment was for pre-existing common law rights to an already-used mark.

EU General Court Upholds Second Fine Against Intel After €140M Reduction – On Wednesday, December 10, the General Court of the European Union issued a judgment upholding a September 2023 fine levied by the European Commission against American semiconductor designer Intel for anticompetitive behavior in excluding rival company AMD from the x86 microprocessor market, the second fine issued by the EU Commission against Intel following the EU General Court’s annulment of a €1.06 billion fine in January 2022.

[TITLE]Costco Beats Q1 Earnings Estimates With 6.4% Comparable Sales Growth:
[TEXT]
Costco Wholesale Corporation COST reported first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, wherein the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the bottom line beat the same. Nonetheless, both revenues and earnings improved year over year, driven by robust membership growth, resilient traffic, double-digit e-commerce gains and margin expansion.

Costco’s Quarterly Performance: Key Metrics and Insights

Costco posted quarterly earnings of $4.34 per share, which excludes a 16-cent tax benefit, and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.26. This compared favorably with the prior-year period’s earnings of $3.82 per share, which excludes a 22-cent tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Including the tax benefit, quarterly earnings came in at $4.50, up from $4.04 per share reported in the prior-year period.

Total revenues, comprising net sales and membership fees, reached $67,307 million, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter. However, the figure came just shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $67,326 million. Momentum was driven by healthy traffic trends, continued strength in international markets and strong digitally enabled sales. E-commerce remained a standout contributor, helped by better personalization tools and improved app functionality.

Costco’s comparable sales rose 6.4% year over year in the quarter. Comparable sales in the United States grew 5.9%, while Canada and Other International markets saw increases of 6.5% and 8.8%, respectively. Digitally enabled comparable sales surged 20.5%, supported by solid performance across categories such as pharmacy, jewelry, tires, small electrics, apparel and majors.

Costco’s strategic investments, customer-centric approach and merchandise initiatives, along with an emphasis on membership growth, have helped it capture market share and maintain steady revenue growth. By prioritizing value and quality, the company has built strong customer loyalty, leading to an impressive membership renewal rate of 92.2% in the United States and Canada and 89.7% worldwide in the quarter.

Costco Achieves Membership Growth and Improved Margins

Net sales climbed 8.2% year over year to $65,978 million, while membership fees jumped 14% to $1,329 million, benefiting from strong renewal rates and the annualized benefit of the recent membership fee increase. Excluding the membership fee increase and FX, membership income jumped 7.3% year over year. Costco ended the quarter with 81.4 million paid household members, up 5.2% from the year-ago period, and total cardholders grew 5.1% to 145.9 million. Executive memberships increased 9.1% to 39.7 million.

Traffic improved 3.1% worldwide and 2.6% in the United States, while the average transaction or ticket increased 3.2% both globally and in the United States. Excluding the effects of gasoline price changes and foreign exchange, total comparable sales rose 6.4%, with the United States up 5.9%, Canada up 9% and Other International gaining 6.8%.

Gross margin expanded 4 basis points year over year to 11.3%, driven by efficiencies in fresh foods, better inventory execution, higher Kirkland Signature penetration and strength in ancillary businesses. The operating income grew 12.2% to $2,463 million, while the operating margin improved 20 basis points to 3.7%.

[TITLE]With a $35 billion push, Amazon puts e-commerce rivals on notice:
[TEXT]
Amazon.com Inc.’s plan to invest an additional $35 billion in India by 2030 is expected to intensify competition in the online commerce and prompt rivals to increase their spending on infrastructure, supply chains, and consumer acquisition.

The US tech giant, which has already deployed $40 billion in the country, will invest money in all of its businesses—its core e-commerce operations, cloud computing division Amazon Web Services, entertainment businesses including Prime Video and MX Player, and its devices segment.

“Other players will be pushed to accelerate investments of their own, spurring faster innovation, deeper regional penetration, and more nuanced strategies for tier-II and tier-III markets," said Naveen Malpani, partner and retail and e-commerce industry leader, consulting firm Grant Thornton Bharat.

Deeper penetration

Amazon, which has millions of Prime subscribers in the country, has been stepping up its promise of quicker deliveries.

For instance, this festive season, Prime members drove demand from tier-II and tier-III cities across key categories, including appliances, fashion and beauty, smartphones, and furniture. Prime members experienced faster deliveries, with over 3 million products delivered in metro cities within the same day or the next day, and more than 5 million products reaching customers in tier-II and -III cities within two days.

Although a late entrant in the quick-commerce play, it is also expanding its presence through Amazon Now, its 10-minute delivery service that now operates in three cities with more than 300 micro-fulfilment centres. The company is adding two centres a day as it scales its shorter delivery-window model.

Udit Madan, senior vice-president, worldwide operations at Amazon, said speed remains a central focus for the business. “We’re going to get to faster speeds—not just our fastest speeds with Amazon Now, but by expanding into more and more areas. This is a significant area of investment for us and one that will shape the business and demand patterns in India. A large part of our investment this year went towards speeding up and improving reliability in tier II-III markets, something we are now doing in parts of the US and Europe."

India’s online commerce ecosystem has expanded significantly over the last decade, dominated by companies such as Walmart-backed Flipkart, Amazon, Meesho, Nykaa, Swiggy, and Eternal Ltd.

While the overall retail market is expected to grow from $1 trillion in 2024 to $1.7 trillion by 2030, according to estimates from consulting firm Deloitte, online retail is projected to grow much faster—from $75 billion in 2024 to $260 billion by 2030—doubling its share of total retail to 14%.

Quicker response

Young shoppers are increasingly comfortable buying everything from cosmetics to apparel on their smartphones. This is especially true post-covid with the entry of new quick-commerce players such as Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, Zepto, etc.

Food aggregator and quick-commerce platform Swiggy plans to raise
