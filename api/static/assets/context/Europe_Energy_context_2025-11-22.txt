[TITLE]Smartkem and Jericho Energy Ventures Extend Letter Of Intent for Proposed All-Stock Merger to Form U.S.-Owned, AI-Focused Infrastructure Company:
[TEXT]
Proposed all-stock transaction aims to align JEV's scalable energy platform with Smartkem's semiconductor innovations to power next generation AI data centers

MANCHESTER, England, Nov. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Smartkem, Inc. (Nasdaq: SMTK), ("Smartkem"), a company developing a new class of organic semiconductor technology, today announced that it has agreed to a 60-day extension of its non-binding Letter of Intent ("LOI") for a proposed all-stock business combination (the "Proposed Transaction") with Jericho Energy Ventures Inc. (TSX-V: JEV, OTC: JROOF) ("Jericho" or "JEV"), an energy innovation company. The amendment to the LOI also extends the deadline by which Smartkem is required to invest in Jericho to prevent Jericho from having the right to terminate the LOI to December 31, 2025. The other terms of the LOI remain unchanged.

As previously disclosed, if completed, the Proposed Transaction would establish a Nasdaq-listed, U.S.-owned and controlled AI infrastructure company that integrates low-cost domestic energy with advanced semiconductor packaging and materials to support the rapidly growing demand for AI compute capacity.

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY

Ian Jenks, Chairman & CEO of Smartkem

"We are pleased to extend the LOI as both teams are committed to working towards a transaction that could unlock meaningful value across the rapidly converging energy and AI sectors. We believe the opportunity to integrate Smartkem's world-class semiconductor materials with JEV's scalable energy platform represents a compelling strategic path forward."

Brian Williamson, CEO of Jericho Energy Ventures

"Extending the LOI reflects the continued enthusiasm between JEV and Smartkem to progress with the proposed merger to create a U.S.-owned AI infrastructure company that brings together JEV's energy innovation and Smartkem's semiconductor capabilities. We look forward to discussions toward a definitive agreement."

Anthony Amato, Strategic Advisor to Smartkem

"This extension indicates the significant potential that both parties see in combining the complementary capabilities of JEV's energy platform with Smartkem's semiconductor technology to meet the power and performance needs of next-generation AI infrastructure."

The LOI is non-binding, and there can be no assurance that Smartkem and Jericho will ultimately enter into a definitive agreement for the Proposed Transaction, that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated, or as to the timing or ultimate terms of any Proposed Transaction that may occur. Both Smartkem and Jericho will need significant additional capital to complete the negotiation of the Proposed Transaction, obtain any required stockholder approvals and ultimately complete the Proposed Transaction. The closing of the Proposed Transaction would be subject to significant closing conditions, including the negotiation of the definitive agreement, the satisfactory completion of due diligence, required board and stockholder approvals, and approval of continued listing by Nasdaq.

[TITLE]Aramco Redefines Oil Power in $120 Billion U.S. Tech and LNG Alliance:
[TEXT]
The outcome of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, including his meeting with Trump and his entire entourage, has been successful, at least by media reporting. The impact of all is still to be seen, but from the start, MBS’s visit not just rebooted a strained political relationship. The primary outcome, based on all, is that it has reset the economic core of the US–Saudi partnership around Aramco. While the largest oil company in the world had already found its place in global power projections, Aramco has now become the principal vehicle for turning headline investment promises into hard assets, contracts, and code.

Though 2025 isn’t over yet, Aramco’s multibillion-dollar dealmaking spree with the United States has already reached staggering levels. In May 2025, the oil company had already unveiled 34 preliminary agreements with US companies worth up to $90 billion, encompassing a wide range of projects, including LNG, refinery upgrades, AI, advanced materials, and finance. The latter is now followed by another 17 MOUs, adding another $30 billion in potential projects, from LNG and manufacturing to services procurement. If you take both figures together, it shows clearly that the Saudi pledge to raise total investments is now anchored at around $1 trillion.

Analysts should understand that these levels of financial commitments are no longer just

John Evans, Chief Executive Officer, said:

Subsea7 delivered 27% growth in Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2025 driven by a strong performance in Subsea and Conventional and Renewables. Group revenue remained at a high level while our Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by more than

460 bps year-on-year. This was the result of both solid execution, particularly in Subsea and Conventional, as well as the continued mix-shift of our backlog towards contracts with a more favourable risk-reward balance.

The resilience of our strategy – focused on long-cycle energy projects with advantaged economics – was demonstrated in the third quarter with order intake of $3.8 billion representing a book-to-bill of over 2 times, equating to a book-to-bill of 1.4 times for the first nine months of 2025. The award in August of a third subsea scope for the Sakarya gas development in Türkiye was a strong endorsement of the ability of our 3,000 engineers and project managers, as well as our experienced offshore crews, to leverage our differentiated solutions to create value for clients.

We expect the positive momentum in our business to continue supported by a record backlog approaching $14 billion as well as active tendering on a strong portfolio of future opportunities.

Third quarter project review

Within Subsea and Conventional, our vessels remained busy across the world, achieving a high level of utilisation. Seven Vega spent the majority of the quarter in Norway, installing pipe-in-pipe at Yggdrasil. Seven Oceans, Seven Navica and Seven Arctic were also active in Norway, at Irpa and Øst Frigg. In addition, in September, Seven Navica worked at Murlach and Bittern-Belinda in the UK. Seven Borealis and Seven Pacific continued working in Angola. In the third quarter, the second of our four pipelay support vessels (PLSVs) in Brazil – Seven Waves – commenced a new three-year contract for Petrobras, following the award in 2024. The final two PLSVs have rolled onto new contracts during the fourth quarter.

In Renewables, we delivered a robust financial result despite challenging market conditions. Seaway Strashnov successfully completed the installation of all 87 monopiles at Dogger Bank C in the UK, while Seaway Alfa Lift made good progress adding transition pieces. After a yard stay for a crane repair, Seaway Ventus continued work at the East Anglia THREE project in the UK. In August, Seaway Aimery transited to the US where, after 20 days on standby pending the lifting of a stop-work order, it began laying cables at the Revolution project.

Third quarter financial review

Revenue was $1.8 billion, in line with the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA of $407 million equated to a margin of 22%, up from 18% in Q3 2024. After depreciation and amortisation of $175 million, net operating income was $232 million, equating to a margin of 13%, up from 9% in the prior year period. After net foreign exchange losses of $38 million, net finance costs of $12 million and taxation of $73 million, net income was $109 million.

Net cash generated from operating activities in the third quarter was $283 million, including a $82 million unfavourable movement in net working capital. Net cash used in investing activities was $34 million mainly related to purchases of property, plant and equipment, while net cash used in financing activities was $123 million including lease payments of $79 million. During the quarter, cash and cash equivalents increased by $132 million to $546 million and, at 30 September 2025, net debt was $505 million, including lease liabilities of $421 million. This represents a significant improvement both sequentially, from $695 million in Q2 2025, and year-on-year, from $857 million in Q3 2024.

Third quarter order intake was $3.8 billion comprising new awards of $3.3 billion and escalations of $0.5 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 2.1 times. Backlog at the end of September was $13.9 billion, of which $2.0 billion is expected to be executed in the remainder of 2025, $6.0 billion in 2026 and $5.9 billion in 2027 and beyond.

Guidance

We anticipate that revenue in 2025 will be between $6.9 and 7.1 billion, while our Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be within a range from 20 to 21%.

Based on our firm backlog of contracts for execution in 2026, we expect revenue to be within a range of $7.0 to 7.4 billion, while our Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 22%.

[TITLE]Latin America’s Clean Energy Moment:
[TEXT]
Latin America has all the necessary ingredients for a successful clean energy transition, but can it pull it off? The region has enormous clean energy production potential, and already sources an impressive 70% of its electricity from renewables. However, the necessary infrastructural and policy supports to ensure a secure, sustainable, and just transition are lagging far behind.

A new white paper from the World Economic Forum, Energy Transition Readiness: Latin America and the Caribbean, finds that “while the region has some of the most favourable structural conditions worldwide – abundant renewables, critical mineral wealth and relatively low fossil fuel dependence – progress in transition readiness has not kept pace.” The World Economic Forum report also notes that while many other developing regions have reported major progress in this regard, Latin America and the Caribbean’s readiness levels have stagnated over the past decade.

There are a number of reasons for this inertia, but perhaps the most significant hurdle for the region’s lack of transition readiness is a persistent under-investment in infrastructure. Latin America’s power grids are insufficient and unfit for the region’s growing and evolving energy needs. Energy losses through transmission and distribution are above the global average (13.5 percent versus 10.2 percent). Moreover, the World Economic Forum reports that “ageing grids and limited interconnections restrict the integration of renewables.”

The region is also beset by gaps in clean energy investment, innovation, and human capital. A lack of funding has hindered research and development progress and capacities across Latin America and the Caribbean, and served to disincentivize the growth of a skilled workforce. Altogether, the 33 countries that make up the region contributed just 4 percent of the world’s global transition capital in 2025, at a total of $70 billion. This falls far short of the $150 billion that the region needs to contribute annually by 2030 in order to be transition-ready.

“Structural challenges – from infrastructure bottlenecks to fragmented policies, limited innovation and weak financing – highlight the critical areas where focused reform and investment can unlock the region’s full potential,” writes the World Economic Forum.

And that potential is enormous. The region has all the raw materials to become a clean energy powerhouse, and foreign investors have taken notice. China’s presence in the region’s markets has grown immensely in recent years, and supply chains and trade relations with Beijing are increasingly central to Latin American economies. Around 90% of all installed wind and solar technologies in Latin America are produced by Chinese companies. China has inked bilateral trade pacts with Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Peru, and its Belt and Road Initiative has invested in all manner of infrastructure projects in 21 Latin American countries since 2013.

Latin America’s trade patterns leave it exposed to critical economic vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to energy trade. Many nations in the region are what is known as “dual energy-dependent”, meaning that they both export and import fossil fuels, leaving them exposed to price volatility on both ends. Moreover, increasing economic and financial reliance on just one country – China – results in critical geopolitical risks.

Foreign companies are also quickly turning Latin America into a global hub for data center construction, transforming regional economies and energy systems on the crest of the global AI boom. The data center market in Latin America is projected to double in valuation by the end of the decade. Brazil, Mexico, and Chile are leading this growth trend, and other countries like Colombia, Peru, Costa Rica, and Panama are emerging as new investment centers. This development is allowing the U.S. and allies to nearshore their supply chains while also offshoring the resource needs, grid stress, and public backlash associated with data center development.

This boom will place even more stress on the region’s already beleaguered power grids and create a new urgency for shoring up transition readiness. In order to avoid catastrophic grid failures, rolling blackouts, and growing reliance on energy imports, the World Economic Forum argues that meeting goals for energy security and transition readiness requires “action across four pillars: stronger policy frameworks, deeper regional integration, scaled financing partnerships, and greater investment in innovation and skills.”

[TITLE]Serbia scrambles to ensure its winter energy security – DW – 11:
[TEXT]
Serbia's balancing act between its EU ambitions and close ties with Russia faces a severe test this winter. The unresolved fate of Serbia's Russian-owned oil and gas company NIS threatens the country's energy security.

For Serbia's authorities, the clock is ticking: By November 25, the government must decide what to do with the oil and gas company Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS) — a decision that raises major energy security, financial and geopolitical dilemmas that Belgrade can no longer postpone.

The Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom Neft holds a 45% stake, and another Russian firm, Intelligence, an 11.3% stake in NIS, putting it in the crosshairs of US sanctions aimed at preventing Russia from using energy revenues to fund its war in Ukraine.

These sanctions have been postponed no less than eight times since January but finally came into effect on October 9.

Their impact was felt immediately: US measures disrupted the flow of crude oil via the JANAF pipeline, leaving Serbia's refinery with only enough supplies to process until the end of November, according to Serbian officials.

Impact on Serbia's energy security and financial stability

NIS occupies a strategically crucial position in Serbia's energy system. It operates a refinery in Serbia and supplies more than four-fifths of the country's gasoline and diesel, as well as nearly all aviation and heavy fuel.

Shutting down a refinery, warned energy expert Milos Zdravkovic, would have catastrophic consequences for the economy.

"NIS employs around 14,000 people. They [NIS] contributed around €2 billion ($2.3 billion) to Serbia's budget [state coffers] in 2023 and €2.08 billion in 2024. This is crucial for our GDP and budget, and we can't do without it," Zdravkovic told DW.

But there is even more at stake: NIS is subject to secondary sanctions, which means that any company or bank doing business with it could also be affected.

Jorgovanka Tabakovic, governor of the National Bank of Serbia (NBS), has confirmed that NBS has received warnings that it could fall under secondary sanctions if it works with an entity already under measures.

"I hope those sanctions won't happen because that would mean a blockage of all payments," said Tabakovic.

What solutions are being explored?

The only way out of the crisis is a permanent change in ownership, in other words the exit of Russian shareholders from NIS.

Serbia is now trying to find a solution.

Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic has said that Gazprom Neft has agreed to sell its stake in NIS.

She emphasized that the name of the third-party buyer is not being disclosed at the present time because negotiations are ongoing.

Would the state buy Gazprom Neft's stake?

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has said that if the agreement with this third party falls through, the state will buy the stake.

"If we don't have another solution, no matter the cost, we will find the money. We will negotiate with the Europeans and everyone else," said Vucic, adding "We will secure the funds… I want to avoid confiscation, nationalization and the seizure of assets at all costs."

Energy expert Milos Zdravkovic says that Serbia is 'between a rock and a hard place'. On the one hand, US sanctions are halting the NIS refinery's operations. On the other, Serbia relies on Russian gas Image: Darko Vojinovic/AP Photo/picture alliance

Economic journalist Radojka Nikolic estimates that such a purchase would likely cost Serbia between €1.5 billion and €2 billion.

If financed from the state budget, the country might have to delay other projects, such as the Expo 2027 project, or the construction of a national stadium. Alternatively, it could incur additional debt or draw from budget reserves.

"That would be a very bad signal, because foreign exchange reserves exist to guarantee the state's current liquidity," Nikolic told DW. "It's quite risky. It sends out a very bad message. Reserves are not such a guarantee. They could be used for something else."

Geopolitical dilemma

Because Serbia is energy-dependent on the East and financially dependent on the West, the government's decision on NIS raises a series of interconnected dilemmas that Serbia can no longer avoid.

"We are between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, US sanctions are halting the refinery's operations. On the other, we rely on Russian gas. That's an even bigger problem because Serbia consumes 2.8–3 billion cubic meters [98.8–105.9 billion cubic feet] of gas annually, of which 1.73–1.75 billion goes to industry. Gas cannot be bought at a newsstand, so, you can't get it whenever you want," energy expert Milos Zdravkovic explained.

[TITLE]Geothermal Energy Poised to Nearly Double in Value by 2034:
[TEXT]
The primary challenge facing the sector is the high initial capital investment required for exploration and drilling, though increasing global investment in clean energy and supportive regulatory frameworks are helping to mitigate these financial hurdles.

Market expansion is heavily reliant on technical advancements, such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), which enable heat extraction in regions without naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs.

The global geothermal power market is forecast to nearly double in value from $7.4 billion in 2024 to $14.5 billion by 2034, reflecting a 7.0% Compound Annual Growth Rate.

Geothermal power, which harnesses the Earth’s natural heat for electricity generation, heating, and industrial processes, is recognized within the energy sector for its high capacity factor. This reliability is a key differentiator, enabling geothermal plants to provide consistent baseload power, unlike intermittent sources such as solar and wind, according to industry analysts. This positioning makes geothermal a critical component in building resilient, low-carbon electricity grids.

The global geothermal power market is projected to nearly double in value over the next decade, driven by increasing global demand for stable, continuous renewable energy sources, according to a report published by Allied Market Research (AMR).

The market was valued at $7.4 billion in 2024 and is estimated to reach $14.5 billion by 2034, reflecting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of seven point zero percent (7.0%) from 2025 to 2034, the research firm stated.

Market expansion is being facilitated by technical advancements aimed at accessing a wider range of subterranean heat resources. Progress in exploration and drilling technologies, including those used for Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), are cited as major factors boosting efficiency and reducing operational expenses. EGS technology, in particular, works by injecting fluid deep underground under controlled conditions to create new fractures and increase rock permeability, which allows for heat extraction even in regions lacking naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs.

The geothermal industry relies on three primary power station configurations for electricity generation: dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle.

Dry steam power stations, the oldest type, use steam drawn directly from the Earth.

Flash steam power stations use high-pressure hot water, flashing it into steam to drive turbines. The binary cycle segment, which uses a secondary working fluid with a lower boiling point to capture heat from the geothermal fluid, currently holds the largest market share.

Binary cycle technology is dominant due to its ability to utilize low-to-medium temperature resources, which are more geographically accessible and abundant than the high-temperature reservoirs required for dry or flash steam systems, according to AMR.

Financial and Regulatory Hurdles

Despite the favorable growth forecast, the market faces significant restraints, primarily related to high initial capital investment. Geothermal projects require substantial financial resources during the exploration and drilling phases, which often involve extensive geological surveys, seismic studies, and test drilling. The cost of drilling can reach several million dollars per well, depending on geological conditions and required depth. The risk associated with non-productive wells further contributes to the financial strain, often resulting in longer payback periods compared to other established renewable energy technologies.

However, increasing investment in clean energy infrastructure globally is creating opportunities that may mitigate these financial hurdles. Governments and international financial institutions are channeling more funds into renewables, including geothermal, to diversify the global energy mix and finance costly exploration.

Regulatory frameworks in major markets are also designed to support adoption. In the European Union, the Renewable Energy Directive encourages geothermal adoption to meet overall energy targets. In the United States, the Department of Energy (DOE) promotes geothermal projects under energy efficiency and sustainability mandates. Geothermal projects must comply with safety and environmental guidelines, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) requirements under the Clean Air Act and the National Environmental Policy Act concerning emissions, water usage, and land disturbance.

Ultimately, while the geothermal power sector is projected for healthy growth due to its ability to provide consistent baseload power and technical innovation like EGS, its trajectory remains dependent on sustained investments and policies that overcome the inherent high upfront costs associated with accessing the Earth’s deep heat resources.

[TITLE]Azerbaijan Bets Big on China to Power Its Green Energy Corridor:
[TEXT]
Azerbaijan is hoping China can play a big role in helping Baku fulfill its ambitions of building a “green energy corridor” to Europe.

Azerbaijani officials and representatives of China's Datang Overseas Investment Co. signed a deal on November 12 covering the construction of a 100 Megawatt solar power plant. The sides also agreed to explore the development of offshore wind power, energy storage systems, and the implementation of technical training programs.

The solar farm will be situated in the Gobustan District south of Baku, with a target completion date for the second half of 2026. China's Jinko Solar announced that it will supply solar panels for the plant, while Turkey's EPRA Energy has confirmed that it has conducted grid connection, grid code compliance, and power quality analyses for the project.

The Datang deal is an outgrowth of Azerbaijani leader Ilham Aliyev’s April visit to Beijing, which saw the signing of six separate cooperation agreements covering the potential development of renewable energy projects in Azerbaijan.

[TITLE]Aramco Redefines Oil Power in $120 Billion U.S. Tech and LNG Alliance:
[TEXT]
The outcome of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, including his meeting with Trump and his entire entourage, has been successful, at least by media reporting. The impact of all is still to be seen, but from the start, MBS’s visit not just rebooted a strained political relationship. The primary outcome, based on all, is that it has reset the economic core of the US–Saudi partnership around Aramco. While the largest oil company in the world had already found its place in global power projections, Aramco has now become the principal vehicle for turning headline investment promises into hard assets, contracts, and code.

Though 2025 isn’t over yet, Aramco’s multibillion-dollar dealmaking spree with the United States has already reached staggering levels. In May 2025, the oil company had already unveiled 34 preliminary agreements with US companies worth up to $90 billion, encompassing a wide range of projects, including LNG, refinery upgrades, AI, advanced materials, and finance. The latter is now followed by another 17 MOUs, adding another $30 billion in potential projects, from LNG and manufacturing to services procurement. If you take both figures together, it shows clearly that the Saudi pledge to raise total investments is now anchored at around $1 trillion.

Analysts should understand that these levels of financial commitments are no longer just

[TITLE]Geothermal Energy Poised to Nearly Double in Value by 2034:
[TEXT]
The primary challenge facing the sector is the high initial capital investment required for exploration and drilling, though increasing global investment in clean energy and supportive regulatory frameworks are helping to mitigate these financial hurdles.

Market expansion is heavily reliant on technical advancements, such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), which enable heat extraction in regions without naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs.

The global geothermal power market is forecast to nearly double in value from $7.4 billion in 2024 to $14.5 billion by 2034, reflecting a 7.0% Compound Annual Growth Rate.

Geothermal power, which harnesses the Earth’s natural heat for electricity generation, heating, and industrial processes, is recognized within the energy sector for its high capacity factor. This reliability is a key differentiator, enabling geothermal plants to provide consistent baseload power, unlike intermittent sources such as solar and wind, according to industry analysts. This positioning makes geothermal a critical component in building resilient, low-carbon electricity grids.

The global geothermal power market is projected to nearly double in value over the next decade, driven by increasing global demand for stable, continuous renewable energy sources, according to a report published by Allied Market Research (AMR).

The market was valued at $7.4 billion in 2024 and is estimated to reach $14.5 billion by 2034, reflecting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of seven point zero percent (7.0%) from 2025 to 2034, the research firm stated.

Market expansion is being facilitated by technical advancements aimed at accessing a wider range of subterranean heat resources. Progress in exploration and drilling technologies, including those used for Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), are cited as major factors boosting efficiency and reducing operational expenses. EGS technology, in particular, works by injecting fluid deep underground under controlled conditions to create new fractures and increase rock permeability, which allows for heat extraction even in regions lacking naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs.

The geothermal industry relies on three primary power station configurations for electricity generation: dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle.

Dry steam power stations, the oldest type, use steam drawn directly from the Earth.

Flash steam power stations use high-pressure hot water, flashing it into steam to drive turbines. The binary cycle segment, which uses a secondary working fluid with a lower boiling point to capture heat from the geothermal fluid, currently holds the largest market share.

Binary cycle technology is dominant due to its ability to utilize low-to-medium temperature resources, which are more geographically accessible and abundant than the high-temperature reservoirs required for dry or flash steam systems, according to AMR.

Financial and Regulatory Hurdles

Despite the favorable growth forecast, the market faces significant restraints, primarily related to high initial capital investment. Geothermal projects require substantial financial resources during the exploration and drilling phases, which often involve extensive geological surveys, seismic studies, and test drilling. The cost of drilling can reach several million dollars per well, depending on geological conditions and required depth. The risk associated with non-productive wells further contributes to the financial strain, often resulting in longer payback periods compared to other established renewable energy technologies.

However, increasing investment in clean energy infrastructure globally is creating opportunities that may mitigate these financial hurdles. Governments and international financial institutions are channeling more funds into renewables, including geothermal, to diversify the global energy mix and finance costly exploration.

Regulatory frameworks in major markets are also designed to support adoption. In the European Union, the Renewable Energy Directive encourages geothermal adoption to meet overall energy targets. In the United States, the Department of Energy (DOE) promotes geothermal projects under energy efficiency and sustainability mandates. Geothermal projects must comply with safety and environmental guidelines, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) requirements under the Clean Air Act and the National Environmental Policy Act concerning emissions, water usage, and land disturbance.

Ultimately, while the geothermal power sector is projected for healthy growth due to its ability to provide consistent baseload power and technical innovation like EGS, its trajectory remains dependent on sustained investments and policies that overcome the inherent high upfront costs associated with accessing the Earth’s deep heat resources.

[TITLE]NextNRG Secures 28-Year Microgrid Power Purchase Agreement with California Healthcare Facility, Expanding into a Multi-Billion-Dollar Healthcare Resilience Market:
[TEXT]
Miami, FL, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NextNRG, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXXT), a pioneer in AI-driven energy innovation transforming how energy is produced, managed, and delivered, today announced the execution of a 28-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Sunnyside Nursing and Post-Acute Care Center in Torrance, California. This milestone marks a major step in NextNRG’s transition from development-stage projects into long-term ownership and operation of revenue-producing energy assets, generating approximately $5.0 million in gross revenue over the life of the agreement and establishing a stable, asset-backed cash flow stream.

This agreement positions NextNRG within one of the most attractive and underserved segments of the distributed energy market: the long-term care, post-acute, and assisted living sector. With more than 15,000 licensed nursing homes and an additional 32,000 assisted-living facilities in the United States, the total addressable market for resilient energy systems in this vertical exceeds $3.2 billion annually, with expected growth toward $7–8 billion over the next decade. These facilities must maintain continuous power for patient care, HVAC, and life-safety equipment, making them highly aligned with NextNRG’s “own-and-operate” microgrid model.

At the same time, regulatory pressure is rapidly reshaping this market and accelerating demand for on-site resiliency solutions. Many states are now requiring healthcare facilities to install extended backup power systems to protect patients who depend on continuous power during grid outages. In California, for example, mandates require that skilled nursing facilities maintain an alternate power source capable of operating for 96 hours as of January 1, 2024. In other states such as Florida and Texas, similar regulations now require long-term care facilities to maintain backup power capable of supporting heating and cooling systems for up to 96 hours during outages. These recently enacted requirements create a time-sensitive need for reliable, multi-source energy systems further validating the strategic value of entering this sector.

From the healthcare facility’s perspective, this PPA reduces risk by eliminating the need to fund high capital expenditures to build their own resiliency infrastructure. Under the PPA, they receive predictable, stable long-term energy pricing along with redundancy — solar, battery storage, and gas-powered backup generation — which supports their HCAI regulatory compliance and service requirements.

Project Overview

Under the agreement, NextNRG will develop and operate a multi-source microgrid at Sunnyside that blends 409 kW of rooftop solar, a 300 kW battery energy storage system, and integration with existing gas-fueled backup generation. This diversified energy mix ensures maximum reliability, enabling the facility to maintain power across grid disruptions while benefiting from optimized costs and clean generation. The system is expected to produce approximately 627,000 kWh in its first year.

As outlined in the project scope, NextNRG will complete a full roof replacement to support the solar array, deliver HCAI-compliant engineering and permitting, install QCells DuoPeak modules and SolarEdge inverters, upgrade electrical systems, and manage interconnection with Southern California Edison. NextNRG will own, operate, monitor, and maintain the system for the duration of the 28-year contract.

“Signing this long-term PPA with Sunnyside is a turning point for NextNRG,” said Michael D. Farkas, Executive Chairman and CEO of NextNRG. “We’re no longer just developing projects, we’re locking in long-term, contracted revenue for critical microgrid assets that we own and operate. This is exactly the evolution we’ve been working toward.”

“These kinds of facilities provide critical, power-dependent care, and simply cannot afford outages,” Farkas added. “Our microgrid will give Sunnyside dependable, clean, cost-controlled energy for decades to come, and we see this as the blueprint for many similar projects in the healthcare sector.”

[TITLE]Current climate plans might be amplifying disorder by increasing complexity faster than countries can adapt to it:
[TEXT]
As leaders gather for CoP-30 in Belém, Brazil, the world risks re-enacting a familiar ritual: ambitious declarations, accelerated timelines and renewed pressure on developing countries to decarbonize faster.

But beneath the rhetoric lies an uncomfortable truth.

The global climate strategy, as currently designed and sequenced, is generating the very disorder, fragility and instability it seeks to avert. It is pushing societies into what can be called ‘the entropy trap’: a condition in which well-intentioned transitions increase systemic complexity faster than they increase the capacity to manage it.

This is not an ideological argument. It is structural and, at its foundation, thermodynamic: Modern economies are vast systems of continuous energy transformation. Every transaction—running a factory, streaming a video or irrigating a field—is a thermodynamic process. And thermodynamics has an unforgiving constant: energy transformations tend to increase entropy, or disorder, unless supported by sufficient buffers, redundancies and stabilizing structures.

For two centuries, advanced economies kept entropy in check by relying on dense, stable and dispatchable energy sources: coal, oil and gas. These fuels powered predictable grids, scalable industrial systems and steady growth that built state capacity and social resilience.

The global climate agenda now seeks to replace these dense energy sources with diffuse, intermittent and geographically dispersed ones—solar and wind. This shift is essential in the long run. But the way it is being pursued—rapidly, uniformly and often prematurely—adds complexity before countries have built the institutions, grids and financial systems needed to absorb it. When complexity outruns capacity, entropy rises.

This is not theoretical. It is already happening: In the Netherlands, rooftop solar adoption has surged. But distribution networks have not kept pace. Utilities have begun refusing new solar connections, producers are curtailed even when the sun is abundant and industrial users face rising congestion costs.

Here is the paradox: green abundance is creating infrastructural scarcity. The system cannot handle the bi-directional flows and volatility that come with a diffuse energy base. Solar panels are not the problem; the sequencing is.

Spain offers another warning. This April, widespread power disruptions occurred not because of insufficient renewable generation, but because its grid could not maintain stability under high levels of intermittent supply with inadequate balancing and storage capacity.

If a mature grid in a high-income, technologically sophisticated nation struggles under these conditions, what happens when countries with far weaker infrastructure are pushed to adopt similar pathways prematurely?

Also Read | CoP-30: India could deploy its carbon market to attain climate leadership

Across Europe, Australia, and parts of the US, we see the same pattern: curtailment rising, storage lagging, balancing costs increasing, volatility in wholesale markets growing and transmission bottlenecks multiplying. These are not failures of renewable energy. They are failures of timing, sequencing and system design—symptoms of entropy accumulation.

If advanced economies are encountering fragility under rapid renewable deployment, the risks for developing countries are even greater. Their grids are weaker, their fiscal space tighter, their industrial systems more power-sensitive and their societies more vulnerable to shocks.

Most developing countries operate grids with limited redundancy, thin transmission networks, minimal storage and inadequate balancing mechanisms. Introducing large volumes of intermittent energy can undermine reliability, industrial competitiveness and public trust.

The transition also demands enormous upfront capital investment—capital that must otherwise fund health, education and infrastructure. Manufacturing, the backbone of development, depends on stable baseload power. Intermittency hinders investment, undermines export competitiveness and poses risks to job creation. And because poor households spend a higher share of income on energy, price spikes or outages carry greater social and political consequences.

In short, the current mitigation-first model accelerates entropy in developing countries by increasing complexity without increasing the buffers needed to manage it.

Some argue that developing countries should restrain growth in the name of climate mitigation. This view misunderstands both development economics and thermodynamics.

Growth is how societies build the capacity needed to reduce entropy. It is the mechanism through which they expand grid resilience, strengthen public finances, build adaptation infrastructure, invest in technology and create stable political and social systems. High-income countries built this capacity over decades of fossil-fuel-driven industrialization.

Expecting developing countries to leapfrog directly to high-complexity, low-density energy systems without similar buffers is unrealistic and inequitable.

Growth is not the obstacle to climate action. It is the precondition for a stable transition: Recognizing the entropy trap does not mean abandoning ambition. It means sequencing the transition coherently and designing it to reduce, rather than amplify, systemic fragility. Adaptation must come first, as most climate-related losses in developing countries stem from vulnerability, rather than emissions.

Adaptation—coastal protection, heat resilience, water systems, climate-smart agriculture and so on—reduces entropy by increasing stability and lowering risk.

Renewables must expand, but in proportion to grid readiness, storage availability, industrial needs and fiscal capacity. Uniform timelines across countries with vastly different capabilities increase disorder, not resilience. Technology sharing—covering advanced grid software, power electronics, storage solutions and transmission innovations—is essential. Without it, developing countries cannot manage the complexity of modern energy systems.

Finally, finance must be restructured. What developing countries need is not more project loans, but large-scale risk-sharing arrangements, including sovereign guarantees from advanced economies and deeper capital pools anchored by multilateral institutions. Premature transition without financial stabilisers increases entropy; targeted guarantees reduce it.

The core message for CoP-30 is clear: climate goals cannot be met by pushing the world’s most vulnerable societies into higher entropy. A mitigation-first, transition-fast model risks destabilizing grids, slowing industrialization, straining public finances and weakening resilience. The alternative is a climate framework grounded in realism: growth first, adaptation immediately, renewables scaled as capacity expands and technology and finance aligned with developmental needs.

The second law of thermodynamics is not a barrier to climate ambition. It is a warning. Systems that increase complexity without increasing stabilizers will fail.

A stable climate requires stable societies. And stability requires development—powered by growth, supported by technology and financed with fairness.

These are the author’s personal views.
