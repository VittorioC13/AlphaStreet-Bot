Information technology outfit Megaport Ltd (ASX: MP1) has announced a $200 million capital raise and a major acquisition, which will open up a new business front for the company.

The company said on Tuesday that it would buy Latitude.sh, "a global, automated infrastructure platform delivering compute-as-a-service" for US$150 million up front and up to a further US$150 million contingent on revenue and integration targets.

Megaport also stated that it would invest approximately $43 million in expanding its operations in India, with the funds allocated to acquiring a leading network operator with a local team and approximately 400 active customers.

New capital to fund deals

The deals would be funded by a fully-underwritten $200 million placement to institutional shareholders at a price of $14.30 per share.

Up to another $20 million will be raised via a non-underwritten share purchase plan open to Megaport's retail shareholders, who will be able to subscribe for up to $30,000 worth of new shares at the placement price or a lower price if the shares trade below that.

Megaport also said that it had delivered "strong financial performance" through the first four months of the year, with annual recurring revenue running at $260.1 million for October this year, up 22% compared with the same month last year and first quarter revenue of $62.9 million, up 21% compared to the same period last year.

The company said in its statement to the ASX on Tuesday that the Latitude.sh acquisition was "highly strategic and financially compelling''.

The company added:

Latitude.sh is a globally scalable, high performance software platform that automates infrastructure. It is similar to Megaport and offers customers compute-as-a-service which can be provisioned on demand.

Megaport said it would set up a new "compute as a service" division based around Latititude.sh, giving it exposure to a US$13 billion compute market, which it said was expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 20%.

As the company said:

The market is being supported by customers increasingly seeking to run critical workloads globally, with low latency. Latitude.sh's CPU / GPU capabilities support deployed inference and training workloads closest to users, partners and data centres.

Megaport said Latitude.sh was profitable, with EBITDA margins of about 50%, and was growing its annual recurring revenue at more than 50%.

The acquisition will be funded with US$70 million in cash and about 7.8 million Megaport shares to make up the remaining US$80 million.

The extra US$150 million in contingent payments will be paid in three US$50 million tranches over three years, should the relevant milestones be met.

Megaport will hold its annual general meeting on 25 November. The company's shares remain suspended from trade and last changed hands for $15.30.

Oklahoma families face transportation barriers amid SNAP funding freeze

KOCO ^ | 11/6/25 | Olivia Hickey

Posted on by DallasBiff

As SNAP benefits remain frozen, many Oklahoma families struggle with transportation to access food pantries, while local charities offer some assistance.

Leveda Jordan Smith, a mother of three from southeast Oklahoma City, is among the over 600,000 residents who relied on SNAP benefits before the shutdown.

"Being a mother of 3, not receiving SNAP benefits has made it harder for us to figure out where our next meal is gonna come from, if we're gonna have enough to stretch by," Smith said.

Smith, who does not have a driver's license, depends on her significant other, friends, and family members for transportation. As a student on a tight budget, rideshares are not a viable option for her. The pantries in her area are typically open while she is in class or when her rides are at work. Currently, her family is stocked with canned and boxed goods, but fresh foods like meat, milk, and produce are out of reach.

[TITLE]Legault presents economic plan to help Quebec weather U.S. tariffs:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

Quebec Premier François Legault is warning the province may be heading toward a recession and says he has revised his economic priorities to help Quebec weather the storm caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

While his latest plan, announced less than a year before the 2026 general election, is largely inspired by the one that guided him since he was elected in 2018, it also includes some new ideas that, according to him, will help the province integrate into the new reality of the economy.

The situation is serious and Quebecers need to be “told the truth,” Legault told reporters on Monday, presenting his new economic vision for Quebec.

He said the province is "very close" to the threshold marking a recession, noting that economic uncertainty has paused some investments, which “will have an impact eventually."

Legault cited the forest industry’s 60,000 jobs as examples of positions that are at risk due to punishing 45 per cent tariffs from the United States.

He said he is keeping in min d Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney’s priorities, and he intends to intervene in the economy to create new jobs that he hopes will replace those that are set to disappear.

Legault pr esented his new economic vision for Quebec on Monday at the Beauharnois hydroelectric plant, days after giving CBC and Radio-Canada a preview.

WATCH | Premier says Quebec needs a plan to face a possible recession: Energy development at centre of Legault’s new economic vision to deal with U.S. tariffs | Duration 2:36 Premier François Legault’s strategy, called Quebec power, includes accelerating major infrastructure projects, boosting hydro production and ensuring the province’s businesses get their fair share of federal defence contracts. He says the idea is to replace jobs that will be lost due to the trade war caused by Donald Trump's tariffs.

Energy investments are key

Hydro-Québec is at the forefront of Legault’s “new economic vision,” with the premier saying that in Quebec, “we’re blessed by the gods.”

The Crown corporation is planning to invest $200 billion by 2035 to double its energy capacity – the biggest construction project in Quebec’s history, Legault added.

His plan also rests on the Churchill Falls MOU , the tentative agreement between Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador which would replace the 1969 hydroelectric contract between the provinces.

The deal would increase the power of Churchill Falls and develop a run-of-river plant on Gull Island. But since the election of Progressive Conservative Premier Tony Wakeham, who is aiming to get a better deal for his province, the agreement has been on shaky grounds.

Legault said he’s against putting more money on the table, but he would be open to the idea of modulating instalments differently.

The premier said he would be open, for example, to the idea of investing less money until 2041 — the end of the current contract — even if it means paying more later.

“If we’re making changes, I have things that I’d like to improve,” Legault warned. “It’s give and take.”

Critical minerals, defence

Despite the setbacks of Northvolt and other companies like Lion and Taiga Motors, Legault said he wouldn’t abandon the battery sector entirely, saying other opportunities will arise when Trump leaves the White House.

In the meantime, according to the premier, Quebec must take advantage of new "strategic opportunities,” such as critical minerals and defence.

The federal government announced in its latest budget investments of $30 billion over five years to strengthen national defence.

European Union countries also want to invest more in their armed forces to meet new spending targets they have set for themselves.

Quebec, according to Legault, is well positioned to meet those needs, especially given Bombardier and Davie, two Quebec flagship companies whose factories are capable of producing civilian and military equipment in the province.

WATCH | Legault prioritizing defence spending: Why Quebec is taking a new approach and making defence spending a top priority | Duration 4:50 Premier François Legault is slated to present his new economic vision for Quebec. Defence and security spending are expected to be the main focus. The government says it wants to help Quebec businesses to get their fair share of contracts from Ottawa and the European Union.

Investing in data centres

Part of Legault’s vision for Quebec is to invest more in data centres, despite them being energy-intensive and creating few jobs.

"Now, we have data centres that are ready to pay the full [electricity] price," Legault said. "And companies increasingly want to set up next to data centres.”

The premier said the Quebec government is already in contact with Google, but it would not allow the American giant to pay a preferential rate for hydroelectricity.

"I’m not closed to American companies as long as there are guarantees of benefits for Quebec, that prices are good and that we make big profits with hydroelectricity,” he told CBC and Radio-Canada on Friday.

Another bill to fast-track infrastructure projects

Legault hinted that his government would also introduce le gislation to give Hydro-Québec more leeway.

Finance Minister Eric Girard is set to table Bill Q-5 in the next few weeks, the premier said.

Bill Q-5, whose name alludes to the Carney government’s C-5 – One Canadian Economy Act – would exempt some infrastructure projects of national interest from certain environmental laws that would otherwise slow their materialization.

However, in 2020 the Legault government adopted Bill 66, which has a similar purpose.
