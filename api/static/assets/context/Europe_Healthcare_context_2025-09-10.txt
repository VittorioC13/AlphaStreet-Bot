[TITLE]Public perceptions of digitalisation and patient safety: a cross-sectional survey in Germany:
[TEXT]
Studies examining patient safety perceptions on digitalisation and their influencing factors are highly valuable for developing interventions and implementing strategies to improve perceived safety. 21 Despite the importance of this research, there is a lack of focus on identifying sociodemographic factors that affect the public perception of digitalisation and patient safety. Identifying these factors is crucial to designing targeted strategies to tackle patient safety problems. Therefore, this study first aimed to provide data on patient safety perceptions on digitalisation from the view of the German general public, and, second, it examined the sociodemographic factors influencing these perceptions.

In general, research on safety and digitalisation is growing, and the broader context of perceived safety in relation to healthcare digitalisation is receiving more attention. 21–24 The research group around Minartz et al 21 23 24 focused on the context of emotional and psychological safety referring to the perceived level of danger compared with the perceived level of comfort when interacting with digital technologies. This concept relates to patients’ subjective feelings of safety and well-being. 25 Minartz et al concluded that digital (health) literacy is a key factor in perceived safety. 21 However, they did not consider the patient safety perspective, which is understood as the focus on preventing harm during healthcare delivery. Ekman et al performed key informant interviews in Sweden on technical, regulatory and patient safety aspects. 19 Respondents highlighted both the potential benefits and challenges regarding patient safety and care quality. On the one hand, digital technologies were perceived as reliable and capable of enhancing care quality by providing more data to support clinical decision-making. On the other hand, respondents pointed out possible limitations of telemedicine, particularly for specific conditions and patients with more complex needs. It becomes apparent that a certain disappointment and disillusionment is spreading, especially among medical professionals. Wosny et al described frustrating experiences, raising concerns

[TITLE]INDIGO randomised controlled digital clinical trial: INvestigating DIgital outcomes and quality of life in cancer survivors – a study protocol:
[TEXT]
Reaching patients who are no longer receiving treatment or being followed up for their cancer has been a barrier to research. By using the primary care research infrastructure and social media, we hope to describe which methods of recruitment work across different demographic groups, tumour types and at different times post-treatment. We aim to explore outcomes in the short term (>1 year) and long term (>10 years) following a cancer diagnosis. The INDIGO study ("INvestigating DIgital Outcomes") is an innovative pan-cancer trial, in line with National Health Service (NHS) plans to transform digital health data collection, 28 intending to recruit people diagnosed with any type of cancer aged over 16, able to understand, read and write written English and have online access. It will run as a pilot in Northwest London and will be scaled nationally.

Public Health England successfully linked patients’ responses from NCPES to the national cancer registry with patients’ year of birth, sex, ethnicity and postcode. 27 Linking patient-reported outcomes or experiences to national cancer registry data provides context to those measures. We therefore aim to be able to assemble a dataset that has treatment details and PROMS data, without undue burden for patients.

Historically, PROM studies involved paper-based questionnaires with response rates of 54%–66%. They are associated with significant costs in terms of administration and data processing. Secure digital platforms are being increasingly used to reduce costs. 22–25 They offer an ability to edit, update and share questionnaires more easily, allowing iterative approaches to questionnaire design to maximise utility and minimise responder burden. Although clinical and administrative data are widely collected, PROMs data are largely missing and are not included within the National Cancer Patient Experience Survey (NCPES). 26 The National Cancer Patient Experience Survey (NCPES) focuses on patients’ experience of healthcare services; therefore, it does not include any validated PROM questionnaires (eg, European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level Version - EQ-5D-5L).

PROMs are tools which help to translate patients’ quality of life and results of their treatment into categories that clinical teams can measure and act on. 2 4 5 There have been studies looking at long-term outcomes, but these studies often focus on patients diagnosed with one cancer type 19 20 or patients who were still on follow-up 1–5 years from diagnosis. 7 19 20 There have been few large-scale studies exploring which healthcare services patients use in the long term. Those that have been performed often focus on costs, not qualitative measures. 21

It is estimated that in 2020 there were 3.4 million people in the UK living with or beyond a diagnosis of cancer. 1 There have been studies which have sought to develop and optimise patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in cancer care. 2–6 Patient-reported outcome collection to date has been in the context of clinical trials assessing treatment or post-treatment. 7–11 With tight entry criteria, patients in trials are not representative of the incident population and are limited in how much we can learn

[TITLE]Community pharmacists’ knowledge, practices and barriers in diabetes mellitus management during Ramadan in Jordan: a cross-sectional study:
[TEXT]
While pharmacists’ knowledge and practices regarding diabetes management during Ramadan have been investigated in some countries, 34 36 37 42 such studies are still lacking in Jordan. Given that community pharmacies are highly accessible and many patients in Jordan seek medical advice from pharmacists before consulting a physician, 26 43 it is crucial to assess the level of pharmacists’ understanding and practice of diabetes management during this period. This assessment can enhance patient care by addressing patients’ daily needs throughout the fasting period. Therefore, this study aimed to assess community pharmacists’ knowledge level and practices concerning diabetes management in Ramadan alongside the predictors affecting pharmacists’ knowledge and practice, and the barriers to providing optimal diabetes management in Jordan.

Jordan, a Middle Eastern country with a majority Muslim population, had an age-adjusted comparative prevalence of diabetes at 14.8% among Jordanians aged 20 to 79 years in 2021, 38 making it one of the countries with the highest diabetes prevalence worldwide. The prevalence has significantly increased from 13% in 1994 to 23.7% in 2017, with further increases expected in the coming years. 39 As a result, a growing number of people may be at risk of complications from fasting during Ramadan in Jordan. Furthermore, research from Jordan shows that DM is poorly controlled, and the level of adherence to diabetes self-care practices—such as diet, exercise, blood glucose monitoring and medication adherence—remains unsatisfactory among diabetic patients. 40 41 This highlights the critical importance of effective diabetes management and education, particularly during Ramadan.

Pharmacists play a vital role in the successful implementation of diabetes care guidelines and the overall management of diabetes during Ramadan by providing medication management and patient education. 34–36 As accessible healthcare professionals, pharmacists are in a unique position to provide free of charge personalised advice on medication adjustments and regular glucose monitoring, and offer guidance on diet, meal planning and physical activity. 34 35 They can also help identify patients at higher risk of complications and consequently provide comprehensive care to diabetic patients during Ramadan. 37

Globally, evidence has shown that pharmacists improve clinical outcomes in diabetes through patient education, medication review, adherence support and promotion of self-care behaviours. 19–24 Studies have demonstrated pharmacists’ effectiveness in improving glycaemic control, reducing HbA1c, preventing treatment side effects and enhancing quality of life. 19–24 In Jordan, most pharmacists, particularly in community and hospital pharmacies, primarily focus on dispensing and inventory management, with limited provision of structured clinical services such as patient education, medication reviews and individualised pharmaceutical care. 25–27 Nevertheless, pharmacists in Jordan play a growing role in diabetes management, moving beyond medication dispensing to active involvement in patient care, education, screening and therapy optimisation. 22 28–30 Integrating pharmacists into diabetes care teams in Jordan leads to better glycaemic control, improved patient knowledge and cost-effective health outcomes. 22 28–31 Despite some positive outcomes from pharmacist-led interventions in Jordanian settings, barriers such as lack of time for pharmacists, insufficient continuous education and limited patient knowledge
