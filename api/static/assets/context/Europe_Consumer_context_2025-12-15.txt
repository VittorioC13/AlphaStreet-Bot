This surge is driven by increasing consumer awareness around preventive healthcare, rising adoption of personalized wellness solutions, and a shift towards holistic health approaches. Emerging trends such as digital health integration, plant-based formulations, and sustainability initiatives are reshaping the landscape. As stakeholders prepare for this dynamic environment, understanding the strategic drivers and technological innovations shaping the market becomes essential for capitalizing on upcoming opportunities and mitigating risks.

First, technological advancements—particularly in AI, IoT, and data analytics—are enabling personalized health solutions, enhancing consumer engagement, and improving product efficacy. Second, regulatory shifts aimed at transparency and safety are fostering consumer trust and encouraging innovation, especially in dietary supplements and functional foods. Third, supply chain transformations, driven by digitalization and regional diversification, are reducing costs and increasing agility amid geopolitical uncertainties.

New Delhi: Retail inflation edged up slightly to 0.71% in November, from a record-low of 0.25% in October, as food deflation narrowed, official data released on Friday showed. Price pressures stayed muted amid goods and services tax (GST) cuts and softer food prices.This was the fourth month in FY26 that inflation stayed below the central bank's target range of 4%, with a margin of two percentage points on either side of that figure. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was 5.5% in November 2024."The uptick was primarily driven by the fading favourable base from last year and a seasonal rise in prices of certain food items, which narrowed the deflation within the food basket," said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at CareEdge Ratings.Food prices fell for sixth straight month, declining 3.9% in November after a 5% drop in October.Rural inflation rose marginally to 0.1% year-on-year from a 0.3% decline in October, while urban inflation increased to 1.4% from 0.9%.Out of 22 major states and union territories, eight recorded higher inflation than the national average. Kerala led with 8.3% inflation, followed by Karnataka (2.6%), Jammu & Kashmir (2.3%), Tamil Nadu (2.1%), and Punjab (1.7%)."The evolving inflation-growth outlook as well as the fiscal policy measures unveiled by the next union budget will guide the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) next decision," said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA . "Our base case suggests a pause in the February 2026 policy review."Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC Bank , though, believes there's scope for a rate cut. "With a comfortable inflation trajectory in place, we believe that the RBI has space to cut rates further by 25 bps, even though it remains a close call," she said.

[TITLE]Rich World’s Rate-Cut Momentum Is Fading Away:
[TEXT]
A deluge of delayed data will offer traders and policymakers a much-anticipated snapshot of the US labor market and broader economy.

Click here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.

Elsewhere, multiple data releases in China, inflation figures from the UK to Canada, jobs numbers in the US, and growth figures in Brazil will be among the highlights.

In comparison to the advanced-economy narrative of a potentially shifting tide for policy, the direction of travel elsewhere is less clear. Several other central banks, from Mexico to Thailand, are set to extend easing cycles in the coming week.

“Bloomberg Economics’ ECBspeak Index, our proprietary central bank sentiment indicator, suggests the hawks have the momentum and their preferred outcome for the December meeting — no change in interest rates — will surely be delivered.”

Policymakers in four other European countries are expected to keep borrowing costs steady. The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, is widely expected to hike.

The European Central Bank, meanwhile, is set to present higher growth forecasts that may cement the tentative rate hold officials have enforced since May, with questions to President Christine Lagarde likely to focus on how soon a pivot to tightening could transpire.

Among multiple decisions due on Thursday and Friday, the Bank of England’s probable reduction in borrowing costs may draw the most scrutiny. It’s an outcome that investors will look to for clues on whether it could be one of the BOE’s final moves of the cycle.

The Federal Reserve’s cloudy outlook for any further reductions following Wednesday’s quarter-point cut is one part of that backdrop. Another is that the global economy has apparently weathered US President Donald Trump’s tariff onslaught better than expected.

A year that dawned with the prospect of successive, if limited, rate cuts across the rich world is set to end with that momentum losing steam. Instead, central bankers are stepping back to assess how their progress so far is impacting growth and inflation.

The final flurry of global monetary policy decisions for 2025 is likely to showcase how the easing cycle in advanced economies either lacks fresh impetus or is effectively over.

Story Continues

Following the Fed’s latest decision to lower interest rates, the November jobs report — due on Tuesday — will begin to shape the 2026 outlook for borrowing costs.

Economists project a 50,000 increase in payrolls and a 4.5% unemployment rate, consistent with a sluggish, but not rapidly deteriorating, labor market.

The report will also include an estimate of October payrolls — figures that were delayed by the federal government shutdown. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it was unable to conduct its survey of households for the month, and as a result won’t publish an October unemployment rate.

The fallout from the longest-ever government shutdown extended to another high-profile economic indicator: the consumer price index. The November CPI report on Thursday will have no monthly changes for most of the price categories, including the overall CPI and core measure that excludes food and energy.

That’s because the BLS said it was unable to collect much of the October price information. November data collection was also delayed by the government shutdown, adding another caveat to the widely-watched figures.

The US will also issue figures on October retail sales. Excluding autos and gasoline, economists forecast an acceleration in outlays that would suggest solid consumer demand at the start of the fourth quarter.

New York Fed President John Williams, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Fed governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller are among US central bank speakers scheduled to appear this week.

Meanwhile, National Economic Council head Kevin Hassett — seen as the frontrunner to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair — told CBS’ that he’d consider Trump’s policy opinions if picked to lead the institution.

The president “has very strong and well-founded views

[TITLE]I wanted to prioritize travel for my family of 5, so I learned how to maximize credit card points and started a travel fund:

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

I used to scroll through friends' glamorous-looking vacation photos and feel a familiar pang, knowing there was no way my family could afford trips like that. But I didn't want to stew in jealousy, so I decided to figure out how we could travel more on our budget.

I started by prioritizing more local trips

Since some of my favorite travel memories aren't from far-off places but from day adventures or quick weekend trips, I learned to prioritize them in our calendar. Mini vacations are cheaper — no flights, rental cars, time off work, or dog sitters needed, since we generally bring our dog on these trips or leave her with the neighbor.

We live in Arizona, so we schedule hiking excursions with friends to Sedona's Red Rocks or other scenic areas at least once every few months. We also visit my parents, who live an hour and a half north of us, enjoying their cooler weather and small-town charm.

However, I don't want my family to miss out on exploring beyond our little bubble, so my next tactical move was to maximize credit card points.

My friend taught me how to maximize credit card points

I'd earned free flights and hotels before, but my friend showed me I had more to learn.

Over the past two years, I've signed up for credit cards when the point offers looked too good to pass up. I often book under my friend's referral link, so we both earn bonuses. My husband then signs up using mine, and we add each other as authorized users, often for extra points.

I currently have nine credit cards. It sounds intimidating, but it's manageable as I never add more than one sign-up bonus at a time. Closing cards can ding your credit score, so I phase them out slowly.

Some, though, I'll keep long-term, like my Sapphire card with its zero foreign transaction fees and great travel partners, and my Southwest card, which allows me to book flights with my Rapid Rewards points and offers one free checked bag for myself and up to eight guests.

Because the Sapphire card's points can be transferred to Southwest, I was able to combine them and book a flight for my family of five to Washington, D.C., this summer. The flight cost me 130,000 Rapid Rewards points, which is about $1,300. The only thing I paid out of pocket was the $56 in security fees. Then I used 78,914 introductory points from my husband's new Sapphire Chase card, valued at $788, to pay for half of our five-night hotel stay in Georgetown. In total, I saved around $2000.

One caveat: I always pay my credit cards off monthly. I want to be the one benefiting — not the credit card company.

Booking trips with family and friends makes travel more memorable and affordable

We often split hotels or Airbnbs with family or friends. Sharing costs makes trips more economical and usually more fun. We plan meals together, too, when the place we're staying has a kitchen, which further cuts costs.

I discovered that when new properties are listed on Airbnb, the first few stays are often discounted to drive more bookings and garner reviews. We've stayed in some upgraded places using this tactic. On an upcoming trip to Europe, I found a two-bedroom flat in London's city center with only a few reviews, offering a better deal at $970 for four nights, while many nearby properties were $1,300 or more.

I search for the best deals on transportation

While in Europe, we plan to take trains to and from a few cities. I was shocked by train costs. That's how I found Omio, which helped me compare, purchase, and store tickets for train, bus, and ferry trips in one place, saving me time and money.

When traveling, we rely on public transportation if the city is well-connected, only hopping in a rideshare or taxi if we are worn out. If we do need a rental car, I usually check a few companies to find the best deal, as rates can vary significantly.

On a seven-day trip to Maui in 2024, I found the best deal by booking directly with Alamo through my Sapphire rewards program. I secured a Chrysler Pacifica for 48,989 points, which equates to around $490.

I decide when to splurge and when to save

My dad's vacation rule: splurge on a nice hotel for a few nights, then switch to budget options. Admittedly, I am scarred by that one cockroach-infested motel he booked when I was 11, so I never go too budget. Still, I like his thinking. If we're traveling to multiple cities, we often take this approach, staying in one nicer place and then offsetting it with something more budget-friendly in the next.

Even with hacks, traveling is an expensive undertaking. Tucking money into a vacation fund every month helps, and staying strategic is key. For me, experiencing new places as a family is worth prioritizing.

Indian garment manufacturer CTA Apparels has applauded the Government of India's encouraging progress on the India-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA), with the blueprint now in advanced stages.Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal confirmed that negotiations have been "very positive," with both sides showing readiness to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement soon.The European Union is India's second-largest apparel export destination, accounting for nearly 27 per cent of India's garment exports, valued at over USD 7.5 billion annually.Currently, Indian apparel products face import duties ranging from 8 per cent to 12 per cent in the EU--tariffs that key competitors such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Turkey do not face due to preferential trade arrangements.A well-structured India-EU FTA could significantly narrow this competitive gap by reducing or eliminating tariffs, thereby enabling Indian exporters to offer more price-competitive, value-added products in Europe, CTA Apparels said in a statement."This move is expected to boost India's apparel exports by an estimated 20-25% over the next three years, according to industry trade projections," the statement added.Additionally, the agreement's focus on rules of origin, market access, sustainability, and technical standards will help in creating a predictable and stable environment for long-term investments in the textile value chain.For responsible and sustainability-driven manufacturers, the FTA presents an opportunity to scale global partnerships and strengthen India's presence in premium European markets. Mukesh Kansal , Chairman, CTA Apparels, said, "The progress on the India-EU FTA is a welcome development for India's apparel sector. The European Union is one of our most important partners, and a fair, forward-looking trade agreement will unlock new opportunities for growth, technology adoption, and sustainable value creation. CTA Apparels stands fully aligned with India's vision of strengthening global trade partnerships rooted in quality, transparency, and innovation."A 40-member European Union negotiating team was in New Delhi earlier this month, marking the most intensive phase of the India-EU free trade agreement (FTA) discussions, aimed initially at concluding it by the end of this year.India-EU FTA talks were relaunched in 2022.

[TITLE]Costco Beats Q1 Earnings Estimates With 6.4% Comparable Sales Growth:
[TEXT]
Costco Wholesale Corporation COST reported first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, wherein the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the bottom line beat the same. Nonetheless, both revenues and earnings improved year over year, driven by robust membership growth, resilient traffic, double-digit e-commerce gains and margin expansion.

Costco’s Quarterly Performance: Key Metrics and Insights

Costco posted quarterly earnings of $4.34 per share, which excludes a 16-cent tax benefit, and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.26. This compared favorably with the prior-year period’s earnings of $3.82 per share, which excludes a 22-cent tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Including the tax benefit, quarterly earnings came in at $4.50, up from $4.04 per share reported in the prior-year period.

Total revenues, comprising net sales and membership fees, reached $67,307 million, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter. However, the figure came just shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $67,326 million. Momentum was driven by healthy traffic trends, continued strength in international markets and strong digitally enabled sales. E-commerce remained a standout contributor, helped by better personalization tools and improved app functionality.

Costco’s comparable sales rose 6.4% year over year in the quarter. Comparable sales in the United States grew 5.9%, while Canada and Other International markets saw increases of 6.5% and 8.8%, respectively. Digitally enabled comparable sales surged 20.5%, supported by solid performance across categories such as pharmacy, jewelry, tires, small electrics, apparel and majors.

Costco’s strategic investments, customer-centric approach and merchandise initiatives, along with an emphasis on membership growth, have helped it capture market share and maintain steady revenue growth. By prioritizing value and quality, the company has built strong customer loyalty, leading to an impressive membership renewal rate of 92.2% in the United States and Canada and 89.7% worldwide in the quarter.

Costco Achieves Membership Growth and Improved Margins

Net sales climbed 8.2% year over year to $65,978 million, while membership fees jumped 14% to $1,329 million, benefiting from strong renewal rates and the annualized benefit of the recent membership fee increase. Excluding the membership fee increase and FX, membership income jumped 7.3% year over year. Costco ended the quarter with 81.4 million paid household members, up 5.2% from the year-ago period, and total cardholders grew 5.1% to 145.9 million. Executive memberships increased 9.1% to 39.7 million.

Traffic improved 3.1% worldwide and 2.6% in the United States, while the average transaction or ticket increased 3.2% both globally and in the United States. Excluding the effects of gasoline price changes and foreign exchange, total comparable sales rose 6.4%, with the United States up 5.9%, Canada up 9% and Other International gaining 6.8%.

Gross margin expanded 4 basis points year over year to 11.3%, driven by efficiencies in fresh foods, better inventory execution, higher Kirkland Signature penetration and strength in ancillary businesses. The operating income grew 12.2% to $2,463 million, while the operating margin improved 20 basis points to 3.7%.

[TITLE]With a $35 billion push, Amazon puts e-commerce rivals on notice:
[TEXT]
Amazon.com Inc.’s plan to invest an additional $35 billion in India by 2030 is expected to intensify competition in the online commerce and prompt rivals to increase their spending on infrastructure, supply chains, and consumer acquisition.

The US tech giant, which has already deployed $40 billion in the country, will invest money in all of its businesses—its core e-commerce operations, cloud computing division Amazon Web Services, entertainment businesses including Prime Video and MX Player, and its devices segment.

“Other players will be pushed to accelerate investments of their own, spurring faster innovation, deeper regional penetration, and more nuanced strategies for tier-II and tier-III markets," said Naveen Malpani, partner and retail and e-commerce industry leader, consulting firm Grant Thornton Bharat.

Deeper penetration

Amazon, which has millions of Prime subscribers in the country, has been stepping up its promise of quicker deliveries.

For instance, this festive season, Prime members drove demand from tier-II and tier-III cities across key categories, including appliances, fashion and beauty, smartphones, and furniture. Prime members experienced faster deliveries, with over 3 million products delivered in metro cities within the same day or the next day, and more than 5 million products reaching customers in tier-II and -III cities within two days.

Although a late entrant in the quick-commerce play, it is also expanding its presence through Amazon Now, its 10-minute delivery service that now operates in three cities with more than 300 micro-fulfilment centres. The company is adding two centres a day as it scales its shorter delivery-window model.

Udit Madan, senior vice-president, worldwide operations at Amazon, said speed remains a central focus for the business. “We’re going to get to faster speeds—not just our fastest speeds with Amazon Now, but by expanding into more and more areas. This is a significant area of investment for us and one that will shape the business and demand patterns in India. A large part of our investment this year went towards speeding up and improving reliability in tier II-III markets, something we are now doing in parts of the US and Europe."

India’s online commerce ecosystem has expanded significantly over the last decade, dominated by companies such as Walmart-backed Flipkart, Amazon, Meesho, Nykaa, Swiggy, and Eternal Ltd.

While the overall retail market is expected to grow from $1 trillion in 2024 to $1.7 trillion by 2030, according to estimates from consulting firm Deloitte, online retail is projected to grow much faster—from $75 billion in 2024 to $260 billion by 2030—doubling its share of total retail to 14%.

Quicker response

Young shoppers are increasingly comfortable buying everything from cosmetics to apparel on their smartphones. This is especially true post-covid with the entry of new quick-commerce players such as Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, Zepto, etc.

The global Health and Wellness Products Market is projected to reach a valuation of over $1.2 trillion by 2026, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.8%. This surge is driven by increasing consumer awareness around preventive healthcare, rising adoption of personalized wellness solutions, and a shift towards holistic health approaches. Emerging trends such as digital health integration, plant-based formulations, and sustainability initiatives are reshaping the landscape.

[TITLE]CEO Talks: Hannah Colman of Jimmy Choo on Starting at the Bottom, Growth and Plans Under Capri:
[TEXT]
LONDON — In the world of luxury, Hannah Colman, chief executive officer of Jimmy Choo, is a rarity. She spent her entire career at the company before taking up the top job in 2020, starting in 1997 as a “Saturday girl,” working on the shop floor of the brand’s first and only store on Motcomb Street in Belgravia.

After doing the weekend shifts, she became manager of that store and in the ensuing years worked her way up the management ranks. She served as president EMEA [Europe, Middle East and Africa] and global e-commerce, and later interim CEO after her predecessor, Pierre Denis, left the job.

Unusually for a luxury CEO, she has a long-standing, collaborative and warm relationship with the brand’s creative chief, Sandra Choi, a niece of the namesake cofounder. Colman and Choi worked together for decades under various private equity and industry owners before Capri Holdings purchased Jimmy Choo in 2017.

Over the years they’ve helped fuel growth at the brand, which posted $605 million in revenue in fiscal 2025, opening stores; dressing celebrities on- and off-screen; adding product offshoots and licenses to the footwear mix, and building up the handbag category, which now accounts for a large chunk of sales.

Their tight relationship has meant that Jimmy Choo, which turns 30 in 2026, still has the feel of an entrepreneurial family business despite its corporate ownership.

Here, Colman talks
