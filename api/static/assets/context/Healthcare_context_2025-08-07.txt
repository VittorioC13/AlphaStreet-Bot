[TITLE]Capsa Healthcare Acquires BlueBin to Advance Intelligent Clinical Supply Management:
[TEXT]
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capsa Healthcare, a leader in healthcare workflow and supply management solutions, today announced the acquisition of BlueBin, a recognized innovator in Kanban-based supply chain systems and predictive analytics for healthcare. This strategic move brings together two complementary capabilities that together enhance visibility, efficiency, and reliability across the entire clinical supply chain.

By integrating BlueBin’s proven methodologies and analytics with Capsa’s point-of-care and supply management technologies, the combined solution aims to reduce operational friction, improve supply availability, and return valuable time to clinical teams.

“Healthcare systems are under increasing pressure to do more with less—clinically, operationally, and financially,” said Gaurav Agarwal, Chief Executive Officer at Capsa Healthcare. “This acquisition reflects our continued commitment to developing intelligent infrastructure that equips, enables, and engineers solutions to free up clinical care and deliver measurable financial results.”

BlueBin’s solutions are currently deployed in over 250 hospitals, with a strong track record of client retention and operational impact. At Memorial Hermann Health System, BlueBin’s Kanban implementation led to $4 million in annual supply savings and an additional $2.4 million in operational efficiencies.

The BlueBin acquisition reinforces Capsa’s capability to optimize healthcare operations, reduce waste, and enhance patient care.

Clinical Focus: Reduces time clinicians spend on supply-related tasks, allowing more time for patient care

Operational Visibility: Provides real-time data on inventory levels and usage patterns

Financial Efficiency: Helps reduce supply costs and optimize inventory levels

Space Utilization: Minimizes storage footprint, freeing up space for clinical use

BlueBin’s leadership and implementation model will remain in place, with Charles Hodge continuing as President and CEO. His team’s hands-on, community-based approach to implementation will ensure continuity and success for current and future clients.

“This partnership allows us to scale our mission of ensuring the right supplies reach the right place at the right time,” said Hodge. “Together with Capsa, we’re building a smarter, more responsive supply chain that supports both caregivers and patients.”

With this acquisition, Capsa Healthcare becomes the only provider offering a complete clinical supply management solution—from warehouse to bedside—through a single partner.

The Offer and withdrawal rights for all outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Shares”), of Sage in exchange for (i) $8.50 per Share, net to the seller in cash, subject to any withholding of taxes and without interest (the “Closing Amount”), plus (ii) one non-transferable and non-tradable contingent value right per Share (a “CVR”), which represents the right to receive up to $3.50 per Share upon the satisfaction of specified milestones (as described further in the Offer to Purchase), net to the seller in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes, pursuant to the CVR Agreement (the Closing Amount plus one CVR collectively, the “Offer Price”), expired as scheduled at one minute following 11:59 p.m., New York time, on July 30, 2025 (the “Expiration Time”).

Each CVR paid to Sage stockholders represents a non-transferable and non-tradable contractual contingent right to receive a cash payment of up to $3.50, net to the seller in cash, subject to any withholding of taxes and without interest, upon the achievement of certain milestones in accordance with the terms of the Contingent Value Rights Agreement entered into between Supernus and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC as rights agent, (the “CVR Agreement”).

[TITLE]Capsa Healthcare Acquires BlueBin to Advance Intelligent Clinical Supply Management:
[TEXT]
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capsa Healthcare, a leader in healthcare workflow and supply management solutions, today announced the acquisition of BlueBin, a recognized innovator in Kanban-based supply chain systems and predictive analytics for healthcare. This strategic move brings together two complementary capabilities that together enhance visibility, efficiency, and reliability across the entire clinical supply chain.

By integrating BlueBin’s proven methodologies and analytics with Capsa’s point-of-care and supply management technologies, the combined solution aims to reduce operational friction, improve supply availability, and return valuable time to clinical teams.

“Healthcare systems are under increasing pressure to do more with less—clinically, operationally, and financially,” said Gaurav Agarwal, Chief Executive Officer at Capsa Healthcare. “This acquisition reflects our continued commitment to developing intelligent infrastructure that equips, enables, and engineers solutions to free up clinical care and deliver measurable financial results.”

BlueBin’s solutions are currently deployed in over 250 hospitals, with a strong track record of client retention and operational impact. At Memorial Hermann Health System, BlueBin’s Kanban implementation led to $4 million in annual supply savings and an additional $2.4 million in operational efficiencies.

The BlueBin acquisition reinforces Capsa’s capability to optimize healthcare operations, reduce waste, and enhance patient care.

Clinical Focus: Reduces time clinicians spend on supply-related tasks, allowing more time for patient care

Operational Visibility: Provides real-time data on inventory levels and usage patterns

Financial Efficiency: Helps reduce supply costs and optimize inventory levels

Space Utilization: Minimizes storage footprint, freeing up space for clinical use

BlueBin’s leadership and implementation model will remain in place, with Charles Hodge continuing as President and CEO. His team’s hands-on, community-based approach to implementation will ensure continuity and success for current and future clients.

“This partnership allows us to scale our mission of ensuring the right supplies reach the right place at the right time,” said Hodge. “Together with Capsa, we’re building a smarter, more responsive supply chain that supports both caregivers and patients.”

With this acquisition, Capsa Healthcare becomes the only provider offering a complete clinical supply management solution—from warehouse to bedside—through a single partner.

This milestone significantly enhances the Company's reach, operational capacity, and growth trajectory – including the addition of over 5 billion administrative records that support aggregated health economics research and insights into social determinants of health.

Driven by the rising demand for high-quality longitudinal data, rare disease insights, and datasets that include health economics and social determinants of health, OneMedNet has rapidly accelerated the development of new partner sites across its nationwide network.

25% iRWD™ network expansion

1750+ healthcare system and provider partner sites

34 million patients

136 million clinical exams

5 billion Administrative Records, inclusive of claims

Addresses rare diseases, underserved populations, and high-demand RWD sectors by enabling insights into health economic and social determinants

Poised for significant revenue growth through increased data licensing and new enterprise partnerships

This exponential growth not only reinforces OneMedNet’s position as a premier data partner but also lays the foundation for accelerated revenue generation, customer acquisition, and data monetization at scale.

At OneMedNet, we believe Real-World Evidence is only as powerful as the clinical integrity of the data behind it. The OneMedNet iRWD™ network and platform delivers regulatory-grade depth and precision, enabling life sciences, payers, and healthcare innovators to generate clinically grounded insights that are actionable and reflective of how care is delivered in the real world. As the $60 billion RWE industry1, continues to transform, OneMedNet is proud to be at the forefront, helping make evidence generation faster, more effective, and more grounded in real clinical reality says Aaron Green, President & CEO, OneMedNet.
