[TITLE]Empty pipelines, empty desks: Inside Nigeria’s oil and gas manpower meltdown (1):
[TEXT]
Nigeria’s oil and gas industry is hurtling toward a major crisis, not from dwindling reserves or hostile divestments, but from an alarming shortage of skilled professionals to drive the next phase of growth, DAMILOLA AINA writes

When Adedayo Ajibola, a 25-year-old geology graduate from one of Nigeria’s top federal universities in the South-West, woke up at 5:30 am on a rainy Wednesday morning in his parents’ modest bungalow in Sango-Ota, Ogun State, he carried with him the kind of hope only the young can summon. By 9 am, after braving the notorious Lagos traffic and a torrential downpour that drenched his well-ironed shirt, he arrived at an oil servicing firm’s office (name withheld) in Alagomeji, Yaba. It was supposed to be his big job break after completing his National Youth Service Corps assignment in February this year.

Instead, Adedayo left the glass doors of the office with a heavy heart. The interviewer, after scanning his carefully arranged curriculum vitae, dismissed him as “too fresh” for the job. “You don’t have any work experience yet,” the recruiter told him. “It won’t be easy for you to learn. You need to gain some experience. For now, we don’t have any available slots for you,” he recounted during a sit-down conversation with The PUNCH last month. The words, delivered almost casually, cut deep.

Adedayo carries the weight of a second-class lower division degree, a badge he believes brands him undesirable in Nigeria’s cutthroat job market for the oil and gas sector.

Pleading his case, the athletic young man, standing at 5 feet 9 inches, highlighted the practical skills he honed during his training with industrial companies, analysing rock samples and assisting with field surveys. But the man explained that without hands-on laboratory or field work, the firm could not take him on. At best, he would connect Adedayo to a friend in Lekki, who could provide hands-on training for fresh graduates. That, too, sounded like another waiting game.

The interviewer’s parting words were to “go learn elsewhere, then come back.”

But where exactly is “elsewhere, when no company is willing to take a chance on fresh graduates like me?” the young job seeker quipped.

As Adedayo trudged back into the rain-soaked streets, his thoughts wandered to his parents, who had stretched themselves thin to see him through school. The rejection felt like failure, not just his own, but theirs too.

“Sometimes I ask myself, was it worth it? I did everything society said I should: finished school, served my country, and yet here I am, still being told I am not enough,” he said, his voice heavy with frustration.

This gnawing sense of stagnation weighs heavily on Adedayo, who confides that each rejection feels like a personal failure to his family. “My parents invested so much in me, school fees, books, everything. Now, I’m just sitting at home, endlessly applying for jobs. It makes me feel like I’ve failed them,” he admits, his eyes downcast during our conversation in his modest family home.

He admitted, “I know my grade isn’t helping,” his voice heavy with self-doubt. “But I keep telling them my industrial training gave me real skills, logging data, working with geologists in the field. Why can’t that count?”

But Adedayo is far from alone. In Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Warri, similar tales echo among young graduates of geology, petroleum engineering, and related fields clutching certificates but lacking the elusive “experience.” Many spend months, sometimes years, attending fruitless interviews, living off their parents, or scrambling for internships.

For every job advertised in the oil and gas industry, dozens of qualified young Nigerians are turned away for not having the experience they are desperately trying to gain or a criterion too thin for a camel to pass through.

This dilemma is unfolding at a time when the country’s oil and gas workforce is ageing rapidly. It’s a vicious cycle that’s already starving the nation’s oil and gas sector of fresh blood, even as veterans retire in droves. The veterans who built their careers during the oil boom of the 1990s and early 2000s are preparing to bow out, yet there is no ready pipeline of skilled successors. Training opportunities are shrinking, internships are scarce, and graduate employment programmes have thinned out. The result is a widening chasm between a hungry, unemployed youth population and a sector that urgently needs fresh hands to power its future.

Hence, Nigeria’s oil and gas industry may be hurtling toward a major crisis, not from dwindling crude production, investment shortage or divestments, but from an alarming shortage of skilled professionals to drive the next phase of growth.

As international oil giants steadily retreat from Nigeria’s oilfields and indigenous firms assume greater responsibility, the backbone of the industry, the technical workforce, is ageing rapidly. Many of these veteran engineers and geoscientists, who once kept the rigs humming and pipelines flowing, are now within touching distance of retirement. Yet, there is no clear pipeline of younger, well-trained professionals ready to take their place.

Over the next three to five years, experts warn, Nigeria’s energy sector may confront a dangerous vacuum. Critical skills in areas such as geology, engineering, digital competence, data analytics, renewable energy integration, and sustainability leadership are already in short supply. Without immediate intervention, this shortage could widen into a gulf, threatening both oil production targets and the broader energy transition.

Industry leaders, regulators, and policy analysts are increasingly sounding the alarm. They caution that unless Nigeria urgently invests in structured mentorship schemes, graduate training programmes, and technical capacity building, its ambitious plan to raise crude output to three million barrels per day by 2030 risks collapsing, not for lack of oil in the ground, but for lack of human capital to extract and manage it.

This emerging skills drought, they argue, is as much a national concern as it is an economic one.

The oil and gas industry is often described as the lifeblood of Nigeria’s economy. For decades, the sector has funded over half of government revenue and more than 90 per cent of foreign exchange earnings. Yet, a chilling truth is being whispered with growing urgency: the sector may soon run out of the one resource it cannot afford to lose: A vibrant workforce. The looming crisis is a shortage of skilled manpower to replace ageing executives and technical staff, a problem that experts warn could cripple Nigeria’s oil ambitions within a decade.

Unlike the often-quoted fears of meeting crude oil production demands, this danger is not buried under the earth’s crust. It is visible, pressing, and human and industry stakeholders must scramble to avert a looming catastrophe, one that has already crippled Nigeria’s health and education sectors, where years of brain drain, poor succession planning, and underinvestment have left gaping holes that the system still struggles to fill.

These warning bells have grown louder in the aftermath of a historic wave of divestments by international oil companies. Shell, ExxonMobil, ENI, and TotalEnergies have all sold their onshore and shallow-water assets, retreating to focus on deepwater operations.

Post-Divestment era

The success of Nigeria’s oil and gas sector in the post-divestment era has not happened by chance. Industry observers point to three major factors that have enabled indigenous operators to take charge of assets once dominated by international oil companies.

First, there was a migration of talent. Many Nigerian technical experts who had spent years working with IOCs made the switch to indigenous firms. They carried with them decades of experience, industry knowledge, and technical know-how that became invaluable in sustaining operations after the handover.

Second, the retention of Shell expertise proved critical. More than 80 per cent of the onshore and shallow-water assets sold were originally managed by Shell. When local operators took them over, they absorbed much of Shell’s seasoned technical workforce. This move ensured continuity and prevented operations from stalling during the transition.

Finally, IOC-experienced leadership gave indigenous companies an edge. Many local investors deliberately recruited management teams with international oil company backgrounds to oversee their new assets.

In their wake, indigenous players have stepped in, now contributing more than half of Nigeria’s crude oil production, a sharp jump from the 40 per cent they controlled before divestments.

“On the surface, this is a victory,” noted an analyst report by Reuters, quoting data from the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission. “Local firms are now at the centre of Nigeria’s oil future. But beneath the numbers lies a deeper question: do we have the talent pipeline to sustain this shift?” The answer, many fear, is no.

Currently, most indigenous E&P companies depend heavily on former IOCs staff, with minimal evidence of structured training for young engineers, a trend that is unsustainable and threatens long-term industry growth.

The Managing Director of Ingentia, a Leading Oil Exploration and Production Company, Olajumoke Ajayi, did not mince words at the Nigeria Oil and Gas Energy Week forum held in the nation’s capital three months ago.

Sharing her recent recruitment experience, Ajayi painted a troubling picture of the widening skills gap in the oil and gas industry.

According to her, many young graduates leave the four walls of a university only to find themselves stranded in the labour market, unable to secure jobs because employers insist on hiring people with years of experience.

“If we should go by the untapped 37 billion barrels of oil we have, or the 210 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves, it will take us decades to produce,” she said. “But the question is, how many of us in this room will still be working in 30 years? We need capacity building. We need succession planning. Without it, all these reserves will remain trapped underground.”

“So why am I saying this? We need capacity building. Recent recruitment efforts have highlighted a significant gap in the industry’s skill set. So we need to be deliberate

[TITLE]Why NUPRC Must Release the Frontier Exploration Fund Now:
[TEXT]
The Petroleum Industry Act was enacted to fix long-standing structural gaps in Nigeria’s oil and gas sector. Among its strongest innovations is the creation of the Frontier Exploration Fund — a statutory pool meant to finance exploration in under-explored basins across the country. Today, billions of Naira have accrued to the Fund, yet the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission seems not in a hurry to deploy these resources as mandated by law. The consequences may be too costly to ignore.

The PIA sets out a straightforward framework for funding and exploring Nigeria’s frontier basins:

Section 9(4) establishes the Frontier Exploration Fund and mandates that 30 per cent of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited’s profit oil and profit gas under PSCs and similar arrangements be channelled into the Fund.

Section 9(5) requires that these remittances be transferred into a dedicated escrow account and used strictly for frontier exploration and development, subject to appropriation by the National Assembly.

Section 9(1) gives NUPRC the duty to promote frontier-basin exploration, undertake basin studies, and evaluate frontier acreages.

Section 64(c) further ensures that PSC profit oil and gas cannot reach the Federation without first deducting the statutory 30 per cent for the FEF and management fees.

These provisions make the flow and use of FEF money non-discretionary. In simple terms, the money must enter the escrow account, and it must be used for exploration.

Recent figures show that NNPCL has consistently complied with its own statutory duties:

In the first nine months of 2025 alone, NNPCL generated N801.3bn for Management Fees and the FEF — representing 56.5 per cent of the annual projection.

Both FEF and Management Fees received N400.667bn each during the period.

Industry checks indicate that

[TITLE]Surge in Natural Gas Prices Sets The Stage for Coal Comeback:
[TEXT]
As U.S. natural gas prices jumped to a three-year high, coal has become a cheaper power-generating fuel for utilities, which are set to run coal-fired generators harder this winter.

U.S. benchmark natural gas prices at Henry Hub have jumped from $4.23 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at the start of November to above $5 per MMBtu by early December. Early on Friday, the front-month futures price was $5.084 per MMBtu.

That’s the highest price in three years, as a polar vortex with freezing temperatures and snowstorms gripped most of the U.S. and as U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports continue to set record highs as new plants ramp up liquefaction and shipments.

Near-month futures prices are at their highest since December 2022, while the price of the 12-month futures contract strip January 2026 through December 2026 climbed in one week by 26 cents to $4.302 per MMBtu, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its latest Natural Gas Weekly report.

The report also showed that working natural gas stocks totaled 3,923 Bcf for the week ending December 3, which is 5% more than the five-year average and less than 1% lower than last year at this time.

Although natural gas stocks are at levels higher than the five-year average, prices are rallying as heating and power demand jumps with the colder weather and LNG exports out of America are setting new highs.

The U.S. is set to export 14.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG this year, up by 25% from 2024, the EIA said in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) for November. Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana has ramped up exports more quickly than the EIA expected, leading the administration to raise its forecast of LNG exports in the current quarter by 3% compared with last month’s outlook. The EIA expects U.S. LNG exports to increase by an additional 10% in 2026.

As a result, soaring U.S. natural gas prices make gas-fired power generation more expensive for electric utilities and some of these are set to boost generation from cheaper coal.

The EIA expects in its latest STEO that the 2025 annual average price of natural gas paid by electric power plants will jump by 37% and the price paid by industrial sector customers will increase by 21% compared with the 2024 averages.

The Henry Hub natural gas spot price is set to average $4.00 per MMBtu in 2026, the EIA forecasts. The expected average price would be 16% higher than in 2025, primarily due to surging LNG exports amid flat gas production.

Coal, for its part, saw increased production this year, supported by the Trump Administration and the rising price of natural gas.

The coal production increase in 2025 is the result of rising demand, the EIA notes. Demand has increased due to higher natural gas prices, delayed coal plant retirements, and strong demand for heating in the earlier winter months this year. In response to higher demand, the EIA expects electric power coal inventories to end the year at 107 million short tons (MMst), which would be 17% lower than at the end of 2024.

Higher natural gas prices are setting the stage for increased coal use, at least in the coming months. But soaring power demand from AI could also support a quiet comeback for coal in the coming years.

Most coal-fired power plants could delay retirement because of the AI-driven power demand surge, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Reuters in September.

“Energy sobriety has returned to Washington, D.C. Our focus is on Americans and the price of utility and avoiding blackouts,” Wright said.

“We've got to stop existing firm capacity from retirement,” the Energy Secretary added.

The surge in U.S. electricity demand “is reviving hopes of at least a slightly brighter future for coal,” Ed Crooks, Vice Chair Americas at Wood Mackenzie, said in October.

“There is no doubt that the boom in data centre investment is helping to slow the decline of coal in the US, by prolonging the operational lives of some coal-fired power plants,” WoodMac reckons.

Two years ago, Wood Mackenzie’s base-case expectation was that U.S. coal-fired power generation would plunge by about 60% between 2025 and 2032. Now WoodMac expects the drop to be about 39%.

[TITLE]Europe strikes a deal to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027:
[TEXT]
Brussels Reuters —

The European Union agreed Wednesday to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decade-long dependency on Russian energy.

Representatives for EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement in the early hours of Wednesday on proposals set out by the European Commission in June to end shipments from the EU’s former top gas supplier following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move toward a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.

“Today, we are stopping these imports permanently,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement. “By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

For short-term contracts concluded before June 17 this year, the prohibition will apply from April 25, 2026, for LNG and from June 17, 2026, for pipeline gas.

For long-term contracts concluded before June 17, the cut-off dates will be the start of 2027 and the start of October 2026, with a possible one-month extension for EU members facing difficulties reaching required storage levels.

As of October, Russia accounted for 12% of EU gas imports, down from 45% before its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Hungary, France and Belgium among the countries still receiving supplies.

The European Commission is also committed to phasing out remaining oil imports from Russia by the end of 2027, with a legislative proposal to be presented early next year.

Under Wednesday’s agreement, EU members will submit “national diversification plans” regarding oil and gas supplies to the commission by March 1, and will be required to notify the EU executive whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national bans in place.

The commission will issue recommendations based on this feedback.

[TITLE]How Mexico Revived Its Renewable Energy Sector:
[TEXT]
After several years of stagnation in Mexico’s renewable energy sector, the introduction of more favourable reforms alongside several new solar energy agreements suggests that the Latin American country is pursuing a more diversified energy mix. After several years of energy policy that focused on greater nationalisation, the door is once again open for private participation, which is expected to include the development of several green energy projects and attract investment from various firms worldwide.

Under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), who led the Morena party from 2018 to 2024, Mexico’s energy sector underwent a significant nationalisation, during which time it became harder for private companies to participate in the industry. AMLO decided to nationalise Mexico’s energy sector, citing over-greedy international energy companies, sectoral corruption, and the need for enhanced national energy security.

During his presidency, AMLO supported fossil fuel expansion, bailing out the state-owned oil and gas company PEMEX several times, as well as investing heavily in the construction of major new refineries. Meanwhile, investments in green energy stagnated as AMLO did not prioritise renewable energy development at the national level or allow for investment from private companies.

Since President Claudia Sheinbaum came into office in 2024, Mexico’s energy sector has begun to undergo a transformation, following the introduction of a new energy reform in March 2025. Sheinbaum followed in AMLO’s footsteps by maintaining the national majority ownership of the electricity sector, meaning the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) must provide at least 54 percent of the country’s electricity. The reform also disbanded the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), replacing them with a centralised National Energy Commission (CNE).

While Mexico’s energy sector will continue to be dominated by state-owned companies, Sheinbaum has reopened opportunities for foreign investment in the sector. In her national economic development strategy, Plan México, Sheinbaum introduced the aim of adding almost 23 GW of new power generation capacity by 2030, as well as establishing 100 transmission and distribution projects.

During her electoral campaign, Sheinbaum stated her commitment to renewable energy, emphasising the potential to develop Mexico’s abundant solar and wind resources. “We are going to propel renewable energy in Mexico,” Sheinbaum said during her inauguration. “The objective is that by 2030, 45 percent of the country’s energy will be powered by renewable sources.”

The government plans to invest over $22 billion by 2030 to expand CFE’s electricity generation and distribution. Meanwhile, Mexico aims to attract between $6 and $9 billion in private investment to establish between 6.4 GW and 9.5 GW of new clean-energy capacity by 2030. The new energy reform allows both CFE and Pemex to enter mixed contracts with private companies, so long as they hold a majority share of the project.

In October, Mexico’s Energy Ministry invited private companies to participate in the construction of 34 new power plants to accelerate the expansion of the country’s electricity capacity. The projects include 23 solar photovoltaic and 11 wind power plants across 20 states. Operations are scheduled to commence between 2027 and 2030. Once completed, the facilities are expected to add 5.97 GW of installed capacity.

“The call is part of specific mechanisms to develop strategic and priority projects aligned with binding planning, ensuring an orderly and coherent approach to meeting the National Electric System’s capacity needs,” the Ministry’s announcement stated.

In late October, the Spanish clean energy firm The Cox Group announced an investment of $4.2 billion for new solar and wind farms in Mexico’s border state of Nuevo León. The projects will be developed in the state capital of Monterrey, as well as other municipalities, and are expected to support the creation of 4,000 temporary jobs and 250 permanent positions. The Cox Group and the state government are developing a comprehensive strategy that includes water treatment and reuse, gas cogeneration, and energy efficiency.

In November, the German utility RWE announced plans to launch solar projects in Mexico. RWE’s subsidiary Oyamel Recursos Ambientales is developing a 120 MW PV plant in Veracruz, while its Biznaga subsidiary aims to build the 90 MW Cerro Pelón PV plant in Jalisco. Meanwhile, Canadian Solar’s Recurrent Energy hopes to get approval for a $63 million solar plant in Zacatecas. Spain’s Global Dominion Access and Canadian Solar also submitted environmental permit requests to develop solar operations, while Iberdrola announced plans to develop two solar projects totalling 535 MW in Mexico.

A recent report by the energy think tank Ember forecast that private investment and energy storage in Mexico could grow to as much as 36 GW of solar power and 30 GWh of battery storage in the coming years, owing to a greater openness to private participation in Mexico’s energy sector. As much as 46 percent of the country’s electricity generation could come from private projects, suggesting the beginning of a shift away from nationalisation.

[TITLE]COP30 in Belém: Joint Effort, Tensions and a Path to the End of Fossil Fuels:
[TEXT]
The holding of the 30th UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém made history for two complementary reasons: it was the first climate conference hosted in the Amazon, and it put forests, Indigenous peoples and civil society back at the center of climate negotiations. Bringing together 195 countries and culminating in the unanimous adoption of 29 decisions, the conference showed that, despite geopolitical contradictions and obstacles, there is still room for collective progress.

The key points of Belém were the “joint decision,” the shifting positions of the European Union, the objections of large oil-producing countries and the enormous efforts of Brazilian diplomatic coordination to deliver on implementation of the Paris Agreement. In parallel with the diplomatic conference, Belém welcomed a vigorous presence of civil society, a powerful expression of its commitment to social justice in the fight against climate change.

The decision to join forces: strategy, scope and limits

In the context of the climate negotiations, the Brazilian presidency of the COP created the Mutirão — a “joint decision” strategy to untangle sensitive issues and stitch together a single package of decisions that included finance, adaptation, just transition, trade, gender and technology. At the end of the conference, this package resulted in the approval of 29 documents that sought to advance on multiple fronts without leaving behind urgent demands from the Global South.

Among the financial measures approved, concrete allocations of $135 million to the Adaptation Fund and $300 million to adapt the health sector to climate impacts stand out. The presidency also proposed reformulating climate finance reporting, linking it to the New Collective Quantified Goal for Climate Finance (NCQG), seeking greater transparency between “provided” and “mobilized” resources.

On the other hand, financial ambition fell short of what was necessary: the task-force proposal foresees tripling adaptation financing by 2035 compared with 2025, but without a clearly defined base value. This gap reflects the historical difficulty of the multilateral system in translating political commitment into measurable financial flows — a challenge that, according to climate finance experts, is reflected in the current adaptation finance gap, estimated at around $340 billion. This amount is forecast to reach $1.35 trillion by 2035.

No binding target was delivered to finance adaptation, and the multilateral ambition to mobilize trillions for clean infrastructure remains without clear accountability mechanisms. The recognition that historical goals have not been met gained space in the final text, but without new and effective structures that guarantee the flow of resources where they are most urgent.

Among other points in the task-force decision, advances were made on information integrity and the fight against climate disinformation — essential to confronting denialism, including disinformation promoted by parts of the fossil-fuel industry. There were also developments on carbon markets and discussions on high-integrity rules — a necessary subject for robust accounting of carbon credits, which remains controversial given cases of fraud and technical errors worldwide.

The EU’s position: defensive pragmatism

The European Union played a decisive role in the final design of the “joint decision”. European officials adopted a pragmatic stance: supporting the negotiated package as long as it did not include provisions they considered unfeasible or unsupported, especially those related to the energy transition. In negotiations, European representatives conditioned their greater willingness to finance adaptation on the inclusion — from their point of view — of balanced measures in the energy transition.

This stance produced two key effects: (1) the EU helped ensure approval of the package, avoiding a total impasse; (2) at the same time, its bargaining limited the financial ambition of the final text, contributing to less binding wording on goals and responsibilities. Observers interpreted this strategy as a balance between pro-climate rhetoric and cautious practice — especially relevant after the United States’s direct absence, which altered traditional leadership dynamics.

Objections from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, India and Russia: blocking the fossil roadmap

One of the most sensitive points in the Belém negotiations was the so‑called “roadmap” for moving away from an economy dependent on fossil fuels — an explicit priority of the Brazilian presidency. Although the initiative gained important political support, especially from the Global South and activist leaders, it did not make it into the final texts due to a lack of consensus. Fossil-fuel-producing countries (notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), as well as major emitters such as China and India, and to a lesser extent, Russia, and even Japan, raised firm objections.

These objections ranged from practical issues (timing, socioeconomic impacts and energy security) to geopolitical positions defending industrial and revenue interests. For many of these countries, formal commitments to abandon fossil fuels would entail high political and economic costs, requiring guarantees of finance, technology transfer and just treatment for workers and communities. This bloc managed to bar inclusion of the roadmap in the joint decision, relegating it to a parallel initiative — albeit one that faces growing political pressure.

Brazilian diplomatic leadership: sewing consensus and maintaining the agenda

Brazil, as COP30 president, worked intensively to transform the mutirão effort into a political reality. The presidency’s strategy combined multilateral diplomacy (bilateral and multilateral negotiations), global visibility — placing the Amazon at the center of discussions — and bridge-building among groups of countries. The presidency proposed the creation of an international just-transition mechanism, with a draft to be presented by June 2026 and contributions open until March 15, 2026, aiming to establish an instrument to organize finance, technical cooperation and capacity building.

This action produced results: 122 countries presented new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) during COP30, and a package of decisions elevated just transition as an institutional priority. However, the Brazilian effort coexists with internal contradictions — part of the government promoted a roadmap for renewables even as the state authorized oil exploration auctions at the mouth of the Amazon, renewed contracts for gas and coal thermal plants through 2040, and faced a Congress

[TITLE]Surge in Natural Gas Prices Sets The Stage for Coal Comeback:
[TEXT]
As U.S. natural gas prices jumped to a three-year high, coal has become a cheaper power-generating fuel for utilities, which are set to run coal-fired generators harder this winter.

U.S. benchmark natural gas prices at Henry Hub have jumped from $4.23 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at the start of November to above $5 per MMBtu by early December. Early on Friday, the front-month futures price was $5.084 per MMBtu.

That’s the highest price in three years, as a polar vortex with freezing temperatures and snowstorms gripped most of the U.S. and as U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports continue to set record highs as new plants ramp up liquefaction and shipments.

Near-month futures prices are at their highest since December 2022, while the price of the 12-month futures contract strip January 2026 through December 2026 climbed in one week by 26 cents to $4.302 per MMBtu, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its latest Natural Gas Weekly report.

The report also showed that working natural gas stocks totaled 3,923 Bcf for the week ending December 3, which is 5% more than the five-year average and less than 1% lower than last year at this time.

Although natural gas stocks are at levels higher than the five-year average, prices are rallying as heating and power demand jumps with the colder weather and LNG exports out of America are setting new highs.

The U.S. is set to export 14.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG this year, up by 25% from 2024, the EIA said in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) for November. Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana has ramped up exports more quickly than the EIA expected, leading the administration to raise its forecast of LNG exports in the current quarter by 3% compared with last month’s outlook. The EIA expects U.S. LNG exports to increase by an additional 10% in 2026.

As a result, soaring U.S. natural gas prices make gas-fired power generation more expensive for electric utilities and some of these are set to boost generation from cheaper coal.

The EIA expects in its latest STEO that the 2025 annual average price of natural gas paid by electric power plants will jump by 37% and the price paid by industrial sector customers will increase by 21% compared with the 2024 averages.

The Henry Hub natural gas spot price is set to average $4.00 per MMBtu in 2026, the EIA forecasts. The expected average price would be 16% higher than in 2025, primarily due to surging LNG exports amid flat gas production.

Coal, for its part, saw increased production this year, supported by the Trump Administration and the rising price of natural gas.

The coal production increase in 2025 is the result of rising demand, the EIA notes. Demand has increased due to higher natural gas prices, delayed coal plant retirements, and strong demand for heating in the earlier winter months this year. In response to higher demand, the EIA expects electric power coal inventories to end the year at 107 million short tons (MMst), which would be 17% lower than at the end of 2024.

Higher natural gas prices are setting the stage for increased coal use, at least in the coming months. But soaring power demand from AI could also support a quiet comeback for coal in the coming years.

Most coal-fired power plants could delay retirement because of the AI-driven power demand surge, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Reuters in September.

“Energy sobriety has returned to Washington, D.C. Our focus is on Americans and the price of utility and avoiding blackouts,” Wright said.

“We've got to stop existing firm capacity from retirement,” the Energy Secretary added.

The surge in U.S. electricity demand “is reviving hopes of at least a slightly brighter future for coal,” Ed Crooks, Vice Chair Americas at Wood Mackenzie, said in October.

“There is no doubt that the boom in data centre investment is helping to slow the decline of coal in the US, by prolonging the operational lives of some coal-fired power plants,” WoodMac reckons.

Two years ago, Wood Mackenzie’s base-case expectation was that U.S. coal-fired power generation would plunge by about 60% between 2025 and 2032. Now WoodMac expects the drop to be about 39%.

The Federal Government has warned that Nigeria’s power sector reforms risk stalling unless urgent steps are taken to close the widening skills gap across the electricity value chain, even as the European Union announced fresh support for renewable energy deployment and workforce development in the country.

The union also stated that it has invested more than €200m in grants since 2008 to support Nigeria’s power sector, including policy reforms, capacity building, and market development.

It added that under its current 2021–2027 programme, the target is to support Nigeria in adding 4,00 megawatts of renewable energy capacity, a move expected to supply cleaner electricity to

[TITLE]A Ray of Hope Amid the Climate Information War:
[TEXT]
Lee Zeldin, the Trump loyalist appointed to head the Environmental Protection Agency, seems to be following Musk’s lead. On Tuesday, he announced the termination of $20 billion in grants that have already been promised to institutions via the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program, which Congress established in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. He cited “substantial concerns regarding program integrity, objections to the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the agency’s priorities,” but provided no evidence to support such widespread fraud claims. The best he came up with was that “a group linked to Stacey Abrams received two billion dollars after reporting a mere 100 dollars in total revenue the year before” (a debunking of which you can read here) and that “the founding director of the EPA’s program dished out $5 billion to his former employer.”

Pending clarity on the details, one could argue this last allegation is a conflict of interest—a weak one, given that the individual in question, Jahi Wise, doesn’t seem to have been rehired by that former employer—but not fraud, and not a conflict that can hold a candle to Musk, whose business has been built on an estimated $38 billion in government spending, being given the keys to the federal coffers and cutting subsidies to his flailing car company’s ascendant competitors.
