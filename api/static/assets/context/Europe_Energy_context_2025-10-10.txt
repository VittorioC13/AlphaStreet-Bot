[TITLE]Greenland’s leader urges EU to invest in its mineral resources and renewable energy:
[TEXT]
BRUSSELS (AP) — Greenland’s leader on Wednesday thanked the European Union for being “a trusted friend” and urged the 27-nation bloc to invest in his country’s mineral resources, renewable energy, airports and internet services.

In a speech to the European Parliament, Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said that “2025 has been an eventful if not dramatic year for Greenland.” He noted the challenge posed by climate change but did not mention President Donald Trump’s talk of seizing the Arctic island.

“We need cooperation and partnerships with like-minded countries and institutions who share our values. The EU has been a stable, reliable and important partner for Greenland for more than 40 years,” the 34-year-old premier said in Strasbourg, France.

He extended “a heartfelt thank you” to the EU “for your strong support for Greenland during challenging times we are going through right now. You have stood by us as a friend and partner. We will never forget this.”

Greenland was a colony under Denmark’s crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later, Greenland became a self-governing entity. It remains part of the Danish realm.

Denmark, which also currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency, and Greenland have rejected Trump’s offers to buy the island. He hasn’t ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich territory.

When asked by a reporter before his speech about relations with the Trump administration, Nielsen said that U.S.-Greenland ties should be managed “in mutual respect, with respect for international law.”

“We seek to have more and better cooperation also with the U.S.A., when we can fulfill the respectful tone,” he said.

During the speech, Nielsen said that Greenland has most of the critical raw minerals that the EU is seeking, but that mining these resources is “capital intensive.” He also urged the bloc to invest in the untapped hydroelectricity potential provided by the island’s rivers and glaciers.

Nielsen also called for financial support to develop telecommunications networks, particularly in the poorly connected north, and to build two regional airports.

“It is essential for us that those who operate telecommunications in Greenland are trusted and reliable actors. This is vital to ensure the stability of the infrastructure, and to prevent unauthorized parties from disrupting and compromising connections,” he said.

Lawmakers gave Nielsen a standing ovation as he said “thank you for being a trusted friend of Greenland.”

A global benchmark of clean energy stocks is outperforming major equity indexes and even gold, as investors respond to soaring demand for renewables needed to power the boom in artificial intelligence The S&P Global Clean Energy Transition Index has surged close to 50% since US President Donald Trump's April tariff announcements caused havoc across markets. That compares with the roughly 35% gain delivered by both the S&P 500 Index and gold over the same period.Investors have turned more positive on green stocks as it becomes increasingly clear that the energy needed to power AI can't be delivered without renewables. That's despite efforts by the Trump administration to green policies, as China, India, Europe and some US states stay committed to low-carbon sectors.Lower US interest rates are also buoying green sectors that have traditionally been capital intensive and debt-reliant.The rebound has helped money managers lure capital for green funds. On Tuesday, Brookfield Asset Management said it had raised $20 billion for the world's biggest private fund dedicated to the clean-energy transition. That coincided with an announcement from Resolution Investors LLP that it had launched a global equity climate fund targeting $1 billion within a few years.The S&P index for clean energy stocks has also outperformed the S&P Global Oil Index since early April and is doing better than all major country equity gauges in the world in local currency terms, save for South Korea.Clean energy indexes "tend to have little correlation with the broad market and can hence serve as tactical allocations when catalysts emerge," Shaheen Contractor, senior ESG analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note on Friday. "AI-driven energy demand, which may more than double by 2028, favours fast-to-deploy solar, storage and gas capabilities," she said.US-based Bloom Energy Corp., which manufactures fuel cells for power generation, and Goldwind Science & Technology Co. in China, the world’s largest wind turbine maker, are among the biggest gainers on the clean energy index, boasting triple-digit percentage increases in their share prices this year.The S&P clean energy index’s rebound still only leaves it at half its level compared with 2021, when green investing was at its peak. That coincided with interest rates at crisis lows as the pandemic dragged down the global economy.Aniket Shah, managing director and global head of sustainability and transition strategy at Jefferies Financial Group Inc., describes the latest move into green investments as the arrival of the “glory days.”“We are in this wonderful moment where both the capital markets and the real economy are actually accelerating their efforts around sustainability and the energy transition,” Shah said.

[TITLE]Minister says climate costs warning is ‘back of envelope stuff’:
[TEXT]
Financial and climate advisers have warned Ireland risks fines and other 'compliance costs' of up to €26 billion. Photograph: Getty

The calculation by finance and climate advisers of penalties Ireland faces for failing to meet emission targets has been labelled “back of the envelope stuff” by the Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment.

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) and Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC) warned Ireland risks fines and other “compliance costs” of €8 billion-€26 billion for failing to sufficiently cut emissions by 2030 in line with European Union obligations.

Darragh O’Brien dismissed their estimates, saying there is no agreed way of calculating penalties and he does not believe the EU would impose them.

“There’s no formula; there’s no calculation that’s agreed at all,” he said. “This is back of the envelope stuff.”

In response, the IFAC and CCAC issued a joint statement standing over their work.

“The analysis carried out by the Climate Change Advisory Council and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was thorough, robust and independently peer-reviewed,” they said.

The threat of having to pay for missed climate targets has hung over Ireland for many years, but in a joint exercise earlier this year, the IFAC and CCAC calculated how much they could be.

Ireland is behind on its national emissions cuts targets and those set by the EU.

The Environmental Protection Agency forecast last May that the State would achieve at best a 23 per cent cut by 2030 instead of the 51 per cent set in national law.

It has been expected that Ireland would have to make up for its underperformance by buying substantial amounts of carbon credits from countries that have performed ahead of target, or from other carbon trading markets.

Given the likely high demand for credits among countries struggling to make their targets, the price could increase enormously.

Speaking at a post-budget press conference, Mr O’Brien said he does not expect the EU to make any such demands of Ireland.

“I don’t see that happening. I’m not going to deal with hypotheticals,” he said.

“Our focus is on meeting our targets and looking at our 2040 targets.”

However, IFAC and the CCAC stressed afterwards that Ireland has already been required to pay compliance costs for failures in relation to obligations under the Kyoto protocol, the EU’s previous Effort Sharing Decision and the Renewable Energy Directive.

These were in the form of “statistical transfers” or payments to high performing EU member states with credits to spare.

In their statement the bodies acknowledged their estimates are broad but said the report covered all possibilities.

“It examined a range of potential outcomes in the event that Ireland does not comply with its legal obligations.”

This is not the first time the expert bodies’ exercise has been called into question. Shortly after it was published last March, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, said it was “highly speculative”.

Mr O’Brien said he spoke directly to the European Commission

[TITLE]Renewable energy exceeds global coal power generation for the first time ever, analysis finds:
[TEXT]
Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released Tuesday. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than the increase in overall global demand in the same period, it found.

"A turning point" for global fossil fuel power generation

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

"That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide," said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

"The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant," said Wiatros-Motyka. "This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing."

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

China and India leading the green energy transition

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S., which, combined, account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India's fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

"It's often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn't really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use," said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. "This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction."

U.S. and Europe see fossil fuel power generation increase

In the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Trump's administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Just last week the Trump administration announced that it would be canceling $8 billion in climate-related projects in 16 Democratically governed states, in funding cuts announced amid a federal government shutdown.

Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, announced the cancellations on social media and said additional details would be provided by the Department of Energy. All of the states affected by the cuts voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and all are represented by Democrats in the Senate.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Mr. Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Mr. Trump's efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

"The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they're also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That's going to lead to a gap in supply and demand," Gerrard said.

Renewables "still have an opportunity to make inroads into displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth," said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn't involved in the report.

Smith said that while she remained "very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale."

[TITLE]Renewables have now passed coal globally – and growth is fastest in countries like Bhutan and Nepal:
[TEXT]
For the first time, renewables have toppled coal as the world’s leading source of electricity, in keeping with International Energy Agency projections for this historic shift.

But progress is uneven. The shift away from fossil fuels has slowed in the United States and the European Union – but accelerated sharply in developing nations.

China attracts headlines for the sheer scale of its shift. But many smaller nations are now taking up clean energy, electric vehicles and battery storage at remarkable speed, driven by governments, businesses and individuals.

Importantly, these moves often aren’t

1. Introduction

1.1. This document provides guidance to accountable bodies for Scottish Investment Zones wishing to award grant subsidies under the Scottish Investment Zones Subsidy Scheme (“the Scheme”).

1.2. The Scheme enables accountable bodies to subsidise activity under 4 investment categories: local infrastructure, research and innovation, skills, and business support.

1.3. This guidance explains the terms and eligibility conditions for the awarding of grant subsidies under each investment category.

1.4 Public authorities considering awarding a subsidy under the Scheme should familiarise themselves with the UK subsidy control regime: statutory guidance.

1.5. Accountable bodies for Scottish Investment Zones that satisfy themselves that a grant subsidy award complies with the Scheme and this guidance are not required to conduct their own assessment of the award against the subsidy control principles.

1.6. Grant subsidies given under the Scheme must comply with:

1.6.1. the general conditions in paragraph 3, and

1.6.2 the conditions specified under each investment category.

1.7. The Scottish Investment Zone subsidy scheme and this guidance may be modified from time to time.

2. General definitions

2.1. In this guidance:

2.1.1. “The Act” means the Subsidy Control Act 2022.

2.1.2. “Eligible Activity” means the activities eligible for grant subsidy that deliver the objectives and outcomes of the Investment Zone programme, further detailed under each investment category.

2.1.3. “Beneficiary” means the enterprise receiving a grant subsidy under the Scheme.

2.1.4. “Eligible costs” means the eligible costs listed under each investment category.

2.1.5. “Enterprise” means the definition taken from section 7 of the Subsidy Control Act 2022.

2.1.6. “Intervention” means levers available under the different categories of grant funding, which will achieve specified outputs and outcomes.

2.1.7. “Local Infrastructure” means the infrastructure built, developed or restored at a local level to improve places.

2.1.8. “Pre-development costs” means activities in progress or completed in advance of physical works commencing and include activities such as site investigations, preparing cost estimates, progressing design work, obtaining planning permission, or negotiating land and/or building acquisitions.

2.1.9. “Public authority” means Regional Economic Partnership (or accountable body) and other public bodies awarding grant subsidies under the Scheme.

2.1.12. “Skills” means sector-focused skills activity where the local labour market need, as identified by the Investment Zone, is not being met by existing programmes.

2.1.13. “the Scheme’’ means the Scottish Investment Zones Subsidy Scheme.

3. General conditions

3.1. Accountable bodies and relevant public authorities may award grant subsidies to any enterprise in order to deliver the objectives of their Investment Zone. Enterprises that are businesses will range from large companies to small companies.

3.2. Grant subsidies must only be for activity in Investment Zone areas under the 4 investment categories: skills, local infrastructure, research and innovation, and business support.

3.3. A public authority may not give a grant subsidy for activity that has started, except where:

3.3.1. the beneficiary has begun incurring or has incurred pre-development costs, but physical works and other eligible activity haven’t been legally committed to or commenced.

3.3.2. the public authority is of the view that activity would not be viable unless it starts before the subsidy is awarded and the public authority has provided written authorisation to the beneficiary for the activity to start before the subsidy is given.

3.4. Before giving a grant subsidy under the Scheme, a public authority must, as a minimum, obtain from a beneficiary the following information:

3.4.1. name and size of the enterprise, company registration number, registered company address.

3.4.2. description of the proposed activity, including its location (including which Investment Zone site and/or tax site), start and end dates, and a summary of the costs.

3.5. Open and fair competition should be the default means of awarding subsidies except in justified circumstances. Public authorities must use objective and transparent selection criteria that are available to potential recipients in advance of giving a grant subsidy and be subject to the public authority’s existing accountability frameworks. This includes consideration of potential distortive impacts on the market and mitigation measures.

3.6 A business case for the giving of the grant subsidy must have been approved by the public authority. This includes consideration of the need to ensure that the grant provides additionality and that the minimum amount of grant is used to achieve the desired outcomes.

4. Subsidy type and valuation

4.1. The maximum grant subsidy awardable to a single beneficiary over 3 years under each of the 4 subsidy categories is as follows:

skills: £20 million

local Infrastructure: £45 million

research and innovation: £35 million

business support: £25 million

5. Transparency

5.1. Public authorities must comply with the transparency requirements set out in Chapter 3 of Part 2 of the Act. Any subsidy awarded under the Scheme that exceeds the value of £100,000 must be uploaded to the subsidy database within 3 months of the legal commitment to award a grant subsidy. The relevant accountable body for the Investment Zone is responsible for ensuring that transparency requirements are met. The Scheme maintains its ongoing commitment to comply with Article 369 so checks will be undertaken to ensure subsidy awards are uploaded to the transparency database.

6. Cumulation

6.1. The maximum grant subsidy cumulating to a single beneficiary under each investment category is set out in paragraph 4.1. Subsidies awarded to a single beneficiary under multiple categories, or in multiple Investment Zones, do not cumulate.

6.2. Where a subsidy will or may exceed the maximum grant awardable to a single beneficiary over 3 years set out in paragraph 4.1 for the 4 investment categories, that subsidy will fall out of scope of this Scheme.

7. General prohibitions

7.1. Public authorities must comply with the general prohibitions set out in Article 367 of Part 2 of the UK-EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement and Chapter 5 of the subsidy control regime statutory guidance, including the relocation of activities prohibition in paragraph 5.22 of the Guidance and where relevant the exemption criteria set out at paragraph 5.31 of the Statutory Guidance.

7.2 The Scheme cannot be used to award grant subsidies where the specific policy objective of the subsidy (or one of its objectives) relates to energy or the environment, as set out in paragraphs 4.3-4.8 of the Statutory Guidance.

8. Misuse of subsidy

8.1. A public authority should ensure that any subsidy given under this Scheme is given subject to a condition allowing the public authority to recover the whole or part of the subsidy amount to the extent that the subsidy is used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was given, and not for double funding, and to the extent that a beneficiary does not follow the rules of the Scheme thereby misusing the subsidy.

3. General conditions

3.1. Accountable bodies and relevant public authorities may award grant subsidies to any enterprise in order to deliver the objectives of their Investment Zone. Enterprises that are businesses will range from large companies to small companies.

3.2. Grant subsidies must only be for activity in Investment Zone areas under the 4 investment categories: skills, local infrastructure, research and innovation, and business support.

3.3. A public authority may not give a grant subsidy for activity that has started, except where:

3.3.1. the beneficiary has begun incurring or has incurred pre-development costs, but physical works and other eligible activity haven’t been legally committed to or commenced.

3.3.2. the public authority is of the view that activity would not be viable unless it starts before the subsidy is awarded and the public authority has provided written authorisation to the beneficiary for the activity to start before the subsidy is given.

3.4. Before giving a grant subsidy under the Scheme, a public authority must, as a minimum, obtain from a beneficiary the following information:

3.4.1. name and size of the enterprise, company registration number, registered company address.

3.4.2. description of the proposed activity, including its location (including which Investment Zone site and/or tax site), start and end dates, and a summary of the costs.

3.5. Open and fair competition should be the default means of awarding subsidies except in justified circumstances. Public authorities must use objective and transparent selection criteria that are available to potential recipients in advance of giving a grant subsidy and be subject to the public authority’s existing accountability frameworks. This includes consideration of potential distortive impacts on the market and mitigation measures.

3.6 A business case for the giving of the grant subsidy must have been approved by the public authority. This includes consideration of the need to ensure that the grant provides additionality and that the minimum amount of grant is used to achieve the desired outcomes.

4. Subsidy type and valuation

4.1. The maximum grant subsidy awardable to a single beneficiary over 3 years under each of the 4 subsidy categories is as follows:

skills: £20 million

local Infrastructure: £45 million

research and innovation: £35 million

business support: £25 million

Any subsidy awarded under the Scheme that exceeds the value of £100,000 must be uploaded to the subsidy database within 3 months of the legal commitment to award a grant subsidy. The relevant accountable body for the Investment Zone is responsible for ensuring that transparency requirements are met. The Scheme maintains its ongoing commitment to comply with Article 369 so checks will be undertaken to ensure subsidy awards are uploaded to the transparency database.

6. Cumulation

6.1. The maximum grant subsidy cumulating to a single beneficiary under each investment category is set out in paragraph 4.1. Subsidies awarded to a single beneficiary under multiple categories, or in multiple Investment Zones, do not cumulate.

6.2. Where a subsidy will or may exceed the maximum grant awardable to a single beneficiary over 3 years set out in paragraph 4.1 for the 4 investment categories, that subsidy will fall out of scope of this Scheme.

7.2 The Scheme cannot be used to award grant subsidies where the specific policy objective of the subsidy (or one of its objectives) relates to energy or the environment, as set out in paragraphs 4.3-4.8 of the Statutory Guidance.

8. Misuse of subsidy

8.1. A public authority should ensure that any subsidy given under this Scheme is given subject to a condition allowing the public authority to recover the whole or part of the subsidy amount to the extent that the subsidy is used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was given, and not for double funding, and to the extent that a beneficiary does not follow the rules of the Scheme thereby misusing the subsidy.
