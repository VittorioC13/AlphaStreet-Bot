Other Highlights and Developments

Fleet Operational Update

The average daily time charter equivalent (“TCE”) rate across the fleet was $28,216 for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $29,550 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and $30,476 for the three months ended March 31, 2025.

Utilization across the fleet was 84.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to 92.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 93.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

Utilization and the average TCE rate in the second quarter were impacted by market uncertainties arising from trade tariffs as many customers opted to wait for more clarity, delaying entry into export and import agreements during this period. In addition, trade was further disrupted following imposition by the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS") of an export license requirement for all ethane movements from the U.S. to China from May 23, 2025, until July 2, 2025, when the license requirement was rescinded. Following the requirement being rescinded and as applicable trade tariff tensions ease, we expect utilization to improve during the third quarter of 2025.

In the second quarter approximately 44% of our earnings days were derived from petrochemical cargoes, approximately 42% were derived from LPG cargoes, with approximately 14% derived from ammonia. LPG cargo earnings days in the second quarter of 2025 was the highest for the Company since the first quarter of 2023, highlighting our capability to flex across several segments in response to the market. During the quarter we employed several semi-refrigerated vessels to transport incremental Iraqi ambient propane exports.

U.S. domestic ethylene prices started the second quarter of 2025 at $530 per metric ton (“pmt”), compared to an average price during the first quarter of 2025 of

[TITLE]Cheniere Signs LNG Supply Agreement with JERA:
[TEXT]
JERA has agreed to purchase approximately 1.0 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of LNG from Cheniere Marketing on a free-on-board basis from 2029 through 2050.

Cheniere Energy, Inc. subsidiary Cheniere Marketing LLC has entered into a long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) sale and purchase agreement with JERA Co. Inc.

JERA has agreed to purchase approximately 1.0 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of LNG from Cheniere Marketing on a free-on-board basis from 2029 through 2050. The purchase price for LNG SPA is indexed to the Henry Hub price, plus a fixed liquefaction fee, the two companies said in a joint news release.

“We are pleased to enter into this multi-decade agreement with JERA, the largest power producer in Japan and one of the largest buyers of LNG in the world,” Cheniere President and CEO Jack Fusco said. “This SPA fortifies our longstanding relationship with JERA, which is based upon years of cooperation and mutually beneficial LNG trade. We look forward to providing our flexible, reliable and cleaner burning LNG to JERA through 2050 under this new long-term agreement”.

JERA Chair and Global CEO Yukio Kani said, “JERA and Cheniere have built a trusted relationship over many years, and we are pleased to extend this relationship further. This long-term agreement with Cheniere—a global leader in LNG—supports JERA’s strategy to diversify and strengthen our LNG procurement portfolio, reinforcing our role as a long-term energy partner in the U.S. and deepening our commitment to securing reliable energy supplies. Together, we will continue to contribute to the energy security, stability, and sustainability of Japan and the broader region for decades to come”.

JERA’s Offshore Wind JV with BP

Earlier in the month, JERA said it formed a new 50-50 joint venture with BP plc to form JERA Nex bp, targeted to be a global offshore wind developer, owner, and operator.

The joint venture’s portfolio of operating assets and development projects has a net potential generating capacity of 13 gigawatts (GW), including around 1 GW of installed net generating capacity, a 7.5-GW development pipeline, and an additional 4.5GW of secured leases, JERA said in an earlier statement.

JERA Nex bp, which is planned to be based in London, plans to “initially focus on disciplined and prioritized development of projects from its existing global pipeline while continuing to safely and efficiently operate existing assets in Europe and Asia,” according to the statement.

A Japan-focused unit, JERA Nex bp, has also been established, with former managing executive officer of JERA Masato Yamada appointed as CEO, the statement said.

JERA Nex bp CEO Nathalie Oosterlinck said, “JERA Nex bp begins life with a strong operating portfolio and an extensive development pipeline. We bring together two highly capable teams with the experience, relationships, purchasing power and unique global access of two of the East and West’s pre-eminent energy companies. This gives us the expertise and experience to find new ways to create value from offshore wind and become one of the world’s leading companies in the sector”.

William Lin, BP executive vice president for gas and low carbon energy, said, “Today’s launch marks an important delivery milestone for JERA Nex bp and we are proud to be a partner in this top-tier global offshore wind developer. The JV allows bp to optimize and decapitalize our low carbon energy portfolio as we continue to maintain optionality for electron flows and more material value realization through this decade and the next”.

“JERA is a phenomenal partner with an impressive operating and development portfolio, [a] wealth of expertise and complementary capabilities. With a disciplined, value-driven focus for development, JERA Nex bp will be an incredible vehicle to progress a global pipeline of projects,” Lin added.

[TITLE]Oil steadies on reports of US-Russia deal but ends week about 5% lower:
[TEXT]
SINGAPORE (Reuters): Oil held steady on Friday as markets awaited a meeting in the coming days between Russian president Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump, but prices marked their steepest weekly losses since late June on a tariff-hit economic outlook.

Brent crude futures settled 16 cents, or 0.2%, higher at US$66.59 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were unchanged at US$63.88.

Brent fell 4.4% over the week, while WTI finished 5.1% lower than last Friday's close.

US crude fell over 1% earlier in the session after Bloomberg News reported that Washington and Moscow were aiming to reach a deal to halt the war in Ukraine that would lock in Russia's occupation of territory seized during its military invasion.

US and Russian officials are working towards an agreement on territories for a planned summit meeting between Trump and Putin as early as next week, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The potential meeting raises expectations of a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine, which could lead to eased sanctions on Russia, and comes as trade tensions have been on the rise between Trump and buyers of Russian oil.

This week, Trump threatened to increase tariffs on India if it kept purchasing Russian oil. Trump also said China, the largest buyer of Russian crude, could be hit with tariffs similar to those levied against Indian imports.

"Various non-oil considerations are at play, including fears over the impact of tariffs and the headlines flying over the last few days regarding a Trump and Putin meeting in the near term," said Neil Crosby, an energy market analyst at Sparta Commodities.

"Headline risk is particularly strong currently with flip-flopping regarding who will turn up to a meeting over Ukraine and under what circumstances."

Higher U.S. tariffs on imports from a host of trade partners went into effect on Thursday, raising concern over economic activity and demand for crude oil, ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.

OPEC+ agreed on Sunday to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September, the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share, adding to supply.

The U.S. oil rig count, an indicator of future supply, rose by one to 411 this week.

"Bearish sentiment has returned this week as key OPEC+ members announced a second 'quadruple' output unwind for September (thus fully restoring their extra voluntary cuts of 2.2 mmb/d) and President Trump's sweeping import tariffs took effect against most countries," analysts at FGE NexantECA said.

Trump on Thursday also said he will nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve out the final few months of a newly vacant seat at the Federal Reserve, fuelling expectations of a more dovish policy ahead.

Lower interest rates reduce consumer borrowing costs and can boost economic growth and demand for oil.

The dollar firmed on Friday but headed for a weekly fall. A stronger dollar hurts demand for dollar-denominated crude from foreign buyers.

Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to August 5, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said.
