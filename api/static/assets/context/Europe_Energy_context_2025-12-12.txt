[TITLE]Perimeter Solutions Announces Agreement to Acquire MMT for $685 Million:
[TEXT]
CLAYTON, Mo., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Perimeter Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: PRM) (“Perimeter,” “Perimeter Solutions,” or the “Company”), today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Medical Manufacturing Technologies LLC (“MMT”) from Arcline Investment Management for approximately $685 million in cash, including certain tax benefits.

MMT is a leading provider of highly engineered machinery and associated aftermarket consumables, parts, and services for the manufacturing of minimally invasive medical devices. Nearly all MMT’s revenue is generated from proprietary products and approximately half of its revenue is derived from the aftermarket. MMT is expected to generate approximately $140 million of revenue and $50 million of Adjusted EBITDA on a full-year basis in 2025.

Haitham Khouri, Perimeter Solutions’ Chief Executive Officer, stated, “MMT is an excellent fit with our operating strategy. MMT serves a recurring and growing aftermarket, where it reliably provides highly engineered proprietary parts and consumables that are critical to zero-defect customer workflows and stringent regulatory standards. MMT has a strong track-record of organic and M&A driven growth, both of which we expect to continue.”

Mr. Khouri continued, “We expect MMT to fit seamlessly into our decentralized operating structure, and we believe that the Company is a particularly strong fit with our Operational Value Driver focused operating strategy”.

Perimeter expects to fund the acquisition through $500 million of new secured debt financing and $185 million of cash on hand.

Perimeter Solutions’ Chief Financial Officer Kyle Sable said, “MMT matches our focus on businesses in secularly growing markets with strong free cash flow, high returns on tangible capital, and durable earnings power. As a result of the transaction, we expect to have net leverage profile of approximately 2.7 times net debt to combined Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months ended September 30, 2025, which we believe will be well supported by the cash generation capability of our combined business.”

The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Nixon Peabody and Greenberg Traurig provided legal counsel to Perimeter.

Based on existing assets, Gran Tierra is targeting over $75-$150 million of free cash flow per year from 2027 onwards at a long-term real Brent price of $70 per bbl. 2026 Base Capital Program: The program will focus on quick payback development projects with a focus on free cash flow 2 generation. Development: Gran Tierra expects to drill a total of 8 to 10 gross development wells in its 2026 capital program, including: Suroriente: The Company plans to drill 4 gross development wells in the Cohembi oil field located in the Southern Putumayo Basin of Colombia. With the completion of this drilling program Gran Tierra expects to completely fulfill its commitments associated with the Suroriente Continuation. Upon completion of the commitments, the economics of the Suroriente block strengthen for Gran Tierra and its Partner paying its working interest share of operating and capital costs. Simonette: Gran Tierra plans to drill 5 gross (2.5 net) wells in South Simonette targeting oil weighted-Montney production.

The program will focus on quick payback development projects with a focus on free cash flow generation. Structural Cost Saving Initiatives: Structural cost initiatives are underway across the portfolio, focused on rationalizing workover activity, improving procurement terms and reducing costs through operational optimization and planning. Gran Tierra maintains a disciplined and constant focus on process improvement, ensuring that small operational changes accumulate into meaningful structural cost savings. Collectively, these actions support a stronger, more efficient cost profile across the organization.

Gran Tierra maintains a disciplined and constant focus on process improvement, ensuring that small operational changes accumulate into meaningful structural cost savings. Collectively, these actions support a stronger, more efficient cost profile across the organization. Repayment of $180 Million of Debt in October 2026: As part of the Company’s ongoing strategy to reduce debt, Gran Tierra has repurchased $20 million of its 2029 Notes during the year, reducing the October 2026 amortization to $180 million while lowering the outstanding balance to $718 million. Gran Tierra intends to fully address the $180 million scheduled amortization related to the 2029 notes coming due in October 2026. Based on the Company’s 2026 expected free cash flow 2 generation, disciplined capital program, and continued focus on operational efficiency provide a clear path to meeting this obligation under any of the provided cases – Low, Base and High. Gran Tierra’s planning assumptions incorporate this repayment as a core use of free cash flow in addition to its available credit facilities of approximately $67 million stated as of September 30, 2025, and previously announced $150 million prepayment facility. Gran Tierra is targeting to reach Net Debt to EBITDA to be below 1.5x in 2028 and below 1.0 by the end of 2029. The Company’s long-term plan, coupled with disciplined capital spending and growing free cash flow, underpins our confidence in fully repaying our debt as scheduled while growing EBITDA.

Hedging: Gran Tierra also employs a disciplined, risk-managed hedging strategy designed to protect cash flow, support capital planning, and enhance financial stability across commodity cycles. Gran Tierra maintains a rolling 12-month hedging program and typically hedges 30–50% of forecast production over the next six months, and 20–30% over the subsequent six-month period.

Close of Acquisition of Perico and Espejo Blocks in Ecuador

Gran Tierra has closed the previously announced strategic acquisition of the Perico and Espejo Blocks in Ecuador, following approval from the Ecuador Ministry of Environment and Energy. The transaction shall follow with customary post-closing regulatory requirements including the authorization of the amendment of the underlying Perico and Espejo block contracts after the approval of the Comité de Licitaciones Hidrocarburíferas.

Following Gran Tierra’s 2025 discoveries on the adjacent Iguana Block, the Company believes that developing the Perico and Iguana Blocks together will capture meaningful operational and cost synergies.

Operations Update

Current Production: The Company’s current production 5 is approximately 48,000 to 49,000 boepd.

The Company’s current production is approximately 48,000 to 49,000 boepd. Ecuador Conejo A-2: The Hollin oil zone was perforated over 41 feet (“ ft ”) of reservoir.

[TITLE]US Natural Gas Output and Demand to Smash Records in 2025:
[TEXT]
The production of US natural gas and demand for it will both end the year at record highs, according to the US Energy Information Administration’s Short-Term Energy Outlook cited by Reuters on Dec. 9.

For dry gas production and LNG exports, the totals will keep rising in 2026.

EIA projected dry gas production will rise from 103.2 billion cubic feet per day in 2024 to 107.7 bcfd in 2025 and 109.1 bcfd in 2026. That compares with a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

The agency also projected domestic gas consumption will rise from a record 90.4 bcfd in 2024 to 91.8 bcfd in 2025 before sliding to 90.8 bcfd in 2026…

The agency forecast average U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports would rise to 14.9 bcfd in 2025 and 16.3 bcfd in 2026, up from a record 11.9 bcfd in 2024.

At the beginning of November, US natural gas futures climbed to their highest level since March, driven by anticipated colder weather increasing domestic heating demand and record-breaking LNG exports to European and Asian buyers.

Robust international demand for US LNG reinforces its strategic role as a crucial transition fuel and a geopolitical tool, potentially driving significant investment in expanding export infrastructure, including the long-stalled Alaska LNG project.

Part of the comeback story for natural gas has to do with the Trump administration’s support of fossil fuels and pivot away from Biden’s focus on clean energy.

In the final year of his term, President Biden imposed a moratorium on new LNG export capacity, based on a study by a researcher who claimed that LNG production resulted in more emissions than burning coal. This was perhaps meant to drive investors away from the commodity, like so many studies before it. But it didn’t. Global demand for natural gas has been growing quite healthily, despite the surge in alternative energy sources.

Oil majors have all signaled they have special plans for gas. Shell, for instance, said earlier this year it would make LNG a priority for the next 10 years. CEO Wale Sawan said LNG would be the company’s “biggest contribution to the energy industry” in the period. BP is making plans for both oil and gas production growth, revising its peak oil demand projection by five years.

Australia’s Woodside Energy recently said it expected its sales of crude oil and natural gas to rise by some 50% by 2032, driven by growing demand for energy, which the company sees at 6% annually over the next five years.

The expected surge in liquefied natural gas export capacity in the United States is on course to boost gas consumption significantly, from around 18 billion cu ft right now to as much as 40 billion cu ft—and that 18 billion cu ft is already an all-time high.

The United States turned into the world’s largest exporter of LNG in a matter of years as energy companies raced to build new liquefaction trains along the Gulf Coast in response to the surge in demand for a lower-emission alternative to coal.

In October, the US became the first country to export 10 million tons of liquefied gas in a single month, enjoying solid demand from Europe, which earlier this year signed a commitment to buy significant volumes of both LNG and oil to get President Trump to lower tariffs.

The EU has been breaking records in LNG imports since 2022, even as it tries to move away from the commodity. Germany this year saw the highest volumes of gas-fired generation since 2019.

The country to date has five LNG import terminals featuring floating storage and regasification units. The import terminals provide Germany with an import capacity of 70.7 million tons of liquefied gas annually by 2030. Germany is set to become the world’s fourth-largest LNG importer, after South Korea, China, and Japan.

Meanwhile, US natural gas pipeline capacity is set for its biggest one-year expansion since 2008. Surging demand from LNG exporters, data centers and manufacturing is driving a $50 billion investment boom.

The Permian Basin remains the focal point, with new projects like ExxonMobil’s stake in Enterprise’s Bahia pipeline and TC Energy’s forecast of a 45 Bcf/d demand surge by 2035 highlighting the sector’s long-term growth outlook.

The US federal government is considering further steps to speed up the buildout of liquefied natural gas export infrastructure as flows of natural gas to LNG plants hit a record high. Exports are also running at all-time highs.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s chairwoman announced the coming changes in a statement that said, “Energy infrastructure needs to be built now, and existing projects need to be maintained efficiently to ensure grid reliability today and in the future. We are taking a hard look at our processes and ways we can simplify certain activities.”

If the FERC goes ahead with the planned changes, it could encourage even faster growth in LNG export capacity as global energy demand forecasts see consistent growth in demand for liquefied gas specifically.

Collectively, these actions support a stronger, more efficient cost profile across the organization. Repayment of $180 Million of Debt in October 2026: As part of the Company’s ongoing strategy to reduce debt, Gran Tierra has repurchased $20 million of its 2029 Notes during the year, reducing the October 2026 amortization to $180 million while lowering the outstanding balance to $718 million. Gran Tierra intends to fully address the $180 million scheduled amortization related to the 2029 notes coming due in October 2026. Based on the Company’s 2026 expected free cash flow 2 generation, disciplined capital program, and continued focus on operational efficiency provide a clear path to meeting this obligation under any of the provided cases – Low, Base and High. Gran Tierra’s planning assumptions incorporate this repayment as a core use of free cash flow in addition to its available credit facilities of approximately $67 million stated as of September 30, 2025, and previously announced $150 million prepayment facility. Gran Tierra is targeting to reach Net Debt to EBITDA to be below 1.5x in 2028 and below 1.0 by the end of 2029. The Company’s long-term plan, coupled with disciplined capital spending and growing free cash flow, underpins our confidence in fully repaying our debt as scheduled while growing EBITDA.

Hedging: Gran Tierra also employs a disciplined, risk-managed hedging strategy designed to protect cash flow, support capital planning, and enhance financial stability across commodity cycles. Gran Tierra maintains a rolling 12-month hedging program and typically hedges 30–50% of forecast production over the next six months, and 20–30% over the subsequent six-month period.

Close of Acquisition of Perico and Espejo Blocks in Ecuador

Gran Tierra has closed the previously announced strategic acquisition of the Perico and Espejo Blocks in Ecuador, following approval from the Ecuador Ministry of Environment and Energy. The transaction shall follow with customary post-closing regulatory requirements including the authorization of the amendment of the underlying Perico and Espejo block contracts after the approval of the Comité de Licitaciones Hidrocarburíferas.

Following Gran Tierra’s 2025 discoveries on the adjacent Iguana Block, the Company believes that developing the Perico and Iguana Blocks together will capture meaningful operational and cost synergies.

[TITLE]US Natural Gas Output and Demand to Smash Records in 2025:
[TEXT]
The production of US natural gas and demand for it will both end the year at record highs, according to the US Energy Information Administration’s Short-Term Energy Outlook cited by Reuters on Dec. 9.

For dry gas production and LNG exports, the totals will keep rising in 2026.

EIA projected dry gas production will rise from 103.2 billion cubic feet per day in 2024 to 107.7 bcfd in 2025 and 109.1 bcfd in 2026. That compares with a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

The agency also projected domestic gas consumption will rise from a record 90.4 bcfd in 2024 to 91.8 bcfd in 2025 before sliding to 90.8 bcfd in 2026…

The agency forecast average U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports would rise to 14.9 bcfd in 2025 and 16.3 bcfd in 2026, up from a record 11.9 bcfd in 2024.

At the beginning of November, US natural gas futures climbed to their highest level since March, driven by anticipated colder weather increasing domestic heating demand and record-breaking LNG exports to European and Asian buyers.

Robust international demand for US LNG reinforces its strategic role as a crucial transition fuel and a geopolitical tool, potentially driving significant investment in expanding export infrastructure, including the long-stalled Alaska LNG project.

Part of the comeback story for natural gas has to do with the Trump administration’s support of fossil fuels and pivot away from Biden’s focus on clean energy.

In the final year of his term, President Biden imposed a moratorium on new LNG export capacity, based on a study by a researcher who claimed that LNG production resulted in more emissions than burning coal. This was perhaps meant to drive investors away from the commodity, like so many studies before it. But it didn’t. Global demand for natural gas has been growing quite healthily, despite the surge in alternative energy sources.

Oil majors have all signaled they have special plans for gas. Shell, for instance, said earlier this year it would make LNG a priority for the next 10 years. CEO Wale Sawan said LNG would be the company’s “biggest contribution to the energy industry” in the period. BP is making plans for both oil and gas production growth, revising its peak oil demand projection by five years.

Australia’s Woodside Energy recently said it expected its sales of crude oil and natural gas to rise by some 50% by 2032, driven by growing demand for energy, which the company sees at 6% annually over the next five years.

The expected surge in liquefied natural gas export capacity in the United States is on course to boost gas consumption significantly, from around 18 billion cu ft right now to as much as 40 billion cu ft—and that 18 billion cu ft is already an all-time high.

The United States turned into the world’s largest exporter of LNG in a matter of years as energy companies raced to build new liquefaction trains along the Gulf Coast in response to the surge in demand for a lower-emission alternative to coal.

In October, the US became the first country to export 10 million tons of liquefied gas in a single month, enjoying solid demand from Europe, which earlier this year signed a commitment to buy significant volumes of both LNG and oil to get President Trump to lower tariffs.

The EU has been breaking records in LNG imports since 2022, even as it tries to move away from the commodity. Germany this year saw the highest volumes of gas-fired generation since 2019.

The country to date has five LNG import terminals featuring floating storage and regasification units. The import terminals provide Germany with an import capacity of 70.7 million tons of liquefied gas annually by 2030. Germany is set to become the world’s fourth-largest LNG importer, after South Korea, China, and Japan.

Meanwhile, US natural gas pipeline capacity is set for its biggest one-year expansion since 2008. Surging demand from LNG exporters, data centers and manufacturing is driving a $50 billion investment boom.

The Permian Basin remains the focal point, with new projects like ExxonMobil’s stake in Enterprise’s Bahia pipeline and TC Energy’s forecast of a 45 Bcf/d demand surge by 2035 highlighting the sector’s long-term growth outlook.

The US federal government is considering further steps to speed up the buildout of liquefied natural gas export infrastructure as flows of natural gas to LNG plants hit a record high. Exports are also running at all-time highs.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s chairwoman announced the coming changes in a statement that said, “Energy infrastructure needs to be built now, and existing projects need to be maintained efficiently to ensure grid reliability today and in the future. We are taking a hard look at our processes and ways we can simplify certain activities.”

If the FERC goes ahead with the planned changes, it could encourage even faster growth in LNG export capacity as global energy demand forecasts see consistent growth in demand for liquefied gas specifically.

[TITLE]Microgrids Set for $17 Billion Boom as Central Grids Fail:
[TEXT]
North America remains the dominant market for resilience applications, while the Asia Pacific region is emerging as the fastest-growing market due to rapid urbanization and rural electrification needs.

The primary driver for microgrid adoption has shifted from economic factors to the urgent need for energy security and infrastructure resilience against extreme weather and aging centralized grids.

The global market for decentralized microgrid solutions is projected to nearly triple, reaching $17.16 billion by 2032, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 13.74%.

The global energy landscape is undergoing a decisive structural shift, moving away from the century-old model of centralized utility dependence toward localized, autonomous power networks. According to a new industry report by Credence Research, the global market for decentralized microgrid solutions is projected to nearly triple in value over the next decade, reaching $17.16 billion by 2032.

This trajectory represents a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 13.74%, driven by a confluence of geopolitical instability, accelerating renewable energy adoption, and the urgent need for infrastructure resilience in the face of increasingly volatile weather patterns.

From Niche Pilot to Strategic Asset

Once considered a niche solution for remote military bases or off-grid communities, microgrids have matured into essential strategic assets for the industrial and commercial sectors. The data indicates the market has already expanded significantly, growing from roughly $2.77 billion in 2018 to an estimated $5.71 billion in 2024.

Set OilPrice.com as a preferred source in Google here

This rapid adoption is fueled by the falling costs of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly solar photovoltaics (PV) and battery storage systems. However, the primary catalyst has shifted from pure economics to energy security.

With aging centralized grids in North America and Europe struggling to cope with peak demand and extreme weather, highlighted by recent hurricane-induced outages in the U.S. Southeast, businesses are increasingly viewing decentralized power not just as a sustainability goal, but as an operational necessity.

North America Leads in Resilience

North America remains the dominant region for decentralized microgrid technology, a trend supported by substantial federal investment in grid modernization. The region’s market size is projected to climb from $2.5 billion in 2024 to over $7.6 billion by 2032.

The drive for resilience is evident in recent policy moves. The U.S. Department of Energy’s "Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships" (GRIP) program, for instance, has earmarked billions to harden infrastructure against wildfires and storms. Consequently, industrial users, data centers, and healthcare campuses are bypassing traditional interconnection delays by installing behind-the-meter microgrids that ensure continuity during main grid failures.

Asia Pacific: The Growth Engine

While North America leads in technological sophistication and resilience applications, the Asia Pacific region is emerging as the fastest-growing market, with a projected CAGR of 15.0% through 2032.

The dynamic here is different but equally potent. Rapid urbanization in India and China, coupled with rural electrification mandates in the Indonesian archipelago, is driving demand for hybrid microgrids. These systems often replace costly diesel generators with solar-plus-storage solutions, effectively leapfrogging traditional grid infrastructure in developing areas.

The Role of Digitalization

The hardware of microgrids, batteries and panels, is only half the story. The report highlights that the explosive growth is equally underpinned by software advancements. Modern microgrids rely on AI-driven controllers and real-time analytics to balance loads, manage "islanding" (disconnecting from the main grid), and optimize peer-to-peer energy trading.

As industries race to decarbonize, the ability to digitally manage a mix of wind, solar, and hydrogen fuel cells locally is becoming a critical competitive advantage.

Outlook

The forecasted surge to $17 billion signals that decentralized energy is no longer an alternative to the grid, but a fundamental component of the future energy mix. As extreme weather events become more frequent and digital dependency grows, the premium on power reliability will likely keep the microgrid sector on a bullish trajectory well into the 2030s.

[TITLE]EU Unveils $1.4 Trillion Plan to Fix Power Grid Bottlenecks:
[TEXT]
The European Commission is expected to launch a nearly $1.4 trillion (1.2 trillion euros) package to upgrade cross-border electric grids and accelerate planning and permitting as the EU looks to strengthen power links and accommodate a growing share of renewable electricity generation.

The European Commission is set to unveil the trillion-dollar package to fast-track grid upgrades and renewable projects permits, and boost cross-border cooperation, a leaked document seen by Euronews showed this week.

The Commission has identified eight key grid projects that will boost cross-border cooperation and strengthen links in the outdated European grid, which is not fit for absorbing the rising share of renewable electricity—not without solar and wind curtailments and losses for the EU taxpayer.

The EC is expected to unveil this week a comprehensive EU plan for cross-border electricity infrastructure, according to a draft proposal seen by Reuters.

The Commission will also work with grid operators to help the projects up and running, the proposal says.

“Huge Problem” with Bottlenecks

“In Europe, it’s a huge problem and we lose billions every year in lost value because of curtailment and bottlenecks,” European Commissioner for Energy, Dan Jørgensen, told the Financial Times last week.

That’s why the Commission will present an EU-wide plan to identify and help fund the most critical grid projects. The slow buildout and upgrade of the electric grids are the “biggest danger” to the EU’s net-zero and energy security goals, Jørgensen told FT.

“It is a bit of a paradox that we have an internal market that works better for selling tomatoes or toothpaste than it does for energy,” the EU official said.

In September, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EC would address critical grid bottlenecks in European electricity infrastructure in a bid to avoid spiking power and energy costs.

“Let us be clear – our energy prices remain still too high, too volatile, and too disparate across Europe. In some Member States, electricity costs three times more than in others. And many price spikes could be avoided, if energy could flow more freely to where it is needed,” von der Leyen said at a conference to take stock of one year of work since the landmark report on Europe’s competitiveness published by former European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi.

The national grids are not well integrated as Europe lacks the necessary interconnectors and is not using the ones it has efficiently, von der Leyen said.

“We will liberate these bottlenecks one by one. And we will step in with funding where necessary,” the top EU official said in September.

Trillions of Investment Needed

In late April, the worst blackout Europe has ever seen in modern times, when Spain and Portugal were left without electricity for hours, was a wake-up call for the EU that, regardless of booming renewable energy capacity installations, power supply will not be secure unless grids are capable and flexible enough to accommodate clean energy and meet rising demand.

For example, estimates have shown that some of Europe’s top economies where wind power plays a key role in electricity supply had to curtail a record amount of generation capacity between January and September as grids were unable to dispatch the surge in renewable energy output.

The curtailment rates in Spain, Germany, France, and southern Sweden rose in the nine months of the year compared to the same period of 2024, according to estimates by data provider LSEG cited by Bloomberg.

The European Commission has estimated that $2.3 trillion (2 trillion euros) to $2.7 trillion (2.3 trillion euros) is required to meet grid needs until 2050, a review of the EU’s electricity grids by the European Court of Auditors showed earlier this year.

The current pipeline of cross-border transmission projects in the EU falls short of its 2030 interconnection targets, clean energy think tank Ember said in a report last week.

Countries representing nearly 80% of EU power generation are behind on their 2030 interconnection targets, according to Ember’s analysis. A total of 11 member states – including the biggest economies Germany, France, and Italy, as well as Spain, Portugal, Poland, and Greece – are projected to have import capacity equal to less than 15% of their domestic electricity generation by 2030.

Moreover, optimizing the European power system will require nearly doubling cross-border transfer capacity over the next decade, Ember says.

Eurelectric, the association of the European electricity industry, last month urged the European Commission to take bold action in the Grids Package.

“Without immediate grid upgrades and regulatory reform, Europe risks derailing its electrification and climate ambitions,” Eurelectric said, adding that Europe’s ageing grids could slow down the energy transition.

“The message is clear: Europe needs grids that grow as fast as its ambitions — or risk watching the energy transition stall at the connection point,” the association noted.

[TITLE]Private Equity’s Utility Spending Spree Threatens New Mexico:
[TEXT]
New Mexico is the fifth-largest state by landmass. With its abundance of sunshine and wind, the Land of Enchantment is “a natural location for renewable energy production and clean energy jobs,” the New Mexico State Land Office explains on its website.

This ample renewable generation capacity has positioned New Mexico well to supply clean energy to Western states. According to Mariel Nanasi, executive director and president of New Energy Economy (NEE), “New Mexico can not only meet all of its energy needs through renewables and storage but could also produce electricity for the highly consumptive and populous states of Arizona and California.” Using transmission interties and wholesale market arrangements, it often does just that.

More from James Baratta

But Nanasi and her organization have sounded the alarm on a bid by Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, to acquire TXNM Energy for $11.5 billion. Announced in May, the deal would give Blackstone control of TXNM subsidiaries Texas-New Mexico Power and the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), which serve 800,000 customers. Unlike a leveraged buyout, the acquisition would be fully funded with equity.

For Nanasi, the proposed acquisition threatens to harm ratepayers by enabling the construction of data centers across New Mexico, rather than supplying affordable power to those who need it. “Blackstone sees this purchase as a very important strategic foray into the West,” she told the Prospect.

Before obtaining TXNM, Blackstone must secure regulatory approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, or PRC. Blackstone also finds itself at the center of an ongoing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proceeding, the outcome of which will determine whether the world’s largest alternatives asset manager can acquire TXNM without undermining wholesale competition or transmission service, causing undue cross-subsidization, or adversely impacting consumers. NEE has intervened in the PRC proceeding.

The proposed acquisition threatens to harm ratepayers by enabling the construction of data centers across New Mexico, rather than supplying affordable power to those who need it.

Blackstone is not the only private equity player carving up New Mexico’s utility infrastructure. Bernhard Capital Partners, a smaller private equity firm based in Louisiana, has been seeking regulatory approval for its proposed acquisition of New Mexico Gas Company (NMGC), the state’s largest natural gas utility. Bernhard reached an agreement with Emera, the utility’s parent company, to acquire NMGC for approximately $1.3 billion last year. The firm also owns traditional energy assets in Louisiana and Mississippi, after acquiring CenterPoint Energy and Entergy’s natural gas distribution businesses earlier this year.

For its part, Blackstone has a 5 percent stake in the embattled Ohio-based electric utility FirstEnergy, and 20 percent of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, which is reportedly planning to expand its natural gas power plants to meet electricity demand from data centers. Acquiring TXNM would be a first for Blackstone, as the $1 trillion private markets manager has never owned a regulated utility outright.

A spokesperson for Blackstone told the Prospect the firm is “the right partner to support PNM’s long-term growth” and that PNM would operate as a stand-alone business with its own leadership, with strictly regulated rates from the PRC.

But the Center for Biological Diversity, an intervenor in the FERC case, recently argued that Blackstone’s application neglects the anti-competitive effects of acquiring TXNM on customers, as the company could leverage its ownership of the utility in its continued pursuit of data center investments. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) acknowledged as much in their December 4 letter to Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman.

“Private equity’s money-extracting playbook isn’t anything new, and the consequences that usually follow aren’t either,” the senators wrote.

[TITLE]envelio expands Intelligent Grid Platform (IGP) with the “Grid Connection Navigator”:
[TEXT]
Boston, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

Full transparency and efficient interconnection for project developers and utilities: The new IGP application gives a clear view at the earliest stage of the interconnection process, reducing effort and costs for both sides while ensuring utilities receive more qualified, less speculative requests for faster studies

The new IGP application gives a clear view at the earliest stage of the interconnection process, reducing effort and costs for both sides while ensuring utilities receive more qualified, less speculative requests for faster studies Beyond traditional hosting capacity maps: “Grid Connection Navigator” (GCN) reinvents hosting capacity maps and provides near-real-time automated updates, advanced time-series results, power-flow based calculations in one single, intuitive interface

“Grid Connection Navigator” (GCN) reinvents hosting capacity maps and provides near-real-time automated updates, advanced time-series results, power-flow based calculations in one single, intuitive interface Reliable project planning: Developers can evaluate available grid capacity, identify suitable sites, and estimate connection costs more accurately

Developers can evaluate available grid capacity, identify suitable sites, and estimate connection costs more accurately The world's first rollout of the Grid Connection Navigator is taking place with a US-utility

Boston, 12/10/2025 – envelio, Europe’s leading smart grid software provider, is launching its new Grid Connection Navigator (GCN) application in the North American market. This digital tool streamlines the first step of the interconnection process. Users can independently evaluate available grid capacity, identify suitable sites, and estimate projected connection costs. Utilities benefit from reduced manual efforts and higher-quality connection requests. The new tool complements envelio’s existing interconnection applications, “Grid Connection Study” and “Online Connection Check”.

As DERs (distributed energy resources), electrification, and large loads expand rapidly, the interconnection process and queues often become a bottleneck. In many cases, the process is complex and lacks transparency: developers and companies often cannot determine in advance whether a site is technically and commercially feasible. This can lead to delays, higher costs, and less effective planning. Meanwhile, utilities must review a large number of incomplete or speculative interconnection requests. With the Grid Connection Navigator, envelio has developed a tool that frees up valuable time and personnel resources on both sides.

Win-win in grid interconnection: transparency for developers, efficiency for utilities

Project developers benefit from a much more transparent interconnection-planning process. They can check available grid capacity, identify feasible locations, and calculate projected connection costs in advance. This reduces planning effort while saving time and money. Utilities benefit from receiving more realistic, well-founded, and easier-to-process requests. This enables faster, more targeted interconnection decisions while keeping critical staff resources available for other tasks.

“Hosting capacity maps are the right tool — but a new approach is needed to keep pace with today’s multiple challenges like load growth and flexibility to name a few.,” says Luigi Montana, CEO of envelio Inc. “With the Grid Connection Navigator, we’re taking that next step. Instead of a static map, we provide an interactive, data-driven view of the grid powered by a true load-flow–based algorithm without approximations or heuristics. This gives developers the right information at the very beginning of their planning, while helping utilities focus their resources on requests that are genuinely feasible. The result is greater operational and financial flexibility — and ultimately a faster path to deploying DERs, EV charging infrastructure, and large loads.”

Grid Connection Navigator enables a fully digital connection process

At the heart of the digital tool lies an interactive grid-capacity map. GCN users can evaluate available capacity before submitting a request, identify suitable locations, and access indicative cost calculations. Utilities can embed the Navigator directly into the self-service area of their website, allowing customers to use it immediately without logging in.

Unlike traditional hosting capacity maps, the Grid Connection Navigator is powered by continuously updated data. Instead of annual or infrequent refreshes, it automatically updates underlying calculations, including power-flow–based hosting capacity assessments, giving users near-real-time, highly accurate visibility into grid conditions. The tool also integrates seasonal and time-series–based hosting capacities, providing a clearer view of when capacity is available. This granularity is essential for assessing battery storage projects and flexible interconnections, where timing and variability are critical to technical and economic feasibility.

envelio expands U.S. presence

Last year, envelio introduced its market-leading smart grid software, the Intelligent Grid Platform (IGP), to the U.S. market. Less than twelve months later, a U.S. utility became the first customer worldwide to deploy the Grid Connection Navigator, confirming envelio’s successful entry into the U.S. market. Several other U.S. utilities have already shown interest, highlighting envelio’s dedication to providing intelligent solutions to support grid operators worldwide in planning, operating and transforming electric distribution grids.

[TITLE]Private Equity’s Utility Spending Spree Threatens New Mexico:
[TEXT]
New Mexico is the fifth-largest state by landmass. With its abundance of sunshine and wind, the Land of Enchantment is “a natural location for renewable energy production and clean energy jobs,” the New Mexico State Land Office explains on its website.

This ample renewable generation capacity has positioned New Mexico well to supply clean energy to Western states. According to Mariel Nanasi, executive director and president of New Energy Economy (NEE), “New Mexico can not only meet all of its energy needs through renewables and storage but could also produce electricity for the highly consumptive and populous states of Arizona and California.” Using transmission interties and wholesale market arrangements, it often does just that.

More from James Baratta

But Nanasi and her organization have sounded the alarm on a bid by Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, to acquire TXNM Energy for $11.5 billion. Announced in May, the deal would give Blackstone control of TXNM subsidiaries Texas-New Mexico Power and the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), which serve 800,000 customers. Unlike a leveraged buyout, the acquisition would be fully funded with equity.

For Nanasi, the proposed acquisition threatens to harm ratepayers by enabling the construction of data centers across New Mexico, rather than supplying affordable power to those who need it. “Blackstone sees this purchase as a very important strategic foray into the West,” she told the Prospect.

Before obtaining TXNM, Blackstone must secure regulatory approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, or PRC. Blackstone also finds itself at the center of an ongoing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proceeding, the outcome of which will determine whether the world’s largest alternatives asset manager can acquire TXNM without undermining wholesale competition or transmission service, causing undue cross-subsidization, or adversely impacting consumers. NEE has intervened in the PRC proceeding.

The proposed acquisition threatens to harm ratepayers by enabling the construction of data centers across New Mexico, rather than supplying affordable power to those who need it.

Blackstone is not the only private equity player carving up New Mexico’s utility infrastructure. Bernhard Capital Partners, a smaller private equity firm based in Louisiana, has been seeking regulatory approval for its proposed acquisition of New Mexico Gas Company (NMGC), the state’s largest natural gas utility. Bernhard reached an agreement with Emera, the utility’s parent company, to acquire NMGC for approximately $1.3 billion last year. The firm also owns traditional energy assets in Louisiana and Mississippi, after acquiring CenterPoint Energy and Entergy’s natural gas distribution businesses earlier this year.

For its part, Blackstone has a 5 percent stake in the embattled Ohio-based electric utility FirstEnergy, and 20 percent of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, which is reportedly planning to expand its natural gas power plants to meet electricity demand from data centers. Acquiring TXNM would be a first for Blackstone, as the $1 trillion private markets manager has never owned a regulated utility outright.

A spokesperson for Blackstone told the Prospect the firm is “the right partner to support PNM’s long-term growth” and that PNM would operate as a stand-alone business with its own leadership, with strictly regulated rates from the PRC.

But the Center for Biological Diversity, an intervenor in the FERC case, recently argued that Blackstone’s application neglects the anti-competitive effects of acquiring TXNM on customers, as the company could leverage its ownership of the utility in its continued pursuit of data center investments. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) acknowledged as much in their December 4 letter to Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman.

“Private equity’s money-extracting playbook isn’t anything new, and the consequences that usually follow aren’t either,” the senators wrote.

[TITLE]Where the Algo Meets the Asphalt:
[TEXT]
Geopolitically, the shift is marked by China's pivot from dominating solar panel manufacturing to cornering the green hydrogen market, and a return to "interventionist industrial strategy" in the West where governments are becoming energy shareholders.

The transition is forcing a move away from simple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) toward complex, flexible contracts and driving Big Tech to invest in on-site generation and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) to ensure reliability.

The rapid growth of AI is projected to push global data center power demand to 2,200 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2030, an "always-on" load that threatens to overwhelm the world's aging electrical grids.

There is the economy you see on the screen. And then there is the economy that runs the screen.

For the last few years, the screen has been winning.

We have been living in a "Zero Marginal Cost" fantasy…

We convinced ourselves that adding another million users to ChatGPT was free. That scaling a startup was just a matter of writing better code. That "The Cloud" was an infinite, weightless place where business happened by magic.

But today, S&P Global Energy dropped a bucket of ice water on that fever dream.

I’ve spent the morning reading through their new Horizons Top Trends 2026 forecast. It’s dense. It’s technical. It’s written in the polite, measured language of analysts who don't like to shout. But if you translate the data into plain English, they are shouting.

The bottleneck isn't the code anymore. It’s the copper. It’s the transformers. It’s the sheer, raw wattage required to keep the simulation running. And right now? We don't have enough of it.

Adding Another India to a Grid That Can’t Handle It

Let’s look at the raw numbers, because they are wild.

S&P projects that by 2030, global data center power demand could hit 2,200 terawatt-hours (TWh).

It is easy to glaze over a number like that. We hear stats
