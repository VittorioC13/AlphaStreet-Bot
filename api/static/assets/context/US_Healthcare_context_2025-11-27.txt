[TITLE]Hartford HealthCare could acquire 2 Prospect hospitals by year end:
[TEXT]
After years of uncertainty regarding the future of the Connecticut hospitals owned by bankrupt operator Prospect Medical Holdings, two of the three facilities could have a new owner by the end of the year.

On Tuesday, Hartford HealthCare, one of Connecticut’s largest health systems, presented its case to the state’s Office of Health Strategy to purchase Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals. Under the new expedited approval timeline for hospitals in bankruptcy, state officials must issue a decision by Dec. 30.

During the public hearing, Hartford HealthCare CEO Jeffrey Flaks said the health system plans to bring all its expertise, resources and capabilities to Manchester, Rockville and the surrounding towns.

“The robust apparatus of Hartford HealthCare will be brought to these communities to make health care better. That’s why I’m so confident that we have this very unique opportunity to dramatically improve health care that will be here for generations going forward,” Flaks said.

Hartford HealthCare will spend $86.1 million to purchase the facilities and pledged to invest an additional $225.7 million towards capital improvements, like facility and IT upgrades, over the next three years.

Hartford HealthCare also plans to recruit new physicians to the Manchester and Rockville communities, as well as expand access to specialty care, like oncology, inpatient rehabilitation and vascular and orthopedic surgical services, according to the application submitted to the state.

If approved, the deal would serve as the first step towards concluding a lengthy search to find new buyers for Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals — a process that often seemed on the brink of failure.

In 2022, Prospect signed a deal to sell its three Connecticut hospitals — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury — to Yale New Haven Health for $435 million. But the deal was mired in setbacks and litigation.

In August 2023, a cyberattack crippled operations at Prospect’s facilities around the country. In 2024, Yale New Haven Health and Prospect Medical sued and countersued each other over the true value of the hospitals. In January 2025, Prospect filed for bankruptcy and, by the following month, Yale officials said a deal appeared “impossible.”

In September, Yale agreed to pay $45 million to Prospect to end all disputes over the hospitals’ sale.

Hartford HealthCare stepped in and its acquisitions of the Manchester and Rockville facilities could be finalized by the end of the year. Connecticut’s flagship academic medical institution, UConn Health, seems poised to acquire Waterbury Hospital. A judge for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas approved the UConn deal earlier this week, and now the transaction must obtain state approval.

It’s a speedy transition for the three hospitals, whose ownership had languished in uncertainty for years.

While the Yale deal was pending, Lamont and OHS received broad criticism for the lengthy approval process. That led state legislators to approve a measure earlier this year that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy.

Under the emergency certificate of need timeline, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete.

In an emailed statement, Lamont’s spokesperson Rob Blanchard said OHS “met all statutory timelines in the Yale-Prospect [certificate of need review]” and that the legal disputes between the two companies illustrate the transaction’s complexity.

“Yale’s decision to file suit against Prospect less than two months after the agreed settlement raised clear concerns

[TITLE]Fisher and Paykel Healthcare raises full-year guidance after strong first half:
[TEXT]
FPH managing director and chief executive Lewis Gradon said it had continued to work closely with clinicians, progressed work on new products, and delivered a range of efficiency improvements across the business.

“This is a strong result against the backdrop of robust growth in the first half of last year. We saw broad-based strength across the hospital consumables portfolio during a period of lower seasonal respiratory hospitalisations, and in homecare, our latest range of masks for treating obstructive sleep apnea has performed well.”

In the hospital product group, first half revenue grew to $692.2m, up 17% compared to the same period last year, or 15% in constant currency. This group includes humidification products used in respiratory, acute and surgical care.

Sales of hardware grew by 21%, and hospital new applications consumables revenue lifted by 16%.

In the homecare product group, first half revenue lifted 10% to $395.9m, or up 8%. This group includes products used in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and respiratory support in the home.

Gradon said the turnoff of 3G networks had supported hardware sales of its sleep apnoea machines.

The company said its team efforts, together with other efficiency gains, helped to offset the 32 basis-point impact of US tariffs on its hospital products sourced from New Zealand.

Investment in research and development equated to 10% of revenue, or $114.1m.

The company directors have approved an interim dividend of 19c per share, up from 18.5c per share in the first half of the prior year, set to be paid on December 16, 2025.

The share price sat at $36.70 prior to the market open, and lifted by 4.8% to $38.47 by mid morning.

Outlook

FPH also updated its full-year guidance for the financial year, lifting its expected operating revenue to be in the range of approximately $2.17b to $2.27b, up from $2.15b to $2.25b in August’s guidance.

Net profit is also expected to be higher, with the company expecting full-year net profit to be in the range of approximately $410m to $460m, up from $390m to $440m.

“Our second-half hospital consumables growth can be influenced by year-on-year variations in the Northern Hemisphere winter respiratory season, and we don’t have any additional insights into that impact at present,” Gradon added.

“Available data indicates that last winter was a historically strong season, and so a similar season this year would be pushing our result towards the top end of guidance.”

The outlook continues to estimate a 75 basis point impact to gross margin due to US tariffs. It also assumes current global tariff rates, policies and applications for the remainder of the financial year.

The board also approved a discretionary profit-sharing payment of $9m million to be shared among employees who have worked for the company for a qualifying period.

Reaction

Forsyth Barr senior analyst Matt Montgomerie said the business exceeded the guidance it provided in August, with the result strong across the board.

“Where they saw particular strengths relative to our expectations was in the hospital hardware business, and particularly I think that is the ongoing mix shift within the business towards the products that they’ve launched in the last couple of years. That’s the Airvo 3 and the 950 system which are higher priced products,” Montgomerie said.

“It reflects hospitals moving on from one generation of product to the other. It was very strong growth and outside of that, pretty much in line with what we were expecting.”

Montgomerie said new apps and consumables had a strong half as the high growth category of the business, reflecting ongoing clinical practice change. Homecare was more or less in line with expectations.

He expects that if the business can maintain its momentum into the second half of the financial year, it should finish closer to the top end of its guidance range.

“I think the result is ongoing evidence of execution and delivery, which they’ve shown for a long period of time now.

“It’s one of those results where it’s very hard to pick any holes in it, to be honest.”

[TITLE]Silexion Therapeutics Successfully Completes Toxicology Studies for SIL204, Next-Generation RNA Silencing Therapy, Ahead of Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial in Pancreatic Cancer:
[TEXT]
Successful completion of two-species toxicology studies confirms no systemic organ toxicity, advancing the Company towards its planned regulatory submissions to Israel and Germany

Company remains on track to initiate Phase 2/3 clinical trial in locally advanced pancreatic cancer in Q2 2026

Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Silexion Therapeutics Corp. (NASDAQ: SLXN) ("Silexion" or the "Company"), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing RNA interference (RNAi) therapies for KRAS-driven cancers, today announced the successful completion of toxicology studies for SIL204, the Company's next-generation RNA silencing (siRNA) therapy targeting mutated KRAS oncogenes, ahead of its planned Phase 2/3 clinical trial in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).

SIL204 was engineered as a next-generation siRNA therapy targeting mutant KRAS oncogenes to abolish expression of mutated KRAS proteins, which drive aggressive cancers. Designed for enhanced cellular delivery, stability, and broad antitumor activity, SIL204 has shown positive preclinical data demonstrating significant inhibition of cancer cell growth in vitro across a broad range of KRAS mutated cell lines and has shown positive anti-tumor activity in pancreatic cancer sites following systemic administration. The compelling positive preclinical evidence supporting SIL204's potential efficacy in treating aggressive cancers is now further strengthened by the recently completed toxicology study package. Conducted in two species, these toxicology studies confirmed that administration of SIL204 does not lead to systemic organ toxicity, advancing Silexion's plans to initiate clinical trial sites for a Phase 2/3 trial in LAPC.

Ilan Hadar, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Silexion, commented: "Results from the toxicology studies have cleared us to maintain our planned timelines to initiate SIL204's Phase 2/3 clinical trial in pancreatic cancer. We have recently secured our CRO partner for the trial and continue to prepare regulatory submissions to both Israel's Ministry of Health and Germany's Health Authority (BfArM). SIL204's preclinical package has shown remarkable potential as a cancer treatment, offering an innovative modality - stopping mutated, cancer-driving proteins before they are expressed. We are eager to prove this potential in the clinic and bring SIL204 to patients who could benefit from this treatment. We remain on track to initiate the first stage of SIL204's advanced clinical development in the second quarter of 2026."

Dr. Mitchell Shirvan, Chief Scientific and Development Officer of Silexion, added: "We are highly encouraged by the favorable safety results, which support our unique integrated treatment regimen approach to treating this disease that currently has no solution for its extremely high mortality rate. We believe our integrated approach which combines administering both intratumorally and systemically, combined with our innovative platform for disrupting communication between the KRAS oncogene and tumor cells, holds great promise for improving survival in these patients with a reasonable quality of life.”

[TITLE]Fisher and Paykel Healthcare raises full-year guidance after strong first half:
[TEXT]
FPH managing director and chief executive Lewis Gradon said it had continued to work closely with clinicians, progressed work on new products, and delivered a range of efficiency improvements across the business.

“This is a strong result against the backdrop of robust growth in the first half of last year. We saw broad-based strength across the hospital consumables portfolio during a period of lower seasonal respiratory hospitalisations, and in homecare, our latest range of masks for treating obstructive sleep apnea has performed well.”

In the hospital product group, first half revenue grew to $692.2m, up 17% compared to the same period last year, or 15% in constant currency. This group includes humidification products used in respiratory, acute and surgical care.

Sales of hardware grew by 21%, and hospital new applications consumables revenue lifted by 16%.

In the homecare product group, first half revenue lifted 10% to $395.9m, or up 8%. This group includes products used in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and respiratory support in the home.

Gradon said the turnoff of 3G networks had supported hardware sales of its sleep apnoea machines.

The company said its team efforts, together with other efficiency gains, helped to offset the 32 basis-point impact of US tariffs on its hospital products sourced from New Zealand.

Investment in research and development equated to 10% of revenue, or $114.1m.

The company directors have approved an interim dividend of 19c per share, up from 18.5c per share in the first half of the prior year, set to be paid on December 16, 2025.

The share price sat at $36.70 prior to the market open, and lifted by 4.8% to $38.47 by mid morning.

Outlook

FPH also updated its full-year guidance for the financial year, lifting its expected operating revenue to be in the range of approximately $2.17b to $2.27b, up from $2.15b to $2.25b in August’s guidance.

Net profit is also expected to be higher, with the company expecting full-year net profit to be in the range of approximately $410m to $460m, up from $390m to $440m.

“Our second-half hospital consumables growth can be influenced by year-on-year variations in the Northern Hemisphere winter respiratory season, and we don’t have any additional insights into that impact at present,” Gradon added.

“Available data indicates that last winter was a historically strong season, and so a similar season this year would be pushing our result towards the top end of guidance.”

The outlook continues to estimate a 75 basis point impact to gross margin due to US tariffs. It also assumes current global tariff rates, policies and applications for the remainder of the financial year.

The board also approved a discretionary profit-sharing payment of $9m million to be shared among employees who have worked for the company for a qualifying period.

Reaction

Forsyth Barr senior analyst Matt Montgomerie said the business exceeded the guidance it provided in August, with the result strong across the board.

“Where they saw particular strengths relative to our expectations was in the hospital hardware business, and particularly I think that is the ongoing mix shift within the business towards the products that they’ve launched in the last couple of years. That’s the Airvo 3 and the 950 system which are higher priced products,” Montgomerie said.

“It reflects hospitals moving on from one generation of product to the other. It was very strong growth and outside of that, pretty much in line with what we were expecting.”

Montgomerie said new apps and consumables had a strong half as the high growth category of the business, reflecting ongoing clinical practice change. Homecare was more or less in line with expectations.

He expects that if the business can maintain its momentum into the second half of the financial year, it should finish closer to the top end of its guidance range.

“I think the result is ongoing evidence of execution and delivery, which they’ve shown for a long period of time now.

“It’s one of those results where it’s very hard to pick any holes in it, to be honest.”

[TITLE]Why Medical Tourism Is Becoming a Family Lifeline:
[TEXT]
Medical Tourism Is the New Middle-Class Healthcare Hack

I did not come to Thailand expecting a lesson in how broken the American healthcare system truly is. I came because my son needed braces, and back home, the quote nearly made me stop breathing. Almost four thousand dollars for a mouthful of metal. Four thousand for something his dentist described as “routine.” Four thousand for a child who still loses his shoes at school and asks for snacks every thirty minutes.

Still, taking care of your kids is not optional. So I did what most American parents do. I tightened my budget. I shifted bills. I convinced myself I would figure it out. That is what families do. We stretch.

The Moment I Started Considering Care Abroad

Eventually, after months of stretching, something in me snapped. I started researching alternatives. I looked at Mexico first, then Colombia. Then someone in a Facebook parenting group mentioned Bangkok. She said her daughter got braces there for less than what she paid for a semester of piano lessons. She said the clinic was spotless and the staff were kind. She said it changed everything for her budget.

Honestly, at first, it sounded unbelievable. But the more I read, the more it made sense. Studies that compare health costs across countries, like this OECD dataset, show how drastically prices differ: https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm. Thailand has become a global medical hub, known for dental work, cosmetic surgery, fertility treatments, and full-body checkups. Families from Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Asia fly there for modern, safe, and predictable care. And slowly, American families have started to join them.

The Price Difference Between U.S. and Thailand Care

I booked the trip.

Walking into that Bangkok clinic felt like stepping into a different version of what healthcare could be. The lobby was bright and airy. The staff greeted us like we were guests, not case files. The receptionist spoke softly, smiled easily, and handed my son a sticker before she handed me a clipboard. No frantic phones were ringing. No frustrated patients arguing

[TITLE]India healthcare or USA healthcare? Apollo neurologist explains why more Americans may soon fly to India for medical treatment:

India is quietly becoming a surprising favourite for global patients, and even Americans may soon join that list in bigger numbers. With long hospital queues and soaring medical bills in the West, a growing number of people are looking for faster, safer and more affordable alternatives. Apollo neurologist Dr Sudhir Kumar believes India already offers that edge — and he laid out exactly why in a detailed post on X.Dr Sudhir Kumar listed three major advantages that set India apart. He said patients can access doctors, including superspecialists, far more quickly, often getting appointments within a day. Diagnostic tests like MRIs, CT scans and lab investigations also come through much faster, with minimal waiting time. And the biggest draw for many: India’s medical costs remain significantly lower, from routine blood work to complicated surgeries.He pointed out that this efficiency exists despite India having fewer doctors, fewer hospital beds and fewer MRI machines per capita than the US. According to him, a large, competitive healthcare ecosystem and high patient throughput help keep costs controlled and wait times short.Dr Sudhir Kumar also noted that NRIs and international patients have been travelling to India for years for affordable, high-quality treatment. With rising healthcare expenses and long delays in several Western countries, he believes more Americans may soon look to India for timely and cost-effective care, a trend already reflected in medical tourism data.To highlight the price gap, he shared a chart from the Economic Times using data sourced from KPMG and Policybazaar.com. It compared the cost of major procedures in both countries. A coronary artery bypass grafting, which can cost between $70,000 and $150,000 in the US, is priced at $5,000 to $8,000 in India. Knee replacements, which run up to $50,000 in America, cost $4,000 to $6,000 here.The gap widens further for organ transplants. A liver transplant that could cost more than $300,000 in the US is available in India for $40,000 to $60,000. Similarly, kidney transplants priced between $200,000 and $300,000 in America cost between $7,000 and $12,000 in India. Even IVF, one of the most sought-after procedures, is far more affordable, costing $2,000 to $5,000 per cycle compared to $12,000 to $15,000 in the US. All figures were calculated with a US dollar–rupee exchange rate of 88.45 as of 20 November 2025. The data also noted that actual prices can vary depending on the city, hospital, patient’s health and duration of stay.
