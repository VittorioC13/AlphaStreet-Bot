US-based packaging company Georgia-Pacific has agreed to acquire Anchor Packaging, a manufacturer of rigid food containers and cling film.

Financial details of the acquisition have not been disclosed.

Headquartered in St Louis, Missouri, Anchor Packaging has operated as a portfolio company of private equity firm TJC (formerly known as The Jordan Company) since 2019. The packaging company has operations in the states of Arkansas and Wisconsin.

The move by Georgia-Pacific is anticipated to enhance its product offerings in the food service, retail and processor channels.

Based in the city of Atlanta, Georgia-Pacific operates the consumer brands Angel Soft, Brawny, Dixie, enMotion, Quilted Northern, Sparkle and Vanity Fair.

Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products Group executive vice-president David Duncan stated: “Anchor Packaging will be a significant addition to Georgia-Pacific’s consumer products platform with capabilities that will especially complement our Dixie business.

“Anchor’s talented teams are committed to understanding customer needs and delivering innovative and differentiated solutions to support the needs of the growing food-to-go market.”

The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Anchor Packaging president and CEO Jeff Wolff stated: “This partnership allows us to expand our product portfolio, strengthen our supply chain and accelerate our commitment to innovation. We look forward to delivering even greater value to our customers and stakeholders.”

RBC Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs advised Anchor Packaging, while Nomura Securities International guided Georgia-Pacific in this transaction.

Dixie president Fernando González stated: “This is a major step in building a platform for growth.

“Adding Anchor Packaging to Georgia-Pacific’s portfolio aligns perfectly with our vision to be a preferred partner in providing innovative food and beverage packaging and tableware solutions to our customers. We are excited to welcome the Anchor Packaging team to Georgia-Pacific.”

In May 2025, Georgia-Pacific announced its plan to close its containerboard facility situated in Cedar Springs, Georgia, later in the year, citing concerns about the facility’s long-term competitiveness in meeting customer needs.

[TITLE]Jim Cramer Says Food Stocks Like Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL) Could Benefit From A Merger:
[TEXT]
We recently published 13 Stocks That Jim Cramer Discussed. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.

Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) might have been able to withstand the losses that the broader food sector had faced had it not been for a disastrous 13% share price drop in August. The shares fell after the firm’s third quarter earnings report, which saw its third quarter adjusted EPS and midpoint fourth quarter EPS guide of $0.35 and $0.39 miss analyst estimates of $0.41 and $0.49. After the earnings report, Cramer explained that Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) was suffering as the disruption in the US beef industry had stripped the firm of its pricing power. This time, he discussed the firm in the context of the broader woes of the food sector as he wondered whether a merger might be a way out for Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) and help it to lower costs:

“But the answer is, you take out costs, but I think you have to begin the great merger of this sector. You have to begin the great merger of this sector. You have to start putting together big deals, take out big costs. . . .They have to just become, this should be like a big three. It’s over. You can’t grow. . .and maybe under this administration you could put together a Hormel, Pepsi, I don’t know what.”

While we acknowledge the potential of HRL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

[TITLE]SECURITIES CLASS ACTION NOTICE: Girard Sharp Law Firm Encourages Current and Former 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) Shareholders Who Received Neogen Corporation (NASDAQ:NEOG) Shares in Connection With Neogen Co:
[TEXT]
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Girard Sharp LLP, a national investment, securities, and consumer class action law firm, has filed a securities class action against Neogen Corporation (“Neogen”). According to the complaint, the class includes “all current and former 3M shareholders who received NEOG common stock in exchange for Garden SpinCo shares pursuant to the Merger Exchange (the “Class”)”.

Neogen is a Michigan corporation that, with its subsidiaries, “manufacture and market a diverse line of products and services dedicated to food and animal safety.” The Company’s Food Safety segment consists primarily of “diagnostic test products and complementary products (e.g., culture media) sold to food producers and processors to detect dangerous and/or unintended substances in human food and animal feed, such as foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, natural toxins, food allergens, genetic modifications, ruminant by-products, meat speciation, drug residues, pesticide residues and general sanitation concerns.” The Company’s Animal Safety segment is engaged in the “development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of veterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, diagnostic products, rodenticides, cleaners, disinfectants, insecticides and genomics testing services for the worldwide animal safety market.”

The offering materials for the Merger (“Offering Materials”) stated that the combined Company expected to “have improved EBITDA margins and stronger free cash flow relative to Neogen on a standalone basis, allowing Neogen to deleverage following the [Merger]” and “generate run-rate revenue and cost synergies of $30 million within three years following the closing of the [Merger] due to efficiencies in product innovation, sales, marketing, distribution and production.”

On January 10, 2025, Neogen announced its preliminary 2Q25 financial results and reported a net loss of $456.3 million due to a non-cash goodwill impairment related to the 3M Food Safety Division acquisition. Moreover, Neogen reported that, as of November 30, 2024, the Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. On April 9, 2025, Neogen announced its 3Q25 financial results, reporting a net loss of $11 million and a drop in revenue of 3.4% to $221 million. The Company also reported that its capital expenditures were expected to be approximately $100 million as a result of “lowered Adjusted EBITDA” and a “pull-forward of integration capex into fiscal 2025.” It also reported the Company’s CEO, John Adent, would be stepping down.

Since September 1, 2022, the date upon which Neogen issued shares to former or current 3M investors, Neogen’s share price has declined by 75%. Girard Sharp’s investigation focuses on whether the Offering Materials may have included misrepresentations and omissions regarding Neogen’s and 3M’s financial conditions and the Merger.

[TITLE]Why your favorite Etsy treasures could soon cost more — or go away entirely:
[TEXT]
This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th. Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.

Hunched over her kitchen counter, in the depths of grief, Kellie Abernethy had an idea.

It was March 2020, and she and her husband had been trying for a second child, but suffered a miscarriage that had unmoored them. I just need something to hold onto this moment, she thought then.

Her eyes lingered on the bouquet of flowers on the counter — a gift from her husband — and the clusters of tiny white blooms poking out among the stems. Baby’s breath — a symbol of everlasting love. She thought perhaps she could keep them, encase them in a necklace to wear in memory. Abernethy, who had never made jewelry before, got to work ordering the parts.

After much trial and error, the final product was a delicate rose gold chain with a small round pendant holding the baby’s breath bloom. It occurred to her that other parents may also be looking for something to commemorate the babies they lost, so she listed the photo of her original on Etsy, the marketplace for mom-and-pop (but mostly mom) shops that sell largely handmade items. Some 80 percent of sellers there are women.

Before long, Abernethy had a jewelry business called Rest of the Nest. Five years later, it’s her full-time job. The necklace that started it all became her bestseller. But now, she’s unsure if she’ll be able to continue making it.

President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies, which have significantly raised tariffs on most countries, have hit small businesses like hers that source some of their products internationally. The rose gold Abernethy uses in her signature necklace, for example, she can only find in China. She’s facing a 30 percent tariff on those imports, a fee that is likely too high for her business to absorb.

In late August, the Trump administration also ended a century-old rule that allowed American sellers to avoid tariffs on small international shipments. Known as the de minimis exemption, the rule allowed importers to avoid tariffs on orders valued at less than $800.

Trump has sold his approach to trade as a means to boost domestic production and create jobs, but all those new costs have put Abernethy in a bind: If she raises prices, she risks pricing herself out of the market. If she cuts the necklace entirely, it would mean ending sales of her bestseller, a decision that carries not only financial heft but also emotional significance.

“I feel frozen in fear a little bit,” Abernethy said. “I’ve never done this to be rich. I just want to make a decent living doing something I feel deeply passionate
