[TITLE]Brookfield backs Bloom Energy with $5 billion for fuel cells to power AI data centers:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) -Brookfield Asset Management said on Monday it would invest up to $5 billion in Bloom Energy's fuel cell technology to power data centers, as companies seek cleaner energy to meet the needs of the artificial intelligence boom.

Shares of Bloom Energy surged 24.5% to hit a record high of $108.17 in morning trading.

Brookfield's first investment in its dedicated AI Infrastructure strategy taps into a shift to cleaner power sources such as nuclear, renewables and fuel cells as firms invest billions into building and expanding data centers amid the surge in demand for AI and cloud computing services.

Evercore ISI analysts in a note said Bloom's solid oxide fuel cells offer "reliable, scalable and clean on-site power".

"Hybrid power solutions" could become more important, addressing long lead times and regulatory hurdles for new generation capacity of the legacy grid, they said.

Bloom Energy has already deployed its fuel-cell technology to data centers, through partnerships with American Electric Power, Equinix and Oracle.

The companies are working on the design and delivery of AI factories globally, including a site in Europe that will be announced before the end of the year, according to a statement.

Brookfield is pushing to expand Europe's largest AI infrastructure cluster. In June, it announced plans to invest up to 95 billion Swedish crowns ($9.98 billion) to build an AI data center in Sweden and a 20 billion euro commitment for AI projects in France.

Fuel cells offer a cleaner alternative to traditional power by generating electricity through chemical reactions rather than combustion. Depending on the fuel, byproducts can include water and heat, making them more environmentally friendly.

[TITLE]Critics Fear Financial Titans Have Found Trojan Horse For ‘Climate Mandates’:
[TEXT]
Major global asset managers including BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America in a move that some industry insiders warn could harm consumers, raise electricity costs and advance a climate-driven energy agenda.

In recent months, Blackstone reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy utilities in New Mexico and Texas all while a BlackRock-led group won approval Friday to purchase a major utility in Minnesota. While BlackRock and other huge asset managers have distanced themselves from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment practices in recent years, some energy experts and consumer advocates that spoke to the Daily Caller News Foundation are concerned that buying up utilities may represent a new frontier of financial giants orchestrating “climate mandates.”

“BlackRock isn’t just influencing utilities anymore, they’re buying them. After years of ESG-driven coercion that pushed utilities to abandon reliable energy in favor of China-dependent renewables, BlackRock is now taking direct control. The result will be more of the same: higher costs, weaker grids, and millions in unpaid bills, all driven by the very climate mandates they lobbied for,” Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, told the DCNF. “Minnesotans should brace for more unreliable power, rising rates, and a media narrative that blames Trump for ending taxpayer-funded handouts instead of holding the woke politicians and Wall Street elites responsible for the crisis.” (RELATED: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’)

Electricity demand is on the rise after years of stagnancy as the artificial intelligence (AI) race ushers in the build out of power-hungry data centers. Utility costs are also spiking as demand takes off in a trend that dates back to the Biden administration.

Against this backdrop, private investment titans like BlackRock and Blackstone are reportedly moving to buy power utility companies and invest in data center expansions and startups.

Minnesota recently granted the BlackRock-led group known as Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) approval to buy one of the state’s major power utilities, Allete. GIP is also reportedly on the cusp of acquiring the major energy company, AES, according to sources familiar with the matter that spoke with Reuters. The Financial Times reported that the deal may be for $38 billion.

BlackRock referred the DCNF to Allete’s statement on regulators approving its partnership with GIP and declined to comment further for this story.

Allete’s statement notes that the impending partnership with the BlackRock-led group includes “guaranteed access to capital to fund ALLETE’s five-year plan for advancing transmission and renewable energy goals [and a] $50 million Clean Firm Technology Fund to support regional clean-energy projects and partnerships.”

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) renewed BlackRock’s ability to own up to 20% of utility voting shares in April, with former FERC Commissioner Mark Christie stating that BlackRock “pledged not to use its holdings to influence utility management” and that utilities need the access to capital.

Christie also warned in September 2024 that “this is an issue that deserves much greater scrutiny” and that “the influence that large shareholders, BlackRock or otherwise, can potentially exert across the consumer-serving utility industry should not be underestimated.”

Blackstone has reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy out the Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power Co. recently, according to The Associated Press. The asset management giant also secured a 19.9% stake in a Northern Indiana public utility for over $2 billion in January 2024.

“Blackstone’s sustainability strategy prioritizes accelerating decarbonization by investing in the energy transition and driving value accretive emissions reduction in our portfolio,” Blackstone’s 2024 sustainability report states. “We believe the transition to cleaner energy creates meaningful investment opportunities for private capital. For over a decade, we have pursued attractive investments in companies and assets that are part of the global energy transition as part of our broader energy investing strategy.”

Blackstone also announced on Sept. 15 that private equity funds affiliated with Blackstone Energy Transition Partners will acquire the Pennsylvania-based Hill Top Energy Center natural gas plant for almost $1 billion. The company also announced in July that funds managed by Blackstone Infrastructure and Blackstone Real Estate would invest over $25 billion to help build out Pennsylvania’s energy infrastructure to support the AI “revolution.”

“Renewable” energy goals and ESG investment tend to align with emissions-reduction targets, with some power companies, utilities and states that set goals to cut emissions striving to retire conventional energy sources like coal plants. Isaac added that companies like American Electric Power, in which BlackRock owns a significant stake, have been decommissioning coal plants and replacing them with intermittent sources like solar.

“What happens is when the wind stops blowing and the sun stops shining, then you have to ramp those generational assets back up, and that’s when price spikes happen,” Isaac said. (RELATED: ‘A Huge Win’: Woke ‘Cartel’ Of Financial Giants Dealt Death Blow 11 Days Before Trump Takes Office)

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance Greg Brown told the AP that the reason behind these buyouts are “very simple. Because there’s a lot of money to be made.”

Other experts devoted to consumer protection like Executive Director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild told the DCNF that investment companies like BlackRock stand to gain more than just a profit from these purchases.

“There is no world in which BlackRock’s ownership of American energy benefits ordinary American consumers,” Hild told the DCNF. “This is the same firm that proudly brought us the radical ESG rules and Net-Zero nonsense that forced all our energy bills to skyrocket. We wouldn’t have the scourge of woke capitalism without Larry Fink, who already controls nearly $13 trillion in assets and has been sued for violating anti-trust laws.”

ESG investors weigh a company by its social and environmental choices as well as its finances in a move that critics say bogs down businesses with new costs while doing little to combat climate change. One August 2023 InfluenceMap report showed that as Republicans at the state level and in Congress ramped up their opposition to ESG-focused practices, BlackRock and other major U.S. asset managers decreased their support for climate-related resolutions.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also said in June 2023 that he no will no longer use the term ESG because it has been “politicized,” less than a year after he noted that climbing energy prices are “accelerating” the green energy transition.

“BlackRock has backpedaled on its ESG messaging and its aggressive, unapologetic imposition of ESG on everything they touch. But the leopard hasn’t changed its spots,” President of the Heartland Institute James Taylor told the DCNF. “It still has the same management group with the same values, and it’s still doing whatever it can to impose ESG on everything it touches, in actuality, if not in name.”

Taylor argued that whether BlackRock buys or acquires a large stake of a utility, it “can now assert itself over legislatures in dictating energy policy.”

Notably, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals in May.

The lawsuit, backed by 11 state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock and multiple other asset managers used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby hurting consumers by causing the price of coal to climb.

The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson previously told the DCNF. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.”

Blackstone did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.

[TITLE]Is low Earth orbit getting too crowded? New study rings an alarm bell:
[TEXT]
Hundreds of satellites may soon be flying in orbital regions that are already too packed to allow safe and long-term operations, a new study suggests.

The study found that, while in 2019 only 0.2% of satellites in Earth orbit were forced to perform more than 10 collision-avoidance maneuvers per month, that percentage had risen sevenfold by early 2025, to 1.4%. That number might still seem low, but it means that some 340 satellites spend a lot of time dodging debris and other spacecraft.

Moreover, the satellite population is set to keep growing. While in 2019

Bengaluru: HCLTech , India's third largest IT services company, on Monday posted a flat second-quarter net profit, weighed by restructuring cost, even as revenue beat estimates by growing 10.7% year-on-year. Sequentially, profit rose 10.2% and revenue increased 5.2%.The company reported a net profit of ₹4,235 crore on revenue of ₹31,942 crore for the quarter ended September 30. Estimates in an ET poll of analysts ranged ₹4,136-4,491 crore for net profit and ₹31,252-31,603 crore for revenue.In a first for an Indian IT services company, the Noida-headquartered firm reported standalone quarterly revenue of $100 million (around ₹886 crore) from artificial intelligence-related services.While AI still accounts for under 3% of the total revenue, chief executive officer C Vijayakumar said he expects this to grow "because there are a lot of factory requirements, inferencing, silicon design and validation requirements". "So, I think all of this plays very strongly into our traditional strengths and a number of industry domain solutions that we have built."Vijayakumar added: "A lot of discretionary spend is happening on AI because customers have invested in solutions and capabilities, and they really want to make them work and scale within their enterprise and that's where a lot of our services (are). I see a strong growth potential for our advanced AI services."The company's revenue growth was backed by healthy engineering, research and development (ER&D) services, which expanded more than 13%. An over 7% increase in revenue from Europe and double-digit growth in the financial services and technology & services segments also boosted overall performance. The July-September period is a historically soft quarter for the company's software business, where revenue shrank 3.7% on-year in constant currency terms, which excludes the impact of currency movements."Overall, the demand environment is more or less similar to what we saw in the last quarter...The only area which is soft is the auto segment, which we feel is still struggling, but for all others, we feel good," the CEO further said.Supported by a 44% increase in deal bookings, HCLTech revised its services revenue growth guidance to 4-5% from the earlier 3-5%. It maintained the company-level revenue growth outlook of 3-5% in constant currency for the fiscal year ending March 2026.On similar terms, revenue in the past quarter rose 2.4% sequentially and 4.6% from a year earlier to $3.6 billion.Last week, HCLTech's largest rival, Tata Consultancy Services , kicked off the earnings season, reporting weaker-than-expected numbers with net profit falling 1.4% from a year earlier and 5.4% sequentially, also impacted by a one-time restructuring fee. The Tata Group firm laid off 1% of its workforce and reported its largest quarterly headcount drop of 19,755. Revenue grew 2.4% from a year earlier and 3.7% from the prior quarter.While the HCLTech management refused to directly call out any specific employee reduction, chief people officer Ramachandran Sundarajan said: "On the people's side is largely the skill-location mismatch, it's not a capacity reduction agenda. It's basically rebalancing the demand-supply when it comes to skills and locations. And some of it is also through the acquisitions that we have had over the years. It's small numbers spread out across multiple countries."Given the "strong performance" this quarter, the management said it plans to roll out the annual salary increments effective October. "We'll follow the same process as we did last year, in terms of how we go

[TITLE]China and the US are in a race for critical minerals. African countries need to make the rules:

Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are essential for modern technologies. They are key to industries ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy, defense, and aerospace systems.

The global demand for these minerals has been growing, as has the competition for them.

The supply and production of these minerals is largely concentrated in the global South. Most of the world's cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It produces almost three-quarters of the global cobalt output. Australia produces nearly half of the world's lithium. Chile accounts for another quarter of global lithium production, with China following at 18%.

China dominates the supply chain through massive investments in mining operations, particularly in Africa. It is responsible for refining 90% of rare earth elements and graphite, and 60%–70% of lithium and cobalt. The United States and European Union—long-term trading partners with African nations—have also adopted policies to secure access to Africa's resources.

The question is what African countries are doing to take advantage of this demand for these critical minerals, especially to drive their own development.

As development researchers we address this question in a special publication on the rising significance of critical minerals in Africa by the Indian Council of World Affairs. In another publication, we look at how emerging resource diplomacy may reinforce Africa's position in the global economy as a mere source of raw materials.

We recommend that African countries determine for themselves how to benefit from this global competition. This includes developing national strategies that emphasize local value addition and benefits. Also, national strategies should begin positioning African countries to gain from their resources beyond value addition.

The competition for Africa's critical minerals underscores the urgency of governance reforms and regional cooperation to transform mineral wealth into sustainable prosperity, avoiding another "resource curse."

The emerging 'New World Order'

A Chinese-led "New World Order" is emerging to counter the US-led Western influence. Eastern and global South countries demonstrate this shift through groupings like BRICS and South-South cooperation in technology and development. China has strengthened its influence in the global South through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.

Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious infrastructure project that connects continents by land and sea. Since then, over 200 agreements have been signed with over 150 countries and 30 international organizations. The initiative has expanded China's access to resources. This is often in exchange for infrastructure development that links mining regions to ports.

In Africa, China has invested heavily in mining and infrastructure. Its firms have spent

Beijing is stacking up its bargaining chips ahead of expected US-China talks when Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping visit South Korea's Gyeongju, announcing new export controls to tighten its grip over high-tech manufacturing supply chains. The two superpowers look to be struggling to move beyond their current tariff truce - a 90-day pause from August 11 that ends around November 9 - with officials from both sides continuing to meet to discuss issues predating September's Madrid summit, widely seen as a breakthrough for its Tiktok deal, which would see the US take a stake in one of China's most successful companies overseas.

How the trade war unfolded

On February 4, Trump implemented an additional 10% tariff on imports from China demanding Beijing do more to stop the flow of fentanyl precursors into the US China hit back with levies on some US commodities, farm equipment and automobiles, as well as probes into several American businesses.

In April, Trump singled out China for tariffs exceeding 100% following his sweeping "Liberation Day" duties, while pausing the reciprocal tariffs he placed on some other countries the White House also deemed to be trading unfairly with the US China retaliated, and over the next few weeks, both sides continued raising duties on each other's goods - peaking in May - before agreeing on May 12 to their first 90-day pause, which also saw US tariffs on Chinese goods fall from 145% to 30% and Chinese tariffs on American products drop from 125% to 10%.

There have been two more 90-day extensions since then, the latest agreed on August 11.

Critical minerals

On October 9, along with the addition of five new elements to its control list, Beijing unexpectedly announced export curbs on certain types of artificial diamonds and artificial graphite anode materials - other areas where China is the top producer - used in the production of semiconductors, quantum devices and advanced electronic systems.

Those curbs are set to take effect from November 8, just a day before the current truce expires. Xi and Trump are expected to meet on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit prior to that. China, the world's largest rare earths producer, has been tightening its control over these critical minerals, used in everything from lithium-ion batteries and semiconductors to aircraft engines, LED TVs, camera lenses, and much more.

Earlier controls announced in April caused shortages around the world, before a series of deals with Europe and the US eased the supply crunch.

Semiconductors

One reason China has tightened its control over critical minerals is the US has sought to limit its access to advanced semiconductors, critical for powering artificial intelligence models and applications.

US lawmakers say that without these restrictions, China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies faster than the US, enabling China to not only dominate the industry but also gain a military edge.

China has repeatedly called on the Trump administration to remove such curbs, accusing Washington of trying to contain its legitimate economic development.

Taiwan

Sensing that the Trump administration might be open to a deal that goes beyond traditional trade talks, there are reports that Beijing has renewed efforts to push Washington to alter the language the United States uses when discussing its position on Taiwanese independence.

China for a while now has wanted the US to say "we oppose Taiwan independence," rather than the current version, which is that the US "does not support" the independence of Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory.

Balanced trade

Beijing also demands that the Trump administration remove the additional tariffs and ease restrictions limiting Chinese firms' ability to invest in the world's No.1 economy - a major source of friction that has not been resolved.

Chinese companies' investments in the US face intense scrutiny over concerns about technology transfer, cybersecurity, and dual-use military application, particularly in AI, aerospace, biotech, semiconductors and telecommunications. On the flip side, US politicians have talked up a deal that would see China commit to buy more Boeing jets and raised the fact that the world's biggest buyer of soybeans has yet to book any US soybean cargoes.

But agricultural traders said China's announcement it would start collecting additional port fees from US ships from October 14 - a countermeasure against upcoming US port fees on Chinese ships - suggested the world's top buyer was not going to allow US agricultural imports anytime soon.

Fentanyl

Despite Trump's 20% fentanyl tariffs imposed in early 2025 to pressure China into curbing the flow of chemicals driving America's deadly opioid crisis, Beijing has yet to publicly unveil any dramatic move to meet his demands. But China in June did announce that it had added two precursors to its list of controlled chemicals and arrested or prosecuted some 2,000 people for drug-related money laundering.

The Trump administration has not budged.

[TEXT]
Amid these high-profile developments and the churn of short-term tactical deals, a more subtle but profoundly consequential trend is underway that deserves sustained attention from boardrooms, CEOs, investors, and policymakers: the expanding use of what is commonly referred to as "lawfare." Deliberate, strategic deployment of laws, compliance regimes, and regulatory norms are being increasingly used by China to assert power, shape global behavior, and entrench long-term advantages for itself and its companies around the world.

Bengaluru: HCLTech , India's third largest IT services company, on Monday posted a flat second-quarter net profit, weighed by restructuring cost, even as revenue beat estimates by growing 10.7% year-on-year. Sequentially, profit rose 10.2% and revenue increased 5.2%.The company reported a net profit of ₹4,235 crore on revenue of ₹31,942 crore for the quarter ended September 30. Estimates in an ET poll of analysts ranged ₹4,136-4,491 crore for net profit and ₹31,252-31,603 crore for revenue.In a first for an Indian IT services company, the Noida-headquartered firm reported standalone quarterly revenue of $100 million (around ₹886 crore) from artificial intelligence-related services.While AI still accounts for under 3% of the total revenue, chief executive officer C Vijayakumar said he expects this to grow "because there are a lot of factory requirements, inferencing, silicon design and validation requirements". "So, I think all of this plays very strongly into our traditional strengths and a number of industry domain solutions that we have built."Vijayakumar added: "A lot of discretionary spend is happening on AI because customers have invested in solutions and capabilities, and they really want to make them work and scale within their enterprise and that's where a lot of our services (are). I see a strong growth potential for our advanced AI services."The company's revenue growth was backed by healthy engineering, research and development (ER&D) services, which expanded more than 13%. An over 7% increase in revenue from Europe and double-digit growth in the financial services and technology & services segments also boosted overall performance. The July-September period is a historically soft quarter for the company's software business, where revenue shrank 3.7% on-year in constant currency terms, which excludes the impact of currency movements."Overall, the demand environment is more or less similar to what we saw in the last quarter...The only area which is soft is the auto segment, which we feel is still struggling, but for all others, we feel good," the CEO further said.Supported by a 44% increase in deal bookings, HCLTech revised its services revenue growth guidance to 4-5% from the earlier 3-5%. It maintained the company-level revenue growth outlook of 3-5% in constant currency for the fiscal year ending March 2026.On similar terms, revenue in the past quarter rose 2.4% sequentially and 4.6% from a year earlier to $3.6 billion.Last week, HCLTech's largest rival, Tata Consultancy Services , kicked off the earnings season, reporting weaker-than-expected numbers with net profit falling 1.4% from a year earlier and 5.4% sequentially, also impacted by a one-time restructuring fee. The Tata Group firm laid off 1% of its workforce and reported its largest quarterly headcount drop of 19,755. Revenue grew 2.4% from a year earlier and 3.7% from the prior quarter.While the HCLTech management refused to directly call out any specific employee reduction, chief people officer Ramachandran Sundarajan said: "On the people's side is largely the skill-location mismatch, it's not a capacity reduction agenda. It's basically rebalancing the demand-supply when it comes to skills and locations. And some of it is also through the acquisitions that we have had over the years. It's small numbers spread out across multiple countries."Given the "strong performance" this quarter, the management said it plans to roll out the annual salary increments effective October. "We'll follow the same process as we did last year, in terms of how we go

[TITLE]ET Startup Awards 2025: Minfy bets on AI and homegrown talent to push cloud growth:
[TEXT]
As cloud services firms expand their artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, Hyderabad-based Minfy Technologies is sprinting to keep pace with the wave.The firm plans to hire 180-200 employees – primarily AI engineers – by the end of this fiscal to support its growing pipeline of generative AI solutions across healthcare, retail, manufacturing and energy sectors, its cofounder Vivek Jain said. Its current payroll has around 600 employees.“I think more than the chips and the graphics processing units (GPUs), the biggest war is on talent,” Jain told ET, adding that talent is not going to be available at a low cost. “AI developers will be extremely expensive, and it is important to attract the talent to be able to have some major wins.”In a sector dominated by deep-pocketed players such as Tata Consultancy Services Infosys , and Wipro , and aggressive pricing models, Minfy’s rapid scale-up without any venture capital funding earned the company the Bootstrap Champ prize at the ET Startup Awards 2025 Founded in 2016 by brothers Vivek and Vijay Jain, Minfy helps its clients in healthcare, retail, manufacturing, energy, public services, banking and financial services sectors with cloud migration, modernisation, managed services, and digital transformation solutions.The firm grew its revenue from Rs 4-5 crore in its first year to an estimated Rs 913.3 crore in 2024-25.Minfy has started integrating AI into its internal operations, using AI-assisted tools for coding, testing, and automation, while developing client-facing generative AI solutions, many of which are already in production or pilot stages.Its projects range from forecasting models that optimise enterprise operations and telecom network centres that prevent service disruptions to AI-powered virtual try-ons in retail and automated medical coding in healthcare.The firm is setting up a 40,000-square feet Centre of Excellence in Hyderabad, which is set to go live in November. It will serve as the hub for building and testing its generative AI solutions, Jain said.“AI is moving at a rapid pace. We are trying to catch up with our internal competency. We are using a lot of AI-assisted developers for coding and for testing. We are also using a lot of third-party tools,” he said.For Minfy, navigating the fast-changing cloud services landscape has meant finding a balance between high growth and profitability, a feat few Indian IT services firms have managed to pull off. Over the past decade, the company has scaled its cloud transformation and managed services business while steadily expanding its financial performance.“The problem statement in the market was very clear that the digital boom was coming up and there were tons of applications and user computing that were needed,” Jain said. “This problem statement was so wide and clear that we thought that the existing solo and the private hosters were not able to meet the demand of consumers. This is where we thought of partnering with hyperscale giants like AWS.”He noted that India’s cloud solutions market is estimated at $6-7 billion, and Minfy contributes around $100 million, accounting for roughly 1% market share.Minfy’s trajectory has mirrored the broader enterprise cloud adoption wave across industries and geographies.Betting early on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company built its business model around cloud migration, modernisation, and managed operations.Over the years, it has diversified to include Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, expanding its reach to six regions, including India, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, the US, and Europe, catering to nearly 600 clients.Despite sustained interest from venture capitalists, private equity investors, and potential acquirers, Minfy has consciously remained bootstrapped.Its peers in India’s cloud services space such as BlazeClan (acquired by ITC Infotech) and Rean Cloud (acquired by Hitachi Vantara) have taken different routes.“We are still considering whether we might or might not (raise external funds) because of the technology being super expensive and with very few people. It is not democratised with the AGI (artificial general intelligence) and all the things that are happening,” Jain said. “With very few select large corporations, they have access to the GPUs and access to that kind of chips and technology. So having deep pockets would really help our narrative.”In 2024, Minfy entered into a $500-million multi-year strategic collaboration agreement with AWS to accelerate global cloud adoption and support enterprise clients transitioning to the cloud. Jain said more such partnerships are in the pipeline, though details remain under wraps.

[TITLE]Brookfield backs Bloom Energy with $5 billion for fuel cells to power AI data centers:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) -Brookfield Asset Management said on Monday it would invest up to $5 billion in Bloom Energy's fuel cell technology to power data centers, as companies seek cleaner energy to meet the needs of the artificial intelligence boom.

Shares of Bloom Energy surged 24.5% to hit a record high of $108.17 in morning trading.

Brookfield's first investment in its dedicated AI Infrastructure strategy taps into a shift to cleaner power sources such as nuclear, renewables and fuel cells as firms invest billions into building and expanding data centers amid the surge in demand for AI and cloud computing services.

Evercore ISI analysts in a note said Bloom's solid oxide fuel cells offer "reliable, scalable and clean on-site power".

"Hybrid power solutions" could become more important, addressing long lead times and regulatory hurdles for new generation capacity of the legacy grid, they said.

Bloom Energy has already deployed its fuel-cell technology to data centers, through partnerships with American Electric Power, Equinix and Oracle.

The companies are working on the design and delivery of AI factories globally, including a site in Europe that will be announced before the end of the year, according to a statement.

Brookfield is pushing to expand Europe's largest AI infrastructure cluster. In June, it announced plans to invest up to 95 billion Swedish crowns ($9.98 billion) to build an AI data center in Sweden and a 20 billion euro commitment for AI projects in France.

Fuel cells offer a cleaner alternative to traditional power by generating electricity through chemical reactions rather than combustion. Depending on the fuel, byproducts can include water and heat, making them more environmentally friendly.

Shares of Bloom Energy soared early Monday after it made a deal with Brookfield Asset Management to install fuel cells in artificial intelligence data centers. Brookfield will spend up to $5 billion to use Bloom Energy’s technology. This is Brookfield’s first investment in its strategy to support large AI data centers with both power and computing infrastructure.Bloom Energy’s fuel cells are “fuel-flexible” and can run on natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen, according to the company. Brookfield and Bloom will collaborate to design and build “AI factories” around the world, including a site in Europe that will be unveiled before the end of the year, as stated by CNBC report. Bloom energy stock surgeBloom Energy shares jumped almost 30% in early trading after the announcement. Bloom’s fuel cells provide onsite power and can be installed quickly because they don’t rely on a connection to the electric grid.The company has already installed hundreds of megawatts of fuel cells through deals with utilities like American Electric Power and data center developers such as Equinix and Oracle , according to Bloom Energy, as mentioned in the report by CNBC.AI data centers need off-grid powerThe AI industry’s data center plans are growing fast. For example, Nvidia and OpenAI recently announced a partnership to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, which equals the power used by New York City during peak summer.AI companies face a problem: the U.S. electric grid is old and often slow to provide extra power. Building new data centers could also raise electricity prices for homes. Deploying “behind-the-meter” power solutions (off the grid) is essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories, said Sikander Rashid, Brookfield’s global head of AI infrastructure KR Sridhar, Bloom Energy CEO, said, “AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC last week, “Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that.” Huang added that the AI industry will need off-grid power to quickly meet demand and protect consumers from rising electricity prices.FAQsBecause Bloom Energy made a $5 billion deal with Brookfield to supply fuel cells for AI data centers.They will build “AI factories” using Bloom’s fuel cells to provide fast, off-grid power for AI data centers worldwide.
