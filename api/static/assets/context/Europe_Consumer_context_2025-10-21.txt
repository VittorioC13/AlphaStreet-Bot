British heritage label Sunspel is accelerating its international retail footprint with a slate of strategic openings in Paris, which opened Thursday, and an upcoming flagship in Tokyo, which is slated for February.

[TITLE]Abercrombie Expands U.S. Fulfillment With New Ohio Distribution Hub:
[TEXT]
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) is one of the most oversold mid-cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds. On October 7, 2025, the company announced it will open a new distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, in partnership with Bleckmann, a European supply chain specialist. The facility is expected to be operational by summer 2026 and will serve as a key fulfillment hub for North American operations.

According to the company, the move is aimed at boosting shipping speed, reducing logistics costs, and supporting both store and digital order fulfillment.

The new site builds on an existing partnership between the two companies in the UK and the Netherlands, and marks Bleckmann’s formal entry into the U.S. market. Abercrombie has framed the expansion as part of its long-term supply chain modernization strategy, allowing it to scale with demand and tighten delivery times across channels.

The new Ohio center will add automated inventory handling and order processing capabilities, signaling a shift toward greater operational efficiency. If executed well, the investment could improve margins and responsiveness across the company’s U.S. retail and e-commerce footprint.

Founded in 1892 and headquartered in New Albany, Ohio, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) owns brands including Abercrombie, Hollister, abercrombie kids, and Gilly Hicks, with hundreds of stores worldwide and a growing omnichannel presence.

[TITLE]Tesla, Netflix set to report earnings as US-China trade fight turns 'unsustainable': What to watch this week:
[TEXT]
The stock market enters the third week of the government shutdown after a five-day run of market volatility shaped by US-China trade relations.

At the closing bell on Friday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC), tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all managed to eke out wins to cap a volatile week that saw swings for the major indexes each day.

This week, investors will get some clarity on the economic picture, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics set to publish the Consumer Price Index (CPI), one of most watched measures of inflation, on Friday after a delay from its originally planned release date of Oct. 15.

Figures ranging from import prices to retail sales to jobless claims are likely to remain missing from the calendar amid the ongoing government shutdown.

With the shutdown still in effect, the Federal Open Market Committee will also enter its blackout period ahead of the committee's October meeting, which is set to take place Oct. 28-29.

In the corporate sector, earnings season for the third quarter is properly underway after bank earnings this past week, and a packed roster of companies is set to report in the week ahead. Some of the week's biggest names include Magnificent Seven stock Tesla (TSLA), chipmaker Intel (INTC), streaming giant Netflix (NFLX), and Coca-Cola (KO), always a marker for retail consumption patterns.

This week will also see reports from the defense contracting majors in Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), along with several of the major telephone network operators, including T-Mobile (TMUS) and AT&T (T).

'Not sustainable'

After Beijing unveiled a sweeping series of new export controls that curtailed shipments of products with even trace amounts of a group of rare metals, President Trump took to Truth Social to threaten 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods before rolling that threat back.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US and China will hold talks later this week in Malaysia.

Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs

Rare earth stocks, one of the biggest winners of the past two weeks, gave up some of their gains as moves from Washington and Beijing swung investments up and down throughout the week.

A few days later, Trump made another post to Truth Social, this one labeling Beijing's cessation of US soybean purchases — a move that has been crushing the US agricultural sector — an "economically hostile act" and threatening that the US may stop buying Chinese cooking oil.

Then, when asked about a potential trade war, Trump told a reporter in the Oval Office that the US is "in one now" with China. Last week, Trump said his threats of high tariffs on Beijing are "not sustainable."

[TITLE]RBL Bank To Have Open Offer Before Emirates NBD Is Allotted Shares:
[TEXT]
Emirates NBD will invest $3 billion in RBL Bank Ltd., which will trigger an open offer, following which the Dubai-based bank will be allotted shares, according to Chief Executive Officer R Subramaniakumar.

The second largest bank of Dubai will buy a 60% stake in the Indian private bank through a preferential allotment. For the investment, up to 41.6 crore shares at Rs 280 apiece will get allotted to Emirates NBD on a preferential basis. An open offer is a consequence of preferential allotment, he said in the second-quarter conference call on Sunday.

The open offer will take place after all regulatory approvals. Preferential placement will be followed 15 days post open offer, he said.

Post the investment, RBL Bank's net worth will increase to Rs 42,000 crore, Subramaniakumar said. The deal will conclude in April, and after that, RBL Bank will be a listed entity of Emirates NBD.

The merger requires approval from the Reserve Bank of India, Securities Exchange Board of India, and Competition Commission of India, he said.

The fund infusion will likely support RBL Bank to scale the existing business. RBL Bank will continue to focus on low-cost retail deposits. The private bank is unlikely to compromise the core banking business, he said.

Subramaniakumar is also seeing rating upgrades in the upcoming time. The gap between the cost of funds for large private banks and RBL Bank Ltd. will narrow down over time.

According to him, the return on assets will expand materially given the large infusion of equity.

India allows 74% foreign investment in private banks, but limits shareholdings of any single foreign institution to 15% unless the regulator has approved.

The Reserve Bank of India has given informal approval for the deal, as per a Reuters report.

As per the agreement, post fund infusion, the current management will continue at the top level, according to the CEO. The board structure will be in the ratio of 50:50. Around 50% will be independent directors.

[TITLE]Denver-based women’s ski apparel brand Halfdays raises $10M:
[TEXT]
Halfdays is now sitting on a mountain of cash.

The Denver-based women’s ski apparel company announced a $10 million raise this month, bringing its lifetime total to $15 million. Apparel maker Kellwood Company led the raise, with participation from Dicks Sporting Goods Ventures and model Taylor Hill.

“This raise will allow us to fuel our growth trajectory: expanding our core winter and ski collections, continuing to grow into year-round trail and activewear, and investing in brick-and-mortar retail,” co-founder and CEO Ariana Ferwerda said in an email.

Ferwerda, who started the brand in 2020 alongside Karelle Golda and former Olympic skier Kiley McKinnon, said Halfdays’ collection will double in size next year to feature more versatile, all-year activewear. Bestsellers like the $395 Lawrence jacket, $295 Alessandra snowpant and $95 Sophia baselayer leggings will remain.

Ferwerda said powderhounds will also have more places to find Halfdays, with online fashion outfits Revolve and Shopbop joining existing retailers like Nordstrom, REI and Dick’s.

Halfdays will also grow its own store count after a successful Denver debut at 2609 Walnut St. in RiNo, which opened last December. Ferwerda said no additional ones are planned in Colorado, but Halfdays is exploring doing a pop-up shop in the mountains sometime this ski season.

Halfdays started as solely direct-to-consumer before testing the wholesale slopes in 2021, its second ski season. Last year, Ferwerda said, the company “decided to go all in” and tripled to 150 retail locations across North America.

This year, one-third of Halfdays’ projected $25 million in sales will come from that arm of the business. That total revenue is an 80% jump from 2024, Ferwerda said.

Halfdays raised its previous $5 million in 2021 and 2022, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

[TITLE]Altagamma’s Chairman Discusses the Ins and Outs of Luxury Amidst AI and Tariffs:
[TEXT]
As the values of brand, craftsmanship and the never-ending quest for experiences become more important with luxury shoppers, Altagamma is taking proactive measures to help its members stay current.

After a post-pandemic boom, the luxury market has cooled a bit in the past year or so. The personal luxury goods market dipped to 363 billion euros in 2024, a 2 percent decline compared to 2023, based on the annual Luxury Study, released by Bain & Co. and Fondazione Altagamma. That dip was partially caused by macroeconomic tensions, decreased Chinese demand, and a marked withdrawal by aspirational consumers, those spending less than 5,000 euros annually on luxury goods and services.

As chairman of that foundation, Matteo Lunelli has a bird’s-eye view of the factors that are impacting the Italian luxury goods sector and the 100-plus brands of excellence that are involved with the Made in Italy initiative.

During an interview Friday morning, he noted that the luxury market is still “far above” the market value and consumer consumption of 2019. While the very high end of the market is strong, the aspirational luxury market has weakened due to economic pressures. With shoppers more inclined to spend for a live experience than to purchase goods, they are investing in luxury hotels, “super fine dining,” luxury cruises, super-luxe yachts, private jets, and expensive sports cars, which continue to gain interest, Lunelli said.

With shoppers are also gravitating toward brands that align with their personal values, Altagamma abides by the idea that high-end products must be excellent in everything that they do, he said. That includes the creation of a product, how it is developed and the way that workers are treated. To that end, the organization has charted common values for members to abide by. With many Made in Italy companies intrinsically linked to their home communities such as Ferrari and Lamborghini in the “Motor Valley,” that can include research centers and schools.

Lunelli said, “That is the strongest element of sustainability. When you are linked to the community and the territory, then you feel even stronger

[TITLE]Why Galeries Lafayette’s India debut marks a luxury turning point:
[TEXT]
More than three years after announcing a partnership, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail is set to open the first Indian outpost of Galeries Lafayette, the iconic Parisian luxury department store chain.

Spread over two buildings and five floors in south Mumbai’s Fort area, the high street shopping store brand will offer more than 250 international luxury brands, two-thirds of which are coming to India for the first time. The store is expected to open its doors for shoppers in November.

Apart from top brands from Europe such as Dior and Chanel, Galeries Lafayette will retail well-known luxury brands from Japan and Korea including Commes des Garçons (Tokyo) and Joseon Beauty (Seoul). Parisian brand Hermès, which also has a standalone store in Fort, Mumbai, will sell its beauty products at Galeries Lafayette as well.

Galeries Lafayette and Aditya Birla Fashion are betting on the soaring demand for personal luxury goods in India, as the country mints more dollar millionaires. India added 39,000 dollar millionaires in 2024 taking the total to 917,000, according to the Swiss bank UBS's Global Wealth Report, 2025.

Internationally, Galeries Lafayette's competition includes Harrods of London, Bergdorf Goodman in the US, and Printemps, France, none of which have a presence in India.

India a key market

Galeries Lafayette gets 37 million visitors a year in our Paris store, and half of whom are international, CEO Arthur Lemoine told Mint in an interview. “Clearly, we see many Indians there already. We know India is a key and strategic market. Indian customers can shop abroad in Dubai, Singapore, and Paris. But they are also asking for and expect to consume locally."

Brokerage firm Kotak Securities this May said India's luxury market grew to $17.67 billion in 2024 and will hit $85 billion by 2030. Much of this growth, to be sure, comes from spending on jewellery, especially during wedding season, while the sale of luxury cars is also a fast-growing segment.

Galeries Lafayette will also open a store in Delhi, although the timeline is unclear.

As global luxury brands spread their retail footprint, Indians initially had access only to them, said Ashish Dikshit, managing director of Aditya Birla Fashion. “But in the last 5-7 years in particular, Indians have more confidence and have started to do more discovery, exploring more brands and looking for upcoming labels and designers."

To capture demand from upwardly mobile Indian consumers, Mumbai’s Galeries Lafayette is designed to offer a “ladder to luxury," noted R Sathyajit, CEO of International Brands for Aditya Birla Fashion. For instance, one floor of the Mumbai store is dedicated to bags and the basement to cosmetics and beauty products — categories that most Indians make their first luxury purchase in.

The “sweet spot" for these entry-level luxury purchases can include a ₹3,000 Chanel lipstick or a small luxury brand bag worth ₹20-30,000, going up to ₹80,000 to ₹1.5 lakh, Sathyajit added. Other offerings for those flirting with luxury shopping include a floor dedicated to unisex casual and streetwear fashion with brands such as Commes des Garçons and Les Yeux, where shoppers can pick up a T-shirt for ₹5-6,000 apiece and a pair of jeans starting ₹10,000 a pair.

Global luxe slows

While Reliance Industries Ltd’s Reliance Brands has dominated the business of franchising foreign luxury brands in India, Aditya Birla Fashion has been making inroads into the business. In fiscal 2025, the Reliance company reported revenue from operations of ₹2,337 crore, up 3.3% year on year.

Aditya Birla Fashion’s luxury division crossed ₹500 crore in revenue in FY25, per its annual report. This division includes the multi-brand store chain The Collective, along with franchises for westernwear luxury brands Ralph Lauren, Fred Perry, and Ted Baker among others.

In 2021, the company acquired a controlling stake in luxury label Sabyasachi for nearly ₹400 crore, following up with another deal for a controlling stake in rival luxury label Tarun Tahiliani in 2024. A year later, the company also acquired a controlling stake in designer label Masaba for ₹90 crore.

The global market for luxury has slowed down drastically since 2023 after years of growth more from increased prices rather than sales volumes, consulting firm McKinsey said in a report this January. Economic slowdown in Europe and China has hit sales for luxury biggies such as LVMH and Kering. (This week, LVMH reported a 1% jump in sales for the September quarter, though.)

In this scenario, India has emerged as a bright spot for luxury brands and retailers companies searching for a new, eager customer base to sell to.

“The real challenge in India is luxury supply, not demand," Anand Ramanathan, partner for the consumer industry practice at consulting firm Deloitte, told Mint. “Indians are already going abroad to buy. But luxury brands coming to India need an ecosystem – the right location, parking, mall space. There isn’t enough of that ecosystem just yet in India."

He pointed out that while DLF Emporio in Delhi and Phoenix Palladium and Jio World Plaza in Mumbai have become luxury shopping destinations, there is much more demand for luxury shopping in the top five to seven cities in India. For now, customers in these places have to make do with smaller outlets in five star hotels or shop abroad.

Besides, Ramanathan added, some malls such as the Phoenix Mall of Asia in Bengaluru that were initially positioned as a luxury destination changed over time opening up to non-luxury brands due to slow business.

[TITLE]Byte-Sized AI: Google Adds Shoes to User-Centric Virtual Try-On; NoFraud Acquires Yofi:
[TEXT]
Byte-Sized AI is a bi-weekly column that covers all things artificial intelligence—from startup funding, to newly inked partnerships, to just-launched, AI-powered capabilities from major retailers, software providers and supply chain players.

NoFraud acquires Yofi AI

NoFraud, which helps Shopify merchants and companies screen orders to prevent credit card fraud and unnecessary chargebacks, announced last week that it has acquired Yofi AI. The startup has developed systems to help brands and retailers, like JD Sports Canada, to identify abusive shopping patterns, stop fraudulent transactions and reward loyal, legitimate customers.

Yofi had backing from venture capital firms like Nyca Partners, Point72 Ventures and eBay Ventures. NoFraud said the acquisition will help it to extend its capabilities and help retailers and brands fight the issue of fraudulent returns.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Jordan Shamir, co-founder and CEO of Yofi AI, said fraud and theft continue to be major issues plaguing brands and retailers of all sizes.

“Policy abuse has become the single biggest threat to retail margins,” Shamir said in a statement. “It’s forcing merchants to absorb billions in unnecessary costs and putting loyal customer relationships at risk. We built Yofi AI to stop this head-on, and by joining NoFraud we can take that fight to scale—giving merchants the only platform that protects profits in real time.”

Yofi’s systems will be integrated into NoFraud ahead of the holiday season, the two companies said in the announcement.

Scott Gifis, CEO of NoFraud, said older technology solutions can’t provide merchants with an accessible, efficient way to track and mitigate the issues associated with fraud and malicious shopping. He’s hopeful that joining forces with Yofi will help companies bridge that gap.

“Together with Yofi AI, we’re taking a massive step forward to change how merchants manage risk,” Gifis said in a statement. “Legacy tools weren’t built for today’s realities. Our platform meets risk where it happens, in real time, protecting margins and helping merchants grow.”

Frasers links with Commercetools to power agentic shopping integrations

Frasers Group announced this week that it’s using a partnership with Commercetools as a way for some of its brands to participate in agentic commerce.

Frasers Group said the partnership is the first of its kind in Europe and will touch three of its brands—Sports Direct, Flannels and Frasers. Those brands will use Commercetools’ agentic commerce suite to help shoppers discover Frasers’ products through publicly available large language models (LLMs).

David Clark, chief customer officer at Frasers Group, said the partnership will help the brands involved to meet consumers where they are today, while also anticipating where they’re headed next.

“The digital customer ecosystem is evolving faster than ever before, and so are customers’ expectations,” Clark said in a statement. “With this partnership, Frasers Group is now at the forefront of this evolution to deliver enhanced customer experiences across ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity—including native checkout in ChatGPT—across Sports Direct, Flannels and Frasers. This marks a shift in our digital capabilities, delivering an even more intuitive and personalised shopping experience for our consumers.”

The announcement comes on the heels of retail giant Walmart announcing that it had partnered with OpenAI to make items available for purchase directly in ChatGPT. The companies did not disclose when Walmart items would be available via Instant Checkout, but items on Etsy are actively able to be purchased on the ChatGPT platform. OpenAI announced that “thousands” of Shopify merchants will also be available in the near future, with Vuori and Skims among them.

Andrew Burton, CEO of Commercetools, said Frasers Group’s integration comes at a critical turning point for the fashion, apparel and retail industries.

“The future of commerce is agentic, and it’s arriving faster than most retailers realize,” Burton said in a statement. “Frasers Group understands that when customers start delegating shopping to agents or doing their shopping through an LLM, the retailers who will win will be those ready to deliver seamless, trusted, consistent experiences through those agents,” Burton said in a statement.

Google extends virtual try-on to shoes

Google announced last week that it has expanded its generative AI-powered virtual try-on tool, which allows consumers to see items on a virtual version of their own likeness, to include shoes.

The company’s virtual try-on tool, which it expanded a few months ago, allows users to see how a single item of clothing might look on their own body. To test out the tool, users upload a full-body photo of themselves.

Google said it uses “state-of-the-art AI accurately perceives shapes and depths, preserving those subtleties when showing you what something would look like on you.”

Unlike some other companies, Google’s try-on experience is limited to one item at a time. So, for instance, if a consumer is checking out a pair of ASOS heels, they can’t also put a shirt of their choice on their digital avatar.

The experience seems like another play at customization as Big Tech companies continue to advance their AI-enabled offerings and consumers change their shopping patterns.

First Insight launches retail-focused conversational AI co-pilot

First Insight announced this week that it’s allowing “major retailers” to beta test a new conversational AI co-pilot it calls Ellis.

First Insight did not disclose which of its clients have started participating in the beta test, but it partners with companies like Under Armour, Kohl’s, Francesca’s and Marks & Spencer.

Ellis is meant to help brands and retailers scenario plan, leveraging predictive analytics and natural language processing (NLP) to provide real-time insights that can shorten the decisioning process.

First Insight said Ellis can leverage internal data to help planners, merchandisers and other retail professionals with ensuring their assortments match consumers’ interests and expectations; understanding the best price point for specific items; forecasting demand; aligning marketing spends and campaigns with selling goals; compressing time to market and more.

First Insight is testing the tool as retailers head into the holiday season, which is one of the sector’s most critical timeframes of the calendar year. That’s especially true as the macroeconomic environment fluctuates and holiday spending among some generations, particularly Gen Z, is expected to decline.

Greg Petro, CEO of First Insight, said the tool will help brands and retailers bring data into many of the decisions they make, which can enrich decisioning and provide sound reasoning for their actions, rather than making decisions using gut feeling and historical spending patterns alone.

“Retail doesn’t win on intuition anymore,” Petro said in a statement. “Ellis turns signals into decisions—on product, price and promotions—at the moment retailers need them most and with a competitive understanding never before available. It’s about speed with confidence: protecting margins, finding growth and staying in step with customers as they shift.”
