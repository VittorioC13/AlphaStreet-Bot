[TITLE]Enfabrica’s ACF-S and EMFASYS architecture could change how AI clusters process tens of thousands of chips efficiently:
[TEXT]
Nvidia’s acquisition brings Enfabrica engineers directly into its AI ecosystem

EMFASYS chassis pools up to 18TB of memory for GPU clusters

Elastic memory fabric frees HBM for time-sensitive AI tasks efficiently

Nvidia’s decision to spend more than $900 million on Enfabrica was something of a surprise, especially as it came alongside a separate $5 billion investment in Intel.

According to ServeTheHome, “Enfabrica has the coolest technology,” likely because of its unique approach to solving one of AI’s largest scaling problems: tying tens of thousands of computing chips together so they can operate as a single system without wasting resources.

This deal suggests Nvidia believes solving interconnect bottlenecks is just as critical as securing chip production capacity.

A unique approach to data fabrics

Enfabrica’s Accelerated Compute Fabric Switch (ACF-S) architecture was built with PCIe lanes on one side and high-speed networking on the other.

Its ACF-S “Millennium” device is a 3.2Tbps network chip with 128 PCIe lanes that can connect GPUs, NICs, and other devices while maintaining flexibility.

The company’s design allows data to move between ports or across the chip with minimal latency, bridging Ethernet and PCIe/CXL technologies.

For AI clusters, this means higher use and fewer idle GPUs waiting for data, which translates into better return on investment for costly hardware.

[TEXT]
Kodiak AI, Inc. is expected to commence trading on Nasdaq under ticker symbols “KDK” and “KDKRW” on September 25, 2025

Kodiak’s ~$2.5 billion valuation is among the largest operating company de-SPAC transactions of 2025 to date

This milestone, together with Kodiak’s track record in deploying revenue generating autonomous technology, underscores its leadership in the autonomous vehicle sector

Kodiak and Ares Acquisition Corporation II have raised over $275 million before expenses to help Kodiak accelerate its go-to-market strategy

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. and NEW YORK, Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kodiak AI, Inc. (“ Kodiak ” or the “ Company ”), a leading provider of AI-powered autonomous vehicle technology, today announced that Kodiak Robotics, Inc. successfully completed its business combination with Ares Acquisition Corporation II (NYSE: AACT) (“ AACT ”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company. The business combination was approved by AACT shareholders on September 23, 2025. In connection with the closing, AACT was renamed Kodiak AI, Inc. Kodiak AI, Inc.’s common stock and public warrants are expected to begin trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the “ Nasdaq ”) on September 25, 2025 under the ticker symbols “KDK” and “KDKRW,” respectively.

In connection with its business combination with AACT, Kodiak received more than $212.5 million from certain institutional investors, including $145 million in PIPE funding and approximately $62.9 million in trust cash from AACT, before expenses.

“The transportation industry faces growing challenges, including safety risks, rising costs, and driver shortages,” said Don Burnette, Founder and CEO of Kodiak. “Going public with the support of our partners at AACT marks an important step in Kodiak’s journey to help transform how freight moves by providing our driverless solution to customers. The Kodiak Driver is already on the road, safely and reliably delivering freight every day for paying customers without a human in the cab. Our driverless operations show that autonomy is no longer a future promise but a reality today. Thanks to our Kodiak team members for their extraordinary dedication in helping us achieve this milestone, and I am eager to begin our next chapter as a public company with the support of our new and existing investors.”

Kodiak’s next-generation AI-powered autonomous driving system, the Kodiak Driver, is designed to help address critical challenges in the trucking industry and the public sector, including a significant labor shortage, rising costs, and demand for shorter delivery timelines. The Kodiak Driver integrates learnings from real-world experience across commercial trucking and public sector applications to continuously improve AI models and increase reliability and efficiency in a wide range of environments. With approximately 3 million on-road autonomous miles and over 3,000 paid driverless hours logged to date, the Kodiak Driver is already delivering value to customers. The Company has already achieved significant commercial milestones:

In 2024, Kodiak became the first company to announce delivery of driverless semi-trucks to a paying customer, Atlas Energy Solutions (NYSE: AESI), which in 2025 placed an initial order of 100 trucks.

Today, Atlas owns and operates a fleet of eight Kodiak Driver-powered driverless trucks, operating day and night, up to 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Kodiak has delivered over 7,300 loads for on-highway customers including Maersk, IKEA, J.B. Hunt, Bridgestone, C.R. England, and more.

“When we launched AACT, we set out to find a differentiated business primed for commercial growth and well-positioned to enter the public markets,” said Allyson Satin, Chief Operating Officer of AACT and Partner at Ares Management Corporation (“ Ares ”). “Kodiak has distinguished itself through its innovative technology, which is already integrated into customer fleets and utilized for daily, revenue-generating driverless freight operations. We are confident in Don and his team as they continue to execute on their strategy to scale as a public company, improve the safety and efficiency of the freight industry and create long-term value for investors. On behalf of AACT and Ares, I want to congratulate the entire Kodiak organization, and we look forward to our continued partnership.”

By accessing the public markets through its combination with AACT, the Company is well-positioned to scale its commercialization of the Kodiak Driver. The Company is leveraging both public capital and strategic investor alignment to capture a share of the estimated $4+ trillion global freight market. Kodiak has partnered with Roush Industries, Inc., a leading vehicle upfitter, to scale its production of autonomous trucks equipped with the Kodiak Driver. Roush delivered its first Kodiak Driver-powered truck in August 2025.

The Kodiak Driver combines advanced AI-powered software with a modular hardware system designed to integrate seamlessly into customers’ existing fleets. The platform delivers scalable, safe, and efficient autonomous trucking by leveraging learnings from millions of real-world miles across every Kodiak Driver-powered vehicle, ensuring that advancements made by one truck benefit the entire fleet. Kodiak offers its technology through a Driver-as-a-Service model, in which customers pay a per-mile or per-vehicle licensing fee to access driverless operations and ongoing support.

Investor Celebration and Bell-Ringing Ceremony

To celebrate its expected public market debut on September 25, 2025, Kodiak will display a Kodiak Driver-powered truck in Times Square, and ring the Nasdaq opening bell at 9:30 a.m. ET. Executives, board members, and key investors will gather to mark this milestone. The ceremony can be streamed live and replayed on the Nasdaq website at https://www.nasdaq.com/marketsite/bell-ringing-ceremony .

[TITLE]Oracle stock rises as White House names software giant in TikTok deal; company announces CEO shake-up:
[TEXT]
Oracle (ORCL) stock rose more than 6% Monday as the White House confirmed that the software giant is part of a consortium of investors that will control TikTok's US operations. The company also separately announced a CEO shake-up.

A senior White House official on Monday morning confirmed the details of the TikTok deal, which will move the social media app's US operations into a new joint venture based in the United States and controlled by American investors, who will have a majority of the new company's ownership stake and of its board seats.

Oracle and Venture Private Equity firm Silver Lake are set to lead the new venture, with China-based tech giant ByteDance holding a less than 20% equity stake.

The venture will receive a copy of TikTok's valuable content recommendation algorithm, which will be "fully inspected" and "retrained" by Oracle — the group's security provider — on US user data. The algorithm will be regularly inspected by US government officials.

"We feel [this] meets every security requirement that we need for the algorithm to make sure it's behaving appropriately," a senior White House official said.

Trump is set to sign an executive order later this week declaring that the terms of the new TikTok agreement meet America's national security needs. The president has touted the deal repeatedly and said Sunday that the final list of investors would be "really great people, very prominent people."

TikTok, the short-form video app owned by ByteDance, faced a US ban due to national security concerns unless it divested its ownership to a US- or US-allied country by Dec. 16. Congress passed a law effectively banning TikTok in 2024 under former President Joe Biden, and Trump promised to "save" the app on his campaign trail despite originally trying to ban TikTok in his first term. The US president extended the deadline for TikTok to divest its ownership multiple times as the app featured in high-stakes trade talks between the US and China.

The White House official said the US government has no plans to take equity, a "golden share," or a board seat — as it has with US Steel and Intel — though it might charge a fee for facilitating the deal.

Multiple outlets had reported previously that Oracle would be part of a consortium of investors that would control TikTok's US operations.

Analysts have told Yahoo Finance that Oracle's involvement in such a deal is seen as a positive for the software company because it would expand its partnership with TikTok. Oracle has worked with TikTok to store the app's American user data since 2022, and that ongoing deal accounted for 5% of the revenue seen by its booming cloud business, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), in its 2025 fiscal year, Morningstar analyst Luke Yang estimated.

[TITLE]SoftBank, Ark Invest Among Potential Investors In Tether’s $15 Billion Funding Round:
[TEXT]
The industry’s largest stablecoin issuer, Tether (USDT), is reportedly in discussions with a series of leading firms including SoftBank Group and Ark Investment Management, for a significant funding round aimed at raising between $15 billion and $20 billion.

This capital influx could potentially value the company at an astonishing $500 billion. Bloomberg News first reported these developments, indicating that Tether is exploring private placement opportunities to solidify its position in the market.

SoftBank And Ark Invest’s Potential Involvement

Per the report, the involvement of SoftBank and Ark could significantly enhance Tether’s credibility in the eyes of mainstream investors, particularly as the company seeks to overcome previous scrutiny regarding its role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Amidst this search for funding, Tether is also expanding its investment horizons beyond digital assets, venturing into sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI), telecommunications, cloud computing, and real estate.

Related Reading

Adding to the momentum, Tether recently appointed Bo Hines, a former advisor to President Trump on cryptocurrency matters, as CEO of its US division.

This move aligns with Tether’s vision to establish a new operation in the US, adhering to the new regulatory environment, particularly following the introduction of a new dollar-pegged cryptocurrency aimed at businesses and institutions, dubbed “USAT.”

Tether And US Regulatory Standards

As NewsBTC reported recently, the new token adheres to the regulatory framework established by the GENIUS Act, the first stablecoin legislation signed into law by President Trump, highlighting Tether’s focus on aligning with US regulatory standards.

Related Reading

Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, noted that the firm’s USDT stablecoin serves as a crucial financial tool for millions in emerging markets, showcasing how digital assets can foster trust, resilience, and financial freedom on a global scale.

[TITLE]Raymond James Considers AT&T (T) a Top Large-Cap Total Return Opportunity:
[TEXT]
AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is one of the best value stocks in Goldman Sachs’ portfolio. On September 18, Frank Louthan, an analyst at Raymond James, raised the price target on the stock from $31 to $33 and maintained his Buy rating.

The analyst cited three metrics that are particularly tracked for telecommunication companies. These three metrics are Wireless post-paid subscriber growth, EPS, and free cash flow growth. According to his analysis, AT&T is executing its strategy effectively and should be able to perform well on these metrics. For the next 12 months, Louthan also called AT&T its top large-cap total return opportunity.

Telecom stocks are generally supported by stable wireless demand, disciplined capital allocation, and consistent cash generation that underpins dividends and debt reduction. A couple of days before Louthan, JPMorgan analyst Sebastiano Petti had commended AT&T’s capital return strategy, including $20 billion in share repurchases till 2027, as one of the factors to support his Buy rating. Petti also believes that the company will gain share in the convergence market with the help of its recent acquisitions of Lumen’s consumer fiber business and spectrum from EchoStar.

AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is a major U.S. telecommunications and media company offering wireless, broadband, and fiber services to millions of customers.

While we acknowledge the potential of T as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you’re looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

ZDNET's key takeaways

AI agents can reduce service costs by more than 20%.

Service leaders are investing in tech and data integration.

Only 46% of service reps' time is spent engaging customers.

The 2025 State of Service report from Salesforce found that four out of every five service leaders say AI agent investment is essential to meeting business demands.

Leaders expect AI agents to boost prior AI-enabled outcomes and are backing that expectation with investment.

Also: Only 11% of business leaders see AI leading to major job cuts - for now
