[TITLE]OpenAI strengthens Sora 2 guardrails after actor Bryan Cranston raises alarm:
[TEXT]
OpenAI said it is cracking down on unauthorized content following outcry over Sora 2’s ability to replicate likenesses and copyrighted material without permission.

And public figures might have actor Bryan Cranston to thank for that.

During the Sept. 30 launch of Sora 2, the newest version of OpenAI’s advanced text-to-video model, the company said it would prohibit users from replicating real people’s likenesses without that person explicitly opting in through a “cameo” feature.

Despite this stated policy, videos of Cranston, who is best known for his role as Walter White in “Breaking Bad,” quickly started appearing on the Sora app alongside AI-generated videos of other celebrities, including deceased figures like Michael Jackson and copyrighted characters like Ronald McDonald.

Cranston subsequently raised the issue with SAG-AFTRA, the union representing more than 150,000 film and TV performers, which has resulted in a collaborative effort with OpenAI and several talent agencies to “ensure voice and likeness protections in Sora 2,” the companies said in a joint statement posted to X on Monday.

The statement said OpenAI has strengthened its original guardrails to ensure this type of content no longer slips through. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noted that the company "is deeply committed to protecting performers from the misappropriation of their voice and likeness."

The news comes as Hollywood creatives continue to grapple with the rapid advancements of artificial intelligence. Although many in Hollywood have secretly embraced AI tools in recent years, tensions between entertainment industry professionals and AI developers have remained high as artists express concern about the potential for such tools to steal their likenesses and take their labor.

SAG-AFTRA’s attempt last year to funnel some compensation toward voice actors by striking a licensing deal with an AI company also faced backlash from some in the industry who opposed such cooperation altogether.

Before signing onto Monday’s statement, the talent agency CAA had slammed OpenAI for “expos[ing] our clients and their intellectual property to significant risk” by allowing Sora 2 users to generate videos containing copyrighted IP, such of depictions of famous fictional and animated characters.

Cranston also said in the post that he had brought up his concerns with Sora 2 to SAG-AFTRA after feeling "deeply concerned not just for myself, but for all performers whose work and identity can be misused in this way.”

In the first few weeks after launch, videos of Sora-watermarked clips featuring copyrighted characters such as Spongebob Squarements, Pikachu and Mario flooded the internet. Prior to launch, The Wall Street Journal had reported that Sora 2 would let users generate material protected by copyright unless the copyright holders opted out of having their work appear.

Now, however, requests to generate such clips on the Sora app return an error message stating that the prompt “may violate our guardrails” concerning “third-party likeness” or “similarity to third-party content.”

OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it has changed its policy around copyrighted content.

The joint statement also expresses support for the NO FAKES Act, which aims to hold individuals, companies and platforms liable for producing or hosting unauthorized deepfakes. The bill, which was introduced in the Senate in April, has not moved forward in Congress.

"We were an early supporter of the NO FAKES Act when it was introduced last year, and will always stand behind the rights of performers," Altman wrote in Monday's statement.

Meanwhile, Altman is among a few prominent figures who have drawn intrigue online by embracing user-made deepfakes of themselves.

While touting Sora 2’s abilities, Altman appeared eager to let people generate videos of him sticking his head out of a toilet, meowing in a cat suit or even shoplifting at a Target — something that stirred additional concern over the ability for Sora 2 to generate realistic but fake surveillance footage.

Boxer and YouTuber Jake Paul has also been the subject of a slew of fake videos depicting him coming out as gay, giving makeup tutorials or dancing in a ballerina outfit. Paul, an OpenAI investor, has poked fun at the videos and has continued to allow others to cameo him on the Sora app, crediting the team behind it for "making the internet fun again."

SAG-AFTRA President Sean Astin on Monday commended OpenAI for this opt-in protocol.

“Bryan Cranston is one of countless performers whose voice and likeness are in danger of massive misappropriation by replication technology,” Astin said in the statement. “Bryan did the right thing by communicating with his union and his professional representatives to have the matter addressed. This particular case has a positive resolution.”

Cranston also expressed optimism in his statement Monday, saying he’s “grateful to OpenAI for its policy and for improving its guardrails, and hope that they and all of the companies involved in this work, respect our personal and professional right to manage replication of our voice and likeness.”

[TITLE]New blueprint for AI regulation could speed up planning approvals, slash NHS waiting times, and drive growth and public trust:
[TEXT]
AI Growth Labs will unlock new ways to accelerate innovation and cut bureaucracy in a safe environment

Growth Labs will unlock new ways to accelerate innovation and cut bureaucracy in a safe environment More new homes, better outcomes for patients, and world-leading innovations for professional services among potential wins for the public

This new approach to regulation will help drive forward growth and national renewal under the government’s Plan for Change

More new homes, better outcomes for patients, and world-leading innovations are among the benefits people can expect to see from a new blueprint for AI regulation being announced today, as the government slashes bureaucracy and ramps up the safe adoption of AI to unlock its full potential.

At the Times Tech Summit today (21st October), the Technology Secretary will announce plans to look at how companies and innovators can test new AI products in real-world conditions, with some rules and regulations temporarily relaxed under strict supervision.

Known as sandboxes, individual regulations are temporarily switched off or tweaked for a limited period of time in safe, controlled testing environments. They would initially be set up for key sectors of the economy like healthcare, professional services, transport, and the use of robotics in advanced manufacturing, to accelerate the responsible development and deployment of AI products.

The announcement comes as the Chancellor also details progress made towards delivering on the government’s vision for a regulatory system that better supports growth and innovation. At today’s Regional Investment Summit, the Chancellor will announce a range of pro-growth reforms that will help deliver that vision set out March’s Regulation Action Plan, including a plan to save businesses across the country nearly £6 billion a year by 2029 by cracking down on pointless admin tasks.

AI applications hold the potential to make the lives of citizens better, faster. The AI Growth Lab will pilot responsible AI which can otherwise be held back by certain regulation, and generate real-world evidence for the impact they can deliver. This will ramp up adoption of AI and deliver opportunities for people across the country, cutting bureaucracy that can choke innovation and supporting businesses to flourish to deliver tangible national renewal.

For example, a testing ground focused on building AI tools could support health workers deliver better patient care on an accelerated timeline. This would also help reduce NHS waiting lists and time demands on frontline NHS staff, as well as ensure that public services are working around the lives of the British public.

Currently, a typical housing development application racks up 4,000 pages of documentation and takes as long as 18 months from submission to approval. By reviewing regulations to explore how AI could support officials, those times could be slashed – speeding up decision making and putting the government’s plans to build 1.5 million new homes by the end of the current Parliament in the fast lane.

Close working between businesses and regulators are already delivering transformations for the public. A sandbox led by the Information Commissioner’s Office has supported age verification company Yoti to fine tune their age estimation technology to help keep young people safe online, while another trial has helped FlyingBinary to develop online services which support mental health patients.

Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said:

To deliver national renewal, we need to overhaul the old approaches which have stifled enterprise and held back our innovators. We want to remove the needless red tape that slows progress so we can drive growth and modernise the public services people rely on every day. This isn’t

[TITLE]Servers, software and data: how the cloud powers the web:
[TEXT]
Inside the cloud: data centres like this power the global internet - Copyright AFP Pablo PORCIUNCULA

Luca MATTEUCCI

The outage that hit the world’s leading cloud provider Amazon Web Services on Monday has highlighted global reliance on the technology, which offers businesses on-demand IT resources without heavy investment in expensive server farms.

In its most widespread form, the so-called “public” cloud relies on shared data centres, where clients hire IT capacity. The “private” cloud,” on the other hand, consists of dedicated machines reserved for a single company.

The United States dominates the global market for cloud computing.

AWS held 30 percent of the market share in the second quarter of this year, followed by Microsoft Azure (20 percent) and Google Cloud (13 percent), according to the Synergy Research Group.

These three firms have been dubbed “The Big Three.”

The AWS outage made part of the global internet and applications inaccessible for several hours on Monday, preventing millions of people from logging on to sites such as Snapchat, Fortnite, Airbnb and Reddit.

Other players, such as the US firms Oracle, IBM, Salesforce or Akamai, as well as Chinese giants Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei, share parts of a rapidly growing market, with significant barriers to entry.

In Europe, France’s OVHcloud is one of the main providers.

In 2023, 43 percent of businesses in the European Union used cloud services, mainly for email, file storage and office or cybersecurity software.

Adoption varies by size: 78 percent of large companies with more than 250 employees use the cloud compared to 42 percent of small businesses (10-49 staff), according to a study of 161,000 companies published by Eurostat.

– Foreign giants –

There are three distinct major models of cloud services. In all cases, providers handle the installation of services, storage drive and network connections in data centres across the world, which consume huge amounts of energy daily.

The most popular model — Software as a Service or SaaS — allows the direct use of online apps such as Gmail, Zoom, Teams or Slack.

In 2023, 96 percent of EU cloud client companies bought at least one SaaS service

In the case of Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS, businesses hire resources with only minimal pre-configured settings to install their own software.

The third — Platform as a Service of PaaS — is an intermediate model, where the client can outsource not only the management of the infrastructure but also part of the software that runs their apps.

PaaS is the least adopted model in the EU, with 26 percent of cloud client companies using it.

Despite the growth in the European market, local providers have seen their share of the market shrink in recent years and captured by foreign giants known as “hyperscalers.”

Hyperscalers are able to finance the construction of ever more data centres, even if the return on investment takes time.

Significant amounts are at stake as the construction of large data centres can exceed a billion dollars.

[TITLE]What’s up with… Vodafone, T-Mobile US, Proximus:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Vodafone Group and partner Vodafone Ukraine are building a subsea cable in the Black Sea to link Ukraine with Bulgaria, Turkey and Georgia; T-Mobile US is looking to capitalise on its nationwide 5G-Advanced rollout with a ‘private network-like’ service offering; Iliad’s owner Xavier Niel is keen to increase his influence over Belgium’s national operator Proximus, it seems; and much more!

The Vodafone Group and Vodafone Ukraine – which is not part of the Vodafone Group, despite the name – are to invest €100m in the deployment of a new high-capacity submarine cable system, dubbed Kardesa, across the Black Sea. It will connect Bulgaria, Georgia, Turkey and Ukraine. The claim is that Kardesa, which is set to boast 500 TBit/s of data capacity, will help improve the diversity of digital routes across the region and “create a modern digital corridor between Europe and Asia”. The first landing for the new festoon will be in Bulgaria in 2027 with subsequent landings in Turkey, then Georgia and then Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, work on the new system in war-torn Ukraine will only take place in “internationally recognised safe zones”. London, UK-based subsea networks specialist Xtera will design and deliver the €100m turnkey project. While there is a lot of excitement currently

[TITLE]Du racks up 1 Tbps Middle East milestone:
[TEXT]
In a “landmark for the communications industry” in the region, UAE-based operator Du has revealed an achievement of 1 Tbps peak traffic through its datamena ecosystem platform based on the DE-CIX Internet Exchange (IX) in the Middle East.

The operator said that the record-breaking performance strengthens its position as a leader in regional interconnection, offering enhanced speed, reduced latency and improved digital experiences across the UAE and wider Middle East. It said that, together with DE-CIX, this milestone was crucial to providing robust and resilient interconnection solutions, which it regards essential for entities in key sectors seeking secure, low-latency connections for their digital transformation initiatives.

According to Du chief executive officer Fahad Al Hassawi, the record-setting performance of UAE-IX marks a “pivotal” moment for the digitisation of the Middle East: “The milestone of 1 Tbit/s is a significant achievement in our mission to build a future-forward digital ecosystem in the UAE.

“The sustained investment in infrastructure and technology has positioned UAE-IX powered by DE-CIX as the foundation for the country’s digital transformation. It also reflects our journey to excellence and our strategic foresight in catering to the networking demands of tomorrow.”

H E Engineer Majed Sultan Al Mesmar, director general of the UAE regulatory authority Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA), added: “This traffic milestone is a clear demonstration of the success of UAE-IX powered by DE-CIX and the important role it plays in the digital ecosystem.

“By enabling faster, more resilient and cost-efficient interconnection, the IX ensures that data flows seamlessly between networks, supports innovation and enhances the overall online experience for businesses and communities alike.”

DE-CIX offers interconnection services in 60 locations in Europe, Africa, North and South America, the Middle East and Asia. Accessible from datacentres in more than 600 cities worldwide, it connects network operators (carriers), internet service providers (ISPs), content providers and enterprise networks from more than 100 countries, and offers peering, cloud and other interconnection services.

With more than 110 connected networks and over 6 terabits of aggregated capacity, UAE-IX powered by DE-CIX is the first IX in the Middle East to reach 1 Tbps peak traffic, driven solely by customer traffic and, said its owner, reflecting its commitment to innovation and scalability.

In Dubai, DE-CIX operates UAE-IX under its DE-CIX as a Service (DaaS) model, which provides comprehensive services – including installation, maintenance and marketing support – to enable partners to establish their fully managed Internet Exchange and interconnection platforms.

DE-CIX added that its UAE IX is the largest of its kind in the region, providing a neutral and resilient interconnection ecosystem that brings together global carriers, cloud providers, enterprises and content platforms. By keeping regional internet traffic local, DE-CIX said that the UAE-IX “significantly” reduces latency, enhances performance and improves the digital experience for millions of users across the UAE and the wider Middle East.

It said that enterprises in the region using the exchange could benefit from a broad suite of interconnection services including peering, cloud exchange, cloud routing and advanced security features such as blackholing for DDoS mitigation. DE-CIX insists these capabilities make UAE-IX a critical digital hub, empowering businesses and service providers to scale seamlessly, optimise costs and deliver cutting-edge services to their customers.

[TITLE]Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market to 2030 Featuring Saudi Telecom Co, Mobily, Zain, Integrated Telecom Co, GO Telecom, Bayanat Al Oula, Detecon Al Saudia, and NourNet:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market, By Region, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market was valued at USD 18.72 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 24.05 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.26%. The Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services market encompasses a broad range of services including mobile voice and data, fixed-line broadband, satellite communication, and enterprise network solutions.

These services are delivered by key national operators such as STC, Zain KSA, and Mobily, and are vital to enabling both consumer connectivity and business operations across the Kingdom. With the highest population in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Saudi Arabia has emerged as a digitally active economy, with increasing demand for faster, more reliable telecommunications infrastructure.

The market is poised for significant growth driven by the expansion of 5G networks, fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) initiatives, and government-led smart city projects such as NEOM and The Line. These national efforts require high-capacity, low-latency connectivity to support technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology is actively driving digital infrastructure development, aiming to increase internet speed, coverage, and digital inclusion across urban and rural areas.

Growing demand for enterprise-level connectivity solutions in sectors like banking, logistics, and manufacturing is contributing to the telecom market's evolution. Enhanced regulatory frameworks, investment in ICT infrastructure, and strategic public-private partnerships are further accelerating sector development. As Saudi Arabia continues its digital transformation journey, the telecommunication services market will remain at the core, providing the foundational layer for future technological innovation and national economic diversification.

Key Market Drivers

Nationwide 5G Deployment and Infrastructure Modernization

Saudi Arabia is rapidly expanding its fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications network as part of its national digital transformation under Vision 2030. This rollout is not limited to major urban centers like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam but is extending to remote and underserved areas. Investments in 5G base stations, fiber backhaul, and spectrum acquisition are enabling the country to build one of the most advanced telecom infrastructures in the region.

This aggressive infrastructure development is improving connectivity speed, latency, and network capacity across all user categories. 5G enables use cases like smart manufacturing, autonomous transportation, and real-time healthcare diagnostics, increasing demand for advanced telecom services. The government, in collaboration with major telecom providers, is also offering incentives for private sector adoption of 5G, which in turn accelerates revenue generation for the sector and fosters innovation ecosystems across industries. As of early 2025, more than 65 percent of Saudi Arabia's population has access to 5G connectivity - up from just 23 percent in 2021. This rapid rise in coverage is driven by large-scale investments in nationwide base stations, spectrum rollout, and private-public collaboration to accelerate high-speed internet availability across both major cities and rural zones.

Key Market Challenges

Regulatory Complexity and Evolving Compliance Requirements

The regulatory environment for the telecommunication services market in Saudi Arabia is becoming increasingly complex due to the convergence of data protection, cybersecurity, localization, and international investment standards. While the Communications, Space and Technology Commission has implemented forward-looking frameworks to promote digital growth, the simultaneous application of multiple regulatory layers - especially concerning cross-border data transfer, 5G infrastructure sharing, and cloud services - creates compliance ambiguity for telecom operators. These overlapping mandates often slow down the introduction of new services or infrastructure deployments due to longer approval cycles and legal risk assessment periods.

The continuous revision of cybersecurity guidelines and national digital standards requires telecom companies to allocate substantial resources to legal, IT, and compliance functions. For smaller operators or new entrants, these burdens can restrict innovation and delay service expansion. Additionally, global technology vendors partnering with Saudi providers must also adjust to local legal frameworks, which can complicate integration timelines and strategic alliances. As the market matures and becomes more digitally interconnected, the need for unified, streamlined regulations that balance innovation with control will become increasingly vital to sustaining growth.

Key Market Trends

Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Network Optimization

Telecommunication service providers in Saudi Arabia are increasingly embedding artificial intelligence technologies across their operations to enhance network performance and customer service efficiency. Artificial intelligence-driven solutions are being used for predictive maintenance, automated network configuration, dynamic resource allocation, and anomaly detection. This has allowed operators to proactively resolve network issues, reduce service downtime, and deliver consistent, high-quality connectivity to a digitally demanding user base.

Moreover, customer experience management has benefited significantly from the application of artificial intelligence. Telecom operators are deploying virtual assistants, natural language processing systems, and intelligent analytics to personalize services, automate queries, and minimize human intervention in customer support. These tools help operators gain insights from large volumes of user data, enabling more agile decision-making.

[TITLE]What CFOs Embracing AI Need to Know About Compliance:
[TEXT]
CFOs need AI governance, not just IT oversight, as data and algorithm controls are becoming as vital as financial controls.

AI is rewriting compliance as algorithms make decisions once handled by humans, creating new risks around bias, opacity, and accountability.

In today’s finance world, there’s no compliance without AI — and no safe AI without strong compliance.

Compliance programs are only as strong as their weakest pillars. And for CFOs and finance departments, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as one of the biggest opportunities, and most dangerous risks, of the 21st century.

Enterprise AI targeted at corporate back-office workflows doesn’t just learn from data; it redefines how decisions are made. That means accountability structures built for human oversight are being stress-tested in ways compliance leaders are still struggling to measure. The challenge isn’t merely technical. It’s structural. The same algorithms that can enhance efficiency or accuracy can also introduce opaque dependencies, unpredictable biases, and noncompliant cross-jurisdictional data flows.

Adopting AI doesn’t just change how finance operates. It can ultimately change what compliance means.

The “so what” for CFOs is that governance over data and algorithms is becoming as important as governance over dollars and disclosures. The CFO who treats AI as another IT tool could be missing the point. The CFO who treats AI as part of the control environment may be getting ahead of it.

New Frontier of Compliance Risk

Historically, the compliance function in finance organizations has operated within well-defined guardrails. Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) controls govern financial reporting. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sets standards for disclosures. Cybersecurity frameworks like NIST or ISO manage data protection.

Each of these regimes shares a common premise: The entities being regulated, whether they are people, systems or processes, are known and their behaviors largely traceable.

AI breaks that assumption. The learning models embedded within forecasting tools or risk analytics engines evolve continuously based on new data inputs. Their internal reasoning, particularly in complex deep-learning models, may be statistically valid but logically inscrutable. For a CFO signing off on quarterly statements or audit attestations, this presents a fundamental problem: How to ensure accountability when the “actor” is an algorithm.

“You’re messing with … money here,” Trustly Chief Legal and Compliance Officer Kathryn McCall told PYMNTS in an interview posted this summer. “This is a lot different from using an AI agent to plan your vacation in Paris. … You’ve got to treat these AI agents as nonhuman actors with unique identities in your system. You need audit logs, human-readable reasoning and forensic replay.”

Traditional compliance frameworks are designed around the principle of control and the capability of defining, testing and documenting how decisions are made and validated. But in the world of AI, “control” morphs into “explainability,” the ability to articulate why a model made a given prediction or recommendation.

Finance functions have always depended on trustworthy data, but AI exponentially magnifies the scale and complexity of data dependencies. In practical terms, that can mean documenting not only what the model does but also what assumptions underpin its logic, what data it consumes, and how those inputs are validated over time.

Redefining the Role of CFO

The marketplace is not standing still as AI sweeps over the enterprise back office.

NContracts on Monday (Oct. 20) introduced a pair of AI-powered compliance and risk management solutions for financial institutions; while earlier in October, Anthropic and Deloitte announced a partnership to build AI solutions that include compliance features to enable their deployment in regulated industries like financial services, healthcare and life sciences, and public services.

Companies are asking not “Should we try this?” but “How will this improve cash flow, forecasting accuracy, or decision speed?” Emanuel Pleitez, head of finance at Finix, told PYMNTS in an interview posted Oct. 8.

“If you just start using AI today without needing to make the big five, 10% of your budget investment into it, you can actually extract and get five to up to 20% more productivity gains,” added Pleitez.

The latest PYMNTS Intelligence report, “From Experiment to Imperative: U.S. Product Leaders Bet on Gen AI,” captures this pivot well. Eighty-seven percent of product leaders now expect AI to improve fraud detection, 85% forecast better regulatory compliance, and 83% anticipate stronger data security.

As PYMNTS wrote earlier this year, financial industry executives believe that companies have little choice but to turn to AI to make their way through today’s increasingly complex regulatory landscape and faster product development cycles.

“In 2025, there is pretty much no compliance without AI, because compliance became exponentially harder,” said Alexander Statnikov, co-founder and CEO of Crosswise Risk Management. “Think about all the change management that happens with regulations. Now, states will be stepping in. How do you stay on top of it?”

[TITLE]OpenAI strengthens Sora 2 guardrails after actor Bryan Cranston raises alarm:
[TEXT]
OpenAI said it is cracking down on unauthorized content following outcry over Sora 2’s ability to replicate likenesses and copyrighted material without permission.

And public figures might have actor Bryan Cranston to thank for that.

During the Sept. 30 launch of Sora 2, the newest version of OpenAI’s advanced text-to-video model, the company said it would prohibit users from replicating real people’s likenesses without that person explicitly opting in through a “cameo” feature.

Despite this stated policy, videos of Cranston, who is best known for his role as Walter White in “Breaking Bad,” quickly started appearing on the Sora app alongside AI-generated videos of other celebrities, including deceased figures like Michael Jackson and copyrighted characters like Ronald McDonald.

Cranston subsequently raised the issue with SAG-AFTRA, the union representing more than 150,000 film and TV performers, which has resulted in a collaborative effort with OpenAI and several talent agencies to “ensure voice and likeness protections in Sora 2,” the companies said in a joint statement posted to X on Monday.

The statement said OpenAI has strengthened its original guardrails to ensure this type of content no longer slips through. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noted that the company "is deeply committed to protecting performers from the misappropriation of their voice and likeness."

The news comes as Hollywood creatives continue to grapple with the rapid advancements of artificial intelligence. Although many in Hollywood have secretly embraced AI tools in recent years, tensions between entertainment industry professionals and AI developers have remained high as artists express concern about the potential for such tools to steal their likenesses and take their labor.

SAG-AFTRA’s attempt last year to funnel some compensation toward voice actors by striking a licensing deal with an AI company also faced backlash from some in the industry who opposed such cooperation altogether.

Before signing onto Monday’s statement, the talent agency CAA had slammed OpenAI for “expos[ing] our clients and their intellectual property to significant risk” by allowing Sora 2 users to generate videos containing copyrighted IP, such of depictions of famous fictional and animated characters.

Cranston also said in the post that he had brought up his concerns with Sora 2 to SAG-AFTRA after feeling "deeply concerned not just for myself, but for all performers whose work and identity can be misused in this way.”

In the first few weeks after launch, videos of Sora-watermarked clips featuring copyrighted characters such as Spongebob Squarements, Pikachu and Mario flooded the internet. Prior to launch, The Wall Street Journal had reported that Sora 2 would let users generate material protected by copyright unless the copyright holders opted out of having their work appear.

Now, however, requests to generate such clips on the Sora app return an error message stating that the prompt “may violate our guardrails” concerning “third-party likeness” or “similarity to third-party content.”

OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it has changed its policy around copyrighted content.

The joint statement also expresses support for the NO FAKES Act, which aims to hold individuals, companies and platforms liable for producing or hosting unauthorized deepfakes. The bill, which was introduced in the Senate in April, has not moved forward in Congress.

"We were an early supporter of the NO FAKES Act when it was introduced last year, and will always stand behind the rights of performers," Altman wrote in Monday's statement.

Meanwhile, Altman is among a few prominent figures who have drawn intrigue online by embracing user-made deepfakes of themselves.

While touting Sora 2’s abilities, Altman appeared eager to let people generate videos of him sticking his head out of a toilet, meowing in a cat suit or even shoplifting at a Target — something that stirred additional concern over the ability for Sora 2 to generate realistic but fake surveillance footage.

Boxer and YouTuber Jake Paul has also been the subject of a slew of fake videos depicting him coming out as gay, giving makeup tutorials or dancing in a ballerina outfit. Paul, an OpenAI investor, has poked fun at the videos and has continued to allow others to cameo him on the Sora app, crediting the team behind it for "making the internet fun again."

SAG-AFTRA President Sean Astin on Monday commended OpenAI for this opt-in protocol.

“Bryan Cranston is one of countless performers whose voice and likeness are in danger of massive misappropriation by replication technology,” Astin said in the statement. “Bryan did the right thing by communicating with his union and his professional representatives to have the matter addressed. This particular case has a positive resolution.”

Cranston also expressed optimism in his statement Monday, saying he’s “grateful to OpenAI for its policy and for improving its guardrails, and hope that they and all of the companies involved in this work, respect our personal and professional right to manage replication of our voice and likeness.”

[TITLE]What’s keeping flying taxis from taking off?:

A new wave of aviation innovation is taking shape above our cities, where short flights in electric air taxis could complement cars and trains as part of everyday transportation.

Known as advanced air mobility (AAM), this emerging industry aims to connect communities more efficiently while reducing emissions and noise.

Before these futuristic aircraft can take off, Georgia Tech researchers say there’s serious work to do—in the air, on the ground, and in policy.

“The same battery and automation technologies we’re using in electric ground vehicles are now being scaled for aircraft,” says Laurie Garrow, professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and co-director of Georgia Tech’s Center for Urban and Regional Air Mobility.

“We’re also seeing improvements in distributed propulsion and composite materials that make these aircraft lighter, quieter, and more efficient.”

Garrow cautions that widespread commercial service is years away.

“We may see high-profile demonstrations soon, maybe even at global events like the Olympics, but aviation certification is a rigorous process. It takes time to earn public trust.”

The promise of AAM depends on more than aircraft design—it also requires new safety frameworks and public confidence.

“We’ll need to define what I call ‘roads in the sky’—safe corridors where these aircraft can operate alongside traditional air traffic,” Garrow says.

“And we’ll need to ensure certification standards, air traffic control, and pilot training evolve alongside technology.”

Understanding how these vehicles interact with complex urban environments is essential to safe operation. Marilyn Smith, a professor in the School of Aerospace Engineering and director of the Vertical Lift Research Center of Excellence, leads research on modeling and simulation to prepare aircraft for real-world conditions.

Her lab is developing real-time simulations that factor in turbulence, wind shear, and other transient effects.

“These predictions are not trivial,” Smith says. “We need fast, physics-based models that can run in near-real time to inform both design and regulation. There are significant and abrupt variations in the atmosphere that must be accounted for, both for passenger vehicles and smaller delivery drones.”

Smith’s team is also integrating artificial intelligence to improve speed and accuracy in certification—but always under expert oversight.

“AI can accelerate our work,” she says. “Without the knowledge of domain experts, machine learning can generate misleading results, and that’s unacceptable when safety is on the line.”

Even the most advanced aircraft cannot operate without new infrastructure on the ground and in the sky.

Vertiports are needed to allow aircraft to take off and land vertically. Also required are “charging systems and robust fire safety protocols for high-energy batteries,” Garrow says. “And perhaps most critically, we need ‘rules of the road in the sky’ to manage air traffic around existing airports.”

Atlanta could offer a unique advantage. “The runways at Hartsfield-Jackson run east to west, while most of the metro population centers are north and south,” Garrow notes. “That natural separation could make it easier to integrate vertical takeoff and landing operations.”

Alex Oettl, professor in the Scheller College of Business, cautions that AAM’s benefits could concentrate in major hubs without inclusive planning.

“Improved connectivity will raise productivity in ‘superstar cities,’ but we’ll need new strategies if we want to ensure smaller communities aren’t left behind,” he says.

Oettl notes that China has surged ahead in AAM thanks to coordinated government action, flexible regulations, and significant infrastructure investment.

“In contrast, the US and Europe face more stringent certification requirements,” Oettl says. “That slows deployment but ideally ensures stronger safety standards. It’s a tradeoff between innovation speed and risk management.”

Cities and companies that move first into AAM could shape standards and attract investment—but they also shoulder more risk.

“There’s a danger of technological lock-in or stranded assets if early systems don’t scale or demand falls short,” Oettl says. “We’ve seen parallels before, like the scooter boom that left cities with thousands of idle vehicles.”

For now, AAM remains on the horizon—visible but not yet within reach. Coordinated efforts between government, industry, and academia will determine how quickly it moves from prototype to daily reality.

She adds, “In aviation, we like to say we crawl, we walk, we run. These technologies are coming, but safely integrating them into our skies will take time, teamwork, and trust.”
