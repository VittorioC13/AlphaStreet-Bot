[TITLE]Birkenstock Raises 2025 Revenue Outlook, Buys New German Production Facility:
[TEXT]
Birkenstock gave an early glimpse at its fourth quarter earnings ahead of a meeting with analysts and investors at its Munich headquarters on Thursday.

The German footwear maker reported that it expects fourth quarter revenues to total at least 520 million euros, growth of at least 14 percent on a reported basis and 18 percent in constant currency.

This would result in full year revenue of at least 2.09 billion euros, growth of 15.9 percent on a reported basis and 17.5 percent in constant currency, above guidance by 15 percent to 17 percent.

The company also reaffirmed its target for adjusted EBITDA in the range of 31.3 percent to 31.8 percent for the full fiscal year 2025, despite headwinds from foreign exchange rates.

Birkenstock will release its full fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2025 results on Dec. 18.

In tandem with an early look at Q4 earnings, Birkenstock has acquired a new production facility near Dresden, Germany for a net purchase price of 18 million euros. The company said it signed the purchase agreement on Sept. 23, and the acquisition is expected to close in the fiscal first quarter later this year.

According to Birkenstock, this facility includes approximately 840,000-square-feet (more than 10 football fields) of production and logistics space and 860,000-square-feet of undeveloped land. The facility was built and expanded between 1992 and 2012, the company said.

Birkenstock added that the opportunity to acquire this property for the attractive price of 240 euros per square meter arose due to the bankruptcy of its current owner. The acquisition will fast track the company’s manufacturing capacity build up plans at a favorable cost to a new build. The factory is expected to be operational by the end of fiscal 2027.

What’s more, the incremental capacity will support Birkenstock’s revenue growth ambition and allow for more flexibility among product groups. In the first phase, the facility will add to the sandal, clog and footbed capacity. Birkenstock said it will continue to look for opportunities to acquire assets in the European Union.

Following Birkenstock’s meeting on Thursday, analysts were largely optimistic.

“Birkenstock’s financial engine is humming,” Randal Konik, equity analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a note. “Growth is driven by both units (two-thirds) and average selling prices (one-third), supported by a 6-to-9-month order book visibility and minimal leverage (approximately 1.5 times). Business-to-business continues to outpace direct-to-consumer, with 90 percent of growth coming from existing doors and plans to expand into 5,000 additional doors across EMEA and the Americas. Management believes it can double the business every five years, but remains disciplined, controlling output to preserve brand equity.”

Konik also noted that Birkenstock management sees white space across geographies, especially APAC, as well as owned retail and closed-toe footwear styles. As of now, APAC currently contributes just 10 percent of revenues. The company plans to double it China growth relative to the rest of the world, while expanding its owned store base from approximately 100 to 150 by fiscal 2027, with 50 percent of new stores in APAC.

On the product front, closed-toe styles now represent less than 30 percent of the business,” Konik added. “With strong traction in clogs and lace-ups, Birkenstock is evolving into a year-round brand with diversified silhouettes and usage occasions.”

Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser shares in Konik’s optimism for the company’s continued growth.

“Birkenstock remains one of healthiest, most in demand, and best run brands in our coverage,” Poser wrote in a note on Thursday. “Demand for Birkenstock, by design, continues to outpace supply. Demand for the Boston clog continues to accelerate, while the Lutry and Naples Wrapped clogs are building momentum.”

[TITLE]Linktour's European Entry: A Strategic Bet on Premium Micro-Mobility:
[TEXT]
MUNICH, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At the IAA Mobility 2025, Chinese EV newcomer Linktour Automotive made its European ambitions official. However, unlike many competitors focusing on volume segments, Linktour is executing a targeted strategy: entering the premium niche of the microcar market. For German financial observers, this raises a critical question—is there a viable business model for high-end, tech-infused city cars?

In an exclusive interview with OnVista, Zheng Lei, the vice general manager, clarified the rationale. "We see a significant gap that hasn't been fully addressed yet," he stated. "While existing options serve a basic need, many lack the elements that define modern urban life: style, personal expression, and smart technology." Linktour's approach is not to compete on price but to create "a new class of urban mobility," positioning its L6e and L7e models as emotionally engaging lifestyle products rather than mere utilities. This focus on margin over volume is a calculated risk in a segment traditionally driven by cost-consciousness.

The brand's potential differentiator lies in its industrial backbone. As part of the Shandong Weiqiao Pioneering Group, a Fortune Global 500 leader in aluminum production, Linktour possesses an inherent cost and engineering advantage. The use of an all-aluminum frame—a first for vehicles in this class—directly translates to weight reduction and efficiency gains, a tangible benefit of vertical integration. This material science edge is central to its value proposition.

Furthermore, Linktour is deploying advanced technology typically reserved for larger vehicles. The application of Cell-to-Body (CTB) technology in microcars is a strategic move explained by three pillars: "performance and safety," "efficiency," and "innovation." By integrating the battery into the vehicle's structure, Linktour enhances rigidity and safety while saving weight and space—a crucial advantage in a small vehicle. This technological ambition signals an intent to redefine segment standards and justify a premium positioning.

Regarding European operations, Linktour's strategy appears phased and pragmatic. When questioned

[TITLE]Turkiye And The West: Between Geopolitical Risks And Strategic Roots:
[TEXT]
History

Determining America's Role in the World

Turkiye’s Strategic Orientation

Turkiye’s relationship with the West, and particularly with the United States, has long shaped its modern geopolitical identity. From its post–World War II realignment to its role in NATO and its deep economic and institutional connections with Europe, the country has historically operated within the frameworks of the Western alliance. While pursuing these ties, Turkiye at times distanced itself from the East—from the Middle East to the broader Islamic world—an approach that can be seen as a strategic shortcoming. While in recent years, Turkiye experienced democratic backsliding, authoritarian drift, and strains in diplomacy, these challenges do not change a deeper reality: Turkiye’s political, military, economic, and cultural patterns remain closely intertwined with those of the transatlantic community. This orientation rooted in decades of strategic choices and institutional linkages, has proven durable and is likely to continue influencing its trajectory well into the future.

Turkiye has long viewed the Euro-Atlantic framework as a source of stability, legitimacy, and strategic advantage despite the fluctuating tone of Turkish foreign policy. This alignment is evident not only in treaty commitments and strategic partnerships but also in the country’s institutions, legal structures, education systems, public sentiment, and civil society. Turkiye’s journey toward modernization has consistently followed a Western compass, beginning with the 19th-century reforms and culminating in the republic’s foundation under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who explicitly embraced Western models of modern governance and law. However, while the Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) conservative discourse over the last two decades has appealed to certain constituencies, fueled populist narratives and delivered electoral gains, it has also drawn Turkiye into the entanglements of the Middle East.

Pursuing unnecessary expansionist visions—either framed as a revisionist ambition or sectarian “Ummah” agendas — has proven counterproductive. Such approaches risk undermining the strategic achievements and international standing that Turkiye had painstakingly built in the decades before the AKP came to power in 2002. Although EU accession was initially leveraged to win votes and popularity, after consecutive electoral victories the AKP reversed its agenda, adopting a self-serving and adventurous course. The voter credit it received enabled it to test—and ultimately undermine—certain values and the country’s founding principles.

The Post-WWII Strategic Choice

The end of World War II created a bipolar world dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union. In this environment, the Republic of Turkiye made a defining and courageous decision: to align firmly with the Western bloc. This choice was neither automatic nor risk-free but emerged after weighing geographic vulnerability, ideological identity, and long-term aspirations. It became one of the most enduring features of modern Turkish foreign policy.

In 1949, Turkiye joined the Council of Europe, signaling its intent to participate in the new European institutional architecture of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Its most decisive step came in 1952, when it formally joined NATO, embedding itself within the transatlantic security alliance that would dominate Cold War geopolitics.

Turkiye’s path to NATO was difficult. Remaining neutral for most of WWII, Turkiye joined the war against Germany and Japan only in 1945, raising doubts

[TITLE]Host Hotels & Resorts Recommends that Holders of:
[TEXT]
BETHESDA, Md., Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: HST) (the “Company”) has learned that certain affiliates of MacKenzie Capital Management, LP (“Purchaser”) made an unsolicited “mini-tender” offer for up to 100,000 operating partnership units (“OP Units”) of Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. (“Host L.P.”) at a price of $10.55 per OP Unit less cash distributions made by Host L.P. after April 30, 2025 (the “MacKenzie Offer”). This follows multiple earlier “mini-tender” offers by the Purchaser launched between 2016 and 2023. Neither the Company nor Host L.P. are in any way associated with the MacKenzie Offer, and holders of OP Units are under no obligation to take any action with respect to the MacKenzie Offer.

Mini-tender offers seek less than 5 percent of a company’s outstanding equity. This allows the offering company to avoid many of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) disclosure and procedural requirements for tender offers. The SEC’s guidance to investors on “mini-tender” offers is available at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm. This guidance advises that mini-tender offers “have been increasingly used to catch investors off guard” and that investors “may end up selling their securities at below-market prices.”

After careful evaluation of the MacKenzie Offer, the Company and Host L.P. recommend that the holders of OP Units reject this unsolicited offer. In making this recommendation, the Company primarily considered that the offer price in the MacKenzie Offer is below the $17.37 per share closing stock price of the Company’s common stock on September 24, 2025. Although there is no trading market for the OP Units themselves, at any time holders of OP Units may request that the Company redeem their OP Units and the Company will issue 1.021494 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for each OP Unit, which shares may then be sold. Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 24, 2025 of $17.37, an OP Unit holder would receive shares with a market value of approximately $17.74 compared to the cash MacKenzie Offer of $10.55, less cash distributions of $0.2042988 per OP Unit made on July 15, 2025 and to be made October 15, 2025 (if the date of settlement of the MacKenzie Offer is after that date).

The Purchaser has made many similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for equity of other companies and multiple earlier unsolicited mini-tender offers to holders of Host L.P. units at a similar discount to current market value. Like its other offers, this offer puts individual investors at risk because they may not realize they are selling their OP Units at a discount. The Company urges investors to get current quotes for the Company’s common stock for which their OP Units may be redeemed, consult their financial and tax advisors and exercise caution with respect to the MacKenzie Offer. The Company recommends that holders of OP Units who have not responded to the Purchaser’s offer take no action. The Company encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC’s letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at:

http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm.

Holders of OP Units should consult with their personal financial advisor or other legal, tax or investment professional(s) regarding any questions they may have.

The Company requests that broker dealers, and other market participants, include a copy of this

[TITLE]Taoiseach finds common ground with Canadian PM Mark Carney during Ottawa meeting:
[TEXT]
After the hot air, treacherous escalators, and humidity of the United Nations week in New York, Taoiseach Micheál Martin made a brief foray into the calm and cool sanity of the far north for a breakfast of porridge and smoked trout with Canadian prime minister – and Mayo exile – Mark Carney.

The leaders had met briefly during engagements at the UN conferences. Still, Thursday’s visit was an opportunity for some photo-visual diplomacy and to firm up the mutual economic benefits, which have become more attractive since the tariff storms whipped up by the Trump administration.

“This is one of our strongest relationships – culturally, economically, with respect to shared values and foreign policies,” said Mr Carney when he made a brief joint address with the Taoiseach in his office at the Canadian parliament.

“Our trade has doubled since the signing of the Ceta agreement between Canada and the European Union. When I think

[TITLE]MGM Empire City, Resorts World Advance For New York Casino Licenses:
[TEXT]
MGM Empire City became the first applicant to advance for consideration for a downstate New York casino license Thursday after its Community Advisory Committee unanimously voted 5-0 to forward its $2.3 billion expansion proposal to the state’s Gaming Facility Location Board.

Fellow racino Resorts World followed suit Thursday when that CAC unanimously advanced its $5.5 billion proposed expansion at Aqueduct Racetrack into an integrated casino resort by a 6-0 vote.

The two approvals follow the rejections of all three Manhattan-based proposals — Freedom Plaza, The Avenir, and Caesars Palace Times Square — by 4-2 votes from their respective CACs. The Coney is likely headed to a similar fate as four members of its CAC have already publicly signaled their intentions to vote down Thor Equities’ $3.4 billion proposed casino prior to a scheduled Monday vote.

MGM Empire City and Resorts World are the two incumbents among the original eight applicants vying for as many as three $500 million licenses that could be awarded by the New York State Gaming Commission. Both racinos have been long-standing favorites to be awarded full casino licenses as they have been offering gaming via video lottery terminals (VLTs) for more than a decade at their respective racetracks.

Empire City originally opened at Yonkers Raceway in 2006, and MGM agreed to purchase the venue in May 2018 for approximately $850 million. Resorts World opened at Aqueduct in 2011 and expanded its scope in 2021 with a 400-room hotel. It also plans to have some of its expanded gaming amenities as part of this proposal ready within six months of being awarded a license.

#Breaking: The Yonkers Community Advisory Council has voted unanimously in favor of a full casino license for MGM Empire City. https://t.co/HOSa46IiCJ — CBS New York (@CBSNewYork) September 25, 2025

Building Empire

In addition to incumbency, MGM Empire City enjoys solid backing from Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano. The gaming venue was largely well-received by the local community during its two state-mandated public hearings overseen by the CAC.

MGM Empire City began releasing details of the expansion as far back as November 2023. It projects 8,500 new jobs over the course of building the venue, broken out into 6,500 construction jobs and 2,000 additional gaming positions as its casino workforce will grow from 700 to 2,700.

Similar to other CAC final committee hearings, MGM Empire City did submit amendments for consideration. Unlike the other committees, however, these were voted through as part of the application sent forward. The amendments also tracked in language similar to the Community Benefit Agreement the casino signed with the City of Yonkers that was approved by the city council.

Among the add-ons:

$10 million to purchase and renovate a new library/community center

$2 million to fund small business facade improvements on Yonkers Avenue

$1.5 million initial payment and $500,000 annual payment to the Yonkers Economic Development Council

$2 million for Yonkers Avenue streetscape improvements

$1.25 million for parks improvements

The amendments also included a $100 million commitment by MGM Empire City dedicated to improving traffic flow and drainage around the casino area.

All five members of the CAC provided context for their “aye” votes, with themes of being great for small businesses in Yonkers as well as acknowledging concerns of traffic, noise, and drainage issues emerging from multiple committee members.

Chair James Cavanaugh noted the two hearings featured 110 speakers, with a “majority in support” of the proposal. He said the CAC received 221 additional email comments, with 178 in favor of the casino pursuing a full license.

Cavanaugh, who was appointed to the committee by Spano, again pointed out this pursuit will be a make-or-break venture for the city.

“If Yonkers does not get one of the three full casino licenses, Empire Casino will wither and die,” he said matter-of-factly, citing figures of potential lost tax revenue and jobs without the expanded venue. “With three new casinos within a half-hour drive, all offering table games, sports betting, entertainment, and all the goes of a full-blown casino, who is going to continue going to an aging slot parlor that has none of these things?

“A casino license is a good deal for New York state, for Westchester County, and especially for Yonkers. For that reason, I join the rest of my fellow committee members and vote yes.”

Resorts World continues on smooth path

Much like the two public hearings, the CAC for Resorts World was as effusive in its praise for the gaming company as the community. Stevens Martinez, appointed to the CAC by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, noted Resorts World had everything at the ready when facing queries from the committee.

“We asked the applicant some tough questions,” Martinez said. “Often times, we demanded answers within a short turnaround time. … But not once did the applicant ever push back on us. Not once did they hide information from us or try to give us the runaround. They answered our questions transparently, quickly, and with data.

“And I believe this is why the public and the community were on their side.”

New York state Sen. James Sanders placed his aye vote via videoconference in South Africa. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, who was the fifth aye vote, could not resist a small celebration at the expense of the rejected Manhattan and likely soon-to-be rejected Brooklyn proposals.

“There’s an old saying that if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu,” Richards said. “The community was at the table, and it couldn’t have been done without everybody here.

“There’s a theme in Queens, and I know (rapper) Nas is a part of this ‘Queens get the money.’ Sorry, Jay-Z, we win again. I just had to rub that in. And you can let the Brooklyn borough president know that I send my regards to him. With that being said, I vote aye.”

The final countdown continues

The New York State Gaming Commission announced that the CACs for Bally’s and The Coney will hold their votes Monday.

The Metropolitan Park CAC has announced its vote will be held next Tuesday, the deadline day for a CAC vote.

A failure to hold a vote is assumed as a rejection of the applicant.

Non-Binding Letter of Intent with Appian, with significant due diligence already completed, for a Senior Secured Credit Facility of up to US$175 million for the development and construction of the Goldboro Gold Project.

TORONTO, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NexGold Mining Corp. (TSXV: NEXG; OTCQX: NXGCF) (“NexGold” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that, on September 24, 2025, it entered into a royalty agreement with an affiliate of Appian Capital Advisory Limited (“Appian”) in relation to the Company’s 100% owned Goldboro gold project (the “Project”). Under the terms of the agreement, Appian will pay Goldboro Gold Mines Inc. (the subsidiary of NexGold holding title to the Project) (“GGM”) consideration of US$24 million for a 2.9% net smelter returns royalty (the “Royalty”) covering all minerals produced from the Project up until 1,250,000 ounces of gold or gold equivalent is achieved, and thereafter only covering gold, for the life of the Project. Further details are set out below under “Royalty Transaction Details”. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions (including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”)) and is expected to close towards the end of September 2025.

Additionally, the Company has signed a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) with Appian for a senior secured credit facility of up to US$175 million from certain funds advised by Appian for the development and construction of the Company’s 100% owned Goldboro Gold Project.

Kevin Bullock, President & CEO of NexGold, commented: “We are excited to announce this strategic partnership with Appian, a leading investor in metals and mining with a track record of identifying and supporting the development of high-quality assets. Appian has undertaken an extensive due diligence process on the Goldboro Gold Project and this royalty financing provides NexGold with important non-dilutive capital to help advance Goldboro towards construction, as well as deleveraging the balance sheet. The structure of the agreement allows us to retain future flexibility, including the option to buy back a significant portion of the Royalty and pursue future financings when necessary. We are also pleased to have signed an LOI to work towards project financing with Appian, which will assist in taking Goldboro through construction and into operations.”

Royalty Transaction Details

The Company, GGM and Appian have entered into a binding royalty agreement, subject to certain closing conditions (including the approval of the TSXV), for a purchase price of US$24 million. In exchange for the purchase price, GGM will issue to Appian the Royalty on all minerals produced from the Property up until 1,250,000 ounces of gold or gold equivalent is achieved, and thereafter only on gold, for the life of the Project. This transaction secures for the Company a less dilutive source of financing, providing sufficient funding to buy back an existing royalty on the Project, buy back certain debt, and help advance the Project through project development activities towards project financing and a construction decision while maintaining the robust economics of the Project.

In connection with the transaction, the Company agreed to grant Appian security over all present and after-acquired property of GGM, including the Project and the shares of the entities that own directly or indirectly the Project to secure the Royalty obligations. The Royalty will also be guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The security and guarantees will be released if the buyback (as discussed below) occurs.

Buyback

GGM will have a right at its sole discretion to repurchase a portion of the Royalty (effectively bringing the Royalty down to 1.0% of net smelter returns), subject to certain timing and payment thresholds being met.

Minimum Payments

Prior to commercial production being achieved at the Project, certain minimum payments will be implemented if construction of the Company’s Goliath Gold Complex project in Ontario (the “Goliath Project”) is also started or started in advance of the Project. No minimum payments are payable if the Goliath Project does not begin construction prior to the Project achieving commercial production.

Participation Right

For a period of three years from the transaction closing date, Appian has a right to negotiate its participation for up to 50% of any project financing with respect to the construction of the Project. In addition, during this three-year period, if GGM wishes to solicit offers for a stream or grant an additional royalty interest on the Project, Appian will have the first right to offer to purchase the stream or additional royalty interest, which offer may be accepted or denied by GGM.

Closing

The transaction is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including the approval of the TSXV. The Company expects the transaction to close towards the end of September 2025.

Project Financing

The Company, GGM and Appian have entered into the LOI to provide for up to US$175 million in senior secured credit for the purposes of the construction and development of the Goldboro Gold Project.

The LOI is a non-binding letter of intent, and entry into definitive transaction documents with respect to the project financing contemplated by the LOI is subject to, among other matters, the negotiation and execution of mutually-acceptable definitive transaction documents, and the formal approval of the proposed project financing by the board of each of Appian and the Company. Further, the consummation of the proposed project financing, even if definitive transaction documents are entered into, would be subject to customary closing conditions for transactions of this nature, including any applicable regulatory and TSXV approvals. The LOI does not create any agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Company and Appian for purposes of any law, rule, regulation, agreement or otherwise, and will not until such time as definitive transaction documentation has been approved by the board of directors of each of Appian and the Company and entered into by the parties. There can be no assurance that a definitive transaction will result from the LOI and details of the terms will be disclosed once a definitive agreement is signed.

Advisors

National Bank Financial acted as Financial Advisor to the Company with respect to the sale of the Royalty. Auramet International acted as Financial Advisor to the Company with respect to the project financing facility. Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP acted as legal advisor to the Company. McCarthy Tétrault LLP acted as legal advisor to Appian. No finder fees are payable in connection with the Royalty.
