Nailable solar shingle maker GAF Energy has shut down its San Jose, California, research and development and manufacturing hub, which opened in 2021, and moved its headquarters to Georgetown, Texas. Going forward, the company will only manufacture its solar shingles at its Texas factory.

The move comes with layoffs in California. GAF Energy laid off 138 San Jose employees on December 13, according to a California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filed by the company in October.

“In light of ongoing changes in the solar industry, we are aligning our business and our team to focus on key markets where solar is most compelling for builders and homeowners,” GAF Energy president Martin DeBono said in a statement.

GAF Energy opened its 450,000-square-foot nailable solar shingle factory in Texas in May 2024 to meet growing demand for its Timberline Solar Energy Shingle, which the company calls the world’s first and debuted in January 2022.

More recently, in February, GAF Energy rolled out its ES 2 solar energy shingle. The updated version produces 57 watts per shingle – about 23% more power than the previous model.

[TITLE]Oil Settles at Lowest Since 2021 as Traders Weigh Ukraine Deal:
[TEXT]
The US oil benchmark fell to its lowest level since February 2021, with traders weighing renewed signs of optimism surrounding a deal to end the war in Ukraine and mixed economic data from China.

West Texas Intermediate settled below $57 a barrel in thin trading ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays, sliding as stocks wavered. US negotiators offered more substantial security guarantees to Kyiv in a renewed bid to clinch a deal, though the effort still appeared part of a bid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on territory. An agreement to end the conflict could lift restrictions on the flows of Russian oil, limiting disruptions in an already well-supplied market.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The potentially positive developments in the talks added to earlier bearish momentum on signs of weakness in China’s economy that could limit a key source of demand for crude — outweighing news that the country’s apparent oil demand and refining activity increased in November.

Oil is set for an annual loss, with supply set to exceed demand this year and next. Concerns about a glut are showing up in the key Middle Eastern crude market, and trend-following commodity trading advisers were 100% short in both Brent and WTI on Monday, according to data from Bridgeton Research Group.

“Crude continues to trade heavy as headlines this morning suggest there’s growing consensus around elements of a potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire,” said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Group. “While a ceasefire wouldn’t trigger a sudden wave of Russian barrels returning to market, it would materially reduce the risk of future supply disruptions.”

Still, the fact that some details of a peace deal remain unclear could offer support for prices, Babin said.

And there are other geopolitical inputs at play. Even as US-Ukraine talks advanced, Ukraine has intensified attacks on Russia’s Caspian region, hitting energy production and refining assets. Meanwhile, the market is also weighing attacks on shipping in the Black Sea and the risk of US military action in Venezuela after the Trump administration detained a supertanker last week.

The government has notified the new Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, bringing into force a modern regulatory framework aimed at attracting investment and improving ease of doing business in the oil and gas sector.The rules, issued under the recently approved Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Act, 2025, replace the earlier system of multiple licences with a single petroleum lease covering exploration, development and production of all hydrocarbons, including shale, according to a gazette notification.The new framework provides lease tenures of up to 30 years, extendable for the full economic life of a field, with terms protected from adverse changes. Criminal penalties for violations have been removed and replaced with higher financial penalties of Rs 25 lakh, plus Rs 10 lakh per day for continuing breaches. The rules also allow lessees to share infrastructure to improve operational efficiency.Environmental provisions have mandated time-bound plans for zero gas flaring and reduced greenhouse emissions.Applications for petroleum leases must now be decided within 180 days, and disputes may be resolved through an expedited mechanism, including a neutral arbitration seat for foreign investors.The Oil Industry Safety Directorate has been designated as the competent authority for offshore safety, audits and standard-setting in exploration and production operations.Commenting on the move, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said, "In a landmark moment today, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, have been amended to offer ease of business and operations".With a broader spectrum of rights under one petroleum lease, the lessees will have the right to carry out all types of mineral oil operations under one petroleum lease, he said, adding that they may undertake decarbonisation and comprehensive energy projects at oilfields.Application for the grant of a petroleum lease will be decided within 180 days. Long-term leases of up to 30 years may be granted and may be extended up to the economic life of the field, allowing the lessee to make a planned investment decision.Lessees will make an annual declaration to the government of the installed, utilised and excess capacity of the infrastructure facilities owned by it, he said.The new rules permit lessees to jointly develop or share infrastructure facilities by mutual agreement.Seat of arbitration of lease and contractual disputes, where all lessees or contractors are companies incorporated in India, will be New Delhi. Where any member is a foreign company as defined in the Companies Act, a neutral seat of arbitration may be opted for.Rules require NOCs to promptly notify all existing and new discoveries, submit field development plans within prescribed time limits, obtain central government approval for development areas, and regularly report development and production activities. Vedanta Group chairman Anil Agarwal said, "Notifying the landmark reforms to India's oil and gas regulatory framework" is "a truly historic development"."The world has long recognised India's vast untapped hydrocarbon potential, and these new rules finally create the environment needed to unlock it," he said."India produces some of the most affordable oil and gas globally. These reforms will directly benefit consumers - especially the poorest - by enabling greater domestic production and reducing dependence on imports."He said this is the kind of bold, inclusive policy that transformed the United States from a major importer into an energy surplus nation."I never imagined I would witness such a reform in my lifetime. Our energy security is both our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity. With these changes, I am confident that India can produce at least 50 per cent of its energy domestically."

[TITLE]Atlantica Closes the Acquisition of Statkraft's Renewable Energy Platform in Canada:
[TEXT]
December 10, 2025 – Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure today announced it completed the previously announced acquisition of a Canadian renewable energy platform, marking an important milestone in the Company’s growth strategy in North America.

The platform includes 236 MW in operation and a 0.6 GW pipeline of renewable and storage projects and a small team of experienced employees who have joined Atlantica. This acquisition expands Atlantica’s presence in the Canadian market and strengthens its position in the broader North American renewables sector.

The operating portfolio includes a 51% stake in l’Érable, a 100 MW wind facility in Quebec, in operation since 2013, and a 136 MW wind asset in Alberta that began operations in early 2025. Both assets are backed by long-term PPAs with investment-grade counterparties, with an average remaining contract life of approximately 13 years. The platform also adds approximately 0.6 GW of solar, wind, and storage projects under development across several Canadian provinces, further strengthening Atlantica’s position in Canada.

In addition, Atlantica successfully closed the project financing of Winnifred with National Bank of Canada.

Santiago Seage, Atlantica’s CEO, said: “This transaction is a key step in our North American growth strategy. We are pleased to welcome the new team members to Atlantica. The integration of this experienced local team will complement our existing Canadian operations and enhance our capabilities to capture future growth opportunities across the region”. Santiago added: “This acquisition significantly expands our presence in a core market with attractive growth prospects.”

Atlantica previously announced in August 2025 that it had signed an agreement to acquire this platform. Following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the transaction has now successfully closed.

[TITLE]Utility watchdogs accuse PGE of skirting new law meant to make data centers pay for rising demand:
[TEXT]
QTS Data Centers in Hillsboro on Oct. 11, 2024. Despite data centers driving overall system demand growth for Portland General Electric, the company does not plan to directly assign new costs associated with meeting that demand to the data centers.

The company doesn’t plan to simply assign the costs of energy investments needed to support data centers, to data centers, but to focus on all drivers of “peak demand”

Oregon’s largest electrical utility is proposing to make residential customers pay at least part of the long-term cost of supplying large data centers, despite a new law requiring it to charge the centers’ developers, not other customers.

This summer, Oregon became one of just a few states to pass a law requiring data centers to foot the costs of growing energy and transmission infrastructure that’s needed to power them.

The POWER Act mandated Oregon’s three monopoly electric utilities create a separate rate class for data centers to ensure residential customers and other medium and industrial customers weren’t subsidizing the new costs associated with the data centers’ anomalous growth.

But months after the law passed, a plan to comply with the new law from Oregon’s largest electric utility — Portland General Electric — reveals the company could be trying to find a work-around that would only directly charge data centers for the first three years of costs associated with a typical 50-year infrastructure investment.

Residential customers and other customers would help pay for the rest over the remaining 47 years.

Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens’ Utility Board, said PGE’s plan invokes a “twisted logic” to try and skirt the new law. The utilities’ watchdog group was established by Oregon voters in 1984 to represent the interests of the state’s consumers who are captive to the monopoly utilities.

PGE Spokesperson Drew Hanson says it will ensure all customers “pay their fair share of system costs.”

The three-member Oregon Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a decision on PGE’s plan at the end of April.

Data centers drive overall growth

Oregon’s data center market is the fifth largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield.

Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and X, formerly named Twitter, have massive data centers in eastern Oregon as well as in The Dalles, Hillsboro and Prineville that require enormous amounts of energy to operate.

Between 2013 and 2023, Oregon’s overall electricity consumption rose by more than 20%, the analysis found, according to a Sightline Institute analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

“Data centers undoubtedly drove a major share, if not almost all, of this growth,” analysts wrote.

PGE serves 930,000 customers, and absorbed the most data center load growth of any private utility in the state during the last decade, according to that analysis.

The company also raised residential rates 50% during the last five years in part to pay for system upgrades and growth.

As a customer class, residential users’ demand on PGE’s system has grown by

[TITLE]Ford to convert EV battery plants to make battery storage for data centers:

BlueOval SK, Glendale, KY Image: Ford

Ford is jumping into the battery energy storage business, betting that booming demand from data centers and the electric grid can absorb the EV battery capacity it says it’s not using.

To achieve this, Ford plans to repurpose its existing EV battery manufacturing capacity in Glendale, Kentucky, into a dedicated hub for manufacturing battery energy storage systems.

[TITLE]LNG Supply Expands Faster Than China’s Demand Growth:
[TEXT]
China’s LNG demand is disappointing in 2025 for a second year in a row, just as new U.S. export projects ramp up and Qatar is nearing start-up of the first new facilities in its huge capacity expansion.

The wave of new LNG supply that will come online by the end of the decade, mostly from the top exporters, the United States and Qatar, has prompted many analysts to expect an oversupplied LNG market by 2030 that would weigh on prices.

Lower prices could incentivize additional demand from price-sensitive buyers in south and Southeast Asia, but projects for nuclear capacity expansion in the world’s top LNG importers, China and Japan, could reduce demand for imported gas in the long term.

China could even launch the world’s first small modular reactor (SMR) as early as 2026.

If further tests and construction prove successful, a buyer’s market would give LNG importers new leverage in contract negotiations for long-term supply into the 2030s and 2040s.

“The question isn’t which technology prevails. The question is how Asian utilities reprice long-term contracts when two clocks—LNG expansion and nuclear validation—start running in parallel, each generating data that forces the other to justify its risk premium,” geopolitical risk analyst Güney Y?ld?z writes in Forbes.

We are years away from SMRs replacing any gas demand in China. But Japan is working to restart more of its nuclear reactors that were shut down for safety checks after the Fukushima disaster in 2011—potentially reducing demand for LNG in the resource-poor G7 nation.

Japan’s Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, favors accelerating the restart of nuclear reactors as a way to reduce the economy’s dependence on energy imports.

The share price of Energy Vault Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:NRGV) surged by 15.49% between December 5 and December 12, 2025, putting it among the Energy Stocks that Gained the Most This Week.

Energy Vault Holdings (NRGV) Continues to Rally Following Entry into Swiss Market

Energy Vault Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:NRGV) develops and deploys utility-scale energy storage solutions in the United States, Australia, and internationally.

Energy Vault Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:NRGV) continued to rally after formally announcing its entry into the Swiss market on December 4 with the launch of FlexGrid, a new configuration of its B-VAULT battery energy storage system designed for commercial, industrial, and small utility-scale clients. The company signed two agreements for the technology with Schindler Group and Energie Wettingen AG, with both projects operating under CKW’s Flexpool, the most advanced and diversified flexibility network in Switzerland.

Gianmarco Zorloni, Director of Business Development at Energy Vault Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:NRGV) commented:

“With the launch of B-VAULT FlexGrid, we are introducing a compact, modular, easy-to-install, and regulation-ready platform tailored for Europe’s evolving energy landscape. The combination of the Schindler and Wettingen projects illustrates our ability to serve both industrial customers and municipal utilities with a common technology base that adapts to diverse site conditions, from dense urban settings to utility-scale networks. These installations embody what B-VAULT FlexGrid was designed to do: deliver compact, compliant, and intelligent energy storage where it’s needed most, without compromise on performance or community impact. We look forward to continued expansion in the European market as we seek to address the continent’s evolving energy demands.”

It is worth noting that Energy Vault Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:NRGV)’s global B-VAULT portfolio now exceeds 2 GWh of deployed or contracted systems across multiple continents. The company also grew its revenue backlog by 112% YoY in the first nine months of 2025, hitting $920 million.

Following the recent rally, Energy Vault Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:NRGV) has posted gains of almost 114% since the beginning of 2025.

While we acknowledge the potential of NRGV as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
