[TEXT]
Iconic mechanical switch manufacturer Cherry is in deep financial trouble, with its debts now exceeding its total equity. Because of this, the company had to hold a general meeting, and it’s now considering selling either its peripherals or its Digital Health & Solutions division to stay afloat, according to a report from Heise Online. It should be noted, though, that Cherry’s keyboard switches fall under the components division, while its peripherals business focuses on actual keyboards and mice. This means that the beloved Cherry MX switches are safe from being taken over by another company, at least for now.

Cherry held the patent for the legendary Cherry MX switches that many mechanical keyboard enthusiasts swear by, but it finally expired in 2014. This led to an explosion of competing switch brands, like Gateron, Kailh, and Outemu, among others, which you can find in the best gaming keyboards. Furthermore, the company has since lagged behind the competition in releasing innovations, with other companies being the first to introduce factory-lubed and Hall-effect switches. Even gaming peripheral companies like Corsair, Logitech, and Razer have introduced their own switches sourced from Cherry’s competitors.

The COVID-19 Pandemic allowed the company to flourish until 2021. But by 2022, its sales had fallen by half to just EUR 41.2 million. Its total turnover recovered in 2023, but the Digital Health & Solutions and components divisions continued to slip. Things have gotten so bad that its Chief Financial Officer, Jurjen Jongma, said that the only way for the company to survive is to sell some of its parts. “Due to the groups low market capitalization and the current share price of Cherry below one euro, it is currently neither possible nor advisable to strengthen the group’s equity in any way other than through strategic mergers & acquisitions options,” said Jongma.

As part of the company’s cost-cutting measures, it has also ended switch production at its headquarters in Auerbach. Instead, it will outsource manufacturing to partners in China and Slovakia. Aside from the potential sales of one of the divisions mentioned above and outsourcing switch production to cheaper locations, the company has also already sold the Active Key division, its hygiene peripheral device business, for 21 million euros, secured extended financing worth 23 million euros, and received support from its majority shareholder, Argand Partners.

Aerospace companies set to get more capital market support as reusable rockets make headway

Global Times

By Chu Daye Published: Nov 28, 2025 10:46 PM

Six Chinese commercial aerospace companies had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus from June 18 to November 27, the Securities Daily reported on Friday, amid faster growth in China's commercial aerospace sector and launches being scheduled for several reusable carrier rockets in the coming months.

Chinese industry insiders and financial experts said more commercial aerospace companies are set to receive further support from the capital market as China's commercial aerospace industry moves from the technological exploration phase to commercialization.

The Securities Daily reported on Friday that six commercial space companies, including Chinese private space firms LandSpace, Galactic Energy, CAS Space, Space Pioneer, Yee Space and Mino Space, have had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus.

The IPO progress has come amid China's increasing policy support for the sector. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced in June a new sci-tech growth tier on the country's Nasdaq-style Science and Technology Innovation Board, also known as the STAR Market.

The regulator also called for more support for companies in cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence and commercial aerospace, such as more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market, in light of industrial development and market demand.

Beijing-based LandSpace said in a statement sent to the Global Times that it is set to launch its ZQ-3 reusable rocket at the end of November. Industry analysts said this will be a key step in the mastering of heavy duty, low cost and reusable rockets by Chinese private space firms.

Space Pioneer, another Beijing-based aerospace company, is also preparing for a launch for its Tianlong-3 reusable rocket, according to the South China Morning Post. The rocket is expected to be used to build China's massive internet satellite constellations, the report said.

A Beijing-based venture capital investor surnamed Liu told the Global Times on Friday that there has been a marked rise in market attention toward the commercial aerospace sector, given the policy support and recent progress made in the industry. "The new policies are also a boon for earlier-stage investors looking for an exit strategy," Liu said.

Tian Lihui, professor of finance at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Friday that listing can not only address the financing challenges faced by enterprises and secure funding for continuous research and development input, but also guide capital toward companies with genuine technical strengths and commercial potential. It will also promote the healthy development of the industry, Tian noted.

The CSRC's call for more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market precisely addresses the chokepoint for commercial aerospace - high R&D investment and long profitability cycles - by opening up more capital market channels for the industry, Tian said.

Further policy support came on Tuesday, when China's space agency released an action plan to back commercial space firms and encourage them to pursue international cooperation over the next two years.

The document released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said the country's commercial space enterprises should "go global" and help developing countries to build satellite-application industries.

Among the supportive measures, the CNSA will establish a national commercial space development fund and local governments will be urged to establish technology-innovation centers focused on reusable rockets and smart satellites, and to build open platforms for advanced manufacturing, final assembly and testing.

The plan aims to achieve high-quality commercial space development by 2027. The recommendations for the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) list the aerospace sector among China's strategic emerging industries.

[TITLE]Speciality chemical makers are betting on pharma momentum. And it's paying off:
[TEXT]
MUMBAI : The Street is gravitating towards speciality chemical manufacturers that supply contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) makers, as uncertainty looms over the broader chemicals sector.

The reason, according to experts, is that suppliers to pharma companies enjoy clearer growth visibility, far less competition, and stronger margins than industry-linked speciality and agro-chemical businesses that dominate the country's chemicals landscape.

Intermediates tied to new chemical entities require complex synthesis, rigorous regulatory oversight, and long qualification cycles. In such cases, speed matters far more than cost, and these inherent barriers deepen customer stickiness, said Vikash Agarwalla, managing director and partner at global consulting giant Boston Consulting Group.

Scaling a business that serves pharma CDMOs is inherently slow, as companies enter into contracts early in the drug's discovery phase and grow with the molecule, noted Deepak Jain, chief executive and managing director of Jubilant Ingrevia. “It’s a game of patience, but a high-margin, sticky business."

This gives CDMO suppliers stronger pricing power and better earnings visibility than commodity-style speciality chemicals businesses, Agarwalla added.

[TITLE]Nigeria Bets Big on Renewables as Oil Troubles Deepen:
[TEXT]
For decades, Nigeria’s oil industry has faced a multitude of challenges. Despite having vast quantities of crude, the mismanagement of revenue, weak agreements with international oil companies, an underinvestment in infrastructure, and widespread oil theft have left many opposed to the ongoing production of crude. Now, Nigeria has high hopes for its renewable energy sector, as it looks to diversify its energy sources and boost energy security over the coming years.

Oil theft has long been a problem in Nigeria, affecting both the financial gain from oil projects and health and safety in the sector. A committee, established earlier this year, assessed some of the oil sector’s challenges in Nigeria, including oil theft, bunkering operations, illegal export networks, and alleged compromises within regulatory and security systems. The committee published a report on its findings, which suggested that the government could significantly mitigate the country’s oil losses.

Satellite and agency tracking revealed at least 589 oil leaks across Nigeria in 2024, most of which were due to theft and sabotage. The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative estimated that, over 12 years, Nigeria lost 619.7 million barrels of oil, with a total value of $46.2 billion. In addition, Nigeria lost approximately $1.84 billion worth of petroleum products from its refineries over nine years.

While the government seeks to make its oil industry safer and more efficient, and, importantly, more profitable, many Nigerians are calling for the government to abandon its oil ambitions in favour of clean energy sources. While the government continues to back fossil fuels, it also sees a future for Nigeria in green energy, having set a target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 during the COP26 climate summit.

Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan (ETP) led the way for the passing of the country’s Climate Change Act in 2021. The government then established the Energy Transition Office to oversee the implementation of the ETP, with a focus on six pillars – improved energy access, poverty reduction, modern energy access, job preservation, a sustainable transition, and legislation. The ETP aims to reduce emissions in several sectors, including power, transport, oil and gas, cooking, and industry. The ETP was revised and updated in 2024 to incorporate recent data and policy developments.

The government expects the ETP to support widespread job creation, with an estimated 340,000 jobs created by 2030 and up to 840,000 jobs by 2060. Nigeria views natural gas as a transition fuel and as key to its shift away from dirtier fossil fuels. However, to achieve its aims, the government will need to establish new green energy industries and attract investment for large-scale projects.

During the Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum 2025, the government signed contracts with a value of $435 million to expand the country’s renewable energy capacity. The agreements are expected to support the creation of 1,500 direct jobs across the country. Several state governments made deals with local and international renewable energy companies to develop solar, hybrid, and recycling projects to support power generation. Vice President Kashim Shettima said that $23 billion in funding was required in the short term to provide reliable power to millions of Nigerians without access to power.

To attract higher levels of investment to the sector, the government has committed to incentivising local production, streamlining regulations, and encouraging public-private partnerships.

Nigeria has significantly expanded its solar power industry in recent years, aiming to benefit from its abundant sunlight. In October, Nigeria’s Energy Commission signed a strategic partnership with the Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi to develop a solar panel plant with up to 1 GW of production capacity. This followed a visit to the Longi headquarters earlier in the month during which Longi “expressed strong interest in investing in Nigeria and demonstrated readiness to advance concrete plans for the construction of the factory.”

This is the latest of several solar manufacturing sites announced by the government. In September, Nigeria’s Rural Electrification Agency (REA) partnered with the Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria and the Dutch solar manufacturer Solarge BV to establish a special purpose vehicle for the construction and operation of a 1 GW solar panel manufacturing plant in Nigeria.

Meanwhile, in March, the REA signed a deal with Lagos-based renewables developer Oando Clean Energy to develop a 1.2 GW solar assembly plant. The government has also discussed the possibility of introducing a ban on solar panel imports to help encourage local production. Technology Minister Uche Nnaji stated, “We have lithium in abundance here in Nigeria, so Mr President is already taking action… We are adding value to our raw materials.”

As Nigeria’s oil industry continues to face a multitude of challenges, the government is starting to drive investment in the country’s renewable energy sector. In addition to the expansion of its renewable energy capacity, the government is also looking at how to add value to its raw materials and ramp up manufacturing activities to drive economic growth.

In brief A Bonk ETP has begun trading on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange, issued by Bitcoin Capital.

The product lets retail and institutional investors access Solana-based meme coin BONK through standard brokerage platforms.

BONK is currently the seventh-largest meme coin by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.

Solana-based meme coin Bonk (BONK) has begun trading on Switzerland's third-largest stock exchange, through a newly launched exchange traded product, adding another regulated crypto offering to Europe's expanding digital asset market.

Swiss-based crypto ETP issuer Bitcoin Capital issued the BONK ETP on SIX Swiss Exchange, allowing investors to gain exposure to the token through traditional brokerage accounts, according to an announcement shared with Decrypt.

As a subsidiary of Swiss asset-management boutique FiCAS AG, Bitcoin Capital launched the world's first actively managed Bitcoin ETP in 2020.

Switzerland's regulatory framework and market infrastructure for admitting crypto ETPs made it the “preferred venue for the launching a BONK ETP,” Marcel Niederberger, Chief Executive Officer at Bitcoin Capital & FiCAS told Decrypt.

"Europe, and specifically the SIX Swiss Exchange offers a highly developed regulatory environment with consistent supervisory practices," he said.

“The product will reach both institutional and retail investors through established broker platforms,” Niederberger said, noting that regulated ETP access tends to boost investor confidence and liquidity, with most inflows across Bitcoin Capital’s existing products still coming from institutional desks.

He anticipates “continued expansion of regulated products referencing BONK” next year, as maturing European infrastructure and rising appetite for thematic digital assets open the door to “additional ETPs and structured notes.”

BONK sits near $0.0599, up 3.5% on the day, ranking as the seventh-largest meme coin by market value per CoinGecko data.

﻿

Dogecoin leads activity

The Bonk listing follows a surge of meme coin products entering regulated markets mainly in the United States, dominated by Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin by market cap.

In September, the Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF became the first U.S. fund to hold DOGE, while asset manager Grayscale launched its spot GDOG product last week, generating approximately $1.4 million in first-day trading volume.

REX Shares also filed for a BONK ETF in January, alongside other meme coin products.

Meanwhile, 21Shares unveiled a 2x leveraged Dogecoin ETF on the Nasdaq last week, while Bitwise's Dogecoin ETF, BWOW, received approval from NYSE Arca on Tuesday for listing and registration.

[TITLE]8.2% GDP growth signals expanding economic momentum:
[TEXT]
Mohammad Hanief

India’s economy has recorded an impressive GDP growth rate of 8.2% in the second quarter of the 2025-26 financial year, reaffirming the country’s position as one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. This achievement comes at a time when global markets remain unsettled by geopolitical tensions, inflationary waves, and uneven recovery in advanced economies. India’s economic performance, driven by renewed domestic confidence and structural policy support, stands out as a marker of stability and resilience in a turbulent global environment.

The union government has welcomed the newly released figures, describing them as a reflection of the country’s expanding economic capacity and the effectiveness of ongoing reforms. The Prime Minister has noted that such growth underscores the contribution of India’s workforce, entrepreneurs, and industry, while also highlighting the positive trajectory created by sustained policy initiatives. He has reiterated that the government remains committed to advancing reforms and strengthening systems that improve the ease of living for citizens, ensuring that the benefits of growth extend across all sections of society.

India’s economic expansion is characterised by a broad revival across multiple sectors. Domestic demand remains one of the strongest drivers of growth. Urban consumption continues to rise steadily, buoyed by expanding employment opportunities, improved digital access, and enhanced spending capacity. Services associated with travel, communication, retail, and hospitality have seen a substantial revival after a period of prolonged disruption, while emerging service areas such as digital finance and healthcare continue to expand. This transition reflects a shift toward more technology-driven consumption patterns, which in turn support new business models and job creation.

Rural consumption, though influenced by seasonal variations and price fluctuations, has maintained overall resilience. Agricultural stability in several regions, supported by rural infrastructure improvements, has contributed to steady spending patterns. Smaller towns and semi-urban centres have also become important growth nodes, creating new consumption clusters that broaden the base of economic activity beyond traditional metros.

India’s industrial landscape has shown renewed dynamism. Manufacturing has strengthened, supported by higher production levels, sustained demand for domestic goods, and increased confidence among businesses. Policy incentives encouraging domestic manufacturing have attracted fresh investments into sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, renewable-energy components, and automotive products. The shift in global manufacturing preferences, with companies seeking diversified and stable supply chains, has increased India’s appeal as a potential industrial hub.

The construction sector continues to be one of the strongest pillars of the current growth phase. Nationwide infrastructure expansion-covering highways, express corridors, rail modernisation, port upgrades, airport development, and urban housing-has generated wide-ranging economic activity. These initiatives not only propel demand for construction materials but also play a crucial role in employment creation. The scale of public infrastructure spending has produced a ripple effect across allied industries, generating incentives for private participation and supporting thousands of small and medium enterprises connected to supply chains.

India’s investment climate has also strengthened. A sustained rise in capital formation indicates growing confidence among investors. Public-sector expenditure on infrastructure, digital connectivity, and energy systems has laid the foundation for long-term economic momentum. A series of reforms implemented over recent years-ranging from improvements in tax compliance to digitisation of administrative services-have contributed to a more transparent and predictable business environment. These measures have helped streamline processes, reduce barriers, and increase the ease with which businesses operate.

Financial institutions have shown improved health, with stronger balance sheets and rising credit flows to priority sectors. Lending to small and medium enterprises has expanded, supported by government-backed credit mechanisms. This has enabled smaller businesses to participate more effectively in the recovery process and further strengthened the interconnected structure of the economy. Digital payments continue to grow rapidly, deepening financial inclusion and enabling quicker business transactions across rural and urban areas alike.

Even as India’s domestic sectors show strong results, the global environment remains mixed. Export sectors face external pressures due to slower international demand and fluctuations in commodity markets. Despite these headwinds, India has managed to maintain a steady export performance by expanding its presence in sectors such as engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and electronics. Agricultural exports have also shown resilience in several categories. Traditional export industries, including textiles and gems and jewellery, continue to be affected by global market softness, but the diversification of export baskets has helped reduce overall impact.

The services export sector remains one of India’s most stable global strengths. Technology services, business process management, consulting, and financial services continue to attract international demand. India’s skilled workforce, growing digital capacity, and expanding knowledge sectors have played a key role in maintaining a strong services export position, even during periods of global uncertainty.

Employment trends, while still adjusting to pre-pandemic patterns, show gradual improvement. The expansion of construction and manufacturing has supported large-scale labour absorption, particularly in urban and semi-urban regions. The services sector has opened significant opportunities across varying skill levels, supported by the growth of logistics, retail, education, digital platforms, and healthcare. The rise of gig-based and platform-based employment has diversified income opportunities for young workers, particularly in urban centres. At the same time, government initiatives aimed at skill development and digital training continue to bridge gaps between labour supply and industry demand.

Inflation remains a concern, particularly in food categories influenced by seasonal and supply-chain disruptions. Although core inflation has moderated, food prices continue to fluctuate, affecting household budgets. Policymakers maintain a cautious approach to inflation management, balancing price stability with the need to sustain growth. The Reserve Bank of India’s approach has remained focused on ensuring stability in the financial system while providing monetary conditions that support economic expansion.

The government has emphasised that the recent GDP performance reinforces the importance of continuing reforms and strengthening the ecosystem that enhances ease of living. Efforts are under way to improve digital access, expand affordable housing, enhance transportation infrastructure, and increase access to healthcare and social protection. A key focus moving forward will be ensuring that the benefits of economic growth translate into tangible improvements in quality of life and reduced disparities across regions and social categories.

Looking ahead, India’s economic prospects remain robust. The combination of strong domestic demand, renewed industrial activity, expanding services, and sustained investment forms a stable foundation for the coming quarters. The government’s approach-anchored in policy continuity, infrastructure expansion, and reform-driven governance-seeks to create conditions that support long-term growth. While global uncertainties will continue to influence external sectors, India’s structural strengths and diversified economic base position it favourably among emerging economies.

The 8.2% GDP growth rate is more than an indicator of short-term recovery; it signals a broader economic transformation under way. It reflects the growing strength of sectors that have adapted to new realities, the contribution of citizens and businesses across the country, and the policy environment that continues to push for greater transparency, efficiency, and inclusion. As India moves further into the fiscal year, the economic narrative is marked by confidence and a renewed sense of possibility, with a clear national focus on ensuring that growth translates into improved opportunities and living standards for all.

Ahmedabad: Exactly fifteen years ago, on November 19, 2010, then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi launched Khel Mahakumbh to promote sports across the state.On November 26 this year, Gujarat's Deputy Chief Minister Harsh Sanghavi took to social media to announce that "India has officially been awarded the hosting rights for the 2030 Commonwealth Games."While expectations had been building for some time, the formal announcement in Glasgow has now pushed Ahmedabad onto a fast-track development path ahead of the games four years from now.According to CREDAI Gujarat President Tejas Joshi, the event will trigger a major infrastructure upgrade in the city alongside strong growth in the real estate and hospitality sectors."Ahmedabad is already a smart city, and now with the Games, a major restructuring is on the way," Joshi told ET. Connectivity and road infrastructure will see significant improvement, he said, adding that real estate in the city could expand by 25-30% in the next couple of years."Ahmedabad is opening up as a major investment option for players across the country, and one can expect considerable migration to the city for new opportunities," he said, noting that this would also boost affordable housing. The city and adjoining areas currently clock 35,000-40,000 housing units annually, and he expects this number to rise sharply.The state government, he added, is focusing on seamless mobility. "We already have a Comprehensive Mobility Plan under implementation that will integrate travel across metro, BRTS and other modes," said Banchhanidhi Pani, Commissioner, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, who was part of the delegation to Glasgow. Road-widening and pending metro work are being completed, he said, adding that with a Climate Control Cell in place, measures are underway to ensure cleaner air.A major new sports facility - the Veer Savarkar Sports Complex (Naranpura Sports Complex) - inaugurated last September by the Union Home Minister, is expected to play a central role. Built at a cost of ₹824 crore, the complex spans 82,507 sq. m with a built-up area of 1.18 lakh sq. m, features four major buildings, six functional zones and extensive parking, and is billed as the largest sports complex in India. Designed to international standards aimed at the 2036 Olympics, it has already been approved to host global events such as the Asian Aquatics Championships and the World Weightlifting Championships.The city is also gearing up to develop two major integrated sports hubs - including the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave (SVPSE), which will serve as the central hub for the Commonwealth Games and anchor Gujarat's long-term sporting ecosystem. The enclave is planned to house an arena, aquatic centre, tennis courts, training zones, athlete villages and facilities for swimming, basketball, cricket, artistic gymnastics, diving and volleyball. Construction is scheduled to begin in April next year and is expected to be completed by late 2028 or early 2029.A second sports hub at the Police Academy in Karai is set to host high-performance disciplines within a similar timeframe.The hospitality sector is also bracing for rapid expansion. Industry leaders estimate that the Games will generate more than 50,000 jobs in Ahmedabad alone.Narendra Somani, President of the Hotel and Restaurants Association (HRA) of Ahmedabad, said the city currently lacks adequate hotel capacity for the expected surge in visitors. "We will need an additional 4,000 rooms in the five-star category and around 6,000 rooms in two- and three-star hotels," he said, adding that at least six top-end hotels are already under construction and many more are likely to follow. "At the very least, this will create 50,000 new jobs - and the number could be much higher."Somani said the industry now expects the state government to introduce a policy to support the upcoming boom."These developments, once completed, will also strengthen Ahmedabad's bid for the Olympic Games," he added. Earlier in Glasgow, Ashwani Kumar, Principal Secretary (Sports, Youth and Cultural Activities), had also linked the state's long-term ambition to host the 2036 Olympics, calling the Commonwealth Games a strategic stepping stone.

[TITLE]Nigeria Bets Big on Renewables as Oil Troubles Deepen:
[TEXT]
For decades, Nigeria’s oil industry has faced a multitude of challenges. Despite having vast quantities of crude, the mismanagement of revenue, weak agreements with international oil companies, an underinvestment in infrastructure, and widespread oil theft have left many opposed to the ongoing production of crude. Now, Nigeria has high hopes for its renewable energy sector, as it looks to diversify its energy sources and boost energy security over the coming years.

Oil theft has long been a problem in Nigeria, affecting both the financial gain from oil projects and health and safety in the sector. A committee, established earlier this year, assessed some of the oil sector’s challenges in Nigeria, including oil theft, bunkering operations, illegal export networks, and alleged compromises within regulatory and security systems. The committee published a report on its findings, which suggested that the government could significantly mitigate the country’s oil losses.

Satellite and agency tracking revealed at least 589 oil leaks across Nigeria in 2024, most of which were due to theft and sabotage. The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative estimated that, over 12 years, Nigeria lost 619.7 million barrels of oil, with a total value of $46.2 billion. In addition, Nigeria lost approximately $1.84 billion worth of petroleum products from its refineries over nine years.

While the government seeks to make its oil industry safer and more efficient, and, importantly, more profitable, many Nigerians are calling for the government to abandon its oil ambitions in favour of clean energy sources. While the government continues to back fossil fuels, it also sees a future for Nigeria in green energy, having set a target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 during the COP26 climate summit.

Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan (ETP) led the way for the passing of the country’s Climate Change Act in 2021. The government then established the Energy Transition Office to oversee the implementation of the ETP, with a focus on six pillars – improved energy access, poverty reduction, modern energy access, job preservation, a sustainable transition, and legislation. The ETP aims to reduce emissions in several sectors, including power, transport, oil and gas, cooking, and industry. The ETP was revised and updated in 2024 to incorporate recent data and policy developments.

The government expects the ETP to support widespread job creation, with an estimated 340,000 jobs created by 2030 and up to 840,000 jobs by 2060. Nigeria views natural gas as a transition fuel and as key to its shift away from dirtier fossil fuels. However, to achieve its aims, the government will need to establish new green energy industries and attract investment for large-scale projects.

During the Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum 2025, the government signed contracts with a value of $435 million to expand the country’s renewable energy capacity. The agreements are expected to support the creation of 1,500 direct jobs across the country. Several state governments made deals with local and international renewable energy companies to develop solar, hybrid, and recycling projects to support power generation. Vice President Kashim Shettima said that $23 billion in funding was required in the short term to provide reliable power to millions of Nigerians without access to power.

To attract higher levels of investment to the sector, the government has committed to incentivising local production, streamlining regulations, and encouraging public-private partnerships.

Nigeria has significantly expanded its solar power industry in recent years, aiming to benefit from its abundant sunlight. In October, Nigeria’s Energy Commission signed a strategic partnership with the Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi to develop a solar panel plant with up to 1 GW of production capacity. This followed a visit to the Longi headquarters earlier in the month during which Longi “expressed strong interest in investing in Nigeria and demonstrated readiness to advance concrete plans for the construction of the factory.”

This is the latest of several solar manufacturing sites announced by the government. In September, Nigeria’s Rural Electrification Agency (REA) partnered with the Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria and the Dutch solar manufacturer Solarge BV to establish a special purpose vehicle for the construction and operation of a 1 GW solar panel manufacturing plant in Nigeria.

Meanwhile, in March, the REA signed a deal with Lagos-based renewables developer Oando Clean Energy to develop a 1.2 GW solar assembly plant. The government has also discussed the possibility of introducing a ban on solar panel imports to help encourage local production. Technology Minister Uche Nnaji stated, “We have lithium in abundance here in Nigeria, so Mr President is already taking action… We are adding value to our raw materials.”

As Nigeria’s oil industry continues to face a multitude of challenges, the government is starting to drive investment in the country’s renewable energy sector. In addition to the expansion of its renewable energy capacity, the government is also looking at how to add value to its raw materials and ramp up manufacturing activities to drive economic growth.

Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday stressed that India's aviation sector is poised for rapid growth over the next decade.He highlighted the key role of institutions like the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) in supporting the government's "whole-of-government approach" with strong private-sector participation.Speaking after the virtual inauguration of the HAP Airframe Fabrication Facility and NAviMet here, Singh said the government has been very forthcoming in engaging the private sector to the maximum extent."Most of the success stories written over the last 10 to 11 years of Prime Minister Modi's tenure can be attributed to the involvement and participation of the private sector. This is true across fields-biotechnology, vaccines, the first-ever antibiotics-all developed with private-sector engagement. The same applies to space," he said, citing the recent Skyroot launch.Referring to CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories' (CSIR-NAL) two-seater trainer aircraft Hansa-3, Singh recalled being present at the technology-transfer ceremony held in New Delhi in April this year and expressed satisfaction with the pace of progress."Today, we are witnessing the aircraft actually being developed. Within just five or six months, the pioneer team has achieved remarkable progress, and they have truly been pioneers in this field," he said.Noting that India's civil aviation sector is expanding rapidly, the minister said it is estimated that by 2027, the country will handle around six crore passengers.Recalling Prime Minister Modi's early remark that "Hawai chappal wala Hawai jahaj mein chalega (The man wearing hawai chappals will fly in an aeroplane)," Singh said the UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) scheme was launched to make that vision possible. He added that an ecosystem that is cost-effective and inclusive is essential."Accordingly, the number of airports has increased significantly.

Aerospace companies set to get more capital market support as reusable rockets make headway

Global Times

By Chu Daye Published: Nov 28, 2025 10:46 PM

Six Chinese commercial aerospace companies had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus from June 18 to November 27, the Securities Daily reported on Friday, amid faster growth in China's commercial aerospace sector and launches being scheduled for several reusable carrier rockets in the coming months.

Chinese industry insiders and financial experts said more commercial aerospace companies are set to receive further support from the capital market as China's commercial aerospace industry moves from the technological exploration phase to commercialization.

The Securities Daily reported on Friday that six commercial space companies, including Chinese private space firms LandSpace, Galactic Energy, CAS Space, Space Pioneer, Yee Space and Mino Space, have had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus.

The IPO progress has come amid China's increasing policy support for the sector. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced in June a new sci-tech growth tier on the country's Nasdaq-style Science and Technology Innovation Board, also known as the STAR Market.

The regulator also called for more support for companies in cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence and commercial aerospace, such as more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market, in light of industrial development and market demand.

Beijing-based LandSpace said in a statement sent to the Global Times that it is set to launch its ZQ-3 reusable rocket at the end of November. Industry analysts said this will be a key step in the mastering of heavy duty, low cost and reusable rockets by Chinese private space firms.

Space Pioneer, another Beijing-based aerospace company, is also preparing for a launch for its Tianlong-3 reusable rocket, according to the South China Morning Post. The rocket is expected to be used to build China's massive internet satellite constellations, the report said.

A Beijing-based venture capital investor surnamed Liu told the Global Times on Friday that there has been a marked rise in market attention toward the commercial aerospace sector, given the policy support and recent progress made in the industry. "The new policies are also a boon for earlier-stage investors looking for an exit strategy," Liu said.

Tian Lihui, professor of finance at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Friday that listing can not only address the financing challenges faced by enterprises and secure funding for continuous research and development input, but also guide capital toward companies with genuine technical strengths and commercial potential. It will also promote the healthy development of the industry, Tian noted.

The CSRC's call for more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market precisely addresses the chokepoint for commercial aerospace - high R&D investment and long profitability cycles - by opening up more capital market channels for the industry, Tian said.

Further policy support came on Tuesday, when China's space agency released an action plan to back commercial space firms and encourage them to pursue international cooperation over the next two years.

The document released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said the country's commercial space enterprises should "go global" and help developing countries to build satellite-application industries.

Among the supportive measures, the CNSA will establish a national commercial space development fund and local governments will be urged to establish technology-innovation centers focused on reusable rockets and smart satellites, and to build open platforms for advanced manufacturing, final assembly and testing.

The plan aims to achieve high-quality commercial space development by 2027. The recommendations for the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) list the aerospace sector among China's strategic emerging industries.
