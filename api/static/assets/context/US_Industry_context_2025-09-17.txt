[TITLE]Tim Cook details how Apple will put its $600 billion domestic manufacturing investment to work:
[TEXT]
In an interview Friday with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Apple CEO Tim Cook discussed the Phone maker's plans to follow through with its enormous investment in domestic manufacturing, emphasizing semiconductor production in the U.S.

"You can add a lot by making it global and then stitching together the end-to-end supply chain in semiconductors," Cook said. "I can't stress how important this is and how much that will add to what we're doing."

In total, Apple has said it will spend $600 billion on manufacturing in the U.S. over the next four years, including a $2.5 billion expansion of its partnership with Corning , which makes glass for iPhones and Apple Watches at its factory in Kentucky. Apple also said it would work with a number of different companies to grow domestic semiconductor production, including Taiwan Semiconductor , Texas Instruments and Applied Materials .

According to Cook, Apple already does "business with 9,000 different partners across the U.S." and "is in all 50 states with these suppliers," adding that this work has created 450,000 jobs. Cook said the tech giant is "very proud to be expanding that further this year to the $600 billion level."

Apple is taking steps to train more manufacturing workers, Cook said, mentioning that the company opened its own "Manufacturing Academy" in Detroit last month. According to a

[TITLE]Will big investment promises bring back US manufacturing?:
[TEXT]
Listen to the article 10 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Many Fortune 500 companies have announced multibillion-dollar investments since Trump took office in January, but time will tell whether the administration’s policies are truly supporting domestic manufacturing.

Some of these multibillion-dollar pledges come from prominent manufacturing companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple and AstraZeneca, promising to establish or expand operations in the United States.

The White House has taken credit for these announced commitments, calling it the “Trump Effect.” The Trump administration claims that its tariff policies “have generated significant investment,” leading to “incentivizing manufacturing,” according to a Sept. 5 White House fact sheet.

However, some of these investments have either already been announced or have been in the works since the Biden administration, The Wall Street Journal reported in July. For example, defense startup Anduril Industries raised $1.5 billion in a series F funding round in August 2024 to scale autonomous weapon system manufacturing. Fast forward to Jan. 16, four days before Trump’s inauguration, and Anduril announced it chose Ohio to build its $1 billion manufacturing facility.

Another company on Trump’s credit list, recycled paper and packaging company Pratt Industries, pledged a $5 billion commitment to “reindustrialize America.” However, the company committed to the multibillion-dollar investment in November 2022.

While these investments — new or old — aim to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and create thousands of jobs, it remains to be seen how long it will take for these commitments to come to fruition. Many of Trump’s tariffs have gone into effect, with more to be negotiated.

Additionally, Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” into law, which allows bonus depreciation for qualifying equipment and offers research and development deductions.

Different sectors, big gambles

Whether the most recent investments and high-fee tariffs are bringing back manufacturing depends on the industry, experts said.

“From the time a company decides to build a new factory, and the time it’s open, it could be three to five years, and the policies could be completely changed,” said Susan Spence, chair of the Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Business Survey Committee.

Changes may come to the tariffs already in place. Last month, a federal appeals court ruled that Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose broad tariffs was illegal, but delayed any action until mid-October in anticipation of a Supreme Court review. The Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to an expedited hearing on the legality of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners.

On a micro-industry level, it also depends on factors such as competition within sectors like semiconductors, said Brian Albrecht, chief economist at the International Center for Law and Economics.

“There's even a difference between what Texas Instruments is doing and what TSMC is doing,” Albrecht said. While large investments such as Texas Instruments’ $60 billion investment are always a big gamble, it’s too early to tell how successful it will be. In Texas Instruments’ case, it holds 15% of the global analog chips market share, according to AInvest.

A company like TSMC, for example, has mastered what it’s doing in Taiwan, Albrecht added. In March, TSMC announced it was adding $100 billion to the previously pledged $65 billion investment to expand its manufacturing footprint in Arizona.

TSMC dominates the semiconductor sector, holding 70.2% of the world’s market share per a Sept. 1 report from market research firm Trend Force. However, it’s still a gamble for TSMC to go outside of Taiwan and replicate that success in the U.S. as it could encounter supply chain risks such as natural disasters and a volatile geopolitical climate.

“That’s one of the reasons that you have things like the CHIPS [and Science] Act and other investment incentives to try to encourage this, especially domestically,” Albrecht said.

TSMC finalized $6.6 billion in CHIPS Act funding in November 2024 and Texas Instruments finalized $1.6 billion the following month.

Still, if it were a completely bad idea, even with or without incentives like the CHIPS Act, TSMC would have never taken the chance.

“But it's obviously not a guarantee. Otherwise, everyone would be trying to do it,” Albrecht said.

‘People stay still’

Since March, Trump has announced and implemented tariffs on several global trade partners and various sectors.

Duties on imports from Mexico and Canada have been delayed for the second time. While semiconductors and related products are exempt from reciprocal tariffs, the Trump administration in April initiated a Section 232 investigation into semiconductor imports. Trump said last month he would be imposing 100% tariffs on semiconductors but has not yet set a date on when the levies will be put into action.

The word “whiplash” is often used in ISM surveys, Spence said.

“There’s uncertainty. People stay still. They don't invest,” Spence said. “They don't hire if they can possibly get away with holding on, because if they're gonna have to take a [loss], then they want to look at their other controllable costs, and labor is a big one, right? So I don't see that going away until the certainty happens.”

Spence said she doesn’t think things will pay off if manufacturers are not confident in what the economic policies are going to be, if they’re going to stick.

“The other question is, when tariffs finally do get settled and get into play, is it a one-time hit or not? There are more questions than answers,” she said.

Colin Grabow, associate director at the Cato Institute’s Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, said at a Brookings Institution panel in July that the current tariff “is entirely antithetical to a vibrant manufacturing sector,” as it’s far removed from “manufacturing in the 21st century.”

“I suppose that some of the logic that animates the Trump administration’s approach is that it's pretty straightforward,” Grabow said. “You put tariffs on foreign goods, put them at a competitive disadvantage, that creates space for American manufacturers to fill that void.”

Adam Hersh, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said at the same Brookings Institution panel that Trump’s tariff actions and his “One Big Beautiful Bill” will not fix any of manufacturing’s problems, such as regulation costs and investing in human capital.

He added that businesses do not invest because capital costs are low, but rather, they invest where there’s a demand for the product.

“Just lowering the cost of capital is not going to do anything to stimulate investment in manufacturing, particularly when the policies of this administration have created so much economic uncertainty, as well as undermining the consumptive power,” Hersh said.

Moreover, Hersh said tariffs can be and have been used as an important tool to support manufacturing and industrial development, but that the levies “have to be done right” in a way that supports key industries and not impact “downstream industries.”

The ongoing need for raw materials and components imports

Although companies — foreign and domestic — are establishing and expanding operations and pivoting their supply chain to the U.S., manufacturers still rely on access to global markets for raw materials, components and parts to sustain their operations.

Companies that have operations scattered across the world benefit from each location’s “comparative advantage to efficiently produce and manufacture,” Grabow said.

“So when you increase tariffs, you are raising the cost of these vital inputs for American manufacturers and putting them on the back foot,” Grabow added.

A 2022 Commerce Department report found that U.S. manufacturers sourced 69% of their intermediate inputs from domestic suppliers, while nearly one-third of intermediate inputs were imported. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative reported that approximately 94% of U.S. merchandise imports by value are industrial goods.

For example, Apple announced a commitment to invest an additional $100 billion to the previously announced $500 billion, which will fund expansions across 10 states.

While a lot of the components for Apple’s products will be made in the U.S., final assembly will still be completed “elsewhere for a while,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at a White House event.

Cook has explained in the past why much of Apple’s production is done overseas, particularly in China, stating that the quantity and certain skills are necessary to manufacture its products.

[TITLE]Customer Retention 2.0: The Value Multiplier Every CX Leader Needs:
[TEXT]
The Gist

Capital’s new reality. Expensive capital and the high cost of customer acquisition demand a strategic shift to profitable retention to drive organic growth.

Expensive capital and the high cost of customer acquisition demand a strategic shift to profitable retention to drive organic growth. The value multiplier. A focus shift to delivering quantifiable value brings deep insights and produces a multiple dollar benefit to every invested dollar.

A focus shift to delivering quantifiable value brings deep insights and produces a multiple dollar benefit to every invested dollar. Activating advocates. The ultimate benefit of the Value Multiplier is transforming loyal customers to increase lifetime value and develop brand advocates.

During the era of Zero Interest Rate Policies (ZIRP), the working rules for capital, investment and return expectations were far less constricting than they are today. Now, both customers and organizations operate in an environment where every invested dollar must produce a quantifiable return.

But with customer acquisition being more expensive than ever, how can businesses execute a strategy that both expands their customer base and delivers on financial requirements?

The Value Multiplier is a customer retention strategy that increases the quantified value of your existing customer base while unlocking new opportunities for lasting partnerships and organic growth. By alignng your strategy with solving customer problems and delivering measurable performance, you can realign your retention program to meet the business needs of your customers and satisfy the demands of a capital-constrained market.

Let's explore how traditional retention programs can benefit from implementing the Value Multiplier to drive customer value and overcome the capital constraints that we face.

Table of Contents

Capital’s Relationship with Your Customer

More than any other company asset, it’s capital that most directly dictates your ability to acquire, retain and serve your customers. As ZIRP has ended, both companies and customers have experienced a profound shift in perspective. What was once viewed as an unlimited financial opportunity has now transitioned into a more rigorous and structured approach to investment.

This new reality makes a strategic focus on customer retention more critical than ever. Let’s delve deeper into capital’s relationship with your customer and explore why delivering quantifiable value is becoming the new measure for business success.

Demanding a Required Return

The investment landscape is no longer the open, free-flowing environment it once was. As the price of capital has risen, so too has the demand for a healthy, quantifiable return on that investment. With many markets experiencing increased volatility, the required rate of return is now also rising.

This has prompted a significant transition in investment behavior; what was once a more lavish and liberal approach has been replaced with a rigor, structure and cadence built on demonstrating concrete value and investment return.

Capital’s Real Attributes: Expensive & Scarce

The capital landscape is one where the real attributes of capital are both expensive and scarce. As every dollar undergoes intense scrutiny, companies face a crucial dilemma: there is a limited pool of available investment capital, while an increasing number of compelling initiatives are competing for those funds.

This situation renders the "grow-at-all-costs" model unsustainable. Instead, there is a shift toward a more strategic approach that focuses on maximizing value from existing assets, with a clear emphasis on profitability and sustainable growth.

The Customer Shift: The Retention Focus

The new reality of demanding high returns and managing expensive, scarce capital inevitably forces a fundamental shift in how we view and engage our customers. To secure the organic growth needed for survival, companies must now do so more cheaply and more efficiently than ever before.

This is why a focus on customer retention, by prioritizing the existing customer base, aligns the limitations companies face while simultaneously focusing on delivering tangible value that is a multiplier of the customer's initial investment.

Customer Retention: 3 Leading Edge Benefits of a Quantified Value Focus

The best-performing retention programs aren't just built on strong relationships; they're built on a quantifiable alignment to what truly matters—both to your customer and your organization. More than simply being available to your customer, retention programs that drive tangible value do so by identifying and addressing a real need, whether it's related to revenue growth, expense management or brand loyalty.

Let's explore the three key, leading-edge benefits that a quantified value focus will deliver to your customer retention program.

[TITLE]Nation’s largest commuter rail system averts possible strike as unions ask Trump for help:
[TEXT]
By PHILIP MARCELO, Associated Press

NEW YORK (AP) — A potential strike has been averted that could have shut down the nation’s largest commuter rail system this week.

Unionized workers for the Long Island Railroad announced they voted overwhelmingly Monday to authorize their labor leaders to call a strike if an agreement on a new contract isn’t reached.

But officials representing locomotive engineers, machinists, signalmen and other train workers said they’ve also asked President Donald Trump to intercede by forming an emergency board that delays the potential for a strike at least for a few more months.

Union leaders said the earliest a strike could happen is in January while the Presidential Emergency Board, once formed, reviews the contract dispute and presents its recommendations.

A strike, which could have happened as early as Thursday under federal rules, would have impacted some 250,000 riders who ride the LIRR to work each day to and from New York City and its eastern suburbs.

A work stoppage would have also thrown a wrench in the Ryder Cup, which begins Sept. 26. The three-day men’s golf tournament between players from the U.S. and Europe is expected to bring 225,000 spectators to Bethpage State Park in Farmingdale on Long Island.

“This action does not mean a strike won’t happen, but it does mean it won’t happen now,” said Gil Lang, general chairman for the union representing LIRR locomotive engineers, at a news conference at the union’s office in Manhattan on Monday.

“We will continue to be the adults in the room,” he added. “A strike is the last thing we want, and we’ll do everything we can to avoid that.”

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the LIRR and other area transit systems, dismissed the union’s announcement as a “cynical delay” that “serves no one.”

“If these unions wanted to put riders first, they would either settle or agree to binding arbitration,” spokesperson John J. McCarthy said in a statement. “And if they don’t want to strike, they should say so — and finally show up to the negotiating table.”

The agency and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul had resisted calling for an emergency board even though they have the power to do so.

Instead, the MTA announced plans last week to provide commuters with free shuttle buses to take them from some LIRR train stations to subway stops in the New York City borough of Queens in the case of a strike.

Hochul, a Democrat, has also blamed the Trump administration in recent days for the prospect of a strike, even as she’s called on both sides to resume negotiations.

Spokespersons for the White House and the U.S. Department of Transportation didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The last LIRR worker strike happened more than three decades ago and lasted

[TITLE]UAW workers reach tentative deal with GE Aerospace at Ohio, Kentucky plants:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) - Members of the United Auto Workers union at GE Aerospace's Evendale, Ohio, and Erlanger, Kentucky, facilities have reached a tentative agreement with the company, the union said on Friday.

Workers secured victories on all fronts - job security, health care costs, and time off, the UAW said in a statement on Saturday. It said GE will cover nearly all health care premium increases over the term of the contract and workers will receive additional vacation time.

The tentative agreement covers a five-year term and secures strong job security protections for both Erlanger and Evendale locations, including minimum headcount and new work, the statement said.

On Friday, the UAW said in an X post that members will vote on ratification on September 19. Until then, all picket lines will continue.

"We are pleased to have reached a tentative agreement with the UAW covering employees at our Evendale and Erlanger facilities and we look forward to continuing to work side-by-side to serve our customers," a GE Aerospace spokesperson said in response to a Reuters query.

In late August, over 600 workers from the union went on strike after failing to reach a new contract agreement with the company.

The strike marked the latest flashpoint in a broader wave of labor actions across the aerospace and aviation industries, where unions have sought to leverage demand for skilled workers into better contracts.

Pilots, flight attendants, machinists and engineers have all pushed for higher pay and tougher job protections in recent years.

GE's Evendale plant builds marine and industrial engines for the U.S. Navy, while the Erlanger facility supplies parts to some of the company's engine plants.
