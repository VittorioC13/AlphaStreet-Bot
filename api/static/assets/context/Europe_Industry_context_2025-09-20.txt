Rome: Dorf Ketal , one of the biggest global manufacturers and suppliers of specialty chemicals, is in advanced negotiations to buy Italmatch Chemicals SpA of Italy for $1.6 billion from current owners Bain Capital , said people in the know. Both sides have entered deal exclusivity talks and hope to finalise shareholder terms (SPA) in the next few weeks before a formal announcement is made at the month end, they said.The ambitious move, which will be the Mumbai-headquartered company’s biggest acquisition if successful, underscores the consolidation trend in the industry since last year. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co agreed to take over Germany’s Covestro AG in a €12 billion deal in 2024. Last October, Lone Star signed an agreement to sell specialty chemicals company AOC to Nippon Paint Holdings Co. Closer home, JSW Paints acquired a lion’s share of Akzo Nobel’s India business for $1.6 billion.Dorf Ketal (DK) was founded in 1992 by first-generation entrepreneurs and brothers Subodh and Sudhir Menon, who run the company. It’s a leader in the hydrocarbons chemicals value chain — oil and gas exploration, refining, petrochemicals and downstream retail fuel pumps — with a global portfolio and diverse applications across industrial segments.The company, which is privately held, posted a domestic revenue of Rs 5,479 crore in FY24. Revenue for the six months to September 2024 was Rs 2,961.3 crore.Dorf Katel vice chairman Subodh Menon and Bain Capital declined to comment. Mails sent to Italmatch did not generate a response till presstime.The Italmatch acquisition is aimed at diversifying into adjacencies and offering a wider range of products and services, said the people cited. Genoa-based Italmatch operates in four key business segments — water and oil treatment; lubricants, flame retardants and plastic additives; performance products; and personal care. The company led by chief executive officer Sergio Iorio has doubled down on specialty chemical additives used to produce flame retardants and fabric softeners as well as lubricants and water treatment. It has a strong presence in the US and operates 20 manufacturing plants globally, including nine in the EU. That would complement Dorf Katel’s worldwide footprint.In FY24, as per industry sources, Dorf Ketal had made a bid for Pune-based Aquapharm Chemicals, predominantly for its water treatment business, which is a key area for the Menons as well. The company was eventually acquired by Kolkata-based Phillips Carbon Black Ltd. (PCBL), part of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group.Dorf Ketal had been planning an IPO and even filed a DRHP but that was withdrawn last week on account of this transaction.Interestingly, the company's CEO Iorio will be rolling over his stake to ensure management continuity.“Italmatch’s foray into the water segment is what is especially attractive for Dorf Katel. Chemicals used in water treatment in the ethanol industry or even oil and gas refining is a fast-growing segment that Dorf wants to capitalise on,” said an executive in the know. “DK has grown inorganically and its ambitions too have been rising as it has been successful in integrating their global buys.”Since 2003, DK has made at least a dozen acquisitions, buying units and divisions from companies as diverse as ExxonMobil, UOP, Clariant’s North American land oil business to local firm Khyati Chemicals and Pune-based Elixir Soltech. Most of its R&D, product knowhow and IP has been acquired through M&As, posing an entry barrier for competitors. In 2022, it expanded to Latin America, one of the largest oil-producing regions in the world and the fastest-growing in pulp, with strong potential for developing sustainable chemistries derived from plant-based sources like ethanol, soy and other crops.The Italian company too has gone through several rounds of private equity ownership. Bain Capital acquired control of Italmatch from Ardian SAS in 2018. Subsequently, it sold a minority stake in Italmatch to Saudi Arabian Industrial Investments Co, also known as Dussur. Under Bain, Italmatch has expanded through organic growth and bolt-on deals. It signed a binding agreement in 2024 to purchase a majority stake in Brazilian rival Alcolina, which specialises in water treatment for bioethanol, sugar production and industrial applications. The US buyout fund has also helped the company to double earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda). FY24 revenue touched €686 million with sales volumes rising 8% from the previous year. Adjusted ebitda rose 17% from € 115 million to €134 million, as per a July 2025 announcement, while contribution margin grew 10%, reaching € 276 million versus €251 million in the previous year. It also has €690 million of outstanding bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Italmatch has historically grown through M&As and has made several acquisitions in the water additives and lube additives space. The business has managed to maintain a 20-21% ebitda margin profile despite a challenging business environment in chemicals globally, said the industry executive cited above. One of Dorf Ketal's biggest strengths has been the R&D and product knowhow - majority of the IP has been acquired through their M&As (Fluid Energy, UOP Inc, DuPont and Johnson Mathey) and has acted as big entry barrier for competitors. The Menons have also been savvy buyer of oilfield and specialty chemical businesses around the world and has generally known to be a value buyers.Morgan Stanley is advising Dorf Ketal as well as solely underwriting the entire financing.One of the obvious synergies for Dorf Ketal would be to move some of the EU-based manufacturing and rationalise the sites. Over the years, it has become a ‘wells to wheels’ company, delivering solutions across every stage of the value chain, from extraction to end-use.Its plants are located in India, Brazil and Canada in addition to contract manufacturing capabilities in the Netherlands. It’s R&D units are in India, Brazil, Singapore and Canada, with several marketing offices across the world."Global speciality chemical deals of a certain critical size (> $100 mn EBITDA) have been priced in the 10-14 (x) EV / EBITDA range," said Navroz Mahudawala, founder Candle Patners, an advisory firm. "However considering the current ongoing challenges in the chemical sector esp in Europe a buyer may get better pricing compared to traditional historical multiples and most sellers may be more realistic in terms of valuations. The ongoing year (CY 2025), has been challenging for most companies across various segments and we definitely will see a decline in EBITDA margins for most speciality chemicals companies."The market for global specialty chemicals has increased from $1.03 trillion in 2021 to $1.14 trillion in 2023 and is estimated to further go up to $1.43 trillion in 2028 owing to an increase in demand from end-use industries such as automotive, construction, electronics, pharmaceuticals and food and beverages. Europe is a significant market for specialty chemicals.

[TITLE]NVIDIA Announces £2 Billion Investment in the United Kingdom AI Startup Ecosystem:
[TEXT]
News Summary:

NVIDIA commits £2 billion to catalyze the U.K.’s AI startup ecosystem and accelerate the creation of new companies, jobs and globally transformative AI businesses.

Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court will join NVIDIA’s investment in the U.K. market, underscoring their commitment to foster the U.K. AI ecosystem.

The investment will bring new capital and advanced AI infrastructure to major U.K. hubs like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester — empowering researchers and developers across the country to scale the next generation of AI businesses.

LONDON, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced an investment of £2 billion in the U.K. market to catalyze the nation’s AI startup ecosystem and scale the next generation of globally transformative AI businesses. The new capital will be used to foster economic growth, develop more innovative AI technologies, create new companies and jobs, and empower the U.K. to compete in the AI market globally.

Scaling AI companies in the U.K. has been challenging due to limited access to supercomputing, constrained venture capital outside London, rising energy costs and difficulty for VCs to access leading academic institutions, where many researchers are also entrepreneurs. NVIDIA, in collaboration with Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton Capital, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court, will accelerate the U.K. AI ecosystem by providing new capital for AI startups.

“This is the age of AI — the big bang of a new industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “The United Kingdom is in a Goldilocks moment, where world-class universities, bold startups, leading researchers and cutting-edge supercomputing converge. There has never been a better time to invest in the U.K. — AI is unlocking new science and sparking entirely new industries. With new capital and advanced infrastructure, we are doubling down to empower the U.K. to lead the next wave of AI innovation.”

The investment will expand access to capital in key U.K. economic centers, AI growth zones and deep technology ecosystems like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester. NVIDIA’s investment, combined with new, world-class AI infrastructure, will empower researchers and developers nationwide, fueling the launch and growth of AI startups.

“NVIDIA’s investment is a major vote of confidence in the U.K. both today and long into the future,” said U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. “By backing our startups, empowering our researchers and connecting capital with talent, this partnership will create jobs, spark new industries and ensure the U.K. remains at the forefront of global AI leadership.”

NVIDIA is committed to working closely with the U.K.’s leading company founders and VCs — especially in London, home to world-renowned academic AI labs — and partnering with top U.K.-based funds to ensure capital and compute reach the most ambitious entrepreneurs and most dynamic regions, including the U.K. government’s newly announced AI growth zone.

Following NVIDIA’s recent commitment to manufacturing up to a half-trillion dollars’ worth of AI supercomputers in America, the investment will be domiciled in the United States and activated in the United Kingdom, celebrating the transatlantic partnership between the two countries. NVIDIA is purposefully investing in the U.K.’s future, unlocking opportunities for the next generation of British innovators.

“In collaboration with NVIDIA, we're accelerating the growth of U.K. AI startups,” said Sonali De Rycker, partner at Accel. “World-class compute and fresh capital will empower the next wave of entrepreneurs and AI startups, create new jobs and further enable the U.K. to compete in the AI race. The U.K. has long been a hotbed for AI talent, with a strong community of researchers, founders and world-class universities, and this new investment will supercharge the AI flywheel.”

“We’ve embarked on a new journey where scaling AI unlocks capabilities that, when we started in this industry over a decade ago, would have been considered magic,” said Nathan Benaich, general partner at Air Street Capital. “The U.K. has world-class talent and research, but the infrastructure has not kept pace. This commitment aims to bridge that gap by providing U.K. founders with the resources needed to build globally significant AI companies.”

“We are in the midst of a seismic technology shift as people and companies around the world increasingly depend on more intelligent hardware and software,” said James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital. “The U.K. is fortunate to be home to some of the teams and companies leading that wave. The challenge facing us, however, is how to overcome constraints like the cost of energy or ability to access compute. Investment from firms like Balderton and companies like NVIDIA will help smooth the path, so more global winners can be built and thrive here in the U.K.”

“The U.K. has the talent, research institutions and entrepreneurial drive to build world-leading AI companies — but turning breakthrough ideas into global impact requires collective action,” said Hussein Kanji, founder and partner at Hoxton Ventures. “We’re thrilled to partner with NVIDIA to commit resources to help Britain’s brightest founders commercialize their innovations and build the next generation of transformational AI companies.”

“Britain has the science and the talent. This collaboration with NVIDIA puts capital and computing power in their hands to scale globally,” said Saul Klein, founder and executive chair of Phoenix Court. “With nearly 800 venture-backed U.K. companies generating revenues of over $25 million, the opportunity now is to back the next wave of truly differentiated AI companies solving real-world challenges.”

[TITLE]Putting fizz into PepsiCo: weighing up activist advice for US giant:
[TEXT]

“We hope this presentation is received in the spirit in which it is shared,” Elliott Investment Management partners Jesse Cohn and Marc Steinberg wrote in a letter to PepsiCo’s board at the start of the month setting out how the activist investor believes the US giant can improve.

That spirit, they added, was one of “a desire to work together to help PepsiCo build on its legacy of success and achieve its full potential”.

They continued: “We have deep respect for the company and its leaders and, while we support the steps PepsiCo has recently announced, we and our fellow shareholders believe that there is an opportunity for much more. Our goal is to collaborate with the board and management to return PepsiCo to its rightful place as a market-leading consumer packaged goods powerhouse with superior results and impact.”

It was, at face value, a constructive opening salvo. “Fortunately for PepsiCo, its problems are within its power to address. Its core brand portfolio remains among the most attractive in the CPG industry and its structural moats are as powerful as ever,” Cohn and Steinberg said.

“Elliott’s goals at PepsiCo are straightforward: help the company sharpen focus, drive innovation, become more efficient and unlock the value that its leading brands, unmatched scale and world-class employees deserve. The path back to winning is clear and achievable.”

However, given Elliott Investment Management’s record at sparking change elsewhere, PepsiCo’s senior leadership would be forgiven if they were a little concerned at what might lie ahead.

[TITLE]Indie studio bets on new game after buying freedom from Sega:
[TEXT]

Kilian FICHOU

French developer Amplitude knows that “every game could be the last” as it prepares a big bet on a new strategy title less than a year after buying its independence back from Sega.

With the games industry enduring weak growth in recent years, it’s rare and risky for smaller operators to separate from a larger entity.

“When you’re independent, you have to be crystal clear that every game could be the last,” said Romain de Waubert de Genlis, the head of the Paris-based outfit.

His team of 50-odd developers are days away from releasing an early-access version of “Endless Legend 2” for PC, ahead of the polished final product sometime next year.

Founded by former workers at French games juggernaut Ubisoft, Amplitude made a name for itself with different games bearing the “Endless” label, from space-faring empire builder “Endless Space” in 2012, to the original fantasy strategy title “Endless Legend” in 2014.

Sega bought up the studio in 2016 in an effort to take on the strategy genre’s unstoppable force, the “Civilization” series, and Amplitude’s 2021 effort “Humankind” was generally well received.

But an industry-wide slowdown after the pandemic lockdowns pushed Sega into trimming its more than 8,000 employees worldwide, slashing hundreds of jobs in Europe and selling off Canadian studio Relic Entertainment.

– Crisis into opportunity –

Scenting opportunity, Amplitude negotiated its own separation, securing the rights to its intellectual property and keeping on around 170 staff.

“We would never have been able to leave Sega” without the crisis, boss de Waubert de Genlis said of the management buyout that was also backed by around 30 employees and some outside investors.

The split took almost 18 months before becoming official in November 2024, leaving Amplitude with around “one year of runway” to achieve independent cruising speed, the 50-year-old chief added.

This May, Amplitude scored a 12 million-euro ($14 million) capital raise, including from French public investment bank Bpifrance and American specialist investment fund Griffin Gaming Partners.

“What was at stake was continuing to make the type of game that we’re good at,” de Waubert de Ganlis said.

The team had feared that staying with Sega would leave them forced into working on projects far outside their expertise, or expose them to the rolling layoffs.

– ‘Standing over an abyss’ –

The terms of the separation allowed Amplitude to hang on to its “Games2Gether” platform, a messaging service with more than two million users offering the developers feedback on issues like game balance and new features.

“It’s this community-based development that really sets us apart from other studios,” said creative director Jean-Max Moris.

In its lifetime, Amplitude says it has sold 12 million copies of its six games, with each costing between 10 and 25 million euros to develop.

More than 300,000 gamers have already added “Endless Legend 2” to their wishlist on the Steam PC gaming platform, which the team has taken as encouragement for their leap in the dark.

Going independent has really created a sense of “standing over the abyss”, Moris said.

“When you belong to a publisher, if a game tanks there’s still a safety net.”

Amplitude are still working on another as-yet-unannounced title and an animated series set in the “Endless” universe, developed with British production company Passion Pictures — hoping that spreading its bets can safely lift it into independent flight.

[TITLE]Large number of Irish officials went to major London arms fair to meet British defence experts:
[TEXT]
A LARGE CONTINGENT of Irish military officers and civil service personnel travelled to a major arms fair in London last week as work continues on the purchase of new equipment for the Defence Forces – including, potentially, new vehicles, ships and aircraft.

The Journal has learned that more than a dozen people made the journey to the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) event, which is a British Government-backed showcase of military hardware.

They were a joint Defence Forces and Department of Defence team and included senior officers as well as civil servants who are directly involved in the decision-making process.

The government have stressed the need for increased investment in the military amid an increasing number of threats to the country. The trips was part of a major modernisation programme, after the Commission on the Defence Forces report of 2022 found glaring deficiencies in Irish capabilities.

Sources said the team who travelled had a series of meetings with British experts and the Ministry of Defence in London.

It is understood that some of the topics discussed at the event were around naval procurement as well as issues like the command structure and design of the army.

A British company offered assistance around the buying of a new multi-purpose naval vessel and showcased their Type 31 Frigate. Previously The Journal has reported that Irish Navy experts are keen to examine the purchase of such frigates as they proceed with plans to procure a Multi Role Combat Vessel.

The army contingent, along with their colleagues in the Department of Defence, also had meetings with British experts in force design. It’s understood the British assessments were that the army would have to double in size beyond the plan currently envisaged by Irish defence reports in order to meet mission requirements.

The information gathered on the trip will be fed back into the redesign of the structures of the Defence Forces currently underway and to the team selecting the new equipment.

It has also been confirmed that a team from DOD travelled to the Paris Air Show, which is one of the world’s foremost displays of military and civilian aviation equipment.

A source said that the Irish Air Corps are close to launching a competition to find new medium lift helicopters to replace their current ailing fleet of AgustaWestland 139s. It is believed this purchase and other aircraft were examined on that trip.

[TITLE]Europe’s Impossible Choice: AI Development or Net Zero?:
[TEXT]
Guest essay by Steve Goreham

This year, European nations announced plans to pursue artificial intelligence. National leaders announced AI spending goals totaling hundreds of billions of euros in efforts to catch up to the United States. But AI requires huge amounts of electrical power, conflicting with Europe’s commitment to achieve a Net Zero power grid.

Since ChatGPT released their AI chatbot in November of 2022, artificial intelligence has exploded. In only two years, the AI revolution became the driving force in the US high-tech industry. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and other firms will spend over $100 billion this year building and upgrading data centers to run AI. Nvidia, the dominant supplier of AI graphics processor units (GPUs), became the most valuable company in the world, its market capitalization soaring from $300 billion to $4.3 trillion in less than three years.

Artificial intelligence requires vast amounts of electricity. AI processors run 24 hours a day, enabling computers to think like humans. When servers are upgraded to support AI, they consume 6 to 10 times more power than when used for cloud storage and the internet. Data centers consumed 4% of US power at the start of 2024 but are projected to consume 20% within the next decade.

The need for new generating capacity for AI now drives US electricity markets. Coal-fired power plant closures have been postponed in Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and other states. Nuclear plants are restarting in Iowa, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Dozens of small modular reactors are on the drawing board. More than 200 gas-fired plants are in planning or under construction, including more than 100 in Texas. Companies building AI data centers are constructing their own on-site power plants, unwilling to wait for grid power. The pursuit of artificial intelligence is rapidly replacing obsolete US Net Zero policies.

For more than 25 years, Europe enacted policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in order to try to “mitigate” dangerous human-caused climate change. The European Green Deal of 2019 seeks to make Europe the first “climate-neutral continent.” The European Climate Law of 2021 provides legal force for the European Green Deal, calling for a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and for achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050. Nations have been installing wind and solar facilities and closing traditional power plants to reduce emissions. Today,

[TITLE]Can the UK fast-track nuclear power without cutting corners on safety?:
[TEXT]
Before the pomp of President Trump’s state visit to the UK, Washington and London announced a series of collaborations on nuclear research and regulation. A reminder to cynics that perhaps these events have some substance.

Britain is already undergoing a nuclear revival. Large power stations are under construction (albeit much delayed) at Sizewell in Suffolk and Hinkley Point in Somerset. Rolls Royce has been confirmed as the supplier for a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs). These reactors use similar technology to the big power plants, but with all components designed to fit into a single container.

Now, as part of the US-UK deal, we can add proposals to build 12 advanced modular reactors (AMRs), using fundamentally different technology, in Hartlepool.

The UK’s nuclear regulator is therefore being asked to consider radically different designs on a scale and pace never before seen. That’s partly why, as part of the deal, the two countries have agreed to accept each other’s safety checks. The government claims this will “halve the time for a nuclear project to be licensed”. The question is whether this can be done as safely.

PrasitRodphan / shutterstock

The US and UK take fundamentally different approaches to nuclear regulation.

The US’s Nuclear Regulation Commission (NRC) takes a “prescriptive” approach. It sets detailed rules based on its own research and enforces them directly.

Like police setting speed limits, the regulator decides the standards and then ensures nuclear operators meet them. If an accident happens, operators can point to meeting every requirement as evidence they followed the rules. They could even legitimately blame the regulator.

The UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) takes a “descriptive” approach. It sets broad standards but leaves operators to prove how they will meet them.

In road terms, the US sets the speed limit and checks drivers obey it. The UK simply says cars must stay on the road, leaving drivers to decide their own limits, prove they’re safe, and take full responsibility if they crash.

These two approaches are driven to a large extent by the two country’s history and make up of their nuclear industries.

The US has a few standard reactor designs, many operators, and vast federal research labs. The UK has fewer, often state-owned (or foreign state-owned) operators running bespoke reactors fleets, with in-house expertise.

The result is that the US’s regulator – the NRC – is large, well-funded, and deeply involved in design and research. The UK equivalent – the ONR – is smaller and focused on critically reviewing the judgement and processes of the operators.

Both systems have worked well. Nuclear regulation and the associated safety record in both countries is regarded as being among the best in the world.

Why collaboration now matters

A sudden surge of new nuclear in the UK would make closer alignment with US regulators more attractive. If the US has already assessed a proposed power plant design, the UK regulator could potentially rely on that evidence rather than duplicate the work. This would avoid bottlenecks and speed up approvals.

The aviation sector already does something similar. Aircraft are certified by either the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the European Union Aviation Safety Authority (EASA), with airlines around the world trusting those approvals.

There is a strong element of reciprocity, driven by the need for aircraft to fly from one nation to another. The approach makes sense, as it would be absurd for every airline or national regulator to retest the same Airbus wing. Nuclear power, some argue, should move in this direction.

The risk of imported risk

But there are dangers in relying too heavily on foreign regulators. The Boeing 737-Max scandal, in which software error caused two near-identical accidents and left 346 dead, exposed the need to get regulation right. Political pressure and weak oversight at the FAA contributed to design flaws being missed. If the UK simply rubber-stamped US approvals, it could import these risks too.

The nuclear industry has an extra history of mistrust. The US’s 1946 McMahon Act restricted the sharing of nuclear data between the US and UK, and a number of British spies were exposed in the US. Civilian and military technologies overlap, and there is a desire to prevent nuclear proliferation.

So while UK-US collaboration could boost Britain’s nuclear industry and accelerate the path to low-carbon energy, independence and transparency will be essential. Any perception of corner cutting or transatlantic political interference could undermine public trust and derail Britain’s nuclear ambitions.

[TITLE]Algoma Steel Announces Upsizing of Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility:
[TEXT]
SAULT STE. MARIE, Ontario, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Algoma Steel Group Inc. (“Algoma” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ASTL; TSX: ASTL), a leading Canadian producer of hot and cold rolled steel sheet and plate products, today announced that it has amended its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) to increase the aggregate commitments under its asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Facility”) from US$300 million to US$375 million.

The incremental US$75 million in new commitments is being provided by Export Development Canada (EDC), which joins the Company’s existing lending syndicate as a direct lender under the ABL Facility. This transaction is part of a broader set of liquidity initiatives Algoma is pursuing to strengthen its financial position and provide flexibility to navigate evolving market conditions.

“Despite the challenging market conditions brought on by tariffs, this upsizing of our ABL Facility, and the addition of EDC to our banking group, provides Algoma with enhanced financial flexibility to support our operations and strategic priorities,” said Rajat Marwah, Chief Financial Officer of Algoma. “The continued support of our lenders, Wells Fargo and BMO Capital Markets, and the participation of EDC reflect confidence in Algoma’s transformation to Electric Arc Furnace steelmaking and our long-term competitiveness as a sustainable Canadian steel producer.”

The ABL Facility will continue to be secured by a first-priority lien on accounts receivable, inventory, and related assets of Algoma and its subsidiaries, and remains subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement.

[TITLE]DP World’s $29m Bet on Egypt’s Cold Storage:
[TEXT]
North Africa and the Middle East are in the middle of a cold chain explosion. The market is expected to reach $41.1 billion by the end of 2030 with a compound annual growth rate of 8.8%, according to BCC Research. DP World has unveiled plans for a state-of-the-art cold storage facility in Egypt, specifically, the country’s Al Oula region.

The investment, pegged at around $29 million (roughly 1.4 billion Egyptian pounds), will see the construction of a 174,311 square feet warehouse within the Elsewedy Industrial Park. Eight temperature-controlled chambers will house refrigerated and frozen goods, fruits, vegetables, and dairy, among them, with a capacity for 25,000 pallet positions.

Mohammad Shihab, general manager of DP World Egypt, described the project as “a major step in strengthening Egypt’s cold chain capabilities and creating new opportunities for trade and industry.”

The facility arrives at a time when Africa’s food storage infrastructure remains painfully sparse, covering less than 30% of annual production. The lack of adequate cold chain solutions contributes to severe post-harvest losses; nearly 40% of perishable goods and 20% of other food products are lost each year somewhere along the supply chain.

This development highlights more than just new brick and mortar; it shows Egypt’s ambition to plug one of the continent’s biggest economic leaks. For companies across the agricultural sector, predictable access to cold storage can mean the difference between profit and ruin.

For consumers, it promises fresher produce and a more reliable supply. But constructing the facility is only half the challenge. Ensuring smooth operations, power, maintenance, transportation linkages, skilled workforce will be what determines whether this investment pays off or joins the long list of under-utilized infrastructure projects.

If structured and managed well, it might set the standard for cold storage on the continent. But much will depend on governance, regulatory support, and the ability to integrate into regional and global trade networks. Only then can such infrastructure move from promise to performance.

Those promises need to move quickly as the BCC research indicated five core drivers behind the rapid growth of cold chain in Northern Africa and the Middle East.

It is understood that some of the topics discussed at the event were around naval procurement as well as issues like the command structure and design of the army.

A British company offered assistance around the buying of a new multi-purpose naval vessel and showcased their Type 31 Frigate. Previously The Journal has reported that Irish Navy experts are keen to examine the purchase of such frigates as they proceed with plans to procure a Multi Role Combat Vessel.

The army contingent, along with their colleagues in the Department of Defence, also had meetings with British experts in force design. It’s understood the British assessments were that the army would have to double in size beyond the plan currently envisaged by Irish defence reports in order to meet mission requirements.

The information gathered on the trip will be fed back into the redesign of the structures of the Defence Forces currently underway and to the team selecting the new equipment.

It has also been confirmed that a team from DOD travelled to the Paris Air Show, which is one of the world’s foremost displays of military and civilian aviation equipment.

A source said that the Irish Air Corps are close to launching a competition to find new medium lift helicopters to replace their current ailing fleet of AgustaWestland 139s. It is believed this purchase and other aircraft were examined on that trip.

Electric aviation awaits a battery breakthrough

1 day ago Share Save Adrienne Murray & James Brooks Technology Reporters Share Save

Beta Technologies Alia on the way to Stavanger in Norway

An aviation rarity touched down in the Norway's second city of Bergen earlier this month. Alia had flown 100 miles (160km) in 55 minutes on battery power alone. Built by US aerospace company Beta Technologies, the electric plane is designed for cargo operations - carrying up to 560kg (half a tonne) loads. The flight had simulated a planned cargo route between the coastal cities of Stavanger and Bergen, and for the next few months test-flights will be carried out, as part of the country's move towards establishing low-emission aviation. At the helm was pilot Jeremy Degagne, "If you do the drive, it's four and a half hours. And we did the flight in 52 minutes." "It is an important milestone for Norway as an international test arena," says Karianne Helland Strand, a director at Norwegian airport operator, Avinor. The test-flights in Norway follow a whirlwind European tour, which kicked off in Ireland, and saw Alia debut at the Farnborough and Paris Air Shows, as well as making stops in Germany and Denmark.

Beta Technologies Alia has a range of 400km

Alia can fly up to 400km (250 miles) on a single charge, and refuel in less than 40 minutes by plugging-in, just like an electric car. The same fixed-wing model can be configured for medical transport or passenger travel with up to five seats, and this June it undertook the first electric demonstration flight carrying passengers into New York's JFK airport. Beta, which counts Amazon as an investor and UPS as a customer, hopes to get US certification for its plane this year. "I'm convinced that the next major breakthrough in aerospace will come on the back of electric propulsion," says Beta's chief revenue officer Shawn Hall, who's a former fighter pilot. "We're now able to significantly lower the operating cost and it's environmentally beneficial from a carbon perspective."

Alia is one of the most advanced projects, among dozens of firms exploring electric propulsion in aviation. It would be one way of reducing the aviation industry's carbon footprint - which currently accounts for 3% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Pipistrel Velis Electro remains the only electric plane to receive full certification from European authorities, despite clearing that hurdle five years ago. With a range of 185km and 50 minutes of flight time, the Slovenian-built Pipistrel is limited to training and not for shuttling passengers from A to B. But successes like that have been overshadowed by a string of failures in electric aviation. Even aviation giant Airbus has backed away from the market. In January it announced that development of its CityAirbus electric aircraft would be put on hold.

Airbus Development of the CityAirbus is on hold

Range remains the major limitation to electric flight. Even the best lithium ion batteries are bulky and heavy, with much lower energy density than jet fuel. They have "not improved significantly" over the past two decades, reckons Guy Gratton, an aviation expert and professor at Cranfield University. For electric flight to take-off, a "revolution" in battery chemistry is needed, he says. Given those limitations, some are looking at alternative technology. Just as hybrid cars were a stepping stone towards electric vehicles; plane-makers are now also experimenting with hybrid technology. Among the aviation start-ups trying to get electric passenger planes off the ground, is Heart Aerospace. It recently shifted its entire operations from Sweden to the US, which its management said would help it focus "resources" and be closer to clients, including the airlines Mesa and United. The firm has developed a 30-seater, prototype plane, the X1, which the BBC saw before it was shipped to the United States. If all goes to plan during upcoming test-flights, it will become the largest battery-powered plane to fly. "It has about two tons of batteries in it," explained chief technology officer Benjamin Stabler.

Heart Aerospace Heart plans a hybrid plane that can switch between batteries and jet fuel

For its real-world operations, though, Heart is adopting a fundamentally different design: a hybrid plane, powered by batteries, but carrying fuel as backup. "You don't need as [many] batteries," argues Mr Stabler, which makes it lighter and cheaper, and also allows for more paying passengers. "For a normal route, it would fly all-electric from takeoff to landing," he explained. "If you want to go a longer distance, or if there's a diversion, you can switch over to the turbines." The aircraft could travel 200km in electric-only flight. With the hybrid technology, which is scheduled for test-flights in 2026, it could fly 400km with 30 passengers, or up to 800km with 25, the firm claims. "Public transport flying, quite rightly, requires a significant amount of energy reserve," says Prof Grattan. "So hybridisation and the use of conventional fuels to carry safety reserves makes good sense," adds the professor, who has previously advocated this approach.

Heart isn't alone in this field. US-based aerospace startup Electra expects its nine-seater hybrid plane to take flight by 2029, running on a combination of jet fuel and electric power. Beta Technologies is also pursuing hybrid aircraft for defence and civilian purposes. Its first model was built in 2023, and later this year it plans to produce a plane that is not only hybrid but autonomous. "Are we excited about hybrid? 100%," says Mr Hall. "It's a way to get longer ranges, today, and you still get a lot of the environmental benefit." A fully electric foundation is necessary first argues Mr Hall, "you then layer on hybrid technology". Hybrid systems have lower emissions than conventional aircraft and the electric motors would enable quieter take off and landing in urban areas.

[TITLE]Trump and Starmer sign a tech deal before holding private talks on tariffs and war:

AYLESBURY, England (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday signed what he called a historic agreement on science and technology with Britain as United Kingdom officials who have gone all out to impress him with royal pageantry during his state visit now try to deliver key trade and business deals that can further their country’s interests.

Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer held a roundtable with business leaders as they signed the deal. They also had private meetings where the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and tariff rates the U.S. may set on steel imported from Britain were expected to be discussed. At a subsequent joint news conference, Starmer said, “While we shape this bond for a new era, the fundamentals have not changed.”

Trump said he was “tremendously thankful” for the hospitality during his visit and that King Charles III and Queen Camilla are “two fantastic people.”

At the earlier signing ceremony for an agreement meant to promote tech investment in both nations, Starmer referred to the American president as “my friend, our friend” and spoke of “leaders who respect each other and leaders who genuinely like each other.” The event took place at Chequers, a 16th-century manor house northwest of London that serves as a rural retreat for British leaders.

The British charm offensive continued after the king and queen had feted Trump and first lady Melania Trump at Windsor Castle, on Wednesday. The royals used the first of the Trump’s two-day state visit to offer all the pomp the monarchy can muster: gold-trimmed carriages, scarlet-clad soldiers, artillery salutes, a glittering banquet in a grand ceremonial hall and the biggest military honor guard ever assembled for such a state visit.

Trump has seemed grateful for all the attention — so much so that he has largely stuck to script and offered little of his typical off-the-cuff criticism of hosts.

Still, he had his moments. Trump joked with his treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, as he signed the tech deal, “Should I sign this Howard? Scott? If the deal’s no good I’m blaming you.”

After bidding goodbye to the king and queen at Windsor — Trump called the monarch “a great gentleman, and a great king” — the Trumps flew by helicopter some 20 miles (32 kilometers) to Chequers. The Republican president was welcomed by ceremonial honor guard complete with bagpipers — a nod to Trump’s Scottish heritage — and shown items from the archive of wartime leader Winston Churchill, who coined the term “special relationship” for the bond between the allies.

It’s a point that Trump’s British hosts have stressed, almost 250 years after that relationship endured a rocky start in 1776.

Trump told business leaders at a reception at Chequers that the two countries shared an “unbreakable bond.” Starmer said that relationship “is the very foundation of our security, our freedom and our prosperity.”

Trans-Atlantic tech partnership

To coincide with the visit, Britain said U.S. companies had pledged $204 billion in investment in the U.K, including $122 billion from investment firm Blackstone in the next decade. Investment will also flow the other way, including almost $30 billion by pharmaceutical firm GSK in the U.S.

At the reception, attended by tech bosses including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and U.S. officials such as Lutnick and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Starmer said it was “the biggest investment package of its kind in British history by a country mile.”

U.K. officials say the deal will bring thousands of jobs and billions in investment in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and nuclear energy. It includes a U.K. arm of Stargate, a Trump-backed AI infrastructure project led by OpenAI, and a host of AI data centers around the U.K. American companies are announcing $42 billion in investment in the U.K.’s AI sector, including $30 billion from Microsoft for protects including Britain’s largest supercomputer.

British officials say they have not agreed to scrap a digital services tax or water down internet regulation to get the deal, some details of which have yet to be announced.

The British government is learning that when it comes to deals with Trump’s team, the devil is in the details. In May, Starmer and Trump struck a trade agreement that reduced U.S. tariffs on Britain’s key auto and aerospace industries.

But talks on slashing duties on steel and aluminum to zero from their current level of 25% have stalled, despite a promise in May that the issue would be settled within weeks.

The British Chambers of Commerce said failure to cut the tariffs would be “greeted with dismay” by the British steel industry.
