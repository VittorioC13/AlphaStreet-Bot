[TITLE]Trump keeps saying he’s ‘defeated’ inflation but coffee is 21% more expensive and groceries just had their largest non-pandemic jump in a decade:
[TEXT]
Inflation has risen in three of the last four months and is slightly higher than it was a year ago, when it helped sink then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign. Yet you wouldn’t know it from listening to President Donald Trump or even some of the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve.

Trump told the United Nations General Assembly late last month: “Grocery prices are down, mortgage rates are down, and inflation has been defeated.”

And at a high-profile speech in August, just before the Fed cut its key interest rate for the first time this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said: “Inflation, though still somewhat elevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. Upside risks to inflation have diminished.”

Yet dismissing or even downplaying inflation while it is still above the Fed’s target of 2% poses big risks for the White House and the Federal Reserve. For the Trump administration, it could find itself on the wrong side of a potent issue: Surveys show that many Americans still see high prices as a major burden on their finances.

The Fed may be taking an even bigger gamble: It has cut its key interest rate on the assumption that the Trump administration’s tariffs will only cause a temporary bump up in inflation. If that turns out to be wrong — if inflation gets worse or remains elevated for longer than expected — the Fed’s inflation-fighting credibility could take a hit.

That credibility plays a crucial role in the Fed’s ability to keep prices stable. If Americans are confident that the central bank can keep inflation in check, they won’t take steps — such as demanding sharply higher pay when prices rise — that can launch an inflationary spiral. Companies often increase prices further to offset higher labor costs.

But Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said this week that with memories of pandemic-era inflation still fresh and tariffs pushing up the cost of imported goods, consumers and businesses could start to lose confidence that inflation will stay low.

“If that proves to be the case, in hindsight it will be that the Fed cuts — and I do expect several more — are going to be seen as a mistake,” Dynan said.

So far, the Trump administration’s tariffs haven’t lifted inflation as much as as many economists expected earlier this year. And it remains far below its 9.1% peak three years ago. Still, consumer prices increased 2.9% in August from a year earlier, up from 2.6% at the same time last year and above the Fed’s 2% target.

The government is scheduled to release the September inflation report on Wednesday, but the data will probably be delayed by the government shutdown.

Tariffs have pushed up the cost of many imported items, including furniture, appliances, and toys. Overall, the cost of long-lasting manufactured goods rose nearly 2% in August from a year earlier. It was a modest gain, but comes after nearly three decades when the cost of such items mostly fell.

The cost of some everyday goods are still rising more quickly than before the pandemic: Grocery prices moved up 2.7% in August from a year ago, the largest gain, outside the pandemic, since 2015. Coffee prices have soared nearly 21% in the past year, partly because Trump has slapped 50% import taxes on Brazil, a leading coffee exporter, and also because climate change-induced droughts have cut into coffee bean harvests.

Most Fed officials are still concerned that inflation is too high, according the minutes of its Sept. 16-17 meeting. Yet they still chose to cut their key interest rate, because they were more worried

WASHINGTON — Inflation has risen in three of the last four months and is slightly higher than it was a year ago, when it helped sink then-Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.

[TITLE]Prime Day was supposed to kick off holiday shopping, but was more about stocking up on essentials:

ZDNET's key takeaways

Only 23% of shoppers bought gifts during October Prime Day.

Meanwhile, 28% of shoppers said they purchased everyday items.

The most popular products purchased by ZDNET readers were inexpensive tech devices.

Shoppers used this week's Prime Big Deal Days sale, which ran from Oct. 7-8, to stock up on sale items and purchase everyday goods instead of big holiday gift purchases, according to a new tracking survey of over 5,000 October Prime Day shoppers conducted by data company Numerator.

Also: The best October Prime Day deals still live

In September, Amazon said the Prime Big Deal Days event was meant to launch the 2025 holiday shopping season. "Prime Big Deal Days kicks off the holiday shopping season with exclusive deals for Prime members on must-have items and popular gifts," said Carmen Nestares, vice president of North America Marketing and Prime Tech, in the September release. The sale, however, seemed to point toward a different reality.

A recent survey from our sister site CNET found that of those planning to shop early for the holidays, 56% planned to do so between August and October. However, according to the Numerator data, 28% of October Prime Day shoppers purchased everyday goods, like groceries or household items, 25% stocked up on sale items, and 45% purchased an item they've been waiting to buy on sale. The top shopped categories were also all essentials.

Numerator reports the top categories shoppers say they bought during the first day of Prime Big Deal Days were apparel and shoes (26%), household essentials (26%), home beauty & cosmetics (22%), health & wellness items (21%), and home goods (21%). These are similar to numbers reported in Numerator's July Prime Day survey.

Also: Over half of holiday tech shoppers concerned by price hikes and tariffs, CNET survey finds

With turbulent economic conditions, the upcoming holiday season, and growing inflation, it's no surprise that shoppers focused on essentials. According to CNET's survey, nearly 87% of those planning to shop for tech products this year said they are worried

Donald Trump’s fortress economy is starting to hurt America: The pain coming from trade and immigration restrictions cannot be postponed forever

Posted on by SeekAndFind

Brick by brick, President Donald Trump is building a wall around the world’s largest economy. As America’s tariff barriers on everyone else have gone up, so has the drawbridge, making it harder for migrants to enter the country.

The president wants to turn America into a fortress that keeps out foreign incursions. In fact, he is cutting America off from the very goods and talent that helped make its economy the envy of the world. Already the damage is starting to show; once wreaked, it will not easily be reversed.

That is not how investors see it. In the six months since “Liberation Day”, when Mr Trump slapped tariffs on America’s trading partners, financial markets have swung from panic to euphoria. Elsewhere the picture is mixed. Inflation has risen only a little, as America’s importing businesses have absorbed much of the tariff pain. Although employment has stagnated as migration flows have stopped, America’s economy will probably grow by 1.5-2% in 2025.

Some of the explanation for this resilience is that average tariffs are not as high as was feared, in part because of rollbacks and in part because trade flows are adapting fast. In April analysts were warning of America’s average tariff rate reaching 28%. By August, however, customs revenue raised at the border pointed to a rate of only 11%. It also helps that few countries other than China have retaliated at scale against American duties. Big economies including Britain, Japan and the European Union have struck deals that reduce Mr Trump’s proposed tariffs, without levying their own.

The president is fortunate, too, that America is in the middle of an astonishing stockmarket boom, fuelled by optimism

[TITLE]USA Truck Market Outlook to 2029: Strategic Urban Hubs and Infrastructure Investments Further Bolster Logistics Networks, Shaping a Promising Future:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "USA Truck Market Outlook to 2029" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The USA Truck Market was valued at USD 800 billion, based on a five-year historical analysis. This growth is primarily driven by the increasing demand for freight transportation, e-commerce expansion, and the need for efficient logistics solutions. The market has seen a surge in the adoption of advanced technologies, including telematics and automation, which enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs.

The USA Truck Market is characterized by intense competition among several key players, including companies like J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Schneider National, and Knight-Swift Transportation. These companies leverage advanced technologies and extensive logistics networks to maintain their market positions. The market is moderately concentrated, with a mix of large national carriers and smaller regional players, all striving to enhance service quality and operational efficiency.

The USA Truck Market is poised for significant transformation driven by technological innovations and evolving consumer demands. As electric and alternative fuel trucks gain traction, the industry is expected to see a shift towards more sustainable practices. Additionally, the integration of autonomous technologies will likely enhance operational efficiency. With ongoing investments in infrastructure and logistics, the market is set to adapt to new challenges while capitalizing on emerging opportunities in the coming years.

Key players in this market include major cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas, which serve as critical logistics hubs due to their strategic locations, extensive transportation networks, and proximity to major ports. These cities facilitate the movement of goods across the country, making them vital to the overall growth of the truck market.

In 2024, the U.S. EPA finalized stricter greenhouse gas emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks, known as Phase 3, effective for model years 2027-2032. These performance-based, technology-neutral regulations aim to cut emissions by

[TITLE]Diwali 2025: How credit card offers can backfire and smart ways to stay safe:
[TEXT]
As we build up to Diwali 2025 and the enthusiasm lights up the markets, banking institutions and e-commerce platforms are rolling out glittering credit card offers and deals to lure new customers.

Still, beneath the sparkle lie financial pitfalls, complications, and the threat of debt that can burn through post-festival budgets faster than diyas and crackers. Here are five credit card traps you must understand and guard against.

The ‘no-cost’ EMI myth: This popular scheme appears harmless, yet such ‘zero’ or ‘no-cost’ EMI offers often hide processing fees or are introduced after inflating product prices to make the offer look attractive. What seems like ‘free financing’ can stretch your budget for months and attract heavy interest charges if EMIs are missed. Overrunning your credit limit: Festive shopping spikes credit usage and can create unnecessary stress. Avoid spending more than 40% of your card limit, as it can hurt your credit score and signal financial strain to lenders. Splitting large purchases across cards or mixing in debit payments helps maintain a healthy utilisation ratio. Delayed repayments and rolling interest: Even a single missed credit card or loan payment can prove costly. Banks may charge up to 30–45% annual interest along with late fees, and such defaults can stay on your credit report for up to seven years. Always clear full dues instead of the minimum amount to keep your credit profile clean and score high. Misusing cash withdrawals: Withdrawing cash on credit cards incurs immediate interest and 2–3% transaction fees from the day of withdrawal. Such withdrawals should be reserved strictly for genuine emergencies, not festive indulgences. Falling for fake rebates and flash deals: Sellers often inflate prices before announcing discounts. Always cross-check prices across platforms before purchasing. Your credit card is a short-term loan, not free money. Avoid emotional or impulsive purchases.

Risks associated with credit card usage High interest charges: Carrying unpaid balances quickly results in steep interest.

Carrying unpaid balances quickly results in steep interest. Accumulation of debt: Festive overspending can make debt spiral out of control.

Festive overspending can make debt spiral out of control. Credit score impact: Late or missed payments damage credit scores and complicate future borrowing.

Late or missed payments damage credit scores and complicate future borrowing. Hidden charges: Annual fees, late payment penalties, and foreign transaction charges can add up.

Annual fees, late payment penalties, and foreign transaction charges can add up. Fraud and data theft: Careless sharing of OTPs or card details can lead to serious financial loss.

Plan your Diwali expenses carefully. Use only 30–40% of your total credit limit, and if in doubt, consult a certified financial advisor. Doing so ensures your Diwali stays bright without the burden of debt.

[TITLE]Retail media boom forces grocers like Kroger, Albertsons to reorganize:
[TEXT]
This story was originally published on sister site, Modern Retail.

Many of the largest grocers in the U.S. have restructured to bring their advertising and traditional retail businesses closer together.

In a move announced this summer, Kroger pulled its consumer insights (84.51°), loyalty marketing and retail media (Kroger Precision Marketing) businesses together under a single division called Kroger Precision Marketing powered by 84.51°. Albertsons overhauled its C-suite in May following the failure of its proposed merger with Kroger. That move brought together its digital experiences, marketing and loyalty functions as well as its advertising business, Albertsons Media Collective, under chief commercial officer Jennifer Saenz.

These are just a couple of examples of how grocers have combined different elements of their business to better communicate or have shared goals in serving advertisers and consumers. According to leaders at Ahold Delhaize, Kroger, Albertsons and more, grocers have realized that certain functions like merchandising and marketing need to work more closely together in order to successfully grow retail media businesses.

“Everyone has the memo, certainly inside our company, that the retail business model has transformed,” Brian Monahan, svp of retail media for Albertsons, told Modern Retail at Groceryshop. “You have to be some form of a hybrid retail-media company to compete, so everybody’s really trying to learn how to do that.”

Similarly, Ahold Delhaize USA brought digital merchandising into its retail media team
