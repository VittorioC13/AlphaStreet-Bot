[TITLE]How White Hydrogen and Carbon Mineralization Could Decarbonize Industry:
[TEXT]
Engineers are working to accelerate the natural serpentinization process by injecting CO2-enriched water to simultaneously dispose of industrial emissions and harvest the resulting hydrogen, while also yielding critical minerals.

The production of geologic hydrogen is projected to cost significantly less than current renewable hydrogen, and the region's rock has a theoretical capacity for massive CO2 storage.

Geological formations in Newfoundland, specifically the Bay of Islands Ophiolite Complex, are capable of producing low-cost "geologic" hydrogen and permanently sequestering carbon dioxide through a reaction called serpentinization.

In the remote geology of western Newfoundland, a specific formation of ancient oceanic crust is shifting from a subject of academic study to a target for industrial decarbonization. The region’s ophiolite belts, sections of Earth’s mantle pushed onto land, are drawing attention for their theoretical ability to produce low-cost hydrogen while permanently mineralizing carbon dioxide.

This geological convergence arrives as the energy sector seeks scalable alternatives to manufactured hydrogen. While "green" hydrogen produced via electrolysis remains expensive, creating a barrier to widespread adoption, naturally occurring or geologic hydrogen offers a potentially cheaper pathway.

The Economics of "Gold" Hydrogen

Industry data suggests that geologic hydrogen, often called "white hydrogen”, could be produced for between $0.50 and $1 per kilogram. This price point is significantly lower than current renewable hydrogen production costs, which often exceed $4 per kilogram.

The push to explore these formations coincides with a surging market for carbon management. According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sector for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is projected to reach $17.75 billion by 2030, up from an estimated $5.82 billion in 2025. This 25 percent compound annual growth rate is driven largely by government mandates and rising carbon prices that incentivize heavy industry to manage emissions.

The Mechanism: Serpentinization

The focus in Newfoundland centers on the Bay of Islands Ophiolite Complex. Geologists regard this formation as one of the most complete sequences of ophiolites in the world. The rocks here are ultramafic, meaning they are rich in magnesium and iron but low in silica.

When these rocks encounter water, they undergo a chemical reaction known as serpentinization. The reaction oxidizes the iron in the rock, splitting water molecules to release hydrogen gas naturally. Crucially, the process also creates highly alkaline fluids that react aggressively with carbon dioxide. The CO2 is converted into solid carbonate minerals, effectively turning a greenhouse gas into stone.

Research conducted by Memorial University on the local Blow Me Down massif indicates that this process creates brucite, a mineral that facilitates rapid carbon sequestration. The study suggests that for every tonne of brucite formed, 0.63 metric tonnes of CO2 can be sequestered.

Industrializing a Natural Cycle

While serpentinization occurs naturally, it is a slow process. The current wave of exploration targets "stimulated" production. By drilling into these formations and injecting CO2-enriched water, engineers aim to accelerate the reaction. This method theoretically allows operators to dispose of industrial carbon emissions while harvesting the resulting hydrogen for energy.

Esti Ukar, a research associate professor at the Jackson School of Geosciences, suggests that engineering these natural hydrogen accumulations is the key to viability.

"Natural accumulations of geologic hydrogen are being found all over the world, but in most cases they are small and not economical, although exploration continues," Ukar said. "If we could help generate larger volumes of hydrogen from these rocks by driving reactions that would take several million years to happen in nature, I think geologic hydrogen could really be a game changer."

Capacity and Critical Minerals

The scale of the potential storage is significant. Peer-reviewed research on the Bay of Islands Complex calculated a theoretical total CO2 storage capacity of 5.1 x 10^11 tonnes. While practical constraints would limit the accessible volume, even a fraction of that capacity represents a massive carbon sink compared to Canada’s annual emissions.

Beyond energy and carbon, the chemistry of these rocks has implications for critical mineral supply chains. The highly reducing conditions required to generate hydrogen also favor the formation of awaruite, a rare nickel-iron alloy, and chromite. Explorers in the region have identified mineralized zones of chromite exceeding 700 meters in length within the Lewis Hills Massif.

Regulatory and Infrastructural Outlook

Despite the favorable geology, the sector faces hurdles common to emerging technologies. The International Energy Agency notes that while carbon capture project announcements are increasing, global deployment lags behind climate targets.

Policymakers are attempting to close this gap with financial instruments. Tax credits and grants are being established in North America and Europe to de-risk exploration. For hard-to-abate sectors such as steel manufacturing and cement production, where electrification is difficult, the prospect of mineral carbonation offers a distinct advantage: permanence. unlike gaseous storage in depleted oil wells, mineralized carbon cannot leak.

As engineering teams look to validate the Memorial University findings in the field, Newfoundland’s ophiolites may soon serve as a test case for whether the Earth’s crust can be engineered to function simultaneously as a fuel source and a waste repository.

The economics of battery storage systems (BESS) in Europe look much rosier following changes to the European Union’s (EU) power pricing structure in October, with several countries offering the potential for BESS profits to rise more than a 15%, according to Rystad Energy analysis. The new EU system sets power prices every 15 minutes, rather than every hour, giving BESS operators more opportunities to buy electricity when it’s cheap and sell it when prices rise. Since the new system was implemented, arbitrage potential has increased by 14% on average across European power markets. Some countries, such as Austria and Slovakia, saw gains of over 20%, while others, including Portugal, Norway and Sweden, experienced only minor improvements. If a battery earns around 20% more each year due to these price swings, its total return on investment can increase by

[TITLE]US crude exports to Nigeria surge by 153% in 2025:
[TEXT]
Nigeria’s imports of crude oil from the United States rose by 153 per cent in the first nine months of 2025, according to the latest data from the US Energy Information Administration analysed by Sunday PUNCH.

Between February and September 2025, Nigeria imported 39.99 million barrels of crude oil from the U.S., a significant rise from the 15.79 million barrels recorded in the same period of 2024. A month-by-month breakdown of the data shows that US crude shipments to Nigeria increased steadily in 2025.

There was no record of such an import in January in either year, according to available data. In February, Nigeria imported 3.11 million barrels, slightly lower than the 3.61 million barrels recorded in the same month of 2024. March 2025 saw 5.25 million barrels, up from 3.42 million barrels in March 2024.

By April 2025, imports stood at 2.04 million barrels, compared to 1.54 million barrels in April 2024. The upward trend continued in May 2025, with 3.79 million barrels, against 2.08 million barrels in the same month the previous year.

A sharp spike occurred in June 2025, when Nigeria imported 9.16 million barrels, more than eight times the 1.04 million barrels imported in June 2024. In July 2025, US exports to Nigeria hit 4.17 million barrels, just above the 4.10 million barrels recorded in July 2024.

For August and September 2025, US crude exports to Nigeria remained steady at 6.24 million barrels each month. However, no data was reported for those months in 2024, indicating that US crude may not have been shipped to Nigeria during that period.

The cumulative imports of 2025, totalling 39.99 million barrels, mark a significant shift in Nigeria’s sourcing of crude oil, suggesting either a growing demand for specific US grades or a strategic realignment in Nigeria’s import mix.

The surge indicates that the Dangote Refinery’s crude intake is entering a steady ramp-up, with US light sweet crude favoured for its compatibility with complex refining processes. However, the rising reliance on imported US barrels highlights a longstanding paradox for Nigeria.

Despite being Africa’s biggest oil producer and an OPEC member, it has historically exported crude while importing refined products because its state refineries are moribund. The Dangote refinery was expected to address this by using domestic crude oil to reduce reliance on imports. However, the latest data show it is still relying on foreign supply to optimise operations.

The Federal Government earlier disclosed that a total of 67,657,559 barrels of crude oil were supplied to local refiners for processing between January and August 2025. This figure, confirmed by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, highlights the ongoing challenges in bridging the crude allocation gap faced by indigenous refineries, despite Nigeria’s rising production levels.

The commission noted that crude allocation was made in line with the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 and the Domestic Crude Supply Obligation policy. According to the commission, through its Head of Media and Strategic Communications, Eniola Akinkuotu, the barrels were delivered to both modular and state-owned refining facilities, including Waltersmith, Aradel Energy, and refineries under the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited.

“A total of 67,657,559 barrels were delivered to local refiners between January and August this year. All refiners got that amount within the eight-month period,” Akinkuotu noted in a statement.

However, the volume supplied fell short of refiners’ demand by a wide margin. Local processors had requested 123,480,500 barrels for the first half of 2025, meaning they received 55,822,941 barrels—or

MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for peace in Ukraine includes proposals to restore Russian energy flows to Europe, major U.S. investment in Russian rare earths and energy, and tapping frozen Russian sovereign assets, the Wall Street Journal said.

The newspaper said the plans were detailed in appendices to peace proposals handed to European counterparts over recent weeks.

They include a plan for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap $200 billion of frozen Russian sovereign assets for projects in Ukraine, including a major new data center powered by the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces, the paper said.

U.S. companies would invest in Russian strategic sectors such as rare-earth extraction and oil drilling in the Arctic, while Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the world would be restored, it added.

The paper said one unidentified European official compared the proposed U.S.-Russian energy deals to an economic version of the 1945 Yalta conference.

At that meeting, the victors of World War Two, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, divided up their spheres of interest in Europe.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, formed of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

[TITLE]AI is bringing old nuclear plants out of retirement:
[TEXT]
The Palisades Nuclear Generating Station is nestled between sand dunes on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. It shut down for financial reasons in 2022. Three years later, it’s on the cusp of reopening, with hundreds of workers streaming through its security barriers every day.

Palisades is on track to restart in early 2026. When it does, it will be the first nuclear plant in the United States to generate electricity again after being decommissioned. Nick Culp of Holtec, the company that owns the plant, said its revival is a response to a surge in demand for electricity.

“We have seen [Michigan]’s baseload generation go offline at a rapid rate as they’ve moved away from fossil generation,” Culp said. “How do you backfill that when you see demand on the horizon like [artificial intelligence], like data storage, like keeping the lights on at home, and new manufacturing?”

Palisades Nuclear Generating Station is on track to restart in 2026. (Chris Bentley/Here & Now)

Nuclear is part of the answer to that question, Culp said, and the government agrees. Michigan gave $300 million to the restart — part of its goal to have 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 — and the federal government gave the project a loan of more than $1.5 billion.

That money is part of the Trump administration’s investment in what it’s calling a “nuclear energy renaissance.” In May, the White House released a plan to quadruple American nuclear power by 2050, following a similar pledge from the Biden administration.

Meeting that goal would require dozens of new reactors. But whether they’re traditional power plants or new designs, nuclear reactors are expensive and slow to build. Facing a crunch between climate goals and rising electricity demand, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Iowa are reopening plants that closed just a few years ago.

Powering up

When the Palisades plant in Michigan closed in 2022, Jim Byrd said he left his office of more than two decades “with a heavy heart.”

The 2026 Federal Foreign Office budget - setting the course for strong foreign policy

Germany Federal Foreign Office

09.12.2025 - Article

With a total budget of around 6 billion euro for 2026, the Federal Foreign Office is facing up to global challenges and prioritising foreign policy that remains resolute and capable even in difficult times.

Our budget underlines not only Germany's responsibility in the world, but also our clear focus on the fundamental aims of freedom, security and prosperity as the guiding principles of our foreign policy.

Security and prosperity in Europe and worldwide through support for crisis management

In a world that is shaped by geopolitical tensions and numerous conflicts, Germany's foreign policy is aligned more closely than ever with supporting peace and stability. The ongoing war in Ukraine, the fraught situation in the Middle East and the humanitarian crises in Africa require resolute action.

Germany plays an active role both in crisis management and in stabilising affected regions, whether through humanitarian or preventive action. The budget for 2026 shows that, despite current financial pressures, Germany remains a reliable partner in international crisis assistance - both in acute emergencies and in longer-lasting conflicts in places such as Ukraine, Gaza and the Sudan.

The 1.048 billion euro earmarked for humanitarian assistance will be used to support people in emergencies and help alleviate the greatest suffering. One example is support for mine clearance in conflict zones, which is an essential step in order for reconstruction to take place and safety to be restored.

A further 353 million euro of funding will contribute to stabilising affected regions and make it possible to curb violence and begin reconstruction after the acute phase of the crisis has ended. This includes mediating peace, fighting and preventing extremist violence, fighting transnational organised crime, reforming the security sector, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, strengthening legitimate state structures and improving living conditions, as well as promoting democracy and the rule of law.

One key issue remains the situation in the Middle East, particularly the reconstruction of Gaza. Germany is already providing urgently needed humanitarian assistance and will continue to champion the reconstruction of Gaza within the international community. We are implementing the 20-point plan for Gaza together with our partners. We are also supporting the International Stabilization Force in Gaza that was recently endorsed by the UN Security Council, with the aim of bringing lasting stability to the region.

Responsibility for global stability

Security remains a crucial pillar of German foreign policy, and the 2026 budget takes this into account. In times of growing threats to the international order, such as the ongoing Russian war of aggression in Ukraine, Germany has increased its support for military and civil measures. The Enable and Enhance Initiative managed jointly by the Federal Ministry of Defence and the Federal Foreign Office has been substantially expanded. A total of around 12 billion euro (including revenue and reflows) for military support for Ukraine shows that Germany is prepared to take on responsibility in order to preserve security in Europe and beyond.

Moreover, Germany remains flexible in its international cooperation and can swiftly respond to new threats, whether from natural disasters or sudden geopolitical tensions. Through efficient budgeting, funding can be reallocated at short notice in order to swiftly respond to acute crises and ensure security in affected regions.

Support for education and academia

One core element of the budget is the defence of our freedom in an increasingly polarised world. Education and cultural exchange are particularly important in this regard. The 2026 budget therefore once again includes funding of almost one billion euro for cultural relations and education policy. An important component of this policy is the 136 German schools and the Goethe-Institut, which serve as bridges between Germany and the world, foster understanding of our country abroad and communicate our interests and values.

Through its support for education and academia, for example through the German Academic Exchange Service ( DAAD ) and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany remains a global supporter of academic freedom and intercultural exchange.

Skilled workers - the key to making Germany's economy fit for the future

In 2026, recruitment to address the ongoing shortage of skilled workers remains a priority for the German economy. The Federal Agency for Foreign Affairs, which was tasked with coordinating visa processing for skilled workers from abroad in 2021, plays a crucial role in integrating international talent. With an increased budget of 67.5 million euro for 2026, the Agency will be able to further boost skilled immigration - from granting visas to supporting integration into the labour market.

Efficient and capable despite reductions

The Federal Foreign Office will remain fully capable of action despite staffing reductions in 2026. More than 12,000 staff at 225 missions abroad and the headquarters in Berlin are deeply committed to implementing Germany's foreign policy goals. While making necessary budget adjustments, Germany will remain able to effectively carry out its global tasks even in times of crisis.

The 2026 budget ensures capable foreign policy that takes account of Germany's interests and international obligations. Through targeted expenditure in fields such as humanitarian assistance, culture, education and military support, Germany is showing that it can contribute its share to international crisis management and peacekeeping even in difficult times. The 2026 budget is thus also a clear commitment to the values that shape Germany's foreign policy.

[TEXT]
G7+: Statement of the Co-Chairs of the G7+ Ukraine Energy Coordination Group Ministerial Meeting

European External Action Service (EEAS)

12.12.2025

EEAS Press Team

The G7+ Ukraine Energy Coordination Group met virtually today, December 12, 2025, to reaffirm its united support for Ukraine's energy security and strongly condemn Russia's deliberate strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The meeting was co-chaired by Kaja Kallas, High Representative of the EU and Vice President of the European Commission, and Anita Anand, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada, with the participation of Yuliia Svyrydenko, Prime Minister of Ukraine, and EU Commissioner Dan Jørgensen.

Recalling the G7 Foreign Ministers Joint Statement in Niagara and the G7 Energy Ministers Statement on Ukraine's Energy Security in Toronto, participants reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine in defending its territorial integrity and right to exist, and its freedom, sovereignty, and independence.

For nearly four years, Russia has inflicted increasing damage on Ukraine's electricity infrastructure, gas networks, nuclear power plant substations, and renewable energy sources. Millions are being left without heat, light, or access to essential services, with vulnerable populations disproportionally affected. The G7+ Ukraine Energy Coordination Group called on Russia to immediately stop all strikes on civilian infrastructure, including energy infrastructure.

Participants reiterated that an immediate, full and unconditional ceasefire is urgently needed, leading to a just and lasting peace.

The G7+ Ukraine Energy Coordination Group committed to putting Ukraine in a position of strength by

boosting resilience through active and passive air defence of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, to avoid the continuation of the 'we repair, they destroy' pattern;

of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, to avoid the continuation of the 'we repair, they destroy' pattern; continuing to ensure that all the repairing and restoring capacities of Ukraine remain available, and in addition to supplying Ukraine with the necessary equipment , which is not available locally;

of Ukraine remain available, and in addition to supplying Ukraine with the , which is not available locally; ensuring that Ukraine receives enough gas and electricity for the winter of 2025-26,

of 2025-26, closing the financial gap between the needs and the funding of the Ukraine Energy Support Fund;

between the needs and the funding of the Ukraine Energy Support Fund; putting an emphasis on reinforced outreach to third countries to encourage support from beyond the usual donor countries in the energy sector;

accelerating the reform of Ukraine's energy markets , to make energy production, transmission and distribution more efficient and sustainable, thereby maximising the impact of the G7+ support; and,

, to make energy production, transmission and distribution more efficient and sustainable, thereby maximising the impact of the G7+ support; and, supporting Ukraine in addressing governance in state-owned enterprises while drawing all necessary lessons from ongoing investigations in the energy sector.

Participants underlined the need for strong and independent anti-corruption institutions and authorities in Ukraine, to develop and adopt the Anti-corruption Strategy and the State Anti-Corruption Programme, and for effective and comprehensive investigation of corruption cases. They highlighted the importance of further strengthening the independence of Ukraine's energy regulator.

Based on the results of the 2025 Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) in Rome and looking ahead to the 2026 URC in Poland, the G7+ Ukraine Energy Coordination Group reiterated its commitment to supporting Ukraine's immediate needs and vision of a more decentralised, diversified, resilient, and sustainable energy system that is fully integrated with Europe.

[TITLE]The Energy Justice Resistance: How States Can Counteract Federal Attacks on Community Benefits Plans:
[TEXT]
The Biden Administration tied historic federal clean energy funding in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Law (IIJA) and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to a local benefits framework through the Department of Energy’s Community Benefits Plan (CBP) requirements. The Trump Administration’s rapid rescission of CBP requirements, however, has removed the primary federal mechanism linking clean energy deployment to local benefits. Because of this rollback, state legislatures should consider mandating the use of tools such as Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs) and Host-Community Bill Credits (HCBCs) to ensure that communities continue to share in the economic and social benefits of the energy transition.

Federalizing Energy Justice: Mandatory Community Benefit Plans Under the Biden Administration

During the previous administration, President Biden signed the IIJA and IRA into law, appropriating historic amounts of federal funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives, including clean energy development. Much of this funding was made available via grant and loan programs, which were administered by federal agencies, like the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). In 2021, the DOE established a first-of-its kind program, under which all applicants for federal grants and loans under the IIJA and IRA were required to develop and submit CBPs.

CBPs are planning documents in which developers detail how a proposed project will deliver benefits—such as local employment, workforce training, or environmental justice benefits— to impacted communities, beyond the core technical goals of the project. While these planning tools are not legally binding, CBPs were mandatory components of DOE funding applications during the Biden Administration. To ensure these plans were not merely perfunctory, the Biden DOE required CBPs to address four goals: (1) community and labor engagement, (2) quality jobs and workforce development, (3) diversity and inclusion, and (4) benefits for disadvantaged communities under the federal Justice40 Initiative. If the DOE approved a funding application, the Agency integrated the terms and conditions of the proposed CBP into the grant / loan award, thus conditioning grant / loan funding on successful CBP implementation.

Initial evidence suggests that CBPs likely had positive social and economic impacts. Data compiled by UC Berkeley Law demonstrates that, across 635 DOE-funded projects, developers entered into more than 250 agreements to support local labor and encourage community oversight. Many expected that more local agreements would be executed in the future, but that now seems unlikely.

The Trumpian Backslide: Executive Order 14151 and DOE Grant Revisions

Shortly after taking office, President Trump issued a slate of executive orders designed to rollback diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental justice initiatives pursued by the Biden Administration. In Executive Order 14151 (“Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing”), the Trump Administration ordered federal agencies to terminate all DEI initiatives, including those embedded in DOE’s CBP framework. This order thus dismantled the administrative foundation for CBPs.

In response to Executive Order 14151, the DOE issued internal memoranda instructing program offices to suspend CBP implementation and to amend existing grant and loan agreements to remove CBP provisions. The Agency told recipients that “[c]osts incurred after the date of this letter will not be reimbursed” for CBP-related activities. DOE Grants Officers contacted grantees to renegotiate awards and strip CBP obligations that had required local benefits.

The consequences of this rollback were immediate, eliminating structured mechanisms that had tied federal grants to local job creation and community oversight. Even worse, the DOE later terminated grants and loans for over 200 projects, stymieing new development and inhibiting planned benefits from flowing to communities. The Trump Administration’s actions, therefore, shifted federal energy and infrastructure policy away from community empowerment toward regressive deregulation — undermining a significant justice-oriented reform in federal clean energy funding.

Resisting the Backslide: How States Can Support Community Benefits and Wealth Sharing Programs

Because of this federal backsliding, it is incumbent upon states to reassess and strengthen their community benefit frameworks to ensure that the fruits of the energy transition do not remain concentrated among a handful of developers. To do this, states can legislatively mandate that project developers provide monetary and/or non-monetary benefits— such as local hiring, community oversight, and environmental remediation — to host communities as a condition of development. These mandates can help to advance both procedural and distributive justice, ensuring that local communities are involved in, and benefit from, major infrastructure projects that affect them.

Legislatively-mandated community benefit schemes for clean energy projects generally take one of two different forms: Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs) and Host Community Bill Credits (HCBCs). CBAs are highly tailored agreements between project developers and local governments or local organizations in a host community, under which the developer promises to deliver specific public benefits to the community. HCBCs, conversely, are a highly streamlined approach in which developers apportion bill credits among residential electricity ratepayers that reside in the development’s host community, thus providing direct-to-consumer bill savings.

Though each model provides local benefits, the two approaches differ significantly—both normatively and administratively—in how they integrate energy justice into renewable energy siting. Whether states choose to mandate CBAs, HCBCs, or both, moreover, may substantially impact how these states balance the often-tensional policy goals of transition acceleration and energy justice. Legislators should therefore recognize the distinct benefits and tradeoffs associated with each regime.

a. Community Benefits Agreements

For several decades, localities have used CBAs to secure local benefits from, and build public support for, large-scale developments. A highly procedural approach, CBAs generally involve a multi-step process of convening developers and host communities, including: (1) public education; (2) community negotiation; (3) contract drafting and signing; and (4) implementation and enforcement. Because of this individualized time-investment, proponents argue that CBAs increase local buy-in and project certainty, reducing risk for developers. In addition, CBA negotiations provide developers local knowledge that may improve project outcomes. Furthermore, advocates increasingly contend that CBAs — when viewed as a tool to reduce local opposition to utility-scale renewable energy projects — could be more widely deployed to accelerate the energy transition.

Several states have adopted legislation which mandate CBAs for renewable energy and other types of projects. Pursuant to HB 5120 in Michigan, for example, owners of energy facilities of 50 MW of capacity or more must negotiate a CBA with host communities and must pay $2,000 per MW of capacity to the host community. Under AB 205 in California, applicants seeking California Energy Commission certification for renewable energy facilities of 50 MW of capacity or more must enter into “one or more legally binding and enforceable agreements with, or that benefit, a coalition of one or more community-based organizations.” By requiring developers to enter into CBAs with host communities, states can ensure that impacted communities receive substantial benefits from the projects they host.

As more host communities adopt CBAs, however, several issues persist. CBAs often lack clear enforcement mechanisms, typically because of poor planning and drafting. In addition, communities may face challenges monitoring developers’ actions and may be unaware of non-compliance with the terms of a CBA. Even if non-compliance becomes apparent, communities may lack the capacity or resources necessary to address this breach. Power imbalances between developers and host communities may also result in a lack of transparency and the “institutionalization” of CBAs, threatening the underlying flexibility that makes CBAs an attractive policy option.

Some critics harbor deeper, more philosophical objections to the use of CBAs in the context of renewable energy development. Developer-sympathetic critics argue that CBAs risk enabling extortionate opposition to renewable energy projects. Certainly, local stakeholders offer valuable input and express valid concerns

[TITLE]80% of data centre energy must come from renewables - CRU:
[TEXT]
Data centres will be required to meet at least 80% of their annual energy demand with additional renewable electricity projects generating in the Republic of Ireland.

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has today published its decision on a new electricity connection policy for data centres.

Under the rules, data centre developers will be allowed a six-year "glide path" for renewables to be developed and start generating.

The CRU said that new data centres connecting to the electricity network will continue to be required to provide generation and/or storage capacity, either onsite or local in proximity to match the requested data centre maximum import demand capacity.

"This generation will be required to participate in the wholesale electricity market to support overall system adequacy, while providing a potential revenue stream to the developer.," the CRU said in its decision.

When it comes to the location of data centres, the CRU said that electricity system operators must consider whether a requested data centre connection is in a constrained or unconstrained location on the electricity network.

"This will require system operators to focus on the details of the specific application and its location on the electricity network instead of the current broader regional approach," the CRU said.

"The system operators will also be required to regularly publish information in relation to the availability of capacity on the electricity network, identifying current and future constraints to provide accessible information for all stakeholders," it added.

Electricity demand from data centres has grown from 5% of national electricity demand in 2015 to 22% in 2024.

Digital Infrastructure Ireland, which represents the data centre sector, said it was pleased that the policy has finally been released by the CRU.

"We are hopeful this will end the four-year de facto moratorium on data centres and begin to reset the digital infrastructure industry here in Ireland," the group said.

Cloud Infrastructure Ireland, the Ibec trade association that represents digital infrastructure providers, welcomed the publication of the connection policy, which it said provides the needed clarity for new sustainable data centre investments in Ireland.

"The policy will also support Ireland's wider digital economy and the hundreds of Irish firms supporting the digital infrastructure sector," it said.

Wind Energy Ireland also welcomed the publication of the connection policy.

"This new policy gives certainty to large-energy users and to the renewable energy industry," said Noel Cunniffe, CEO of Wind Energy Ireland.

"It will unlock investment into Ireland, support new wind farms and help to accelerate the electrification of our energy system," he added.

The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland (AmCham) said the publication of the CRU's decision provides much-needed clarity for investors and energy users.

"Vital digital infrastructure is foundational to Ireland's ability to attract and retain investment, support high-value jobs, and enable the continued growth of the wider digital economy, all of which rely on dependable access to electricity for large energy users," said AmCham CEO Paul Sweetman.

Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said it may be a good decision for data centres and renewables developers, but added that it is not a good day for climate, or for households and communities dependent on expensive fossil fuels.

"Requiring data centres to 'match' at least 80% of their annual demand with new renewables does not guarantee actual reductions in emissions," said Jerry Mac Evilly, Campaigns Director at Friends of the Earth.

"This is merely an accounting exercise and data centres’ colossal energy demand inevitably means more use of fossil fuel power plants."

[TITLE]Electricity Metering in Nigeria: NERC Reports 187k New Meter:
[TEXT]
Nigeria’s metering performance improved between September and October 2025, with 187,765 electricity customers newly metered nationwide, according to the latest metering factsheet released by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission.

The document shows that 80,943 customers received meters in September, while another 106,822 were metered in October. It indicated that the sustained meter rollout pushed the national metering rate from 55.37 per cent in September to 56.07 per cent in October.

During the same period, the country’s active electricity customer base grew from 12,030,315 to 12,071,018, reflecting an addition of 40,703 new customers. NERC’s figures indicate that the number of metered customers rose from 6,661,564 at the end of September to 6,768,386 by October, leaving 5,302,632 customers still on estimated billing.

The improvement might be partly linked to ongoing interventions such as the Meter Acquisition Fund and other metering programmes, which began yielding visible gains in the fourth quarter of the year.

According to the NERC report, Ikeja Electric posted the highest metering rate in the country at 85.59 per cent, with 1,113,421 of its 1,300,940 active customers captured. Eko Electric followed closely at 84.75 per cent, while Abuja Electric achieved 75.82 per cent.

However, four distribution companies — Yola, Jos, Kaduna, and Kano — remained below the 35 per cent threshold. Yola Disco ranked lowest at 28.92 per cent, followed by Jos (29.74 per cent), Kaduna (33.72 per cent), and Kano (34.50 per cent).

It was noted that Aba Power made the most notable progress in the month under review, installing 18,906 new meters and raising its metering rate from 69.49 per cent in September to 78.20 per cent in October, a 3.3 percentage-point jump.

Abuja Disco added 19,118 meters, while Ikeja installed 17,046, and Ibadan followed with 15,739 during the same period. The remaining DisCos, including Benin, Enugu, Port Harcourt, and Eko, accounted for the balance of the October installations.

Despite the significant gains, NERC’s report shows that more than 5.3 million electricity customers remain unmetered across the country. With metering now crossing the 56 per cent mark after years of stagnation around 50–55 per cent, sector observers believe that sustained progress through the end of 2025 could push Nigeria closer to achieving the long-delayed goal of universal metering.

Recently, NERC accused DisCos of not doing enough in metering. NERC Vice Chairman, Dr Musiliu Oseni, at the recently held 4th NESI Stakeholders Meeting in Abuja, revealed that there are currently 600,000 to 700,000 meters available in the country.

He challenged utilities to improve publicity and rollout speed, noting that the government has made the investment, so the DisCos need to step up. NERC Commissioner for Corporate Services, Nathan Shatti, told the DisCos to stop behaving as if they were doing customers a favour.

Reviewing the data on Meter Asset Provider refunds and installations, Shatti highlighted the “poor performance” of specific utilities, noting that Abuja and Kano DisCos have achieved only 2 per cent compliance on refunds.

Addressing the backlog of paid-for but uninstalled meters, he rejected technical excuses, saying, “If your network is not ready for metering, do not collect people’s money.”

He further observed that for every transformer or meter not installed, DisCos incur losses; hence, it is in their interest to meter customers and fix transformer-related issues. Shatti also revealed that over 350,000 meters are yet to be migrated to the new STS standard, demanding immediate cleanup of obsolete data.
