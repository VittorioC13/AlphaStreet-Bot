As global corporate leaders navigate the geo-economic shifts , "agility and reliability" driven models will succeed, says. In an interview to ET, Bach said India is seen as the "big prize" as there is no viable way for global companies to reduce their dependence on China without deepening engagement with India.It's a significant challenge, especially for CEOs in the West who have spent most of their careers in a world that felt stable and predictable. Suddenly, the terrain has shifted. Leaders now recognize that we're not returning to the pre-2019 world. That means accepting that politics increasingly precede economics. The first questions are now: Can I operate there? Am I welcome? Who will support me if things go wrong? This shift affects capital allocation, risk management and strategy. It means spreading bets more widely, prioritising reliability over efficiency, and building organisations that can adapt quickly. The winners in this environment will be those who can consistently meet customer needs despite political or economic turbulence, who move from efficiency driven models to agility and resilience driven ones.My bigger worry isn't tariffs or protectionism, though those matter. It's the erosion of global leadership and governance. Since World War II, the US, working through international institutions, has provided a framework for coordinated responses to global challenges. That system is weakening. Without strong leadership-whether from the US or others-we risk losing the ability to respond to issues like climate change or global crises effectively. China is providing some leadership in clean tech, largely for self-interested reasons, but it has been absent on major geopolitical issues like Gaza or Ukraine. So, the concern is not just the economic cycle; it's the absence of a coherent global response to global problems.Indian leaders have long operated in an environment marked by uncertainty-frequent policy shifts, supply-chain disruptions, regulatory changes and macro volatility. This is less of a shock for them than for leaders in, say, Sweden, Portugal or the US. The new global paradigm feels more familiar to Indian CEOs than for many of their peers in the West.Every CEO I speak to believes AI is transformative. The debate is not whether it will reshape industries, but how dramatically. Many expect major productivity gains and automation. Companies are investing heavily in upskilling and AI literacy so employees can use these tools effectively. Firms have moved beyond experimentation. They're applying AI at scale -especially in customer service, content generation and operations. You can see the impact in areas like consulting, where firms have cut back on entry-level hiring because AI is taking over many junior-level tasks.Boards need education as much as executive teams do. A CEO cannot move quickly or decisively without a board that understands the environment and supports change. But boards are often the most risk-averse part of the system, which can create friction. In today's world marked by geopolitical uncertainty, rapid technological change, generational shifts and sustainability pressures, risk-averse boards can make the CEO's job significantly harder.There's a great deal of excitement

[TITLE]Surge in Natural Gas Prices Sets The Stage for Coal Comeback:
[TEXT]
As U.S. natural gas prices jumped to a three-year high, coal has become a cheaper power-generating fuel for utilities, which are set to run coal-fired generators harder this winter.

U.S. benchmark natural gas prices at Henry Hub have jumped from $4.23 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at the start of November to above $5 per MMBtu by early December. Early on Friday, the front-month futures price was $5.084 per MMBtu.

That’s the highest price in three years, as a polar vortex with freezing temperatures and snowstorms gripped most of the U.S. and as U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports continue to set record highs as new plants ramp up liquefaction and shipments.

Near-month futures prices are at their highest since December 2022, while the price of the 12-month futures contract strip January 2026 through December 2026 climbed in one week by 26 cents to $4.302 per MMBtu, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its latest Natural Gas Weekly report.

The report also showed that working natural gas stocks totaled 3,923 Bcf for the week ending December 3, which is 5% more than the five-year average and less than 1% lower than last year at this time.

Although natural gas stocks are at levels higher than the five-year average, prices are rallying as heating and power demand jumps with the colder weather and LNG exports out of America are setting new highs.

The U.S. is set to export 14.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG this year, up by 25% from 2024, the EIA said in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) for November. Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana has ramped up exports more quickly than the EIA expected, leading the administration to raise its forecast of LNG exports in the current quarter by 3% compared with last month’s outlook. The EIA expects U.S. LNG exports to increase by an additional 10% in 2026.

As a result, soaring U.S. natural gas prices make gas-fired power generation more expensive for electric utilities and some of these are set to boost generation from cheaper coal.

The EIA expects in its latest STEO that the 2025 annual average price of natural gas paid by electric power plants will jump by 37% and the price paid by industrial sector customers will increase by 21% compared with the 2024 averages.

The Henry Hub natural gas spot price is set to average $4.00 per MMBtu in 2026, the EIA forecasts. The expected average price would be 16% higher than in 2025, primarily due to surging LNG exports amid flat gas production.

Coal, for its part, saw increased production this year, supported by the Trump Administration and the rising price of natural gas.

The coal production increase in 2025 is the result of rising demand, the EIA notes. Demand has increased due to higher natural gas prices, delayed coal plant retirements, and strong demand for heating in the earlier winter months this year. In response to higher demand, the EIA expects electric power coal inventories to end the year at 107 million short tons (MMst), which would be 17% lower than at the end of 2024.

Higher natural gas prices are setting the stage for increased coal use, at least in the coming months. But soaring power demand from AI could also support a quiet comeback for coal in the coming years.

Most coal-fired power plants could delay retirement because of the AI-driven power demand surge, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Reuters in September.

“Energy sobriety has returned to Washington, D.C. Our focus is on Americans and the price of utility and avoiding blackouts,” Wright said.

“We've got to stop existing firm capacity from retirement,” the Energy Secretary added.

The surge in U.S. electricity demand “is reviving hopes of at least a slightly brighter future for coal,” Ed Crooks, Vice Chair Americas at Wood Mackenzie, said in October.

“There is no doubt that the boom in data centre investment is helping to slow the decline of coal in the US, by prolonging the operational lives of some coal-fired power plants,” WoodMac reckons.

Two years ago, Wood Mackenzie’s base-case expectation was that U.S. coal-fired power generation would plunge by about 60% between 2025 and 2032. Now WoodMac expects the drop to be about 39%.

[TITLE]EU plan would boost ESMA powers over crypto and capital markets:
[TEXT]
The European Commission has proposed expanding the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) over crypto and broader financial markets in a bid to narrow the competitive gap with the United States.

Published Thursday, the package would transfer “direct supervisory competences” for key pieces of market infrastructure, including crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), trading venues and central counterparties, to ESMA and strengthen its coordination role in the asset management sector.

The proposal still needs approval from the European Parliament and the Council, where it is under negotiation.

If adopted, ESMA’s role in overseeing EU capital markets would more closely resemble the centralized framework of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

EU proposal aims to streamline markets and strengthen ESMA’s authority. Source: finance.ec.europa.eu

In September, France became the third European country to call for the Paris-based ESMA to take over supervision of major crypto firms, joining Austrian and Italian securities regulators.

The move followed growing criticism of Malta’s crypto licensing regime. In July, ESMA released a peer review of the Malta Financial Services Authority’s authorization of a crypto service provider, saying that the regulator only “partially met expectations.”

Due to concerns over more lenient regulations in some jurisdictions, France has also threatened to block the “passporting” of European licenses obtained from member states, raising enforcement gaps

[TITLE]Integrated capital markets and centralised supervision key to urgent investments in Europe:
[TEXT]
Today, the European Commission has presented its new legislative package to promote further integration of capital markets and to centralise supervision in the EU. The Socialists and Democrats welcome it as an important, necessary step to reap the full benefits of the single market and ensure the urgently needed massive investments in Europe.

Over a year ago, Mario Draghi, former Italian prime minister and president of the European Central Bank, warned in his report on competitiveness that Europe needs €800 billion in annual investments, an amount that cannot be met through bank financing alone. He also emphasised the need to improve European competitiveness through measures such as supervisory simplification.

The S&D Group has long called for further integration and completion of the EU’s Capital Markets Union, including giving European supervisory authorities direct oversight of large cross-border financial firms.

This is crucial, as the persistent national fragmentation in Europe’s capital markets severely limits the benefits that can be gained from the EU’s single market. According to the International Monetary Fund, internal barriers in financial services alone act as the equivalent to a tariff of over 100 percent.

Jonás Fernández, S&D spokesperson on economic and monetary affairs, said:

[TITLE]ED files chargesheet against Reliance Power, subsidiaries in 'fake' bank guarantee case:
[TEXT]
The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday said it has filed a chargesheet against businessman Anil Ambani's group company Reliance Power Ltd. and 10 others in a money laundering case linked to issuance of an alleged fake bank guarantee of Rs 68 crore for securing a tender.

The other accused named in the prosecution complaint include former Reliance Power CFO Ashok Kumar Pal, Reliance NU BESS Ltd. and Rosa Power Supply Company Ltd. (subsidiaries of Reliance Power), an Odisha-based "shell" company Biswal Tradelink Private Limited, its MD Patha Sarathi Biswal, Biothane Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. and trade financing consultant Amar Nath Dutta.

Some other accused include Ravinder Pal Singh Chadha, Manoj Bhaiyasaheb Pongde and Punit Narendra Garg, as per the agency.

The chargesheet has been filed under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at the Patiala House court in Delhi on Friday, as per officials.

The case pertains to a bank guarantee of ₹68.2 crore submitted to secure a tender from the Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI) on behalf of Reliance NU BESS Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Power, a listed company. The company (Reliance NU BESS) was formerly known as Maharashtra Energy Generation Limited.

Probe found, as per the agency, that Reliance Group officials were well aware that this was a "fake" bank guarantee. "Fraudulent" endorsements were being submitted to SECI from a "spoofed" email ID of SBI and when SECI detected the fraud, Reliance Group arranged a genuine Bank Guarantee from IDBI Bank within a day of intimation of the fraud by SECI.

"However, SECI refused to accept the fresh Bank Guarantee as it was submitted after the due date.

"Since Reliance NU BESS Limited had emerged as the L-2 bidder, in order to save the tender, Reliance Group officials even tried to arrange a fresh endorsement of the fake foreign Bank Guarantee from an SBI branch in Kolkata," the ED alleged.

The Reliance Group had earlier said Anil Ambani was "not on the Board of Reliance Power Limited for more than 3.5 years and is not concerned with this matter in any manner".

It claimed to have been a "victim of fraud, forgery and cheating conspiracy" in this case adding that it had made due disclosures in this context to the stock exchange on November 7, 2024.

The ED added that Reliance Group officials signed a "dummy" agreement and also obtained the "Certificate of Enlistment" of Reliance NU BESS Limited from Kolkata Municipal Corporation by submitting "bogus" address documents, it said.

However, when they again failed to get the fresh endorsement done, in order to shift the entire blame onto the intermediary, they filed a complaint against Biswal Tradelink Private Limited and its MD Partha Sarathi Biswal.

Biswal was arrested by the ED in this case apart from ex Reliance Power CFO Ashok Kumar Pal and Dutta. They are currently lodged in jail under judicial custody.

The money laundering case stems from a November 2024 FIR of Delhi Police's Economic Offences Wing (EOW). It was alleged that Bhubaneswar-based shell entity Biswal Tradelink was engaged in issuing "fake" bank guarantees against commission.

Reliance Power Limited submitted this bid for a tender issued by SECI for setting up 1000 MW/2000 MWh standalone BESS projects under tariff-based competitive bidding.

The investigation has "established" the "connivance" and "mala fide" intentions of the Reliance Group in securing the SECI tender by submitting fake Bank Guarantees purportedly issued by foreign banks and their forged endorsements in the name of SBI, the ED said.

The agency also stated in the chargesheet that it has attached assets worth ₹5.15 crore as part of this probe.

The agency added that Reliance Power, with a mala fide intent, hired the services of Biswal Tradelink to arrange a fake Bank Guarantee from FirstRand Bank, Manila, Philippines, which is a "non-existent" branch, and from ACE Investment Bank Limited, Malaysia.

"Endorsements of the fake Bank Guarantees were done by using a spoofed email ID of SBI and forged endorsement letters purportedly issued by SBI.

"A fraudulent domain, s-bi.co.in (a look-alike of genuine address sbi.co.in), was used for the said purpose," it said.

Describing the role of other accused, the ED said Reliance Power routed funds of Rs 6.33 crore from its other subsidiary, Rosa Power Supply Company Ltd. to Biswal Tradelink under the guise of bogus transportation services, in order to meet the required funding for arranging the fake Bank Guarantee.

A "fake" work order and "fake" invoices were executed by the officials of Reliance Group in collusion with accomplice Biswal.

"After arrangement of the fraudulent Bank Guarantee by Biswal Tradelink Reliance Power also paid a hefty fee of ₹5.40 crore to the said shell entity in order to depict the entire arrangement as a genuine commercial transaction," the ED claimed.

[TITLE]US sheds 32K jobs as the White House claims ‘explosive growth’ backed by a GDP surge. But is Trump actually winning?:
[TEXT]
Data from ADP — a global human resources and payroll services software — is used to complement the usual U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) numbers. However, the government shutdown in October and November further obscured just how jobs are doing, due to delayed BLS’ reporting. The next jobs report is expected to be released on Dec. 16. Meanwhile, ADP’s latest monthly jobs report suggests the private sector lost 32,000 jobs in November (2).

Part of the problem in establishing a consensus on how the economy’s doing is that the traditional indicators of a healthy economy tell a conflicting story. GDP and consumer spending, for example, are up, while employment estimates for September show the U.S. continues to bleed jobs.

But GDP is only part of the equation, so the question remains: Is the economy really surging back the way the White House suggests?

As such, the White House

[TITLE]Directors Guild to Meet with Netflix as Theater Owners Call Its Acquisition of Warner Bros. an ‘Unprecedented Threat’ to Movie Business:
[TEXT]
The Directors Guild of America (DGA) is set to meet with Netflix as theater owners call its acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery an “unprecedented threat” to the movie business.

“The news that Netflix had secured exclusive rights to negotiate for WBD [Warner Bros. Discovery] raises significant concerns for the DGA,” the labor union said in a statement to TheWrap.

“We believe that a vibrant, competitive industry — one that fosters creativity and encourages genuine competition for talent — is essential to safeguarding the careers and creative rights of directors and their teams,” the guild said in a statement,” the DGA added.

The labor organization went on to say that it plans to meet with the streaming giant so that it can address its concerns with Netflix’s intentions for one of Hollywood’s most prominent studios.

“We will be meeting with Netflix to outline our concerns and better understand their vision for the future of the company. While we undertake this due diligence we will not be commenting further,” the statement continued.

Theater owners, meanwhile, are blasting the acquisition as an “unprecedented threat” to the film industry, TheWrap reported.

“The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business,” Cinema United President and CEO Michael O’Leary told the outlet.

“The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,” O’Leary continued.

The CEO of Cinema United, the world’s largest exhibition trade association, added that the organization is “ready to support industry changes that lead to increased movie production and give consumers more opportunities to enjoy a day at the local theatre.”

“But Netflix’s stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite,” O’Leary asserted, before urging regulators to “look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have.”

Cinema United reportedly believes that Netflix acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery could risk axing roughly 25 percent of the annual domestic box office, due to the streaming giant having a tendency to release only a few films in theaters, with most being hosted on its platform.

O’Leary pointed out that “Netflix success is television, not movies on the big screen,” adding that “sporadic and truncated theatrical releases to meet awards criteria in a handful of theatres is not a commitment to exhibition.”

The Cinema United CEO also suggested the acquisition could harm local businesses in communities across the country.

“Research shows that for each dollar spent in a local movie theatre, an additional $1.50 is spent in surrounding businesses in the community — restaurants, bars, shopping centers, transportation,” he said.

“That is what is at risk here if we sanction fewer movies in the marketplace. Theatres will close, communities will suffer, jobs will be lost,” O’Leary warned.

California Attorney General Robert Bonta has also raised concerns over a potential Warner Bros. Discovery acquisition deal, telling TheWrap, “Further consolidation in markets that are central to American economic life” will not serve the U.S. economy, consumers, or competition.

[TITLE]Vodafone and ATU win €4.6m EU backing for digital apprenticeships:
[TEXT]

Vodafone Ireland and Atlantic Technological University (ATU) have won €4.6 million from the European Union to develop digital training for engineering and construction apprentices in the west of Ireland.

They are developing a system based at ATU’s Co Donegal campus with Italian tech company FifthIngenium that will combine classroom teaching with remote and virtual training for students.

They have secured €4.6 million for the project from the EU Connecting Europe Facility’s digital fund which, along with their own investment, will bring the total spend on the plan to €6.25 million, said a statement on Monday.

ATU, Vodafone and FifthIngenium will develop virtual construction labs allowing students to practice building using digital models, systems that simulate real building environments and 3D video streaming to teach technical skills.

The initiative will make education “more accessible, especially for people living in rural areas or those balancing work, study and apprenticeship programmes”, they said.

Vodafone and ATU noted that the Government recently pledged to promote careers in construction by expanding apprenticeships, boosting recruitment and improving training opportunities.

James Lawless, Minister for Further and Higher Education, will launch the programme on Monday.

The Republic needs “skilled talent in construction and engineering”, he said in advance of the launch.

“By enabling access to high-quality training nationwide, we are ensuring that Ireland is equipped to deliver the projects that will shape our future,” said Mr Lawless.

Sheila Kavanagh, network director at Vodafone Ireland, said access to training depends on strong digital infrastructure.

“This initiative will give us the ability to train people faster and smarter,” she added.

Prof Graham Heaslip of ATU predicted the project has the potential to revolutionise training.

He added that it demonstrates the university’s ability to attract international industry partners.

Roberto Mangano, chief operations officer at FifthIngenium, said the project is an important step in modernising apprenticeships and giving engineers and construction professionals the digital skills they need.

The partners secured the EU cash with the aid of Vodafone’s Connected Education Programme.

ATU has campuses in Donegal, Galway and Sligo. Its Co Donegal base will pilot the digital apprenticeship project.

[TITLE]PA farmers face rising health care costs as ACA subsidies expire:
[TEXT]
Farming is a profession full of risks. It is physically strenuous and often involves dangerous heavy machinery. Accident reports include farmers falling into grain bins, trapped by farm machinery, shocked by equipment, and more. Farmworkers are also more exposed to chemicals, dust, and gases.

Then there’s the mental toll as farmers navigate challenges outside their control, from financial markets to natural disasters. Suicide rates among farmers are two to five times higher than the national average, according to the American Farm Bureau.

At the same time, most farmers have limited access to healthcare because of the high costs of being self-employed.

Over the years, tax credits and other subsidies included in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have helped lower premiums and made it easier for farmers to access reliable care. Now, though, farmers across the country are bracing for new difficulties ahead. That’s because tax credits created under the Biden administration are set to expire at the end of the year; without congressional intervention, that will mean, on average, a doubling of premiums. At the start of November, farmers on ACA subsidized plans began getting notices that premiums are increasing.

Those higher premiums will come at a time when farmers can least afford them: tariffs, federal funding freezes, and extreme weather are making farming more expensive, with margins tighter than ever. And the loss of credits isn’t just a threat to individuals. It will also impact entire communities across farm country.

“That’s just not sustainable, because right now the margins aren’t there for farming at all,” said Gary Wertish, president of the Minnesota Farmers Union.

Taken together, this has left farmers across the country with a number of bad options: pay premiums at the expense of operations; take only catastrophic policies; drop insurance completely; or move somewhere cheaper.

How the ACA impacts farmers

The ACA was signed into law in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama. Among other major reforms to U.S. healthcare, the ACA established new policies and protections for private insurance purchased from the marketplace. Later, the Biden administration implemented ACA-enhanced premium tax credits that limited the amount a person must pay for upfront costs of insurance.

These enhanced credits were extended by the Inflation Reduction Act through 2025. If they are not extended, the original ACA premium caps will return, and that is expected to raise premiums.

Florence Becot, a researcher with Penn State University, has focused on farmer access to services like healthcare, child care, and mental health services for the past decade. She said access to affordable healthcare has been a persistent issue year over year.

When the ACA was first adopted, Becot said, farmers were split on the package. For some it was life changing, while others lost access to coverage plans they’d had for years. But more recently, with the passage of the credits and other additions to the ACA, the cost for plans have dropped.

Getting insurance from the ACA marketplace has often been the last resort for many farmers, she said, but many have found it easier because of the ACA credits.

Now approximately 27 percent of farmers rely on healthcare from the marketplace, which is

[TITLE]The Trump administration’s data center push could open the door for new forever chemicals:
[TEXT]
This story was originally published by Wired and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

In recent months, the Trump administration has opened a deregulatory floodgate in the name of building more data centers. Among other things, this has involved ordering rollbacks of clean water regulations and opening up public lands to coal mining.

Now, it’s turning its eye to chemical regulation with a new policy that could, experts say, potentially fast-track the approval of new chemicals for use in the U.S. — including new types of forever chemicals — with limited oversight.

In September, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would be prioritizing the regulatory review of new chemicals used in data centers or related projects. The announcement is part of a sweeping set of overhauls pushed by the Trump administration following several executive orders related to AI and a White House AI Action Plan, both rolled out in July. The Action Plan was formed after soliciting more than 10,000 public comments, which included hundreds from industry interests. These actions, the White House has said, will usher in a “golden age for American manufacturing and technological dominance.”

“I think they want to impose as few restrictions as possible on chemicals,” says Greg Schweer, who served as the EPA chief of the new chemicals management branch between 2008 and 2020. “In previous administrations, political people stayed out of [chemical regulation] — they tried to let science win. Here, the industry has a willing set of ears that wants to listen to their opinions.”

September’s announcement was part of a larger push to expedite new chemical reviews at the EPA. The new chemical review process underwent a significant reform in 2016; in the decade since, a backlog of chemical reviews has piled up at the agency, garnering complaints from industry and bipartisan criticism from lawmakers. Clearing out that backlog has been a priority of Trump’s second-term EPA. Helping to lead that charge at the agency are several former chemical industry executives, lobbyists, and lawyers.

“We inherited a massive backlog of new chemical reviews from the Biden administration, which is getting in the way of projects as it pertains to data center and artificial intelligence projects,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “The Trump EPA wants to get out of the way and help speed up progress on these critical developments, as opposed to gumming up the works.”

As part of September’s announcement, the EPA created instructions for companies to submit documentation showing that the chemical for which they are seeking expedited review is part of a “qualifying project.” Companies must prove that the substance they want reviewed more quickly will be used in data centers or “covered component projects.” That includes projects that add at least 100 megawatts to the electric grid or projects that “[protect] national security,” as well as any projects deemed applicable by the secretary of defense, the secretary of the interior, the secretary of commerce, or the secretary of energy.

[TITLE]Mint Explainer | India, Russia to deepen nuclear ties: What it means for India’s 100 GW goal:
[TEXT]
NEW DELHI: During Russian president Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to India, the two countries agreed to deepen civil nuclear cooperation. Russia has already helped India build the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant and has now committed to supporting the plant’s fuel cycle and long-term life-cycle requirements in Tamil Nadu.

Both sides also agreed to resume discussions on identifying a site for jointly developing another nuclear power plant. As India targets 100 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047, the partnership with Russia is expected to play a critical role.

Mint takes a closer look at the prospects for the proposed cooperation and its implications for India’s nuclear ambitions.

What have both countries committed to on nuclear power cooperation?

India and Russia have agreed to accelerate technical and commercial talks on pressurized water reactors, research and joint development of nuclear plants, localization and joint manufacturing of nuclear equipment, and fuel assemblies for Russian-designed large-capacity plants, subject to mutually acceptable terms.

A joint statement after the India-Russia Annual Summit on Friday noted “the importance of cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy as a significant component of the strategic partnership," especially given India’s plans to expand nuclear capacity to 100 GW by 2047.

Along with fuel supplies to Kudankulam, the two sides emphasised the need to finalize the second site for a jointly developed nuclear plant. The statement added that India will work toward formal allotment of this site under earlier agreements.

What is the history of India–Russia collaboration in the nuclear space?

Russia has long been one of India’s most significant partners in nuclear energy. The partnership began in 1961 with an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation in peaceful atomic energy, followed in 1968 by arrangements for exchanging scientists and experts between India’s Atomic Energy Commission and the State Committee for Atomic Energy of the erstwhile Soviet Union.

In 1976, the countries signed a heavy-water supply agreement for the Rajasthan Atomic Power Stations (RAPS I and II). Russia later supported the development of the Kudankulam plant, widely seen as a milestone in bilateral energy ties.

The plant uses Russian VVER-1000 reactors supplied by Rosatom. In 1988, India and the Soviet Union signed an agreement to construct two 1,000 MWe VVER reactors at Kudankulam.

What is the current status of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant?

Located in Tamil Nadu’s Tirunelveli district, Kudankulam is India’s largest nuclear facility, with a planned capacity of 6,000 MW across six VVER-1000 reactors developed with Rosatom and operated by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. Construction began in 2002, although the early units faced delays due to local protests.

This month, during Putin’s visit, Rosatom’s nuclear fuel division began delivering fuel for Unit 3. Both sides also agreed to broaden cooperation at Kudankulam, including on the fuel cycle and long-term life-cycle support.

Why is nuclear power important for India’s energy transition?

Nuclear power, as a non-fossil source, is expected to supply future baseload electricity currently provided largely by coal. Baseload refers to the minimum continuous power needed by the grid.

With India expected to reduce coal dependence over the coming decades, nuclear is seen as a stable alternative. Since solar and wind remain intermittent, reliable baseload sources are essential for maintaining grid stability.

What is the current status of nuclear power generation in India?

India currently operates 24 reactors with a combined capacity of

[TITLE]JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says Europe has a ‘real problem’:
[TEXT]
JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called out slow bureaucracy in Europe in a warning that a “weak” continent poses a major economic risk to the US.

“Europe has a real problem,” Dimon said Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum. “They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”

While he praised some European leaders who he said were aware of the issues, he cautioned politics is “really hard.”

Dimon, leader of the biggest US bank, has long said that the risk of a fragmented Europe is among the major challenges facing the world. In his letter to shareholders released earlier this year, he said that Europe has “some serious issues to fix.”

On Saturday, he praised the creation of the euro and Europe’s push for peace. But he warned that a reduction in military efforts and challenges trying to reach agreement within the European Union are threatening the continent.

“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore,” Dimon said. “It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important.”

He said the US should help.

“We need a long-term strategy to help them become strong,” Dimon said. “A weak Europe is bad for us.”

The administration of President Donald Trump issued a new national security strategy that directed US interests toward the Western Hemisphere and protection of the homeland while dismissing Europe as a continent headed toward “civilizational erasure.”

JPMorgan has been ramping up its push to spur more investments in the national defense sector. In October, the bank announced that it would funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next 10 years — as much as $500 billion more than what it would’ve provided anyway.

Dimon said in the statement that it’s “painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing.”

Investment banker Jay Horine oversees the effort, which Dimon called “100% commercial.” It will focus on four areas: supply chain and advanced manufacturing; defense and aerospace; energy independence and resilience; and frontier and strategic technologies.

The bank will also invest as much as $10 billion of its own capital to help certain companies expand, innovate or accelerate strategic manufacturing.

Separately on Saturday, Dimon praised Trump for finding ways to roll back bureaucracy in the government.

“There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America,” Dimon said. “That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that.”

How Modern Aerospace Materials Are Used in the Industry

For nearly a century, aluminum was the dominant material in aerospace manufacturing, chosen for its light weight, strength and relatively low cost. It defined the first generation of all-metal aircraft and continued to serve as the backbone of aerospace engineering for decades. Today, however, the material mix looks very different.

Modern jets contain significantly less pure aluminum, with many noncritical structures, such as paneling and interior components, replaced by advanced composites like carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) and honeycomb materials.

At the same time, critical components such as engine parts demand metals that can balance lighter weight with the ability to withstand extreme heat and stress. This has led to wider adoption of titanium alloys, high-performance superalloys, and other advanced materials that were once considered too costly or difficult to machine.

For manufacturers and machine shops, these changes bring both challenges and opportunities.
