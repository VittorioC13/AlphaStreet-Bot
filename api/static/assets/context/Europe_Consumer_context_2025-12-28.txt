[TITLE]$950M deal to sell more than 100 JCPenney stores collapses:
[TEXT]
A $950 million deal to sell more than 100 JCPenney locations to a private equity firm fell apart at the last minute.

Onyx Partners, a Boston-based investment firm, was set to acquire 119 JCPenney stores from the Copper Property CTL Pass Through Trust, which was created during the retail chain’s bankruptcy proceedings in 2020.

The deal fell through Monday — just ahead of a Friday deadline to close the sale to Onyx, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing by the special trust.

The entity, which oversees management of around 160 stores and six distribution centers, was created to liquidate the real estate under court-mandated deadlines.

Under the terms of JCPenney’s bankruptcy agreement, the trust had a hard deadline of Jan. 30, 2026 to complete its liquidation of the store’s real estate assets.

In July, Onyx announced it had agreed to buy 119 JCPenney store properties for $947 million in cash — which came out to roughly $8 million per store.

But the asking price drew pushback from trust investors, who pointed to previous Copper Property sales that averaged several million dollars more per store.

Some questioned whether it would have been wiser to turn the portfolio into a real estate investment trust — thus allowing Copper Property to keep the stores and charge JCPenney rent so as to create a steady income stream over the long term.

But Copper Property executives were pressed for time and cited the urgency of meeting the deadlines.

Nick Egelanian, president of retail development firm SiteWorks, told the news site Retail Dive that the precise reason the deal unraveled isn’t clear, but he outlined three likely explanations: lenders may have pulled back, the buyer may have reconsidered the value of the real estate itself or concerns

[TITLE]Pet care is set to become India’s next FMCG battleground in 2026:
[TEXT]
Drools has been the closest competitor to Mars in recent years, but the influx of new FMCG players is expected to reshape pricing dynamics. Industry experts, however, believe the impact will be measured. “Reliance will be an important player, but I don’t see it dominating any time soon,” commented Santosh Sreedhar, partner at Avalon Consulting. He noted that Reliance’s scale would come through its retail chain, not the broader distribution network built over years by Mars or Drools. Sreedhar expects Waggies and HappyFur to cater to the mid-lower price band, while significant acceleration might occur in the mid-premium segment, balancing affordability and quality for large-scale adoption.

Synopsis

FIIs have pulled out heavily from Indian equities in 2025, but brokerages see scope for stabilisation and a gradual reversal. While IPO activity and global return differentials have diverted foreign flows, expectations of Fed rate cuts, improving earnings visibility and normalised valuations could support sentiment. Most brokerages recommend a selective, buy-on-dips strategy heading into 2026.

[TITLE]Best Peptides for Weight Loss 2026: Industry Analysis Examines Compounded GLP-1 Telehealth Access and Pricing Transparency:
[TEXT]
Orlando, Dec. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not medical advice. "Best" in this context refers to an industry analysis framework examining verification factors, service-model transparency, provider model structure, and disclosure quality—not clinical superiority or guaranteed outcomes. Compounded GLP-1 medications are prepared by licensed U.S. pharmacies and are not FDA-approved as finished products. They have not been reviewed or approved by the FDA for weight loss or weight management. FDA-approved branded medications such as Ozempic (semaglutide) and Wegovy (semaglutide) exist separately—Ozempic is approved for type 2 diabetes and may be prescribed off-label for weight management; Wegovy is FDA-approved for chronic weight management. The branded medication Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes; Zepbound (tirzepatide) is FDA-approved for weight management. Evaluation by a licensed clinician is required for prescription medications, and prescription approval is not guaranteed.

As millions of Americans prepare New Year weight loss resolutions for 2026, consumer interest in "best peptides for weight loss" remains elevated, reflecting ongoing demand for prescription GLP-1 medications as part of medically supervised weight management. This industry analysis examines how telehealth platforms are structuring access to compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide, with Sprout Health Weight Loss serving as a representative case study based on publicly available disclosures from its platform.

For those researching peptides for fat loss or prescription weight loss peptides heading into 2026, understanding what telehealth platforms actually offer—and what they don't guarantee—is essential before making any decisions.

Important Regulatory Context: The FDA has increased scrutiny of compounded GLP-1 telehealth marketing across the industry in recent years. According to FDA guidance, compounded drugs are not FDA-approved, and the FDA does not review them for safety, effectiveness, or quality before marketing. The FDA has also warned

Customer Journey Mapping Software Market Overview

1. Market Definition and Scope

The customer journey mapping software market encompasses digital tools designed to visualize, analyze, and optimize customer interactions across multiple touchpoints throughout the buying lifecycle. These platforms help organizations understand customer behavior, preferences, emotions, and pain points by integrating data from online, offline, and omnichannel sources. The scope of the market includes cloud-based and on-premises solutions used by enterprises of all sizes to improve engagement, retention, and conversion rates. Customer journey mapping software is widely applied across industries such as retail, BFSI, healthcare, IT & telecom, travel, and e-commerce. As businesses increasingly prioritize customer-centric strategies, the market has evolved from simple journey visualization tools to advanced platforms embedded with analytics, AI, and automation capabilities, enabling real-time insights and predictive decision-making.

2. Evolution of Customer Experience Management

The market has grown alongside the evolution of customer experience (CX) management from reactive service models to proactive and personalized engagement strategies. Earlier approaches relied heavily on surveys and basic CRM systems, offering limited visibility into customer journeys. Modern customer journey mapping software provides end-to-end journey orchestration, combining behavioral data, sentiment analysis, and contextual insights. This evolution is driven by rising customer expectations for seamless, consistent experiences across digital and physical channels. Organizations now leverage journey mapping tools not only to identify friction points but also to redesign processes, align internal teams, and enhance service delivery. As CX becomes a key competitive differentiator, customer journey mapping software is increasingly viewed as a strategic investment rather than a supporting tool.

3. Technology Integration and Innovation

Technological advancements play a central role in shaping the customer journey mapping software market. Integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, and natural language processing has significantly enhanced software capabilities. These technologies enable real-time journey tracking, predictive modeling, and automated recommendations to improve customer interactions. Cloud computing has further expanded market reach by offering scalable, cost-effective, and easily deployable solutions. Additionally, integration with CRM, marketing automation, contact center, and customer data platforms has strengthened the value proposition of journey mapping tools. Continuous innovation is allowing vendors to offer deeper insights, faster analysis, and more actionable intelligence, supporting data-driven CX strategies across complex customer ecosystems.

4. Deployment Models and Accessibility

The market offers a range of deployment models, including cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid solutions. Cloud-based customer journey mapping software dominates adoption due to its flexibility, lower upfront costs, and ease of integration with existing digital infrastructure. Small and medium-sized enterprises increasingly favor SaaS-based models to access advanced CX capabilities without significant IT investments. Large enterprises, particularly in regulated industries, may still adopt on-premises or hybrid solutions to address data security and compliance requirements. Improved user interfaces, low-code platforms, and visualization dashboards have made these tools accessible to non-technical users, expanding adoption beyond IT teams to marketing, sales, and customer support functions.

5. Industry Adoption Trends

Adoption of customer journey mapping software spans multiple industries, each with distinct use cases. Retail and e-commerce companies use these tools to optimize omnichannel shopping experiences and reduce cart abandonment. BFSI organizations leverage journey mapping to improve onboarding, service personalization, and customer trust. Healthcare providers apply journey insights to enhance patient experience and care coordination. Telecom and IT service providers use journey mapping to reduce churn and improve service responsiveness. As digital engagement becomes integral across sectors, industry-specific customization and vertical-focused solutions are driving broader adoption and deeper market penetration.

6. Role in Data-Driven Decision Making

Customer journey mapping software plays a critical role in enabling data-driven decision-making. By consolidating data from multiple sources, these platforms provide a unified view of the customer, supporting informed strategic and operational decisions. Organizations can measure journey performance, identify bottlenecks, and prioritize improvements based on real customer data rather than assumptions. Advanced analytics allow businesses to quantify the impact of CX initiatives on revenue, loyalty, and brand perception. This capability aligns journey mapping tools with broader business intelligence and performance management frameworks, reinforcing their importance in enterprise digital transformation initiatives.

7. Competitive Landscape and Market Maturity

The customer journey mapping software market is moderately competitive, with a mix of established enterprise software providers and specialized CX technology vendors. Market maturity varies by region, with developed markets showing higher adoption rates, while emerging economies present strong growth opportunities. Vendors compete on factors such as analytics depth, ease of integration, scalability, industry expertise, and pricing models. Continuous feature enhancements, partnerships, and acquisitions are common strategies to strengthen market positioning. As competition intensifies, differentiation increasingly depends on delivering actionable insights and measurable CX outcomes rather than standalone visualization capabilities.

8. Future Market Outlook

The future of the customer journey mapping software market is strongly aligned with ongoing digitalization and experience-driven business models. Growing emphasis on personalization, omnichannel consistency, and real-time engagement will continue to fuel demand. The integration of generative AI, advanced predictive analytics, and automation is expected to further transform journey mapping into a dynamic, self-optimizing capability. Additionally, rising awareness of customer lifetime value and retention economics will push organizations to invest more deeply in journey intelligence. Overall, the market outlook remains positive, supported by sustained enterprise focus on customer-centric growth strategies and continuous technological innovation.

Geographic Dominance:

North America dominates the customer journey mapping software market, driven by early adoption of advanced customer experience technologies, strong digital infrastructure, and the presence of leading software vendors. Enterprises across the U.S. and Canada actively invest in data analytics, AI-powered CX platforms, and omnichannel engagement tools to maintain competitive advantage. Europe follows closely, supported by rising digital transformation initiatives, growing emphasis on customer-centric business models, and regulatory frameworks encouraging structured data management. The Asia-Pacific region is witnessing the fastest growth, fueled by rapid digitalization, expanding e-commerce, increasing smartphone penetration, and growing awareness of customer experience management among enterprises in countries such as China, India, Japan, and Australia. Latin America and the Middle East & Africa are emerging markets, gradually adopting customer journey mapping software as organizations modernize customer engagement strategies and expand digital service delivery.

Clothes destined for Europe could soon require digital passports to prove their green credentials, opening a new era of transparency for the world’s $1.7 trillion fashion industry.

Consumers will be ‍able to scan QR codes or electronic tags to see the garments’ digital product passports (DPPs) and check if a fashion brand’s green claims are true.

The passports will tell consumers what the clothes ‍are made of, how much energy, water and chemicals were used to make them, and who took part in each stage of their production.

Textile suppliers from Bangladesh, the world’s second largest apparel exporter, may need to implement an initial version of the passport as early as 2027, according to analysis by the European Parliamentary Research Service.

“As consumers place a higher premium on ‌sustainability and transparency, the digital product passport could be a key tool to provide granular records

[TITLE]Digital Brands Group Advances Suite of AI-Powered Tools for Global Brand Protection and Growth:
[TEXT]
Austin, Texas, Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digital Brands Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBGI) (the “Company,” “Digital Brands Group” or “DBG”) today announces continued progress in its strategy to build a comprehensive suite of technology-driven tools designed to protect, support, and grow modern consumer brands operating in global eCommerce markets.

Brand misuse and counterfeiting have become a critical global issue, with the counterfeit economy estimated at over US$1.7 trillion annually, eroding consumer trust, damaging brand equity, and diverting billions in legitimate revenue. As commerce and content increasingly move online, Digital Brands Group is assembling an ecosystem of specialized, AI-driven technology solutions to address these challenges at scale, beginning with the onboarding of tools focused on intellectual property protection, counterfeiting, data integrity, and digital trust. SECUR3D Inc. is among the first technology providers integrated into this expanding ecosystem, delivering AI-powered brand and IP protection capabilities across global digital marketplaces and platforms.

SECUR3D’s flagship platform, AssetSafe™, uses advanced AI to identify, monitor, and address unauthorized use of brand assets, including counterfeit products, copied designs, and misuse of trademarks across eCommerce and social channels. SECUR3D’s technology has been deployed across high-profile entertainment, consumer, and digital properties, with experience supporting IP associated with globally recognized franchises such as Godzilla, Star Trek, Jurassic World, Back to the Future, and other major brands.

“Digital brands today face a rapidly evolving threat landscape as commerce, content, and IP move online,” said Hil Davis, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Brands Group. “Our goal is to build a scalable suite of tools that helps brands protect their identity, maintain consumer trust, and operate more securely in digital environments. SECUR3D represents one of the first foundational technologies in that strategy, and we expect to continue onboarding additional tools that expand the capabilities of this platform over time.”

Digital Brands Group plans to introduce further AI-driven and data-centric solutions into its technology stack, creating an integrated offering that can be deployed across its own portfolio and with select external brand partners. The Company believes this approach positions Digital Brands Group as more than a brand operator, but as a technology-enabled platform supporting the next generation of commerce.

[TITLE]Best Beauty & Wellness Products to Use Your FSA Money On (Before It Expires in a Week):
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

Merry Christmas — it’s time to use your FSA funds before they go away forever after December 31. And if that acronym means nothing to you, let us break it down. A flexible savings account consists of money sourced from your (pre-tax) paychecks: to be put towards expenses like “deductibles, co-pays, and medical office visits,” per MetLife. Sometimes but not always, employers pitch into this account; in most cases, the total does not roll over into the next year, meaning it operates on a “use it by December 31 or lose it” policy, with the occasional grace period given depending on where you work. This is not the case for an HSA (health savings account), which rolls over yearly and even stays with you between jobs. That being said, while you can certainly also take advantage of HSA to shop the products we’ll be rounding up in just a second, there’s much less urgency to do so now than with an FSA.

What Beauty and Wellness Products are FSA-Eligible?

If this is news to you, you’re not the only one. The Fast Company reports that, “in 2023, around half of all FSA account holders forfeited some funds back to their employers, with the average amount left in accounts being $436.” That’s over $400 that could’ve been put towards something useful, which doesn’t necessarily mean a post-visit financial obligation to your dermatologist. Indeed, a myriad of beauty products can be bought through your FSA — including trending picks and essentials like sunscreen, LED face masks, tinted moisturizers, and more. So too does eyewear from buzzy brands like Warby Parker and Glasses USA fit the bill, not to mention our readers’ favorite sauna blankets and other devices geared towards wellness.

Sephora and Ulta each have their own dedicated sections online called “FSA & HSA Eligible,” where you can stock up on everything from editor-loved Touchland hand sanitizers and Clinique foundations to innovative liquid pimple patches from Kiehl’s and even shimmering sunscreens from Sol de Janeiro. Standalone beauty companies also have their own FSA-specific categories. Clarins’, for example, features the likes of anti-aging cream and plumping moisturizer.

Makeup products rarely qualify, but skin care that specifically has an SPF rating, plus acne-related products, almost always do. As a handy rule of thumb, any topical that’s made up of ingredients that treat or prevent medical conditions — skin cancer included — is one you’re very likely to be able to pay for via FSA.

How to Pay for FSA-Eligible Beauty and Wellness Products Online

When all is said and done and you’ve picked out all the beauty goodies that will effectively drain your flexible savings account for 2025, how does one go

Customer Journey Mapping Software Market Overview

1. Market Definition and Scope

The customer journey mapping software market encompasses digital tools designed to visualize, analyze, and optimize customer interactions across multiple touchpoints throughout the buying lifecycle. These platforms help organizations understand customer behavior, preferences, emotions, and pain points by integrating data from online, offline, and omnichannel sources. The scope of the market includes cloud-based and on-premises solutions used by enterprises of all sizes to improve engagement, retention, and conversion rates. Customer journey mapping software is widely applied across industries such as retail, BFSI, healthcare, IT & telecom, travel, and e-commerce. As businesses increasingly prioritize customer-centric strategies, the market has evolved from simple journey visualization tools to advanced platforms embedded with analytics, AI, and automation capabilities, enabling real-time insights and predictive decision-making.

2. Evolution of Customer Experience Management

The market has grown alongside the evolution of customer experience (CX) management from reactive service models to proactive and personalized engagement strategies. Earlier approaches relied heavily on surveys and basic CRM systems, offering limited visibility into customer journeys. Modern customer journey mapping software provides end-to-end journey orchestration, combining behavioral data, sentiment analysis, and contextual insights. This evolution is driven by rising customer expectations for seamless, consistent experiences across digital and physical channels. Organizations now leverage journey mapping tools not only to identify friction points but also to redesign processes, align internal teams, and enhance service delivery. As CX becomes a key competitive differentiator, customer journey mapping software is increasingly viewed as a strategic investment rather than a supporting tool.

3. Technology Integration and Innovation

Technological advancements play a central role in shaping the customer journey mapping software market. Integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, and natural language processing has significantly enhanced software capabilities. These technologies enable real-time journey tracking, predictive modeling, and automated recommendations to improve customer interactions. Cloud computing has further expanded market reach by offering scalable, cost-effective, and easily deployable solutions. Additionally, integration with CRM, marketing automation, contact center, and customer data platforms has strengthened the value proposition of journey mapping tools. Continuous innovation is allowing vendors to offer deeper insights, faster analysis, and more actionable intelligence, supporting data-driven CX strategies across complex customer ecosystems.

4. Deployment Models and Accessibility

The market offers a range of deployment models, including cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid solutions. Cloud-based customer journey mapping software dominates adoption due to its flexibility, lower upfront costs, and ease of integration with existing digital infrastructure. Small and medium-sized enterprises increasingly favor SaaS-based models to access advanced CX capabilities without significant IT investments. Large enterprises, particularly in regulated industries, may still adopt on-premises or hybrid solutions to address data security and compliance requirements. Improved user interfaces, low-code platforms, and visualization dashboards have made these tools accessible to non-technical users, expanding adoption beyond IT teams to marketing, sales, and customer support functions.

5. Industry Adoption Trends

Adoption of customer journey mapping software spans multiple industries, each with distinct use cases. Retail and e-commerce companies use these tools to optimize omnichannel shopping experiences and reduce cart abandonment. BFSI organizations leverage journey mapping to improve onboarding, service personalization, and customer trust. Healthcare providers apply journey insights to enhance patient experience and care coordination. Telecom and IT service providers use journey mapping to reduce churn and improve service responsiveness. As digital engagement becomes integral across sectors, industry-specific customization and vertical-focused solutions are driving broader adoption and deeper market penetration.

6. Role in Data-Driven Decision Making

Customer journey mapping software plays a critical role in enabling data-driven decision-making. By consolidating data from multiple sources, these platforms provide a unified view of the customer, supporting informed strategic and operational decisions. Organizations can measure journey performance, identify bottlenecks, and prioritize improvements based on real customer data rather than assumptions. Advanced analytics allow businesses to quantify the impact of CX initiatives on revenue, loyalty, and brand perception. This capability aligns journey mapping tools with broader business intelligence and performance management frameworks, reinforcing their importance in enterprise digital transformation initiatives.

7. Competitive Landscape and Market Maturity

The customer journey mapping software market is moderately competitive, with a mix of established enterprise software providers and specialized CX technology vendors. Market maturity varies by region, with developed markets showing higher adoption rates, while emerging economies present strong growth opportunities. Vendors compete on factors such as analytics depth, ease of integration, scalability, industry expertise, and pricing models. Continuous feature enhancements, partnerships, and acquisitions are common strategies to strengthen market positioning. As competition intensifies, differentiation increasingly depends on delivering actionable insights and measurable CX outcomes rather than standalone visualization capabilities.

8. Future Market Outlook

The future of the customer journey mapping software market is strongly aligned with ongoing digitalization and experience-driven business models. Growing emphasis on personalization, omnichannel consistency, and real-time engagement will continue to fuel demand. The integration of generative AI, advanced predictive analytics, and automation is expected to further transform journey mapping into a dynamic, self-optimizing capability. Additionally, rising awareness of customer lifetime value and retention economics will push organizations to invest more deeply in journey intelligence. Overall, the market outlook remains positive, supported by sustained enterprise focus on customer-centric growth strategies and continuous technological innovation.
