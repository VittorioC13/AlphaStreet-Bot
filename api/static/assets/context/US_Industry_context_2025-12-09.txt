[TITLE]Karnataka eyes to attract $150 b investment in electronics manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Karnataka is targeting investments worth $150 billion in mobile and electronic product manufacturing and design over the next decade.

Industries Minister MB Patil held discussions on Thursday with a delegation led by Pankaj Mohindroo, Chairman of the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), to chart a roadmap for the sector.

The Union Ministry of Electronics and IT launched an electronics components manufacturing scheme in April 2024, offering performance-linked incentives and up to 25 per cent capital subsidy.

The Centre has allocated ₹22,900 crore for the program, which prioritises sub-assemblies such as displays and camera modules, bare components, and essential manufacturing equipment.

Pankaj Mohindroo said the Union scheme prioritises sub-assemblies such as displays and camera modules, bare components, and essential manufacturing equipment. He added that the programme offers performance-linked incentives and up to 25 per cent capital subsidy. The Centre has earmarked ₹22,900 crore for the scheme, he said.

Karnataka is also now exploring the possibility of introducing a parallel State-level scheme, noted Patil. “The proposal is still in the draft stage, and we welcome suggestions from ICEA,” Patil said after the meeting.

Till November 2024, the Union Government had approved 17 investment proposals worth ₹7,172 crore under the scheme. These projects are expected to create 11,800 direct jobs and generate products valued at over ₹65,000 crore, said Mohindroo.

The meeting was attended by Industries Department Principal Secretary S Selvakumar, Industries Commissioner Gunjan Krishna, and other senior officials.

[TITLE]India Invests in Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
India Approves $7 Billion Plan to Boost Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing

The Indian government has approved a significant rare earth manufacturing program worth approximately $7 billion (7 billion Rupees). This ambitious initiative, known as the ‘Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Manufacturing Promotion Scheme,’ represents a major step towards establishing a robust domestic rare earth permanent magnet (REPM) production capacity in India.

According to India’s Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the program aims to achieve an integrated annual production capacity of 6,000 metric tons of REPM. These magnets are considered among the most powerful permanent magnets available and are crucial components in various rapidly growing industries, including electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, electronics, aerospace, and defense.

The approved plan will foster the development of integrated manufacturing facilities. These facilities will cover the entire process from converting rare earth oxides into metals, metals into alloys, and finally, alloys into finished rare earth permanent magnets. This integrated approach is expected to streamline production and reduce reliance on external suppliers.

The surge in demand for rare earth materials and rare earth magnets is primarily driven by the rapid expansion of EVs, the renewable energy sector, diverse industrial applications, and increasing consumption of consumer electronics. Currently, India heavily relies on imports to meet its demand. In the fiscal year ending March 2025, the country imported around 53,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets.

Currently, China dominates the market for these essential elements. Recently China has tightened export regulations on these magnets, especially after the US increased tariffs. Rare earth magnets are permanent magnets made from alloys of rare earth elements. Their power makes them indispensable for devices like electric motors, generators, and hard disk drives.

Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals, creating a substance with enhanced properties. Rare earth magnets are known for their superior magnetic strength, high coercivity, and strong energy production capabilities. Magnetic strength defines a magnet’s power to attract or repel another magnet. Coercivity is the resistance of a magnet to demagnetization.

Energy product describes the total magnetic energy that a magnet can store. The high magnetic strength of rare earth magnets stems from the large number of unpaired electrons in their alloys, creating an exceptionally powerful magnetic field.

The high coercivity is attributed to the high magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which aligns the magnetic moments of atoms within the magnet strongly in one direction, making it difficult to demagnetize.

The high energy product of rare earth magnets is a result of the combination of their high strength and high coercivity, enabling them to store substantial amounts of energy.

Key Applications of Rare Earth Magnets:

* Electric Motors

* Generators

* Hard Disk Drives

* MRI Machines

* Headphones

* Microphones

* Magnetic Separators

* Magnetic Bearings

* Magnetic Jewelry

This initiative is poised to transform India’s manufacturing landscape, creating new opportunities in the rare earth magnets sector and contributing to the growth of various key industries.

[TITLE]Venture capital firms race to back next consumer AI breakout:
[TEXT]
The recent success of several consumer tech companies in public markets has prompted Indian venture capital funds to back the next wave—startups using artificial intelligence (AI) to build products.

Several companies have picked up early-stage cheques this year. In August, AI-powered entertainment company Dashverse raised $13 million from Peak XV, with participation from Stellaris and Z47. Audio and video content platform Kuku FM raised $85 million from Granite Asia in October. Former Housing.com chief executive Jason Kothari's startup Mythik also received $15 million in May from Sakal Media Group, VC Grid, Viscera Capital as well as Shah Rukh Khan's family office. And that’s just content-generation as a space.

Indians spend an average of nearly seven hours a day accessing various services and products on the internet, according to social media intelligence firm Meltwater. Time spent has gone up by five minutes from 2024. Mobile devices account for 58% of time spent online. “With time spent on the phone going up, and more people coming online, consumer AI companies will have even bigger markets to go after," said Anant Vidur Puri, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners.

On the edtech side, English language learning startup SpeakX raised $16 million, led by WestBridge Capital, personalised learning company Arivihan raised $4.17 million from Prosus Ventures and Accel. Stimuler, a voice-first tutor for English as a second language, secured $3.75 million in pre-Series A funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners, SWC Global, and others. Seekho raised $28 million from Bessemer Venture Partners as well.

Funds like Stellaris and Bessemer are both actively scouting for AI-led consumer tech companies. “There are opportunities across the board, from edtech to financial services, healthcare travel, and even content," said Rahul Chowdhri, partner at Stellaris Venture Partners. “Wherever there have been traditionally purely digital experiences, AI can play an interesting role there."

According to a report by San Francisco-based venture fund Menlo Ventures, there are 1.8 billion people globally who use consumer AI at least weekly or monthly, of which 600 million use it daily. In the same vein, $12.1 billion was spent on consumer AI tools, though most of this goes towards general AI assistants. Crucially, only
