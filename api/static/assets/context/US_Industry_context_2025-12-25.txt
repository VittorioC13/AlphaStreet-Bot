[TITLE]Samsung Biologics to Acquire First U.S. Drug Manufacturing Facility in $280M Deal – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
A South Korean biomanufacturing giant is set to purchase its first drug production facility in the U.S. for a sum worthy of its tech giant parent.

Samsung Biologics’ American subsidiary will pay $280 million to acquire biopharmaceutical company Human Genome Sciences from GSK, in a deal expected to close early next year. The deal secures Samsung Biologics’ first manufacturing base in the U.S., at a two-building campus in Rockville, Md., with a combined 60,000 liters of capacity.

Samsung Biologics is the world’s largest contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) by capacity, with 785,000 liters of current capacity across its two major biomanufacturing campuses in Incheon, South Korea. The company specializes in monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, mRNA therapies and next-generation treatments.

The Maryland industrial/life sciences campus at 9911 Belward Campus Drive will support the production of both clinical and commercial production of pharmaceuticals. Samsung Biologics is expected to retain 500 employees at the sites. The company also plans to further upgrade the facilities and bolster their production capacity.

“This landmark acquisition is a testament to our unwavering commitment to advancing global healthcare and bolstering our manufacturing capabilities in the U.S.,” John Rim, Samsung Biologics president and CEO, said in a statement. “The investment will enable us to deepen our collaboration with federal, state and local stakeholders to best serve our customers and partners while ensuring a reliable and stable supply of life-saving therapeutics.”

The Maryland Life Sciences Corridor, between Rockville, Gaithersburg and East Baltimore — as well as the DMV in general — is among the country’s largest hubs of biotechnology development. Frederick, Md.-based developer Matan Companies earlier this month, for example, secured a 161,500-square-foot lease with Montgomery County Public Schools at the landlord’s two-building industrial/life sciences complex in Gaithersburg. Though it wasn’t immediately clear how the school system plans to use the facility.

AstraZeneca in July meanwhile announced a $50 billion boost to its U.S. investments by 2030. Chief among the pharma giant’s plans is a new $4.5 billion manufacturing facility in Albemarle County, Va., its largest ever built. AstraZeneca will also use the funds to expand its already 1.3 million-square-foot life sciences campus in Gaithersburg, not far from the property owned by Matan. GSK made a similar, $30 billion investment pledge in September.

“Along with GSK’s recent commitment to invest $30 billion in R&D and manufacturing in the US over the next five years, the [Samsung Biologics] deal enables us to further focus on building the agility, capacity and capability needed in our manufacturing network to deliver the next generation of specialty medicines and vaccines. I am confident in a positive partnership and future for the Rockville site,” Regis Simard, GSK’s president of global supply chain, said in a statement.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals is set to invest $250m in the expansion of its facility in Norton, Massachusetts, US, to meet the growing global demand for RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics.

This is claimed to become the first fully dedicated small-interfering RNA (siRNA) enzymatic-ligation manufacturing facility.

The facility expansion is intended to increase capacity, lower production expenses, and enable support for future medicine launches from the company’s development pipeline.

As part of this, the company’s next-generation, scalable enzymatic ligation manufacturing platform, known as siRELIS, has been accepted into the US Food and Drug Administration’s Emerging Technology Program.

The programme is expected to facilitate discussions with global health authorities regarding manufacturing approaches for oligonucleotide-based medicines.

This acceptance comes after pilot-scale production of zilebesiran, which is under investigation for decreasing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in hypertension patients, and nucresiran, being developed for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR).

[TITLE]Gold & Silver Break Out While Bitcoin Chops: Why Capital Is Flowing Into Precious Metals:
[TEXT]
Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level, and market confidence continues to deteriorate as an increasing number of analysts begin to call for a prolonged bear market. Sentiment has turned decisively cautious, with investors reassessing risk exposure and preparing for a potentially challenging period ahead. Despite multiple attempts to stabilize, price action remains compressed, offering little confirmation that bullish momentum is ready to return.

Related Reading

According to an analysis by XWIN Research Japan, the current market phase is best described as a range-bound consolidation following a high-level correction, with momentum conditionally tilted to the downside. While Bitcoin has remained largely sideways over the past three months, traditional safe-haven assets have followed a very different trajectory.

Gold and silver have continued to push higher, reflecting rising demand for defensive assets amid persistent geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainty, and expectations of lower real interest rates.

This divergence highlights a structural challenge for Bitcoin in the current macro environment. Institutional capital can allocate to precious metals with relative ease, benefiting from deep liquidity, established market infrastructure, and clear regulatory frameworks. Silver, in particular, has amplified gold’s move, supported by tighter supply dynamics and greater sensitivity to speculative flows.

Bitcoin’s Role as a Risk Asset Limits Its Upside

The analysis explains that Bitcoin has not followed gold and silver higher because it is still treated primarily as a high-beta risk asset, rather than a pure safe haven. In risk-off environments, capital typically flows first into gold and government bonds, where investors seek stability and capital preservation. Bitcoin, by contrast, is often a secondary consideration, attracting flows only after confidence improves.

Unlike gold’s long-term and relatively price-insensitive buyer base, Bitcoin remains more exposed to short-term positioning and marginal demand, making broad macro tailwinds insufficient on their own to sustain a durable uptrend.

CryptoQuant data reinforces this interpretation. Bitcoin’s apparent demand has recently turned negative, signaling that fresh demand is not expanding even as prices hold at relatively elevated levels.

At the same time, Short-Term Holder SOPR has spent extended periods below 1, indicating that short-term participants are selling at a loss or near breakeven. This behavior typically adds selling pressure on rebounds, as underwater holders use price strength to exit positions.

As long as capital continues to favor gold and silver, Bitcoin’s internal demand structure remains a key constraint. The base case points to continued support for precious metals, while Bitcoin’s upside stays capped by weak demand and short-term holder pressure. That view would only change if apparent demand turns sustainably positive and STH SOPR reclaims and holds above 1.

Price Holds Critical Support as Trend Weakens

Bitcoin is currently trading near the $87,000–$88,000 area after a sharp corrective move from recent highs above $110,000. The chart shows that price has lost the short-term bullish structure, with BTC now firmly below the 50-day moving average (blue), which has started to slope downward. This confirms that short-term momentum has turned negative and rallies are facing increasing overhead supply.

More importantly, price is now testing the 100-day moving average (green), which sits just above the current level and has acted as dynamic support throughout much of this cycle. The market’s reaction around this zone is critical. A sustained hold above the 100-day MA could allow Bitcoin to stabilize and form a base, while a decisive breakdown would likely expose the 200-day moving average (red), currently rising near the low $80,000s.

Volume dynamics reinforce the cautious outlook. The sell-off from the October peak was accompanied by elevated volume, signaling distribution rather than a shallow pullback. Since then, volume has tapered off, suggesting a lack of aggressive dip-buying interest at current levels.

Structurally, Bitcoin remains in a broader uptrend as long as it holds above the 200-day MA, but the loss of the 50-day and weakening momentum indicate consolidation or further downside risk in the near term. Bulls need a recovery back above $90,000 to regain control and shift sentiment meaningfully.

[TITLE]Brett Harrison Raises $35M for Institutional Derivatives Platform:
[TEXT]
Brett Harrison, the former president of the now-defunct FTX US exchange, has closed a $35 million funding round for his new derivatives venture, signaling renewed investor confidence in the sector and continued venture appetite for crypto-linked derivatives infrastructure.

On Tuesday, The Information reported that Harrison’s startup, Architect Financial Technologies, is using the funding to build an institutional trading platform spanning derivatives, equities, futures and digital assets. Participants in the round included Miax, Tioga Capital, ARK Investment, Galaxy and VanEck.

The new capital follows a $12 million funding round in 2024 backed by Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, SALT Fund and other investors.

The funding comes after Architect received regulatory approval in Bermuda to offer perpetual futures contracts tied to traditional assets such as stocks, commodities and foreign currencies. Perpetual futures, or “perps”, were first popularized in crypto markets by BitMEX and later became a core product at FTX prior to its collapse in late 2022.

Architect is explicitly targeting professional and institutional traders, offering features such as algorithmic trading capabilities, advanced risk management tools and multi-asset derivatives support. The company plans to expand beyond Bermuda into additional markets, including Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

Derivatives markets outsize traditional asset trading

Derivatives are widely regarded as the largest segment of global financial markets. By some measures, the notional value of outstanding contracts in over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivatives markets is valued in the hundreds of trillions of dollars, dwarfing world economic output by every conceivable metric.

As S&P Global noted in a February report, the derivatives market is constantly evolving, but liquidity remains a core challenge across many asset classes. Investors are increasingly focused on products with deep liquidity and tight bid-ask spreads, even as market structures and index-based solutions continue to innovate.

Derivatives have been widely embraced by the cryptocurrency sector, though not without consequences. According to some estimates, derivatives account for about 75% to 80% of total trading volume across major crypto exchanges, underscoring their central role in market activity.

That dominance has also amplified volatility. The risks were on display during the crypto market’s Oct. 10 liquidation event, which was the largest in history, with $19 billion erased in a single day.

[TITLE]Capital One Provides $91M Letter of Credit for Bronx Affordable Housing Project – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
A joint venture between developer Type A Projects and BronxWorks has sealed $255.7 million of construction financing to build a 100 percent affordable and supportive housing property in the Bronx, Commercial Observer has learned.

Capital One closed a $91.4 million letter of credit to support municipal bonds issued by the New York City Housing Development Corporation for the planned 328-unit River Commons project located a half-mile from Yankee Stadium. The agency provided $64.3 million of tax-exempt bonds and $27 million of taxable debt.

The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development also supplied $109.9 million through its new construction financing program with Hudson Housing Capital also providing $19 million equity investment by purchasing low income housing tax credits. The project, too, received $34.6 million in tax deferrals for various expenses and $500,000 in capital grant funding from Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson.

“Type A Projects is incredibly proud to be part of the solution to New York City’s affordability crisis with beautifully designed and sustainably built affordable homes for hundreds of families at River Commons,” Annie Tirschwell, principal at Type A Projects, said in a statement.

Located at 1240 River Avenue on the site of a former parking lot, the River Commons project will have 230 apartments designated for those earning below 70 percent of the area median income. An additional 98 units will also be set aside as supportive housing rented in partnership with New York City Health + Hospitals and the city’s Human Resources Administration for homeless individuals.

L+M Development Partners is also part of the development team for the 17-story project slated to begin construction next year.

The River Commons project will have apartments ranging from studios to three bedrooms with residents having access to on-site social services. Community amenities will include a fitness center, a children’s playroom, a community room, co-working space, a 15th-floor community terrace and 24/7 security.

“BronxWorks is proud to be part of the River Commons development, offering much-needed quality affordable housing to individuals and families in the Bronx while simultaneously expanding access to health care and social services to achieve long-term stability,” Eileen Torres, CEO of Bronxworks, said in a statement.

River Commons was spurred by a 2018 Jerome Avenue rezoning plan that allowed 4,600 units of new housing, including 1,150 permanently affordable units along 95 blocks of the central and southern Bronx.

Capital One did not immediately return a request for comment.

[TITLE]BMO Capital Sees Impressive Guidance and Construction Cloud Momentum at Autodesk (ADSK):
[TEXT]
Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) is one of the best growth stocks to buy in 2026. On November 26, BMO Capital raised the firm’s price target on Autodesk to $343 from $333 and kept a Market Perform rating on the shares. Despite a difficult sales environment, Autodesk delivered strong Q3 2025 results marked by improving growth and impressive Q4 guidance. BMO Capital remains optimistic due to the continued success of Construction Cloud and the company’s ongoing efforts to unify siloed workflows for its industrial and construction clients.

A day before this rating, the company announced its Q3 2025 earnings results. Autodesk reported non-GAAP EPS of $2.67, which exceeded analyst expectations of $2.50. Total revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $1.85 billion. This performance was supported by a $124 million contribution from the company’s new transaction model; excluding this impact and currency fluctuations, underlying revenue growth remained a healthy 12%.

BMO Capital Sees Impressive Guidance and Construction Cloud Momentum at Autodesk (ADSK)

Strategic momentum at Autodesk was driven by the convergence of design and make workflows within the Autodesk Construction Cloud/ACC and the integration of AI-powered automations. In the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations/AECO segment, revenue remained strong as investments in data centers and infrastructure offset softness in commercial sectors. Management highlighted that AI adoption is yielding tangible productivity gains, noting that the acceptance rate for AI-powered auto-constraints in Fusion has surpassed 60%, with 90% of those sketches becoming fully constrained.

Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) provides 3D design, engineering, and entertainment technology solutions worldwide.

While we acknowledge the potential of ADSK as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
