What are the Crucial Drivers in the Market?

The growing prevalence of chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and inflammatory bowel disease is fueling the development of IDA among all populations. This further drives demand for advanced IDA therapies. The market is further expanding with consistent research and development, which is emphasising the establishment of more effective oral iron supplements with minimal gastrointestinal side effects.

Trends in the Iron Deficiency Anemia Therapy Market

In September 2025, the World Anemia Awareness partnered with the Society for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management (SABM) to raise global focus on blood health.

In August 2025, Danone India and, Government of Maharashtra partnered to boost awareness on iron deficiency and protein intake among Mumbaikars.

What is the Major Challenge in the Market?

The iron deficiency anemia therapy market is facing limitations due to minimal patient adherence to treatment, side effects from oral supplements, and the presence of comorbidities and other micronutrient deficiencies that complicate treatment.

Regional Analysis

What Made North America Dominant in the Market in 2024?

In 2024, North America accounted for the largest share by 37% of the market. This region is having a major rise in the rate of IDA, mainly among pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals with chronic diseases, including chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Whereas, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against routine screening for iron deficiency in asymptomatic pregnant women, quoting insufficient evidence related to the impact on maternal and infant health.

For instance,

In March 2025, ACCRUFeR (ferric maltol) was made available in Canada as a prescription oral treatment for iron deficiency anemia.
