[TITLE]Georgia Tech reportedly inks massive nine-figure apparel deal to ditch Adidas:
[TEXT]
Georgia Tech is going to have a new apparel partner and it comes with a big time price tag. According to ESPN’s Pete Thamel, the Yellow Jackets have agreed to a 10-year deal with Under Armour to become the school’s official apparel provider, starting July 1, 2026.

Source: Georgia Tech and Under Armour have agreed to a new 10-year deal for UA to become the official apparel provider, effective July 1 of 2026. The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that GTech is getting from current adidas deal. pic.twitter.com/MeZfbDkuTU — Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) October 3, 2025

The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that Georgia Tech is getting from the current Adidas deal, according to Thamel and Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Chad Bishop.

"Tech was receiving an average of $3.11 million annually from Adidas in cash and product over its original six-year contract that was signed in 2018," Bishop said. This figure puts the reported value of Georgia Tech's new deal with UA at $186.6 million over ten years.

Georgia Tech’s previous deal with Adidas was set to expire in the summer of 2024, but the two sides put together a new two-year deal. However, the short-term fix wasn't enough to keep the Yellow Jackets from looking elsewhere.

“We’re thrilled to partner with Under Armour, an organization that shares our commitment to excellence, innovation, amplifying the Georgia Tech brand across the globe and enhancing the student-athlete experience, including through innovative NIL opportunities," GT's Vice president and director of athletics Ryan Alpert said in a statement. "Our partnership with Under Armour will play a big part in Georgia Tech continuing to move forward in the new era of collegiate athletics and reaching our ambitions of competing for championships at the highest levels of collegiate athletics.”

For Under Armour, this deal puts the outfitter back on the map in the new era of college athletics.

“As we mark our 30th anniversary next year, we’re thrilled to team back up with Georgia Tech, our first collegiate client, to experience our commitment to enhancing athletic performance." Under Armour's VP of the Team Division Craig Cummings said in a statement. "We are energized by the momentum in Atlanta and look forward to amplifying our presence in the community through meaningful activations and shared purpose.”

Georgia Tech had worn Russell Athletic for over two decades before switching to Under Armour in 1996. They migrated to Adidas and now the two brands will be reunited after thirty years apart.

The Yellow Jacket's first time officially back in the UA branding will come against Deion Sanders and Colorado in Atlanta on Sept. 5, 2026.

[TITLE]Coinbase Applies For OCC National Trust Charter To Bolster Payments Business:
[TEXT]
Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure

Coinbase has now applied for a national trust charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). This move comes as the American crypto exchange seeks to expand its payment operations amid the rise of favorable crypto policy in the US.

Coinbase Does Not Aim To Be A Bank, VP Says

By definition, the National Trust Charter is a federal charter that allows an institution to operate as a national trust bank. Unlike full-service commercial banks, these types of banks are usually non-depository institutions with their primary activity being limited to fiduciary and trust service, and custody and asset management.

Therefore, this license is particularly attractive to many crypto firms that want to offer trust-type services (e.g., custody of digital assets, stablecoin reserves) at scale and across jurisdictions in the US. However, Coinbase’s focus is on the fiduciary status the license offers. The exchange has expressed its intentions to expand its services beyond custody towards payments and other services, while also denying any intention to morph into a bank.

Coinbase’s VP of Institutional Product, Greg Tusar, explained in a blog post saying:

Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank. It is our firm belief that clear rules and the trust of our regulators and customers enable Coinbase to confidently innovate while ensuring proper oversight and security. If approved, the charter would continue to open up opportunities for Coinbase to launch new products beyond custody, including payments and related services, with the confidence of regulatory clarity, fostering broader institutional adoption.

Tusar has described Coinbase’s application for a national trust charter as a “significant step” in growing the exchange’s business operations and encouraging innovation in the mainstream adoption of crypto assets.

The exchange exec. said:

While progress is underway in Congress to craft clear market structure, crypto is already woven into the fabric of the financial system. An OCC charter will streamline oversight for new offerings and enable continued innovation to integrate digital assets into traditional finance. We’re not the first crypto company to seek a federal charter and we won’t be the last.

Aside from Coinbase, Other crypto firms that have filed similar applications with the OCC include blockchain company Ripple Labs and stablecoin operator Paxos.

Coinbase Payments Push

In addition to seeking a national trust charter, Coinbase has taken other steps to force a venture into the payment markets. In June, the exchange popularly struck a deal with Shopify, which would allow the e-commerce platform to introduce the USDC stablecoin as part of its payment options. At press time, COIN trades at $382 following a slight 2.14% gain in the past day.
