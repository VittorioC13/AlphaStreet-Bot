[TITLE]Indian Oil Corporation lines up ₹1.66 lakh cr investment over next 5 years to grow business:
[TEXT]
Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country's largest oil firm, plans to invest ₹1.66 lakh crore over the next five years to expand its core operations in oil refining and fuel marketing, along with ventures in petrochemicals, natural gas and renewable energy, its chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney said on Saturday.

The firm is scaling up its capacity to refine crude oil into fuels like petrol and diesel from the current 80.75 million tonnes per annum to 98.4 million tonnes by 2028, with major expansions at Panipat, Gujarat and Barauni, he said at the company's annual shareholder meeting.

To move this energy swiftly and sustainably, IOC is expanding its pipeline network - the country's most extensive - to 22,000 km with 21 projects under execution. These include pipeline extensions and new storage facilities in Nepal.

Alongside refining and pipelines, IOC is targeting petrochemicals as the next growth engine, expanding capacity from the current 4.3 million tonnes per annum to over 13 million tonnes capacity by 2030, with a sharp focus on specialty chemicals to reduce import dependence and enhance margins.

The firm will continue to expand its 40,000-plus fuel retailing network, adding new-age sources such as EV chargers, battery-swapping stations and CNG and LNG dispensing outlets.

Alongside core business, IOC is investing ₹2.5 lakh crore in energy transition that will help it achieve net zero operational emissions by 2046, he said, adding the firm is investing in green hydrogen production, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and expanding renewable electricity portfolio from 1 GW to 18 GW within three years.

"Looking ahead, your company has committed around ₹1.66 lakh crore over the next five years, with a sharp focus on petrochemicals, natural gas and renewable energy - balancing India's rising auto-fuel demand with the global energy transition," he said.

Giving details of initiatives to expand operational base, he said IOC is sharpening focus on per-pump throughput, non-fuel retail (NFR) and high-potential segments such as bitumen and bunkering. At the same time, it is seeding future-ready platforms such as LNG bunkering, coastal infrastructure, integrated shipping and data transmission services - ventures that leverage the firm's adjacencies to capture emerging opportunities in a rapidly evolving energy ecosystem.

With a market leadership share of 45 per cent in the LPG, IOC has launched BIS-certified Chhotu Master - a compact 5 kg cylinder and cooktop combo - with the first 'Chhotu Shopee' in Ahmedabad.

For industrial customers, innovative offerings like XtraBoost-high fuel-efficient nano-additized AutoLPG and Propane Plus - advanced propane with cleaner combustion and higher heat output - deliver cleaner, more efficient fuels.

While its Servo lubricants have expanded its global footprint to 45 countries, IOC retained market leadership with a 54.5 per cent share in aviation fuel, commissioning new aviation fuel stations at Srinagar and Rewa.

Its natural gas business surged 20 per cent to 7.9 million tonnes per annum, supported by new sourcing agreements with global majors. Its city gas distribution footprint has spread to 49 geographical areas across 21 states, covering 21 per cent of India's population.

Beyond energy, in the explosives business, a new plant at Neyveli has been commissioned, with greenfield projects in Telangana and Maharashtra underway. In Cryogenics, IOC has secured government contracts alongside export orders, while a new unit at Dindori will further strengthen domestic manufacturing capacity.

"All of this is backed by strict capital discipline, ensuring that every investment creates long-term value and keeps IndianOil future-ready," he said.

He said the year gone by reminded us that energy is never just about markets and molecules - it is shaped by the pulse of geopolitics.

"The Russia-Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continued to cast a long shadow on global stability. As the months progressed, new fault lines emerged in the Middle East. Disruptions in the Red Sea and heightened tensions around the Strait of Hormuz unsettled vital energy corridors, forcing global trade to recalibrate. Towards the close of the year, tariff hikes announced by the United States brought fresh headwinds, shaking investor confidence and adding a new layer of uncertainty to global flows."

Against this backdrop, oil and gas markets remained under pressure, with the accelerating pace of the energy transition amplifying volatility.

IOC, he said, delivered a resilient performance during 2024-25. Sales volumes crossed the historic 100 million tonne mark, 20,000 km pipeline network ensured seamless movement of hydrocarbons, over 40,000 fuel stations energised over 3.2 crore customers every day and Indane LPG fuelled 15 crore kitchens.

Alongside, IOC retained a strong presence in petrochemicals, natural gas and exploration and production, further reinforcing its diversified energy footprint.

[TITLE]ADNOC Wins Another Long-Term LNG Deal with Indian Oil:
[TEXT]
'By 2029, IndianOil is set to become ADNOC's largest LNG customer, with a total offtake of 2.2 MMtpa - comprising 1.2 MMtpa from ADNOC's Das Island operations and one MMtpa from the Ruwais LNG project'.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. PJSC (ADNOC) said Wednesday it had signed an agreement to supply one million metric tons per annum (MMtpa) from the Ruwais LNG project to Indian Oil Corp. Ltd.

Targeted to start production 2028, the facility on the Persian Gulf coast would more than double ADNOC’s LNG output.

“To date, over eight MMtpa of the project’s 9.6 MMtpa production capacity has been committed to international customers through long-term agreements, underscoring strong global demand for ADNOC’s lower-carbon LNG”, ADNOC said in a statement.

The offtake announced Wednesday is in addition to a 14-year contract between the two state-owned companies, announced February, for up to 1.2 MMtpa from the Das Island liquefaction facility. Deliveries are to start 2026 for the volumes from the Das Island facility, which has a capacity of six MMtpa.

The companies did not disclose the value of the new agreement. February’s agreement was valued $7-9 billion.

Under the new agreement, “LNG cargoes can be delivered to any port across India, supporting the country’s growing energy needs and enhancing its energy security”, ADNOC said.

“By 2029, IndianOil is set to become ADNOC’s largest LNG customer, with a total offtake of 2.2 MMtpa - comprising 1.2 MMtpa from ADNOC’s Das Island operations and one MMtpa from the Ruwais LNG project”.

“The SPA [sale and purchase agreement] highlights the success of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement signed between the UAE and India in 2022, which continues to foster deeper bilateral trade and energy cooperation”, ADNOC added.

Last August, ADNOC, through ADNOC Gas PLC, and another Indian state-owned company, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. (HPCL), announced a heads of agreement for the delivery of 500,000 metric tons a year of LNG from Das Island for 10 years to India.

HPCL said it would receive the LNG at the recently commissioned Chhara LNG Terminal in Gujarat “to meet the demand of its refineries, City Gas Distribution Network and for marketing to downstream customers”.

Last year ADNOC inked a 10-year agreement to supply 500,000 metric tons per year of LNG to state-owned GAIL India Ltd.

This year ADNOC has now announced six LNG export agreements. Besides the HPCL agreement and the two Indian Oil agreements, the other agreements are with Japanese companies JERA Co. Inc. and Osaka Gas Co. Ltd. and Germany’s state-owned SEFE Securing Energy for Europe GmbH.

As announced January, the $450-million agreement with JERA lasts three years. The LNG will come from the Das Island facility. The companies did not disclose the volume.

In February ADNOC announced a 15-year agreement with Osaka Gas for up to 800,000 metric tons per year, mostly from Ruwais LNG. “Under the agreement, LNG cargoes will be shipped to the destination ports of Osaka Gas and its Singapore-based subsidiary, Osaka Gas Energy Supply and Trading Pte. Ltd.”, ADNOC said.

In July ADNOC and SEFE announced an agreement for 700,000 metric tons per year of Das Island LNG for three years starting 2025.

India will continue to buy oil from wherever it gets the best deal to safeguard its energy security, India's envoy to Russia Vinay Kumar has said, hinting at New Delhi's continued energy purchases from Moscow.India's energy policy is driven by market dynamics and the needs of its 1.4 billion citizens, Kumar said, adding, "Indian companies will continue buying from wherever they get the best deal. That's what the current situation is." Kumar was interviewed by Russian state-run news agency TASSKumar underlined that India's energy cooperation with Russia, among other global partners, contributes to global oil market stability . "Our cooperation with Russia, like with several other countries, has played a role in ensuring that."Describing Washington's decision as "unfair, unreasonable and unjustified", Kumar said the Indian government "will continue taking measures which will protect the national interest of the country".Referring to India-Russia bilateral ties, the envoy said Russian companies in machinery and electronics are showing growing interest in hiring Indian professionals."At a broader level, there is a manpower requirement in Russia and India has skilled manpower. So at present, within the Russian regulations, framework of Russian regulations, laws and quotas, the companies are hiring Indians," Kumar said.He noted that "most of the people who have come are in the construction and textile sectors" but added that demand in machinery and electronics industries is rising.The issue of mobility of Indian workers in Russia figured prominently during external affairs minister S Jaishankar's recent Moscow trip.Meanwhile, US veep JD Vance claimed President Donald Trump's punitive 50% tariffs on imports from India were meant to get an "aggressive economic leverage" for forcing Russia to stop bombing Ukraine.

[TITLE]Renewable energy investment in the Kyrgyz Republic:
[TEXT]
the UK is partnering with the Kyrgyz Republic to develop a flexible financial model that will support informed decision-making on sovereign guarantees for renewable energy projects

the project aims to contribute to unlocking foreign direct investment and accelerate the scale-up of solar, wind and small hydropower projects

The United Kingdom and the Kyrgyz Republic have launched a new partnership to strengthen the enabling environment for renewable energy investment. The project was formally introduced at a meeting in Bishkek, attended by the representatives from the Kyrgyz authorities as well as from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO)-funded Green Cities, Infrastructure and Energy Programme (GCIEP).

The project aims to support the Kyrgyz government in developing a flexible financial model that enables risk-informed decision-making on renewable energy investments.

The model will help project future payment obligations and estimate the potential scale of financial guarantees under various renewable energy growth scenarios. Running from July to December 2025, the project will also include training for relevant government officials to ensure effective use of the model and promote ownership and sustainability beyond the project’s duration.

The Kyrgyz Republics’ electricity sector faces growing challenges. The electricity system depends heavily on ageing hydropower plants that are increasingly vulnerable to seasonal variation and climate change. As a result, the country has experienced rising winter electricity deficits, over 20% of its electricity supply was imported in 2024.

To address these issues, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic aims to diversify the generation mix and increase the share of renewable electricity generation to at least 10% by 2027. With significant potential for solar, wind and small hydropower, and the opportunity to export electricity via the CASA-1000 project, the country is well-position to become one of the regional leaders in green energy.

However, investment is constrained by challenges in issuing government guarantees, as the fiscal impact is often difficult to estimate. This project will help relevant government entities to assess the fiscal implications of issuing sovereign guarantees and explore alternative de-risking mechanisms to attract private sector investment into the renewable energy sector.

Mr Nicholas Bowler, British Ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic, said:

The UK’s Centre of Expertise works with countries to accelerate sustainable urban development and resilient infrastructure. This collaboration is a strong example of how UK expertise can support the Kyrgyz Republic in improving the enabling environment and developing a pipeline of investable renewable energy projects.

Background

The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has established a Centre of Expertise for Green Cities, Infrastructure and Energy (GCIE) to coordinate UK leadership in cities and infrastructure and respond to the impacts of climate change and poverty by accelerating the delivery of sustainable cities and resilient infrastructure.

The Centre of Expertise is part of the British Investment Partnerships approach – the UK’s economic and development offer to partner countries. The Green Cities, Infrastructure and Energy Programme (GCIEP) is the main delivery mechanism of the GCIE Centre of Expertise. The programme is managed by a PwC-led Alliance, including Mott MacDonald, Adam Smith International, Engineers Against Poverty and MDY Legal.
