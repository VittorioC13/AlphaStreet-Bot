[TITLE]Another Crypto IPO Hits the Market and Most People Still Have No Idea What Crypto Is:
[TEXT]
Blockchain-based lender Figure Technology Solutions has officially filed for an initial public offering, marking another move by crypto-related firms seeking a slice of the trillion-dollar machine of public markets.

Both crypto bros and the banks that love them are already celebrating the move to go public, which they say marks a significant milestone in the evolving intersection of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and mainstream finance.

Analysts posit that this signals a broader shift in how people previously unfamiliar with crypto are getting more comfortable investing in it.

“Crypto is becoming one of the big pillars of the IPO market,” IPOX CEO Josef Schuster told Reuters, referring to companies going public through blank-check mergers.

That thus far has gone against all logic provided by recent polls, which have shown at least 60% of people asked, and sometimes as many as 90%, have absolutely no idea what crypto is or how it works but would definitely not put their own money in it.

“It just seems questionable,” one respondent to this National Cryptocurrency Association poll said in July 2025.

Figure CEO Mike Cagney nodded to this proof-of-concept or no dice investor attitude in a 2021 interview.

“When we started back in 2018, I think our hope was that we could just be a blockchain-technology company and not have to build another lending business and a payments business and everything else,” Cagney said. “What became very clear to us early on is that the world wasn’t ready to lean into blockchain the way that we were, so we created these operating businesses.”

Why does it matter for crypto?

This IPO, however, may show a slight softening of that for crypto companies that actually appear to, or can prove, that they do something tangible.

Figure’s focus on practical applications—such as offering crypto-backed loans and using blockchain for transparent, faster underwriting —shows a little bit more transparently how blockchain can be integrated into core financial services.

Its website shows it uses Alphabet Inc.’s Google Gemini chatbot and tech from OpenAI Inc. to sift through loan applications.

This approach is reminiscent of how banks and fintech firms like SoFi and Robinhood (which went public in 2021 and 2019, respectively) are leveraging technology to theoretically reinvent traditional banking.

This trend echoes similar moves by companies such as Coinbase, which raked in an eye-watering $85 billion valuation when it went public in 2021—which simultaneously backed crypto as a legitimate asset and made it more confusing, depending on who you asked.

Unlike earlier crypto firms mired in regulatory controversies, Figure’s massive 22% jump in second half of the year results and its backing by prominent institutional investors like Apollo Global Management and Ribbit Capital may also lend credibility to blockchain’s role in mainstream finance.

What the hell is Figure anyway?

Co-founded by Cagney, who previously helped launch another major blockchain booster and fintech SoFi Technologies, Figure helps create loans.

The company says that thus far it has shelled out $16 billion in loans, including home equity lines of credit, crypto-backed loans, and digital asset exchanges, all of which bring the blockchain into consumer finance.

Shares are expected to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol FIGR.

The New York City-based company, founded in 2018, is likely hoping to get a bite of the current landscape, where digital assets and blockchain technology are increasingly intersecting with mainstream finance.

That is still a controversial move.

According to its recent SEC filing, Figure posted a net income of $29.1 million on revenues of $43.8 million for the first half of 2025, a notable turnaround from a net loss of $15.6 million on $12.5 million in revenue during the same period a year earlier.

The company first announced its intention to go public earlier this month through a confidential filing. Prior funding rounds, including a 2021 venture-backed raise, valued the company at $3.2 billion.

[TITLE]Intel shares jump as Softbank to buy $2bn stake in chip giant:

Intel shares jump as Softbank to buy $2bn stake in chip giant

The BBC has contacted the White House and Intel for comment.

The potential deal , which was first reported last week, aims to help Intel build a flagship manufacturing hub in Ohio. At the time, a White House spokesman told the BBC that the reports "should be regarded as speculation" unless officially announced.

The announcement came just hours after new reports that the Trump administration is in talks to take a stake of around 10% in Intel by converting government grants into shares.

Intel shares have jumped after Japanese technology investment giant Softbank said it is buying a $2bn (£1.5bn) stake in the US computer chip maker.

Under the deal announced on Monday, Softbank will pay $23 per share in Intel.

"The investment comes as both Intel and SoftBank deepen their commitment to investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation in the United States," the two companies said in a joint statement.

Intel shares rose by more than 5% in after-hours trade in New York on Monday.

Last week, US President Donald Trump and members of his cabinet met Intel chief executive Lip-Bu Tan.

The meeting came just days after Trump called for Mr Tan to resign, accusing him of being "highly conflicted" due to his earlier ties to China.

The developments came as the US chip industry is under intense scrutiny by the White House.

Some analysts have described Intel's potential deal with the US government as a lifeline for the firm.

Intel is one of the few US firms capable of manufacturing high-end semiconductors at scale.

But globally, it has lost out to rival chip manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC.

On Thursday, the company declined to comment on the reported discussions and said it was "deeply committed to supporting President Trump's efforts" to strengthen manufacturing and technology in the US.

Such an agreement would mark a "major escalation" in what seems to be an attempt by the Trump administration to reshape the US government's role in the private sector, said political scientist Sarah Bauerle Danzman from Indiana University.

But the potential move sets a "concerning precedent" as it raises questions about whether companies may be pushed to follow political agendas, she said.

It also signals Washington's determination to ensure Intel succeeds and that the supply chain for computer chips is protected, said Dan Sheehan from Telos Wealth Advisors.

"[The Government's] agenda is clear: Accelerate domestic production, reduce dependence on Asia, and position Intel at the centre of the AI and national security landscape," he said.

SoftBank's investment is a "clear vote of confidence" in Intel's turnaround, he added.

Last week, Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay the US government 15% of their Chinese revenues as part of an unprecedented deal to secure export licences to China.

[TITLE]SoftBank to buy $2 billion in Intel shares at $23 each — firm still owns majority share of Arm:
[TEXT]
SoftBank Group late on Monday announced a plan to purchase $2 billion worth of Intel shares at $23 each, which will provide the troubled chipmaker much-needed cash. The companies inked a definitive securities purchase agreement, which sets the price of Intel stock (currently trading below its book value) at which the Japanese company will buy it. Softbank also still owns a majority share of Arm.

Intel and SoftBank frame the deal as a way to 'deepen their commitment to investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation in the United States.' Given the context of Intel's recent struggles, this $2 billion share purchase is a way to pour some money into Intel's efforts to rebuild itself as a leading supplier of processors and a contract chipmaker that serves both internal and external needs for leading-edge semiconductor production.

By modern foundry standards, $2 billion is not a large sum of money. Building a single leading-edge semiconductor production facility today typically costs between $20 billion and $30 billion, and in many cases even more, depending on planned production volumes, product mix, and equipment used. However, the investment does not seem to be entirely

[TITLE]SoftBank makes $2B investment in Intel:
[TEXT]
Japanese conglomerate SoftBank has agreed to make a $2 billion investment in Intel in a deal described as a commitment to advanced technology and semiconductors in the United States.

The agreement, in which SoftBank will buy Intel common stock, was announced Monday after markets closed. SoftBank will pay $23 per share of Intel common stock. Shares of Intel, which closed at $23.66, popped more than 5% in after-hours trading.

SoftBank Group Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son said in a statement that the “strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role.”

The investment provides validation for Intel, which has been overshadowed in recent years by competitors like Nvidia. It also reflects SoftBank’s renewed interest in the U.S., particularly around AI chips. SoftBank recently purchased a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, owned by Foxconn, as part of a plan to build AI data centers.

Intel, steered by new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, is in the midst of a restructuring that aims to streamline the semiconductor business and focus on its core client and data center portfolio. Earlier this summer, Intel shuttered its automotive architecture business and laid off most of its staff. It also announced plans to reduce its Intel Foundry division workforce between 15% and 20%.

Tan has also had to navigate political landmines in recent weeks as President Donald Trump called for his resignation due to conflicts of interest — an accusation that was made without evidence — and his administration reportedly had discussions to take a stake in Intel.

The SoftBank-Intel deal comes just days after the Trump administration threatened new tariffs on imported semiconductor chips as part of his strategy to boost domestic production.

[TITLE]Google Slapped With $36M Fine For Anticompetitive Android Search Deal With Mobile Carriers:
[TEXT]
ACCC Chair Gina-Cass Gottlieb

Google has agreed to pay $36M (USD) after findings by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) revealed that Google had an arrangement with two of Australia's largest telecommunications companies, Telstra and Optus, that stifled competition.The ACCC found that from December 2019 to March 2021, the agreement between Google and the two carriers required the latter to only pre-install Google Search on Android devices they sold. In return, Google shared some of the ad revenue generated from searches on those devices. Google has admitted that its deals with the two companies were "likely to have had the effect of substantially lessening competition."In her remark, ACCC chair Gina-Cass Gottlieb stated, "Conduct that restricts competition is illegal in Australia because it usually means less choice, higher costs or worse service for consumers."In addition, Google has also entered into a court-enforceable undertaking with ACCC to address its concerns over anti-competitive practices dating back to 2017. Hence, Google will no longer require that its search engine be the default option in contracts with Android phone manufacturers and telcos.This undertaking follows those made by Telstra and Optus last year, where the companies both decided not to renew or sign new deals that will make Google Search the only search engine pre-installed on the phones they sell.While ACCC has commended Google for its cooperation, which avoided lengthy litigation , the Federal Court will still have to decide if the fine is appropriate.

[TITLE]SoftBank acquires Foxconn's Ohio facility to build Stargate AI servers — $375 million deal says Foxconn will continue to operate the plant:
[TEXT]
Foxconn on Monday confirmed that it sold its production facility in Lordstown, Ohio, earlier this month to SoftBank, reports Nikkei. Under the terms of the deal, Foxconn will continue to operate the plant, which will be retrofitted to build AI servers and other gear to equip Stargate AI data centers.

The Lordstown, Ohio, site was originally acquired by Foxconn from Lordstown Motors in 2022 and used for electric vehicle production. The complex spans 6.2 million square feet and is six times larger than Foxconn's Houston facility, which is also being expanded to build AI servers. The plant has production facilities (albeit these will have to be changed to build AI servers) and loads of power capacity, which will be required for large-scale manufacturing operations. Foxconn got $375 million for the plant and the land, according to Reuters.

Foxconn Chairman Young Liu explained that the arrangement with SoftBank has been in preparation for over six months. The decision was driven by available power capacity, large land area for further expansion, and urgency to move quickly on the Stargate schedule, which aims to build $500 billion AI infrastructure over the next several years.

Foxconn is already the world’s largest supplier of AI servers and is increasing its capacity in multiple regions. In the United States, it is building up operations in Houston, Texas, where it plans to produce AI machines and other data center gear in partnership with Nvidia. The company is also maintaining activities in California and Mexico, serving dozens of clients. The new Ohio base will become another important production center in its network.

The Ohio complex could become the first manufacturing base linked directly to Stargate and exclusively producing infrastructure components used by SoftBank, Oracle, and OpenAI, which almost guarantees a steady flow of orders. SoftBank is currently evaluating multiple locations for data centers, considering factors such as energy supply, water resources, and telecommunications infrastructure, reports Bloomberg. As soon as SoftBank finds places for its AI data centers, it will be able to equip them with machines produced at the Lordstown, Ohio, facility.

The Stargate project was introduced in January by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank in the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump. Back then, Masayoshi Son, the head of SoftBank, pledged to allocate $100 billion immediately toward data centers, energy facilities, and related projects. However, progress has slowed due to various factors, including U.S. tariff policy and obstacles to building viable financing models, according to Bloomberg. SoftBank denies that access to funding is a problem.

[TITLE]AI boom in Australia: Amazon investment sparks debate on artificial intelligence and housing shortage – Jason Murphy:
[TEXT]
But what do we actually get for the money? Just data centres.

If I was making a list of things Australia should be doing with concrete and air-conditioning, it would not include making data centres. What we need desperately, what we are horribly short of, is homes.

House prices are zooming up, and not just from speculation.

We’ve had huge inflation in the cost of building. Building a house from scratch costs around A$500,000, depending on its size and location. Maybe as much as a million bucks. And the inflation data tell us that price is up 39% compared with 2020.

Even renovation costs a bomb. Chucking a renovation on a small old home is now an A$500,000+ activity.

Jeff Bezos' Amazon wants to build data centres in Australia. Photo / Getty Images

Why is building houses expensive? For a lot of reasons.

One is the tradie shortage. Prices for getting the plumbing and wiring and framework of a house all put in are up sharply. Concrete slabs cost a fortune now.

Australia needs new homes. Photo / Getty Images

When it comes to these data centres, Amazon is supplying the capital, the money, which is nice. But money is not something Australia is super short of.

We have trillions in the national superannuation fund that’s just plonked in the sharemarket. (In fact, we have more super funds than the whole sharemarket is worth, so we now have to invest in other countries’ sharemarkets too.)

What we are short of is skilled people. Unemployment is at a historically low 4.3% right now. Unemployment among trades workers (people whose last job was in the trades) is
