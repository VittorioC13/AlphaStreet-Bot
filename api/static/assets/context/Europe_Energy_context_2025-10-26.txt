[TITLE]Major Investor for Louisiana LNG as Construction Ramps up:
[TEXT]
Australia’s Woodside Energy has enlisted U.S.-based Williams as an investor and pipeline operator of its Louisiana liquefied natural gas plant, to tap its infrastructure experience and ease cost pressures as construction ramps up.

Under the arrangement, Williams will get a 10% stake in Louisiana LNG’s holding company and 80% of the Driftwood pipeline that will supply feed gas to the $17.5 billion project.

Williams, which operates more than 33,000 miles (53,108 km) of pipeline across 24 U.S. states, will pay Woodside $378 million and contribute $1.9 billion towards the project’s construction costs.

Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill told Reuters her company had expertise with developing LNG projects, but it needed to partner with an experienced operator of onshore pipelines in the U.S. like Williams.

The Louisiana LNG venture forms part of Woodside’s major expansion strategy into North America, betting on a pro-fossil fuel U.S. administration and growing global demand for gas.

O’Neill said Woodside was “off to the races” with the project and its construction workforce had ramped up ahead of first production expected in 2029.

Woodside is looking to sell a further 10% to 20% in the holding company after the Williams deal to reduce its overall interest in the project to 50%.

“We do want to bring other investors into the project,” O’Neill said. “We’re not going to set a timeline on it. We’ll continue to be patient, but the window is narrowing.”

Williams is the first partner Woodside has added since giving Louisiana LNG the final go-ahead in April.

Before that, it sold a 40% stake in the project’s infrastructure company to U.S. investor Stonepeak for $5.7 billion.

MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said Williams was a “very strong partner” and would help ease balance sheet pressures associated with the huge project.

“It’s going to really raise the profile of the project within the U.S.,” he said. “From an investor perspective, the sell-down is viewed positively.”

But further sell-downs would be needed to affirm the project’s value, he added.

Shares in the Australian company gained as much as 4.1% to A$24.11 on Thursday.

Once Louisiana LNG is complete, Woodside is keen to tap European markets in particular as they cut LNG imports from Russia, O’Neill said.

Louisiana LNG already has a supply deal with Germany’s Uniper and a heads of agreement with Turkey’s BOTAS.

“There’s very strong interest in LNG from our project from those customers in Europe,” she said.

“They’re absolutely going to need LNG from other sources, and the U.S. is going to be one of those key sources.”

Louisiana LNG is expected to have an initial annual production capacity of 16.5 million metric tons of the super-chilled fuel.

[TITLE]Oil Disruption Widens as China Pauses Some Russia Buys:
[TEXT]
Chinese state-owned companies including Sinopec canceled some purchases of seaborne Russian crude after the US blacklisted Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC, adding to signs of disruption in the oil market.

The majors have begun to assess the curbs, as well as similar moves by the EU, according to people with knowledge of the situation, asking not to be identified discussing sensitive issues. The companies halted purchases of some spot cargoes, mostly ESPO, a grade from Russia’s Far East, they said.

The global oil market has been jolted this week by the wave of US sanctions, which have targeted Russia’s two largest producers and are intended to raise the pressure against Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. Prices spiked on Thursday after the Trump administration’s package was announced, and Brent futures are on course for a weekly gain of more than 7%.

China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., as Sinopec is formally known, as well as China Zhenhua Oil Co., didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment. On Thursday, Beijing pushed back against the US move, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson saying that “China consistently opposes unilateral sanctions that lack a basis in international law.”

US President Donald Trump plans to raise Chinese buying of Russian oil with his counterpart Xi Jinping at a meeting in South Korea next week. The summit will hand the leaders of the two largest economies an opportunity to make progress toward a broader trade deal after a period of strained relations.

State-owned Chinese buyers account for more than 400,000 barrels-a-day of Russian seaborne shipments, up to 40% the overall volume arriving on vessels, according to Kpler Ltd. Russia also delivers crude to China via pipelines.

“Flows to China are set to fall,” said Michal Meidan, director of the China Energy Research program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Still, the pipeline flows look set to continue given that the payments are based on a loan scheme that doesn’t seem to go via western banks, she said.

In addition to China, Russian flows to India, another key buyer, are expected to plunge following the US penalties. The sanctions mark a big shift in Western policy, which previously sought to limit revenue for the Kremlin with a price cap designed to prevent a supply disruptions and price spikes.

The Chinese state-owned companies could seek cheap alternatives, cut runs, or start unplanned maintenance as grades from the Middle East and West Africa become more pricey, with Indian users also seeking replacements for Russian barrels, the people said.

State-linked companies “may scale back their Russian crude purchases, but private refiners are unlikely to be affected,” said Emma Li, lead China analyst at Vortexa Ltd.

Brent futures — the global benchmark — were steady near $66 a barrel on Friday. While they have surged this week, prices remain 12% lower this year amid concern that rising supplies from OPEC+ — a broad producers’ alliance that includes Russia — will contribute to a global surplus.

The US Treasury Department sanctioned the two oil giants after accusing Russia of a “lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine.” They’re the first major US penalties against Moscow since Trump returned to the White House in January.

The sanctions “will indeed have certain serious consequences for us, but overall, they will not have a significant impact on our economic well-being,” Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Thursday. Moscow has about a month to prepare before the restrictions take full effect.

[TITLE]How Washington’s crusade against Russian oil went sideways:
[TEXT]
The US failed to woo India away from Russian oil, so it reached for its favorite weapon: sanctions. But coercion comes with a price.

Imagine a powerful suitor courting a young lady for months, only to have his advances meet resistance and indecision. With his clumsy attempts at courtship going nowhere, he impulsively kidnaps the girl and promptly announces an engagement. His entourage rejoices at the impending nuptials.

The suitor is, of course, the United States and the young lady whom it was unable to woo is India. Unable to convince New Delhi – and others for that matter – that it is in their interest to stop buying Russian oil, Washington resorted to coercion in the only way it knows how: sanctions and the threat of secondary sanctions.

Those cheering the Trump administration’s latest foray into trying to strong-arm Russia, by sanctioning oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil, seem entirely unbothered by the coercive and short-sighted nature of the victory – if, indeed, it even ends up being a victory, which is quite doubtful.

The explicit aim of the new sanctions, as articulated by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is to choke off “the Kremlin’s war machine.” Trump believes – or purports to believe – that he can impress Russian President Vladimir Putin enough that the latter agrees to an immediate ceasefire and, presumably, surrenders Russia’s national interests.

It should be apparent by now that Russia will not bow to such pressure. It should also be apparent that what we are witnessing is the latest installment of sanctions theater – although with a deep-level economic consequence of this posturing.

Oil remains the lifeblood of any industrial economy and is thus non-negotiable. Russian oil is fungible but indispensable to the global system. Removing it would require displacing hundreds of millions of barrels per year, which would have severe economic repercussions. As many have pointed out, there is a paradox at the heart of any serious attempt to restrict Russian barrels from reaching the market: doing so would simply push global prices higher, thus indirectly cushioning Russian earnings.

The effectiveness of the new restrictions will clearly depend on just how zealous the US is in enforcing them through secondary sanctions on entities that deal in Russian oil. But if past experience is any guide, Washington won’t be able to sustain a full-court press – if for no other reason than markets will force its hand for the very reason stated above.

Lax enforcement keeps the global market functioning and avoids a messy price spike. Western politicians are thus able to accrue political points for being tough on Russia while avoiding pressing too hard. Thus a sort of gray-zone equilibrium becomes the fallback position and system-level instability is avoided.

Yes, it is possible to raise the costs for Russia, which has happened before and will be unavoidable now as well. Volumes will likely remain suppressed for a while, discounts will widen, and logistical complexity will rise. But, as past experience has also shown, workarounds will be found. The template for these workarounds is already in place.

Ultimately, this performative endeavor merely creates a pressure valve: Russia feels friction, the Western powers maintain some semblance of credibility – at least among themselves – and, importantly, markets remain orderly.

It is true that reports have emerged that at least one major Indian refiner intends to “recalibrate” its purchases of Russian oil. It has also been reported that several Chinese state-owned oil companies are suspending their inbound supplies of Russian seaborne oil.

It remains to be seen how India will proceed. It will almost certainly cut purchases, possibly even significantly at first. India has generally been reluctant to directly cross the US and tends to be very cautious

[TITLE]New sanctions on Russia drive up oil:
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON — Oil prices spiked Thursday after the U.S. announced massive new sanctions on Russia’s oil industry in an attempt to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and end Moscow’s brutal war on Ukraine.

U.S. benchmark crude jumped 5.6% to $61.79 per barrel and analysts say if the situation remains static, U.S. consumers will soon be paying more at the pump.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said while it was difficult to predict with certainty because of the number of moving parts, consumers will likely see a bump in prices as early as next week, if not sooner.

“We’ll probably start to see motorists be impacted by the sanctions at the pump in the next couple days and it might take five days for that to be fully passed along,” De Haan said, adding that the full impact also depends on whether the Russian or U.S. positions change.

“Russia will feel pressure to come to the table in light of the new developments or President Trump may react when he sees oil prices rising to levels that become uncomfortable, so I don’t think this is going to be very long lasting,” De Haan said.

Oil prices have been relatively low for the past few years and last week the cost for barrel of U.S. benchmark crude fell below $57, its lowest level since early 2021. The price for a barrel of U.S. benchmark crude did rise near $79 a barrel early this year, just before President Donald Trump took office, a price not necessarily considered outrageously elevated by most analysts.

The broad, extended decline in oil prices pushed the average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. last week under $3 for the first time since December of last year, according to GasBuddy.

In Massachusetts, the price at the pump was average $3.01 a gallon, down 3 cents from a week ago, according to a survey from AAA Northeast released Monday. That average hit $3 even on Thursday, according to the motor club.

For much of 2025, inflation has been held mostly in check, partly due to cheaper prices at the pump. However, that could change quickly as higher energy costs have a downstream effect on prices for virtually all products and services across industries.

“The impact to a lot of Americans is that products derived from crude, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel are all likely to see price increases,” De Haan said.

The main reason oil and gas have stabilized at lower levels this year is that the group of countries that are part of the OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countries have continued to boost production. Earlier this month, OPEC+ leaders announced they would raise oil production by 137,000 barrels per day in November, the same amount announced for October. The group has been raising output slightly in a series of boosts all year after announcing cuts in 2023 and 2024.

Russia is the leading non-OPEC member in the 22-country alliance. The group’s next meeting is scheduled for Nov. 2.

The sanctions against Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil follows calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as bipartisan pressure on Trump to hit Russia with harder sanctions on its oil industry, the economic engine that has allowed Russia to continue to execute the grinding conflict even as it finds itself largely internationally isolated.

The European Union on Thursday announced its own measures targeting Russian oil and gas.

The new EU measures ban imports of Russian liquefied natural gas into the bloc, and add port bans on more than 100 new ships in the Russian shadow fleet of hundreds of aging tankers that are dodging sanctions. The latest sanctions bring the total number of such ships to be banned to 557.

The price for Brent crude, the international standard, rose 5.4% on Thursday to $65.99 per barrel.

[TITLE]Russian Drones Pound Ukraine as Trump Slaps Sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil:
[TEXT]
Russian drones attacked the Ukrainian capital for the second night in a row on October 22, injuring four people, officials said within hours of an announcement from Washington imposing sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies. Tymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said drones had damaged several dwellings and other buildings.

Air assaults the night before struck throughout the country, killing at seven people and causing power outages. One of the attacks hit a kindergarten in Kharkiv and another hit an apartment building in Zaporizhzhya.

The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on Telegram that it struck Ukrainian energy infrastructure in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian civilian targets.

The US Treasury Department announced the sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil after the European Union unveiled a fresh wave of sanctions earlier on October 22. Both actions were aimed at pressuring Russia to end its full-scale invasion of its neighbor.

“Today is a very big day in terms of what we’re doing. These are tremendous sanctions. These are very big -- against their two big oil companies. And we hope they won’t be on for long. We hope that the war will be settled,” US President Donald Trump said.

The move marks another shift for Trump, who has resisted putting more pressure on Russia in hopes that Russian President Vladimir Putin would agree to end the fighting. But his patience appeared to have run out after plans for a summit with Putin in Budapest collapsed.

“I just felt it was time,” Trump told reporters at the White House after welcoming NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. "Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don't go anywhere."

In another indication that Trump's patience is wearing thing, the president said he had canceled the Budapest meeting.

“It didn’t feel right to me. It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get,” he said.

The US sanctions are designed to increase pressure on Russia's energy sector and "degrade" the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine, the Treasury Department said in a news release.

"Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the news release.

Related: Oil Prices Surge as Trump Sanctions Russian Energy Giants

Bessent said earlier that Putin had not “come to the table in an honest and forthright manner, as we'd hoped."

The EU sanctions include the blacklisting of oil tankers used by Moscow, travel curbs on Russian diplomats, and a ban on importing liquefied natural gas from Russia by 2027.

The package is the 19th imposed by the EU since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion in 2022. The sanctions were presented last month by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the purchase of fossil fuels from Russia is financing the Russian war.

The US sanctions follow a similar move by Britain last week, said Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at the Center for New American Security. They are the first notable sanction on Russia from the Trump administration and should have an impact beyond those imposed by Britain alone, she said.

“So it’s a big deal but not as big as it would have been a year ago,” she said in response to a question from RFE/RL, pointing out that subsidiaries operating energy projects are also sanctioned and that could make getting new parts for rebuilding more expensive.

Ziemba also said that the Russian oil companies currently do little business in dollars or in the US financial sector, and the “evasive infrastructure” they use could “blunt” the impact of the new sanctions.

During his visit with Trump, Rutte praised the US president’s efforts to bring the two sides together even after some observers criticized Trump’s outreach to Putin, saying it only allowed the Russian leader to buy time.

Consistent pressure on Russia and frank talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are necessary to reach a cease-fire, Rutte said.

“Look at the Russian economy. There are long lines of cars into the gas stations,” Rutte told Fox News, adding that the Ukrainians have hit an estimated one-third of the Russian oil and gas infrastructure.

He also pointed to moves in Europe to do more to stop Russia’s use of a shadow fleet to move oil around the world.

“All of this will help change the calculus,” Rutte said. “Collectively, we will change Putin’s calculus and get him to the table and get the cease-fire going. I’m absolutely convinced. It may not be today or tomorrow, but we will get there.”

[TITLE]Canada's first 'nation-building' nuclear project relies on US suppliers:
[TEXT]
During a joint announcement with Ontario Premier Doug Ford in Bowmanville, Carney described the project as a generational investment aimed at extending Canada’s leadership in clean energy while ensuring long-term prosperity for Ontario workers and communities.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Thursday that the federal government will invest $2 billion in Ontario’s Darlington New Nuclear Project — a plan that has stirred controversy since the eruption of a trade war with the US.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

The $3-billion partnership includes $1 billion from Ontario’s Building Ontario Fund . Ontario Power Generation will remain the majority owner and operator, with the federal and provincial governments holding minority stakes.

In the weeks after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and critical minerals, demand grew for Ontario to cancel its contract with US-based GE Hitachi, the company supplying the small modular reactors (SMRs) and enriched uranium for the $21-billion project. Both Carney and Ford have promoted “buy Canadian” policies to shield domestic industry from US tariff threats. Yet, despite the project’s reliance on American suppliers, both leaders defended the investment as essential to meeting Ontario’s soaring energy needs.

“This investment will strengthen Ontario’s power grid and represents the kind of nation-building projects that defines Canada’s new economic approach,” Carney said. “This is a generational investment that will build lasting security, prosperity, and opportunities.”

Through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, Ottawa had earlier committed $970 million to the project.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

Carney said the project marks the start of a broader plan to fast-track large infrastructure and clean energy projects through Ottawa’s new major projects office as proof that “Canada can build big things again.”

Construction on the first reactor began in May, with completion expected in 2030. Once online, the four reactors will supply

[TITLE]Canada's first 'nation-building' nuclear project relies on US suppliers:
[TEXT]
During a joint announcement with Ontario Premier Doug Ford in Bowmanville, Carney described the project as a generational investment aimed at extending Canada’s leadership in clean energy while ensuring long-term prosperity for Ontario workers and communities.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Thursday that the federal government will invest $2 billion in Ontario’s Darlington New Nuclear Project — a plan that has stirred controversy since the eruption of a trade war with the US.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

The $3-billion partnership includes $1 billion from Ontario’s Building Ontario Fund . Ontario Power Generation will remain the majority owner and operator, with the federal and provincial governments holding minority stakes.

In the weeks after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and critical minerals, demand grew for Ontario to cancel its contract with US-based GE Hitachi, the company supplying the small modular reactors (SMRs) and enriched uranium for the $21-billion project. Both Carney and Ford have promoted “buy Canadian” policies to shield domestic industry from US tariff threats. Yet, despite the project’s reliance on American suppliers, both leaders defended the investment as essential to meeting Ontario’s soaring energy needs.

“This investment will strengthen Ontario’s power grid and represents the kind of nation-building projects that defines Canada’s new economic approach,” Carney said. “This is a generational investment that will build lasting security, prosperity, and opportunities.”

Through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, Ottawa had earlier committed $970 million to the project.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

Carney said the project marks the start of a broader plan to fast-track large infrastructure and clean energy projects through Ottawa’s new major projects office as proof that “Canada can build big things again.”

Construction on the first reactor began in May, with completion expected in 2030. Once online, the four reactors will supply

[TITLE]Eos Energy Executes Next Phase of Growth Strategy with U.S. Manufacturing Expansion and New Software Hub Under Project AMAZE:
[TEXT]
$24 million state-led economic development package underscores the shared commitment between Eos and Pennsylvania to advance U.S. manufacturing and job creation

Expansion reinforces the Company’s progress and transformation as Pennsylvania becomes a national hub for energy, technology, and manufacturing innovation

PITTSBURGH, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) ("Eos" or the “Company”), an American energy company and the leading innovator in designing, sourcing, manufacturing, and providing zinc-based battery energy storage systems (BESS) manufactured in the United States, today announced the next phase of its growth strategy with the expansion of its U.S. manufacturing footprint and the establishment of a new software hub strengthening American energy storage capacity, energy independence, and industrial job growth.

In partnership with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Allegheny County, the Company was awarded a joint $24 million economic development package to support U.S. manufacturing and the continued growth of 1,000 high quality American jobs. The incentive package will help the Company scale operations to meet growing market demand driven, in part, by AI infrastructure, while advancing energy innovation in Pennsylvania.

“Energy storage is the backbone of a modern energy system, and this significant milestone marks our progress to bring America’s battery to scale,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “Through Project AMAZE, we’re proving that you can make things in America again by building world-class capacity, pairing advanced manufacturing with innovative software, and doing it here in Pennsylvania to ensure a more energy-efficient and secure future. We thank Governor Shapiro, Allegheny County, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, and the Pittsburgh Technology Council for their unwavering support and shared vision for advancing Americas quest to lead in energy.”

Eos will expand its manufacturing capacity with a new state-of-the-art 432,000 sq. ft. facility in Marshall Township, PA, that will house additional production lines that complement the Company’s existing Turtle Creek manufacturing facility with plans to reach 8 GWh of annualized energy storage capacity. The new facility enables Eos to transition from single piece flow operations to high-efficiency, large-scale production, marking the culmination of years of process development designed to bring U.S. made energy storage to market at scale.

“The demand for energy is going up — and my Administration is capitalizing on Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and net energy exporter to attract leading energy manufacturers like Eos Energy to the Commonwealth,” said Governor Shapiro. “We’re doubling down on our efforts to aggressively compete for — and win — major projects like this one by cutting red tape, building out our skilled workforce, and investing in the next generation of energy technology. I’m proud that Pennsylvania will be home to Eos’ new global headquarters — and my Administration will continue to work to cut energy costs, create good-paying jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.”

Eos will also establish a new software hub at Nova Place, Pittsburgh’s premiere technology and innovation center, that supports the Company’s growing workforce and proprietary battery management system, software, controls and analytics platform, DawnOSTM. Eos joins a thriving community of other advanced manufacturing, data/telecommunications, AI, electric utilities, and robotics leaders in Pittsburgh’s innovation headquarters.

As part of its expanding software and engineering focus, the Company plans to deepen its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, a leading institution in robotics, AI, computer science, and engineering to further develop a state-of-the-art workforce to work in Eos’ software hub.

“Carnegie Mellon University is thrilled to celebrate this milestone with Eos, and we are looking forward to the many opportunities it unlocks – for Pittsburghers, our students, and America’s bright future in manufacturing,” said CMU President Farnam Jahanian. “On behalf of the CMU community, I extend my sincere congratulations to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Eos CEO Joe Mastrangelo and their teams for leading the way in strengthening Western Pennsylvania’s roles as an innovation engine for the nation and as a driver of the talent that will power it.”

“Pennsylvania has an extensive history of being at the forefront of innovation. We’re proving that in Pittsburgh you can not only build products in America but also offer world class education and intellectual capabilities to grow emerging industries,” said Pranesh Rao, Eos Senior Vice President of Storage System Engineering. “Building our software hub in Pittsburgh—surrounded by talented workers and a fast-growing innovation ecosystem—is both a strategic move and a catalyst to propel Eos to the next level.”
