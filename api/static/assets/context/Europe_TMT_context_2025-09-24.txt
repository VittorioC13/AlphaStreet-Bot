[TITLE]High-tech tax authority helps Greece return to Europe’s financial mainstream:
[TEXT]
By DEREK GATOPOULOS

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — With a pristine white exterior, the Greece tax authority’s new headquarters looks out of place on a clogged industrial artery outside Athens. A former shopping mall and ice rink, the building has been overhauled into an ultramodern digital center that has led the rescue of the nation’s ailing finance and tax sector.

It is teeming with inspectors who chase down tax cheats with the help of drones, big data and live surveillance feeds from as far as Greece’s island ports and remote farming villages.

Analysts at the Independent Authority for Public Revenue monitor millions of transactions in real time and order stings on businesses flagged by algorithms for a high potential of illegal activity. The high tech was on full display during a recent visit as The Associated Press was granted rare access to the authority’s headquarters.

Greece’s tax system — once a byword for inefficiency — has been rewired by technology.

Now, the country that spent nearly a decade as Europe’s financial outcast, drowning in debt, has become one of its best budget performers, with bonds restored to investment grade by all major ratings agencies.

“We worked systematically over the years, with dedication,” Giorgos Pitsilis, governor of the revenue authority, told the AP. “We started from a situation of no data to a situation with big data.”

From crisis to credit upgrades

Greece was one of just six EU member states that recorded a budget surplus in 2024, after running deficits for decades. Momentum carried into this year, with government revenues shooting past targets through August.

Moody’s upgraded Greece’s bonds to investment grade in March, praising its large-scale push to digitize the tax system. Jason Graffam, senior vice president at ratings agency Morningstar DBRS, noted that Greece’s long-term borrowing costs now sit slightly above Spain’s — and below Italy’s and France’s.

“The Greece of today is indeed very different from a decade ago,” Graffam said. “There has clearly been durable change to the country’s economic model and its fiscal regime.”

During the crisis years, international creditors imposed punishing austerity measures in exchange for three massive bailout packages. Greece’s population felt the pain deeply — wages were slashed, companies shut down and the economy bled jobs.

Sustained pressure from lenders forced successive governments to modernize one of Europe’s weakest tax systems.

Out went paper files and fax machines. In came cashless, paperless systems powered by algorithms that scour card payments, tax filings, payroll data, customs declarations and bank records – and flag anomalies for inspectors to pursue.

‘Saturday Night Fever’

Repurposed smartphones carried by inspectors in the field stream video and audio back to headquarters. There are panic buttons to use when someone feels threatened.

Back at headquarters, screens map ongoing site inspections and drone surveillance feeds from multiple sites: from restaurants and ports to hidden grain silos and fruit delivery trucks — even live readings from ships’ fuel tanks.

Tax and customs officials described how the data translates into raids. They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of their work and citing reasons of personal safety.

During a recent nightclub sweep dubbed “Saturday Night Fever,” they matched individual table orders against receipts to uncover undeclared sales, mostly of alcoholic drinks.

“We knew the tables were full, but the receipts didn’t match,” one official said, adding that after inspectors showed up, the nightclub’s reported revenues doubled within days.

Fraud can be detected by cross-referencing mobile phone activity with reported sales as recorded by cash registers and card-payment terminals that by law must be connected to the tax authority.

“If we detect signals from 20 phones inside a store, but see almost no receipts, that’s a cue to dispatch a team immediately,” another inspector explained.

High cost-of-living persists

The reforms have salvaged Greece’s reputation abroad. At home, the windfall has funded 1.6 billion euros in tax cuts recently announced by the center-right government.

Still, opposition parties argue that more efficient tax collection does not offset policies that worsen inequality: The national sales tax rate was hiked during the crisis to 24% — higher than most EU countries.

It hasn’t been reduced since, while other austerity-era cuts remain in place and poverty is stubbornly high.

The powerful Greek Communist Party described recent budget figures as a “blood-stained surplus” that is eating further into the spending power of wage earners.

But the revenue is a sorely needed boost for the government, which is facing public anger over a corruption scandal and the cost-of-living crisis.

Tax compliance may also — slowly and grudgingly – build trust in public institutions, revenue agency officials say.

“It’s a powerful argument … being tax responsible is beneficial,” said Pitsilis, who has been governor since the tax agency became an independent authority in 2017. “We earn more, and that gives space for tax reform.”

[TITLE]Jeep and Dodge Parent Company Stellantis Confirms Customer Data Breach:
[TEXT]
Stellantis, the global automaker behind brands like Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and FIAT, confirmed a data breach affecting its North American customer service operations after unauthorised access was detected on a third-party provider’s platform.

In a statement released Saturday, the company explained that only limited personal data was involved, specifically contact information. Financial or sensitive personal details, such as social security or payment data, were not stored on the affected platform and were not compromised.

Once the issue was identified, Stellantis activated its internal incident response procedures. The company said it acted quickly to contain the breach, launched an investigation and began notifying both law enforcement and impacted customers.

Stellantis is urging customers to be on alert for phishing attempts. That includes emails, calls or text messages that try to trick users into sharing information or clicking harmful links. The company recommends verifying any communication by reaching out through its official support channels.

Stellantis Car Brands: Full List of Global Automotive Names Under Its Ownership

It is worth noting that Stellantis is one of the world’s largest automotive groups, which owns a wide portfolio of car brands that operate across North America, Europe, and other global markets.

Formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group, the company manages some of the most well-known names in the industry, including:

Fiat

Ram

Opel

Jeep

Abarth

Chrysler

Citroën

Dodge

Lancia

Maserati

Peugeot

Vauxhall

Alfa Romeo

DS Automobiles

Cybersecurity experts point out that this kind of breach is becoming more common as attackers look for vulnerabilities in supply chains rather than going after large companies directly.

Javvad Malik, Lead CISO Advisor at KnowBe4, said attackers often exploit smaller vendors with weaker security through social engineering tactics. These tactics are increasingly sophisticated and can involve convincing emails, calls or even AI-generated deepfakes designed to trick people into approving unauthorised actions.

According to Malik, this incident highlights why companies need to look beyond firewalls and software updates. “Full human risk management is key,” he said. “That means combining the right technology with clear training and processes, and making it easy for employees to get help when something feels off.” He also stressed that any response should go beyond technical fixes, noting the importance of fast, clear communication with customers and partners.

Are Car Manufacturers the New Target?

This latest breach at Stellantis comes just weeks after Jaguar Land Rover faced its own cybersecurity incident that disrupted both production and sales operations. That attack, which hit the company’s internal systems and forced delays at dealerships. Now that two major manufacturers have been targeted in such a short span, others could easily be next.

Technology services stocks are currently among the most shorted baskets globally. The boom in Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) has led to the emergence of several multi-billion-dollar hedge funds in the last 12 months. Investors have largely written off information technology (IT) services stocks while flocking to big technology and AI-related themes, creating what appears to be a highly crowded trade setup.The IT services sector has experienced a sharp deceleration over the last two years. In contrast, hyperscalers—large-scale providers of cloud computing—have seen much faster growth . The rapid rise of AI startups and increased consumer exposure have further reinforced the ubiquitous nature of AI in everyone’s mind.However, it is too early to conclude whether the sector is going through a cyclical downturn or a structural one. A significant part of hyperscalers ’ capital expenditure is directed towards supporting their in-house applications, including Large Language Models (LLMs), as well as third-party applications.To become AI-ready, enterprises are largely shifting their on-premises budgets to hyperscalers. This does not necessarily mean they are directly cutting their services budgets.After the COVID-19 pandemic, India’s IT sector witnessed supernormal growth of 13–15% for two to three years. The current consolidation of IT spending is partly a reflection of this high base. The last six months have been particularly challenging for corporations in the United States and the European Union. Uncertainty around tariffs and ongoing technological shifts have delayed decision-making processes.Although AI adoption in most enterprises is still at the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage, the current weakness in demand has encouraged clients to leverage AI-related conversations to squeeze higher productivity benefits from vendors. This behavior is typical in every downturn but usually normalizes over time.Over the last 20 years, India’s IT sector has weathered several major technological shifts. The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) wave of 2005–2007 forced IT vendors to transition from custom application development towards broader software implementation and integration roles.The Social, Mobile, Analytics, and Cloud (SMAC) wave during 2012–2014 pushed IT vendors to evolve from a cost-arbitrage model towards a more agile and consultative approach. Similarly, the cloud transition of 2017–2019 required IT vendors to shift from on-premises infrastructure maintenance to multi-cloud platform management.Despite these transitions, Indian technology companies have continued to grow, reflecting their adaptability and ability to find new growth paths. While it is true that sector growth has gradually slowed over the past two decades, this is largely due to the industry’s already high market share.Typically, IT services see slower growth in the early stages of any major technology transition. However, growth tends to pick up as the technology matures. When it comes to AI, it is expected to be most disruptive in greenfield software development.But new code generation accounts for less than 10% of overall IT work. Other areas likely to be affected include application maintenance and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). Here too, over the last decade, these services have already undergone significant automation , meaning AI’s deflationary impact is likely to be relatively modest.Contrary to common perception, a significant portion of IT vendors’ work involves selecting appropriate technologies, system integration, updating outdated IT systems, and implementing new technologies. These tasks are unlikely to be directly impacted by AI.Interestingly, outsourcing penetration for BPO-related services remains low, and AI-driven automation could actually accelerate outsourcing, offsetting deflationary effects.Industry reports suggest that AI could reduce IT industry growth by

[TITLE]Kimmel’s suspension shows media censorship is a structural problem:
[TEXT]
As corporate media accelerate their censorship of comedians and journalists, we must realize that we got to this dire situation because of old-fashioned, bipartisan corruption in Washington, D.C. The problem didn’t begin with President Donald Trump. It began long ago, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, when presidents of both parties and Congress decided to put the nation’s media system in the hands of a small number of ever-larger corporations.

Those corporations were big political donors to both parties. Enormous mergers were approved. Antitrust laws were ignored. Federal Communications Commission rules were changed, and caps on mega-ownership were relaxed or eliminated.

There was nothing natural or inevitable

[TITLE]High-tech tax authority helps Greece return to Europe’s financial mainstream:
[TEXT]
By DEREK GATOPOULOS

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — With a pristine white exterior, the Greece tax authority’s new headquarters looks out of place on a clogged industrial artery outside Athens. A former shopping mall and ice rink, the building has been overhauled into an ultramodern digital center that has led the rescue of the nation’s ailing finance and tax sector.

It is teeming with inspectors who chase down tax cheats with the help of drones, big data and live surveillance feeds from as far as Greece’s island ports and remote farming villages.

Analysts at the Independent Authority for Public Revenue monitor millions of transactions in real time and order stings on businesses flagged by algorithms for a high potential of illegal activity. The high tech was on full display during a recent visit as The Associated Press was granted rare access to the authority’s headquarters.

Greece’s tax system — once a byword for inefficiency — has been rewired by technology.

Repurposed smartphones carried by inspectors in the field stream video and audio back to headquarters. There are panic buttons to use when someone feels threatened.

Back at headquarters, screens map ongoing site inspections and drone surveillance feeds from multiple sites: from restaurants and ports to hidden grain silos and fruit delivery trucks — even live readings from ships’ fuel tanks.

Tax and customs officials described how the data translates into raids. They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of their work and citing reasons of personal safety.

During a recent nightclub sweep dubbed “Saturday Night Fever,” they matched individual table orders against receipts to uncover undeclared sales, mostly of alcoholic drinks.

Fraud can be detected by cross-referencing mobile phone activity with reported sales as recorded by cash registers and card-payment terminals that by law must be connected to the tax authority.

“If we detect signals from 20 phones inside a store, but see almost no receipts, that’s a cue to dispatch a team immediately,” another inspector explained.

[TITLE]Trump Presses Europe to Cut Russian Energy and Target China with Tariffs:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump last week called on European countries to stop importing Russian oil and gas and to start imposing tariffs on China in order to end the war in Ukraine. He added that Washington is ready to impose major sanctions on Russia if NATO members -- the vast majority of which are European -- did both. On the continued buying of Russian oil and gas, Trump highlighted to the members of the security organisation that it greatly weakens their negotiating position and bargaining power over Russia. On the issue of imposing tariffs on China, he underlined that Beijing has a strong grip over Moscow and that it has become Russia's largest trading partner since the Ukraine war began, providing it with a critical financial lifeline in the process. Given that all these comments are correct, what is Europe going to do now?

That Trump addressed his comments to the security collective of ‘NATO members’, rather than to a geographical collective, tacitly reiterates to Europe the idea that the U.S.’s commitment to NATO might be under further threat if they do not implement his latest suggestions on Russia and China. When he did the same regarding his belief that NATO members should increase their annual defence spending from an average of 2% of their gross domestic product in 2024 to around 5%, this was quickly agreed to. Consequently, there is no reason to think European NATO members will not do the same on completely halting Russian oil and gas imports sooner rather than later. This is particularly true as it is something that many European countries already want to do and are moving toward implementing. Specifically, on 6 May, the European Union’s (E.U.) executive branch -- the European Commission (E.C.) – published its roadmap to phase out Russian energy imports completely by the end of 2027. One part of this will be done by improving the transparency, monitoring, and traceability of Russian gas across the E.U. markets, while new contracts with suppliers of Russian gas will be prevented, and spot contracts will be stopped by the end of this year. Another part will address Russian oil imports with an emphasis on employing the same techniques as for gas and a particular focus on Russia's ‘shadow fleet’ (vessels used by Russia to evade sanctions on oil). The final part will address the nuclear element of the threat from Moscow, restricting new supply contracts co-signed by the Euratom Supply Agency for uranium, enriched uranium and other nuclear materials deriving from Russia. The E.U. has already reduced its share of Russian gas imports from 45% to 19% due to the implementation of the REPowerEU Plan in May 2022. However, E.U. Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen underlined on 13 May that: “The E.U. is very clear. We do not wish for energy from Russia in the future. We don’t wish it now and we will not wish it after a peace [in Ukraine],” he said. “The Roadmap is a very clear signal that we don’t want to import so much as a single molecule [of Russian gas or oil] in the future,” he added.

Following Trump’s latest comments (made on 13 September in the Truth Social media service), several key members of the E.U. moved to support the idea within the E.C. of bringing this forward by at least a year, a very senior security source at the E.U. exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “It could be done earlier, even within the next twelve months, and there are serious talks going on now to that effect,” he said. U.S. energy secretary Chris Wright is even more bullish on the timeframe, stating last week that the E.U. could phase out Russian gas entirely within the next 6- to 12-months. “The only obstacle here [to achieving a phase out of Russian gas imports to Europe within the next 12 months] is the objection of Russia-friendly members Hungary and Slovakia, but this could be dealt with once there is consensus otherwise in the membership,” said the E.U. source. “Once the various mechanisms have been established to end our [the E.U.’s] Russian gas imports, it would be relatively straightforward to do the same for Russian oil imports too,” he underlined.

The principal alternative sources of supply for European gas needs were established in the months following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. These included increased liquefied natural gas supplies from Qatar, among other countries in the region, and from the U.S. All such supply channels remain open, and volumes can be increased over time, most notably from the U.S. Significant in this context was the E.U. pledge in July to buy US$750bn worth of U.S. energy, including gas and oil. Although some in the E.U. questioned whether such volumes could be imported from the U.S., Washington’s unequivocal view is: ‘Cut out all Russian oil and gas, and then we can discuss if the deal with us is too much then’, according to the E.U. source. “There is always going to be considerable flexibility in the deal in terms of the mix of national and private companies involved on both sides, pricing structures, and contract lengths, but in basic terms the U.S. sees no reason why the E.U. would say it cannot import the agreed volumes from the U.S. when it is continuing to import oil and gas from Russia – it looks nonsensical,” he added.

That said, there is less clarity across the E.U. when it comes to imposing tariffs on China, especially at the 50-100% level mentioned by Trump. To begin with, it is much more difficult legally for the E.C. to impose tariffs than it is to impose sanctions, the E.U. source told OilPrice.com last week. “Any agreement must be made among all members and must consider a raft of E.U. and WTO [World Trade Organisation] statutes and rules, as they [tariffs] are classed as a trade policy tool rather than as the foreign policy tool that sanctions are seen as,” he said. Trump, for his part, has always regarded tariffs and sanctions as two weapons in the same broad arsenal of punishments against targeted states, as also detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. Aside from the legal technicalities involved, there is also the economic fact that China is the largest importer of goods to Europe and third-largest market for European exports at a time when Europe is struggling to generate meaningful economic growth. That said, cognisant of the broader NATO security implications mentioned earlier in completely side-stepping the China issue, the E.U.’s 19th package of sanctions against Russia released on 19 September, stated that: “We propose further measures on Chinese actors supporting Russia’s military industry.” It added: “These new sanctions will also squeeze Russia’s access to technologies including AI [artificial intelligence] and geospatial data, as well as critical resources that feed weapons production [...] This includes those received from foreign suppliers including China [and India].” E.C. President Ursula von der Leyen also stated in the accompanying press conference to the Package announcement that: “We target refineries, oil traders, petrochemical companies in third countries, including China.” At the same time, E.U. foreign policy head Kaja Kallas, posted on social media that: “We’re adding more chemicals, metal components, salts, and ores to our export bans and tighter export controls on entities from Russia as well as China [and India].”

In short, according to the E.U. source, Europe has acknowledged Trump’s recently stated concerns over China in some action but is waiting to see if he is serious about following through on these, given his vacillation in China policy during his first term and in his second one to date. However, on the issue of expediting the full ban on all imports of Russian oil and gas ahead of 2027, it is “full throttle ahead,” he concluded.

[TITLE]Nvidia to invest billions in OpenAI as AI race heats up:
[TEXT]
The company will also provide chips for OpenAI’s data centres.

Chipmaker Nvidia will invest up to $100bn in OpenAI and provide it with data center chips, a tie-up between two of the highest-profile leaders in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race.

The deal, announced on Monday, will see Nvidia start delivering chips as soon as late 2026 and will involve two separate but intertwined transactions, according to a person close to OpenAI.

The startup will pay Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares, the person said.

The first $10bn of Nvidia’s investment in OpenAI, which was most recently valued at $500bn, will begin when the two companies reach a definitive agreement for OpenAI to purchase Nvidia chips.

Nvidia did not respond to immediate requests for clarification
