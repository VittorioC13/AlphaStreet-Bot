[TITLE]India Invests in Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
India Approves $7 Billion Plan to Boost Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing

The Indian government has approved a significant rare earth manufacturing program worth approximately $7 billion (7 billion Rupees). This ambitious initiative, known as the ‘Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Manufacturing Promotion Scheme,’ represents a major step towards establishing a robust domestic rare earth permanent magnet (REPM) production capacity in India.

According to India’s Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the program aims to achieve an integrated annual production capacity of 6,000 metric tons of REPM. These magnets are considered among the most powerful permanent magnets available and are crucial components in various rapidly growing industries, including electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, electronics, aerospace, and defense.

The approved plan will foster the development of integrated manufacturing facilities. These facilities will cover the entire process from converting rare earth oxides into metals, metals into alloys, and finally, alloys into finished rare earth permanent magnets. This integrated approach is expected to streamline production and reduce reliance on external suppliers.

The surge in demand for rare earth materials and rare earth magnets is primarily driven by the rapid expansion of EVs, the renewable energy sector, diverse industrial applications, and increasing consumption of consumer electronics. Currently, India heavily relies on imports to meet its demand. In the fiscal year ending March 2025, the country imported around 53,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets.

Currently, China dominates the market for these essential elements. Recently China has tightened export regulations on these magnets, especially after the US increased tariffs. Rare earth magnets are permanent magnets made from alloys of rare earth elements. Their power makes them indispensable for devices like electric motors, generators, and hard disk drives.

Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals, creating a substance with enhanced properties. Rare earth magnets are known for their superior magnetic strength, high coercivity, and strong energy production capabilities. Magnetic strength defines a magnet’s power to attract or repel another magnet. Coercivity is the resistance of a magnet to demagnetization.

Energy product describes the total magnetic energy that a magnet can store. The high magnetic strength of rare earth magnets stems from the large number of unpaired electrons in their alloys, creating an exceptionally powerful magnetic field.

The high coercivity is attributed to the high magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which aligns the magnetic moments of atoms within the magnet strongly in one direction, making it difficult to demagnetize.

The high energy product of rare earth magnets is a result of the combination of their high strength and high coercivity, enabling them to store substantial amounts of energy.

Key Applications of Rare Earth Magnets:

* Electric Motors

* Generators

* Hard Disk Drives

* MRI Machines

* Headphones

* Microphones

* Magnetic Separators

* Magnetic Bearings

* Magnetic Jewelry

This initiative is poised to transform India’s manufacturing landscape, creating new opportunities in the rare earth magnets sector and contributing to the growth of various key industries.

[TITLE]Rail Vision Enters the Quantum Transportation Market with Strategic Acquisition Agreement:
[TEXT]
Ra’anana, Israel, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rail Vision Ltd. (Nasdaq: RVSN) (“Rail Vision” or the “Company”), an early commercialization stage technology company seeking to revolutionize railway safety and the data-related market, today announced the signing of an agreement for a strategic transaction to acquire 51% ownership of Quantum Transportation Ltd. (the “Acquisition” and “Quantum Transportation”), a cutting-edge quantum computing and AI company specializing in error correction technologies. The closing of the Acquisition is expected to close in late December 2025 to early January 2026, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Quantum Transportation holds an exclusive sub license, for rail technologies and platforms, for an innovative pending patent application in quantum error correction owned by Ramot , the technology transfer company of the Tel Aviv University. This IP and additional know-how addresses critical challenges in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices by enabling efficient, real-time decoding of surface code errors, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to traditional methods and supporting scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Through this transaction, Rail Vision and Quantum Transportation aim to combine quantum-AI based intellectual property (IP) protection and innovation with Rail Vision’s advanced vision and railway-safety technologies.

This strategic combination is expected to create meaningful technological synergies, enhance Rail Vision’s current and future product lines, accelerate innovation, and support long-term value creation for stakeholders.

Upon the closing of the Acquisition, Rail Vision will issue ordinary shares representing approximately 4.99% of its issued and outstanding share capital, immediately prior to such issuance, to certain Quantum Transportation shareholders (the “Exchanging Shareholders”) in exchange for their full holdings in Quantum Transportation, representing 51% ownership of Quantum Transportation Ltd. and securing majority control post-closing.

Additionally, upon the closing of the Acquisition, Rail Vision will extend a convertible loan of up to $700,000 to Quantum Transportation at an 8% annual interest rate, disbursed in tranches to support Quantum Transportation's ongoing operations and development roadmap for the next 18 months. The loan, including principal and interest, shall be repayable in one payment within a 24-month term. Rail Vision will have the sole discretion to convert the outstanding amount into Quantum Transportation’s most senior class of shares, at a conversion price equal to the lower of (i) the valuation implied by the share exchange in the current acquisition or (ii) the price per share in a future equity investment in Quantum Transportation, subject to certain conditions.

Quantum Transportation’s sub-licensed, machine learning-based universal decoder pending patent represents a potential breakthrough in quantum error correction, addressing the inherent noise in qubits that limit scalable quantum computing. This technology, developed by leading computer science experts and protected as patented IP, is code-agnostic, noise-aware, and scalable. This enables it to adapt seamlessly across various hardware platforms and code sizes and empowers quantum hardware companies and labs, particularly small- to medium-sized entities, to research and select optimal error correction schemes without in-house teams.

By utilizing this IP for transportation applications, including railway, Rail Vision aims to unlock new capabilities in anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and autonomous rail operations, capitalizing on the growing quantum computing market projected to drive exponential advancements in transportation.

Key Transaction Terms and Structure

Under the business combination agreement, PAD’s implied enterprise value is up to $320 million (at a $10.00 per share reference price and after giving effect to certain pending acquisitions). Key terms of the business combination include:

● Capital & Financing: In connection with the proposed business combination, PAD has entered into a non-binding indicative term sheet with BC Partners relating to a potential credit facility and equity financing of up to an anticipated aggregate amount of $80 million (the “Financing”). The Financing is subject to numerous conditions, including, without limitation, the completion of due diligence and the execution and delivery of definitive documentation. We anticipate that the Financing, together with the funds in FACT’s trust account (consisting of approximately $175 million in gross proceeds raised in FACT’s initial public offering, subject to any redemptions), would provide funding to strengthen PAD’s balance sheet, finance strategic acquisitions, and support ongoing growth. In addition, the parties may seek other sources of financing in connection with the business combination and to bolster PAD’s balance sheet and fund future growth initiatives. There can be no assurance that any definitive agreement will be entered into in relation to the Financing or that the Financing or any other financing will be completed on the terms described, or at all. ● Incoming Capital: Incoming capital would permit PAD to optimize its balance sheet, consummate existing planned acquisitions and fund its future acquisition pipeline. Any additional cash to PAD’s balance sheet is expected to be used for general corporate purposes, positioning the combined company for robust growth post-closing. There can be no assurance that any planned acquisitions will be completed or additional funding will be consummated. ● Pro Forma Ownership Structure: Following the business combination, PAD’s current shareholders are expected to own approximately 59% of the combined company’s outstanding shares. ● Governance and Leadership: We anticipate that the combined company’s board of directors will include, among others, certain current directors of PAD, one designee by FACT’s sponsor, and independent directors with relevant industry experience. The combined company will remain headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, and PAD’s seasoned executive team will continue to lead day-to-day operations.

Aerospace companies set to get more capital market support as reusable rockets make headway

Global Times

By Chu Daye Published: Nov 28, 2025 10:46 PM

Six Chinese commercial aerospace companies had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus from June 18 to November 27, the Securities Daily reported on Friday, amid faster growth in China's commercial aerospace sector and launches being scheduled for several reusable carrier rockets in the coming months.

Chinese industry insiders and financial experts said more commercial aerospace companies are set to receive further support from the capital market as China's commercial aerospace industry moves from the technological exploration phase to commercialization.

The Securities Daily reported on Friday that six commercial space companies, including Chinese private space firms LandSpace, Galactic Energy, CAS Space, Space Pioneer, Yee Space and Mino Space, have had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus.

The IPO progress has come amid China's increasing policy support for the sector. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced in June a new sci-tech growth tier on the country's Nasdaq-style Science and Technology Innovation Board, also known as the STAR Market.

The regulator also called for more support for companies in cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence and commercial aerospace, such as more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market, in light of industrial development and market demand.

Beijing-based LandSpace said in a statement sent to the Global Times that it is set to launch its ZQ-3 reusable rocket at the end of November. Industry analysts said this will be a key step in the mastering of heavy duty, low cost and reusable rockets by Chinese private space firms.

Space Pioneer, another Beijing-based aerospace company, is also preparing for a launch for its Tianlong-3 reusable rocket, according to the South China Morning Post. The rocket is expected to be used to build China's massive internet satellite constellations, the report said.

A Beijing-based venture capital investor surnamed Liu told the Global Times on Friday that there has been a marked rise in market attention toward the commercial aerospace sector, given the policy support and recent progress made in the industry. "The new policies are also a boon for earlier-stage investors looking for an exit strategy," Liu said.

Tian Lihui, professor of finance at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Friday that listing can not only address the financing challenges faced by enterprises and secure funding for continuous research and development input, but also guide capital toward companies with genuine technical strengths and commercial potential. It will also promote the healthy development of the industry, Tian noted.

The CSRC's call for more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market precisely addresses the chokepoint for commercial aerospace - high R&D investment and long profitability cycles - by opening up more capital market channels for the industry, Tian said.

Further policy support came on Tuesday, when China's space agency released an action plan to back commercial space firms and encourage them to pursue international cooperation over the next two years.

The document released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said the country's commercial space enterprises should "go global" and help developing countries to build satellite-application industries.

Among the supportive measures, the CNSA will establish a national commercial space development fund and local governments will be urged to establish technology-innovation centers focused on reusable rockets and smart satellites, and to build open platforms for advanced manufacturing, final assembly and testing.

The plan aims to achieve high-quality commercial space development by 2027. The recommendations for the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) list the aerospace sector among China's strategic emerging industries.
