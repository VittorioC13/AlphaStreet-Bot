[TITLE]Neocloud Crusoe Scores Funding, Oracle Debt Offering, CoreWeave Deal Drama:
[TEXT]
Crusoe, a cloud infrastructure partner of ChatGPT builder OpenAI, raised $1.38 billion in a funding round that values the company at more than $10 billion. Crusoe is among a wave of artificial intelligence "neoclouds" that includes CoreWeave (CRWV), Nebius (NBIS), Lambda and Nscale. CoreWeave stock has climbed 225% since the company's initial public offering.

Technology investors Valor Equity Partners and Mubadala Capital co-led the Crusoe funding round. Crusoe is a partner in the OpenAI project called Stargate in West Texas. Stargate is a joint venture of OpenAI, Oracle (ORCL), SoftBank and MGX. Crusoe also is building an AI data center in Wyoming.

A group of banks next week will launch a massive $38 billion debt offering to help fund the build-out of various Oracle AI data centers, according to a Bloomberg report.

Neoclouds build data centers designed from scratch for crunching AI workloads. Like CoreWeave, Crusoe rents out servers equipped with Nvidia (NVDA) AI accelerators.

Neoclouds: Lambda IPO Coming?

Lambda is also exploring an IPO, according to reports.

On the stock market today, CoreWeave stock rose 6.5% to 131.46 in midday trading.

CoreWeave's proposed all-stock acquisition of Core Scientific (CORZ), originally valued at $9 billion, continues to run into turbulence. Some shareholders oppose the deal and are seeking a higher premium. But CoreWeave has stated it does not plan to raise its offer.

CoreWeave's stellar customer list also includes Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META).

The IBD Methodology: How To Invest In Stocks While Managing Risks

While some analysts project a big AI market opportunity for CoreWeave and other neoclouds, others fret about customer concentration and high debt. According to Synergy Reseach, neoclouds will garner of $23 billion in revenue combined in 2025 and will grow 69% annually through 2030.

Economists are debating whether massive AI investment could harm other parts of the U.S. economy. While neoclouds and Oracle are adding debt, Meta has created a joint venture with Blue Owl Capital, a private asset manager, to fund its AI data center build-out.

CoreWeave Stock Technical Rating

Meanwhile, CoreWeave stock owns a Composite Rating of 61 out of a best possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. Also, CoreWeave stock has a relatively small float, making it more volatile. The Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths.

Further, CoreWeave stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-plus. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. (A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.)

Additionally, CoreWeave is among the top AI stocks to watch.

[TITLE]Investor confidence builds in semicon start-ups as government schemes take hold:
[TEXT]
India’s semiconductor start-up ecosystem is witnessing a gradual shift in investor sentiment, driven largely by government initiatives like the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) and the Design Linked Incentive (DLI) scheme. While funding levels still lag global peers, industry leaders say the conversation around semiconductor investments has become significantly easier than it was just a few years ago.

“Funding interest is growing, and it’s easier to have conversations now than it was a few years ago. Investors are learning the language of semiconductors and building up a knowledge base of how to value such companies,” said Shashwath TR, Co-founder and CEO of Mindgrove Technologies. “But there’s still a long way to go to tap the full potential of both the start-ups and of the funding ecosystem.”

Echoing the sentiment, Hareesh Chandrasekar, Co-founder and CEO, Agnit Semiconductors, said, “Funding interest in the semiconductor sector looks quite robust at the moment with interest from the VC/PE ecosystem, government grants for chip developments and from private industries looking for start-up collaborations to feed into their end-product road-maps.”

Government catalyses private capital

Start-ups note that the DLI scheme, which provides up to 50 per cent of project costs, has emerged as a critical validation metric for private investors, thus unlocking private capital. Venture investment in the semiconductor sector jumped from $5 million in 2023 to $28 million in 2024, according to Endiya Partners’ recent report on India’s semiconductor landscape.

“India’s semiconductor story is reaching a critical turning point,” said Sateesh Andra, Managing Partner at Endiya Partners. He noted that the country is no longer just a consumption-led market but is fast emerging as a design and manufacturing hub. He added that deep-tech entrepreneurs are turning design expertise into investable IP and application-specific silicon innovations—signs of where India’s next big advantage could lie.

Capital efficiency remains a challenge

Despite the positive momentum, Indian semiconductor start-ups continue to operate with significant capital constraints compared to their global counterparts. Shashwath highlighted that while Indian companies might raise $8-10 million in Series A funding, equivalent firms in Silicon Valley or China would secure $30-40 million at similar stages.

“We are forced to be very capital efficient and selective in what we attempt to do. Again, schemes like DLI and the national EDA grid are crucial in making things happen for us,” he added.

The long monetisation cycles inherent to semiconductor development—typically five-seven years—remain a constraint. However, industry observers note that deep-tech focused investors are increasingly adapting their expectations.

Hence, the Indian VC ecosystem and serious deep-tech funds “are beginning to put their money into this sector within a decadal view,” Chandrasekar noted.

Design versus manufacturing bets

Investor interest appears balanced between design-led start-ups and manufacturing ventures, though preferences vary based on risk appetite and capital availability. Design ventures offer lower capital requirements, shorter gestation periods and higher margins, while manufacturing plays demand intensive capital and promise longer-term returns.

Partnerships with global foundries and chip-makers have become crucial for attracting investment. “A credible partnership definitely adds confidence that monetisation of the chips/IP is on the horizon and that customer offtake of chips is imminent,” Chandrasekar said.

With over 100 semiconductor start-ups now operating in India and the DLI scheme having sanctioned ₹803 crore for 23 projects, the ecosystem is showing early signs of maturity. Industry players are now calling for policy continuity through updated versions of ISM and DLI to sustain momentum and help Indian companies achieve global competitiveness.

"The most lucrative industry in Hsinchu isn't chips. It's kindergartens," a Taiwanese friend quipped when I mentioned my trip to the chip city, 50 miles south of Taipei.

He was half-joking, but it's not far from the truth.

Hsinchu, home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and a dense network of tech firms that form the world's chip supply chains, is now the rare place in Taiwan where people are still having babies — if they can afford to.

While most of Taiwan struggles with one of the world's lowest birthrates, Hsinchu's numbers have held just above the national average, fueled by high salaries, economic stability, and a wave of young professionals starting families.

The same boom that's driving Taiwan's place in the global economy is also drawing sharp lines between who can afford to build a life and who can't. In Hsinchu's wealthiest boroughs, parenting is a high-investment, high-competition pursuit. But rising housing costs and inequality are pricing many young locals out entirely.

During my visit to Hsinchu in late May, I found glossy new high-rise housing lining the tracks as my high-speed rail train pulled into the city.

New housing developments are mushrooming in Zhubei in Hsinchu County, where the high-speed rail train station is located. Huileng Tan/Business Insider

At a mall, I watched an elementary schooler casually pay for his solo lunch at the next table, while I balked at my $25 bill at a bougie French café.

"Whenever I go to Hsinchu, I feel like there are so many kids around and wonder if we really have a low birthrate," my friend added.

Tech jobs bring stability — and babies

Taiwan's total fertility rate, or TFR, hit just 0.87 per woman in 2023 — holding steady from 2022 after seven straight years of decline.

It ticked up to 0.89 per woman in 2024 — a "dragon year," traditionally seen as auspicious for births — but remained well below the 2.1 replacement rate. For comparison, the US had a rate of less than 1.6 in the same year.

Against this backdrop, Hsinchu's baby bump — with a steady TFR rate of around 1 per woman — is modest but meaningful. Hsinchu County, an up-and-coming region that is home to part of the science park and where many young families choose to settle, clocked a TFR of 1.02 in 2023.

Even a slight boomlet matters in a super-aged society where one in five people is over 65.

"Taipei is the capital, but it's increasingly filled with older rather than younger residents because the city is very functional for daily living, but the good jobs are elsewhere," Dachrahn Wu, an economics professor at National Central University in Taiwan, told me.

Where parenting is strategy — and big business

In some ways, the children of Hsinchu are the real face of a city reshaped by global demand for chips.

Once a farming town, Hsinchu has transformed into Taiwan's Silicon Valley.

In 2023, TSMC employees alone accounted for at least 2% of all children born in Taiwan, despite making up just 0.3% of the island's population.

Higher fertility and migration have made Hsinchu city and county the only two administrative regions in Taiwan with more young than old people, according to Taiwan's interior ministry.

"Chip and tech companies in Hsinchu typically hire engineers out of graduate school, so they would be in their late 20s when they start working for these firms. This is the prime age for marriage and family formation," said Wu.

Cities like Taoyuan in the northwest of Taiwan — home to another industrial zone — also show a higher fertility rate than the rest of Taiwan, likely for similar reasons, said Wu, who heads a research institute on macroeconomic trends.

Tech wealth

While tech has driven Taiwan's recent wave of wealth, most people aren't in semiconductors.

[TITLE]Eos Energy Executes Next Phase of Growth Strategy with U.S. Manufacturing Expansion and New Software Hub Under Project AMAZE:
[TEXT]
$24 million state-led economic development package underscores the shared commitment between Eos and Pennsylvania to advance U.S. manufacturing and job creation

Expansion reinforces the Company’s progress and transformation as Pennsylvania becomes a national hub for energy, technology, and manufacturing innovation

PITTSBURGH, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) ("Eos" or the “Company”), an American energy company and the leading innovator in designing, sourcing, manufacturing, and providing zinc-based battery energy storage systems (BESS) manufactured in the United States, today announced the next phase of its growth strategy with the expansion of its U.S. manufacturing footprint and the establishment of a new software hub strengthening American energy storage capacity, energy independence, and industrial job growth.

In partnership with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Allegheny County, the Company was awarded a joint $24 million economic development package to support U.S. manufacturing and the continued growth of 1,000 high quality American jobs. The incentive package will help the Company scale operations to meet growing market demand driven, in part, by AI infrastructure, while advancing energy innovation in Pennsylvania.

“Energy storage is the backbone of a modern energy system, and this significant milestone marks our progress to bring America’s battery to scale,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “Through Project AMAZE, we’re proving that you can make things in America again by building world-class capacity, pairing advanced manufacturing with innovative software, and doing it here in Pennsylvania to ensure a more energy-efficient and secure future. We thank Governor Shapiro, Allegheny County, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, and the Pittsburgh Technology Council for their unwavering support and shared vision for advancing Americas quest to lead in energy.”

Eos will expand its manufacturing capacity with a new state-of-the-art 432,000 sq. ft. facility in Marshall Township, PA, that will house additional production lines that complement the Company’s existing Turtle Creek manufacturing facility with plans to reach 8 GWh of annualized energy storage capacity. The new facility enables Eos to transition from single piece flow operations to high-efficiency, large-scale production, marking the culmination of years of process development designed to bring U.S. made energy storage to market at scale.

“The demand for energy is going up — and my Administration is capitalizing on Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and net energy exporter to attract leading energy manufacturers like Eos Energy to the Commonwealth,” said Governor Shapiro. “We’re doubling down on our efforts to aggressively compete for — and win — major projects like this one by cutting red tape, building out our skilled workforce, and investing in the next generation of energy technology. I’m proud that Pennsylvania will be home to Eos’ new global headquarters — and my Administration will continue to work to cut energy costs, create good-paying jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.”

Eos will also establish a new software hub at Nova Place, Pittsburgh’s premiere technology and innovation center, that supports the Company’s growing workforce and proprietary battery management system, software, controls and analytics platform, DawnOSTM. Eos joins a thriving community of other advanced manufacturing, data/telecommunications, AI, electric utilities, and robotics leaders in Pittsburgh’s innovation headquarters.

As part of its expanding software and engineering focus, the Company plans to deepen its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, a leading institution in robotics, AI, computer science, and engineering to further develop a state-of-the-art workforce to work in Eos’ software hub.

“Carnegie Mellon University is thrilled to celebrate this milestone with Eos, and we are looking forward to the many opportunities it unlocks – for Pittsburghers, our students, and America’s bright future in manufacturing,” said CMU President Farnam Jahanian. “On behalf of the CMU community, I extend my sincere congratulations to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Eos CEO Joe Mastrangelo and their teams for leading the way in strengthening Western Pennsylvania’s roles as an innovation engine for the nation and as a driver of the talent that will power it.”

“Pennsylvania has an extensive history of being at the forefront of innovation. We’re proving that in Pittsburgh you can not only build products in America but also offer world class education and intellectual capabilities to grow emerging industries,” said Pranesh Rao, Eos Senior Vice President of Storage System Engineering. “Building our software hub in Pittsburgh—surrounded by talented workers and a fast-growing innovation ecosystem—is both a strategic move and a catalyst to propel Eos to the next level.”

U.S. and China trade cyberattack allegations as tensions escalate

China has been named as the culprit behind a significant cyber-attack on U.S. national security networks, with the potential to disrupt critical infrastructure such as power grids, water supplies and fuel refineries. The attack is part of a broader strategy to exploit internal chaos and unrest in the United States and there are even rumors of a potential military invasion by Chinese troops.

China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) has accused the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) of orchestrating a years-long cyberattack against China's National Time Service Center. The MSS claims the NSA infiltrated the center's systems, stole sensitive data and attempted cyber sabotage, raising concerns

[TITLE]DHS Wants a Fleet of AI-Powered Surveillance Trucks:
[TEXT]
The US Department of Homeland Security is seeking to develop a new mobile surveillance platform that fuses artificial intelligence, radar, high-powered cameras, and wireless networking into a single system, according to federal contracting records reviewed by WIRED. The technology would mount on 4x4 vehicles capable of reaching remote areas and transforming into rolling, autonomous observation towers, extending the reach of border surveillance far beyond its current fixed sites.

The proposed system surfaced Friday after US Customs and Border Protection quietly published a pre-solicitation notice for what it’s calling a Modular Mobile Surveillance System, or M2S2. The listing includes draft technical documents, data requirements, and design objectives.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

If M2S2 performs as described, border patrol agents could park their vehicles, raise a telescoping mast, and within minutes start detecting motion several miles away. The system would rely heavily on so-called computer vision, a kind of “artificial intelligence” that allows machines to interpret visual data frame by frame and detect shapes, heat signatures, and movement patterns. Such algorithms—previously developed for use in war drones—are trained on thousands if not millions of images to distinguish between people, animals, and vehicles.

The development of M2S2 comes amid the Trump administration’s sweeping crackdown on undocumented immigrants across the US. As part of this push, which has sparked widespread protests and condemnation for the brutal tactics used by immigration authorities, Congress boosted DHS’s discretionary budget authority to roughly $65 billion. The GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” allocates over $160 billion for immigration enforcement and border measures—most of it directed to DHS—with the funds scheduled to be distributed over multiple years. The administration has sought to increase DHS funding by roughly 65 percent, proposing the largest expansion in the agency’s history to fund new border enforcement, detention capacity, and immigration surveillance initiatives.

According to documents reviewed by WIRED, locations of objects targeted by the system would be pinpointed on digital maps within 250 feet of their true location (with a stretch goal of around 50 feet) and transmit that data across an app called TAK—a government-built tactical mapping platform developed by the US Defense Department to help troops coordinate movements and avoid friendly fire.

DHS envisions two modes of operation: one with an agent on site and another where the trucks sit mostly unattended. In the latter case, the vehicle’s onboard AI would conduct the surveillance and send remote operators alerts when it detects activity. Missions are to be logged start to finish, with video, maps, and sensor data retained for a minimum of 15 days, locked against deletion “under any circumstances.”
