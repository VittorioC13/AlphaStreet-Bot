Higher Demand for Convenient Options is helpful for the Processed Meat Industry's Growth

Hectic lifestyles of consumers leading to higher demand for convenient meal options are one of the major factors for the growth of the processed meat market. Processed meat cuts are versatile for preparing various recipes and dishes, allowing consumers to enjoy global flavors and further fueling the market’s growth. High demand for ready-to-eat and ready-to-consume options to save time and maintain nutritional integrity is another major factor for the market’s growth.

Technological Innovations are helpful for the Market’s Growth

Technological innovations such as AI, ML, and advanced packaging are fueling market growth. Advanced procedures such as intelligent cutting systems, precision and efficiency, and automation are further fueling the market’s growth by reducing human intervention and automating as many packaging procedures as possible. Non-thermal methods such as e-beam irradiation, ultrasound, and high-pressure processing enhance the quality and shelf life of processed meat, helping maintain flavors and nutrients intact. Enhanced production consistency through traceability systems, smart sensors, and robotics further drives the industry’s growth.

Recent Developments in the Processed Meat Market

Impact of AI in the Processed Meat Market

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the processed meat market by improving efficiency, product quality, safety, and supply chain performance. In processing plants, AI-powered computer vision systems inspect meat cuts for texture, color, marbling, and surface defects with far more precision than manual inspection. These systems also detect contamination risks and foreign materials early, helping companies maintain strict hygiene standards and reduce recalls. Machine learning models optimize grinding, mixing, curing, smoking, and cooking processes to achieve consistent flavor, moisture levels, and texture across batches while reducing energy use and production waste.

AI-driven automation supports accurate portioning, seasoning, and packaging, lowering labor requirements and improving throughput. Predictive maintenance tools monitor equipment performance in real time, allowing processors to address mechanical issues before they disrupt production.

[TITLE]Black Friday: Public warned about fake cloned websites and ‘too good to be true’ offers:
[TEXT]
THE PUBLIC HAS been warned to be “extra vigilant” today and to not be tricked by “too good to be true” scams.

Today is Black Friday when retailers will be dropping their prices and the sales will continue into Cyber Monday, the online equivalent of Black Friday.

Close to 40% of people are expected to make a purchase in the sales and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has urged consumers to stop and think before rushing into a purchase.

It is also warning consumers to be especially wary of ads on social media, as scammers are using convincing clones of trusted websites and fake local shops to trick shoppers.

Cloned sites

To coincide with the Black Friday sales, the CCPC released a collection of case studies from recent scams.

One such incident saw a consumer pay €125 for an armchair after clicking on an advert on a leading social media platform.

He thought he was directed to the website of a popular furniture retailer but had actually been taken to a cloned website.

The CCPC is urging people to make purchases through the retailer’s official website or app rather than clicking on a social media link.

Consumers are also reminded that the information and imagery on websites can be fabricated and you should always take time to check sites like Trustpilot for independent reviews.

One case study referenced by the CCPC involved a consumer paying €320 for shelving from a furniture business he found on social media.

When the item didn’t arrive and messages weren’t responded to, the consumer discovered online reviews from others which pointed to the same experiences.

In hindsight, the consumer said he would have suspected a scam sooner if he had checked the online reviews before he made the transaction.

The CCPC also warns that scammers often create urgency to pressure quick decisions and if something feels off or feels too good to be true, consumers should stop and think before engaging further.

Consumers should also be wary of unusually large discounts, unfamiliar websites, recently created social media profiles, and exclusively five-star reviews.

You should also use a credit or debit card, or trusted payment provider such as Pay Pal, rather than a direct bank transfer.

Advertisement

“Do your research, take your time, and don’t take risks, no matter how tempting the deal,” advised the CCPC.

If you think you have been scammed, you should contact your bank or payment provider immediately.

You may also need to freeze your card to prevent further money being taken.

Meanwhile, An Garda Síochána is responsible for pursuing scam operators and scams can be reported to your local garda station.

Other research carried out by the CCPC ahead of Black Friday revealed that 63% of people do not trust that the pre-sale prices or percentage discount displayed during sales are accurate.

The research also showed that 28% are likely to be swayed by a recommendation from a social media influencer – this climbed to 40% among those aged 15 to 24.

Elsewhere, Mick Moran, the CEO of the Irish Internet Hotline, the national center for reporting illegal online content, warned customers there will be a large amount of online scams occurring over the weekend.

He too advised people to only shop from brands they know and trust.

In particular, he said people should stay away from buying products posted on social media platforms.

Counterfeit goods

Bank of Ireland has also issued a warning to consumers in the run-up to Black Friday.

When compared to the final six months of 2024, there’s been a 47% rise in purchase scam cases with Bank of Ireland in the first six months of 2025.

Purchase scams see fraudsters tricking people into buying goods or services which are fake or don’t exist.

Bank of Ireland warned that fraudsters “redouble their efforts to target people” over Black Friday and up to Christmas.

Revenue has also warned consumers to be wary of purchase scams and counterfeit goods amid the Black Friday sales.

If items are suspected of infringing intellectual property rights, they will be detained by Revenue and checked with the rights holder.

A Revenue spokesperson added that consumers should be aware that counterfeit products are often of inferior quality and, in some cases, unsafe.

A Health-Conscious Crowd is Helpful to Boost the Dairy Alternatives Industry

The dairy alternatives market is observed to grow due to high demand for health-conscious, ethical, and dairy-free options. Such options are low in cholesterol and fat, which is further helpful for the market’s growth. Consumer awareness of health, wellness, and nutrition also supports market growth, driving consumer demand for plant-based and vegan options. Dairy-free product manufacturers also help drive product innovation and introduce a range of products with different flavor options, further fueling market growth.

Technological Innovations Are Helpful for the Market’s Growth

Technological innovations such as precision fermentation, cell-based milk production, and improved plant-based formulations, the use of microorganisms, and novel ingredients help to enhance the quality of plant-based milk, further fueling the growth of the dairy alternatives market. The use of advanced processing methods, such as non-thermal pasteurization, to produce high-quality dairy proteins and similar products also helps fuel market growth. Such technological innovations also help ensure that the quality, nutritional value, taste, and texture of dairy-free alternatives remain similar to those of dairy products, propelling market growth.

Impact of AI in the Dairy Alternatives Market

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the dairy alternatives market by improving product innovation, manufacturing efficiency, and consumer alignment. In research and formulation, AI-powered algorithms analyze data on plant proteins, fats, emulsifiers, and flavor compounds to develop dairy alternatives that closely replicate the taste, creaminess, and functionality of traditional milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream. Machine learning models simulate how ingredients such as oats, almonds, soy, coconuts, and peas behave under different processing conditions, reducing trial-and-error and accelerating the development of smoother textures, better foaming properties, and enhanced nutritional profiles.

AI-driven predictive analytics optimize soaking, grinding, fermentation, and homogenization processes to maintain consistency and reduce waste. Computer vision systems monitor raw materials for impurities, color variations, and microbial risks, ensuring the production of safe, high-quality dairy-free products. These systems improve batch uniformity and help manufacturers meet clean-label and allergen-free standards.

Dairy Alternatives Market Dynamics

What Are the Growth Drivers of the Dairy Alternatives Market?

The growing population of health-conscious consumers, vegans, vegetarians, and flexitarians is a major factor driving market growth. Dairy-free alternatives are low in cholesterol and fat and are therefore highly sought by consumers seeking to maintain their nutritional charts. The rising number of intolerant individuals is another major factor driving market growth. Such food and beverages options are also cost-effective and ideal for people who cannot consume lactose, hence are helpful for the market’s growth. Hence, they are widely used by the food and beverage industry to manufacture dairy-free alternatives, which supports the market’s growth.

Challenge

Consumer Perception May Obstruct the Market’s Growth

Many dairy-free alternative companies are unable to match the taste and texture of dairy-free products to those of dairy products. Hence, many consumers are dissatisfied with such products, further hindering market growth. They are also unable to match the protein and other nutritional levels of the dairy-based product, further impacting the market’s growth. Hence, such issues combined may create an obstruction in the growth of the dairy alternatives market.

Opportunity

Higher Demand for Functional Products Is Helpful for the Market’s Growth

Many dairy-free alternative companies are launching products enriched with essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and high protein. It helps consumers to maintain their nutritional profile in dairy-free form. Such companies are also launching a range of dairy-free products with diverse flavor profiles, further fueling market growth in the foreseeable period and expanding the consumer base. It helps attract consumers by defining the health benefits of such products.

Trade Analysis of the Dairy Alternatives Market

Import & Export Statistics

Global Trade Scale and Recent Trend Signals

The dairy alternatives market continues to expand rapidly, with global market estimates clustering in the low-to-mid tens of billions of US dollars for 2024 and strong multi-year growth forecasts as consumers shift toward plant-based diets and fortified alternatives. Market research groups report that global dairy alternatives (plant-based milks and related products) were valued at around US$34 billion in 2024, with projections of significant growth through the 2020s driven by product innovation, new geographic demand, and wider retail distribution.

Leading Exporters (Value and Volume)

Trade in finished dairy alternative products is closely linked to where production scales are located and where raw materials are processed. Major corporate producers and manufacturing hubs in Europe and North America supply much of the finished product exports (brands such as Danone/Alpro, Oatly, Califia Farms and Blue Diamond lead cross-border shipments and private label supply). At the raw material level, the world’s leading soybean producers and exporters (Brazil and the United States) underpin soy-based alternatives, while Spain and the United States are major origin suppliers for almonds used in almond milk manufacturing. These upstream supplier nations, therefore, play an outsized role in securing feedstock for exporters of finished dairy alternative goods.

Major Importers and Demand Hubs

Import demand is concentrated in high-consumption, rapidly adopting markets: North America and Western Europe remain large retail markets for finished plant-based milks and yogurts, while East Asia and the Gulf states show fast growth in fortified and specialty formats. Retailers and foodservice buyers in the EU, the United States and China import both finished retail SKUs and intermediate ingredients (e.g., concentrate, protein isolates). Growing middle classes and health-driven consumption in Southeast Asia and the Middle East create important secondary demand hubs for imports and regional manufacturing.

Product Forms, Pricing, and Logistics That Shape Trade

Trade covers ambient shelf-stable cartons (UHT), refrigerated ready-to-drink formats, aseptic pouches, concentrated bases and isolates (oat concentrates, almond paste, soy protein), and specialty ingredients for infant and clinical nutrition. Logistics differ by form: shelf-stable UHT and concentrates travel in standard containerised freight, while fresh refrigerated SKUs require cold chain and faster transit. Price sensitivity is driven by raw material cycles (soybean harvests, almond yields, oat availability), processing yields and fortification costs. Manufacturers sometimes adopt “asset-light” and regional production strategies to reduce cross-border freight costs and adapt quickly to local tastes and price points.

Such snacks are in high demand among health-conscious consumers and those who prefer healthy munching over deep-fried snacks. They have a longer shelf life and are flavorful, making them easy to store and carry outdoors to maintain their nutritional profile. Meat-based snacks, available at affordable prices, appeal to different types of consumers because they are high in protein and other nutrients.

Impact of AI in the meat snacks market

Artificial intelligence is transforming the meat snacks market by improving processing efficiency, product quality, and responsiveness to consumer trends. In manufacturing, AI-powered computer vision systems inspect meat cuts for texture, color, fat distribution, and defects with greater accuracy than manual checks. These systems detect contamination risks early and ensure consistent slicing, seasoning, and drying, which is essential for jerky, meat sticks, and other ready-to-eat formats. Machine learning models also optimize marination times, drying temperatures, and smoking cycles to achieve uniform flavor and texture while reducing energy use and production waste.

AI strengthens supply chain operations by forecasting demand, optimizing inventory planning, and improving logistics for perishable raw materials. This reduces the risk of shortages and overproduction, especially in markets where protein-rich snacks experience seasonal or lifestyle-driven demand spikes. In product development, AI analyzes consumer preferences, nutritional data, and flavor trends to help manufacturers create new variants such as low-sugar jerky, high-protein sticks, plant-infused meat snacks, and globally inspired flavors.

[TITLE]Distillers renew call for zero-for-zero deal with US:
[TEXT]
Irish whiskey distillers have renewed their call on the Government and the EU to step up efforts to secure a zero-for-zero trading deal with the US for their products.

The call was made as the industry launched a new tourism initiative aimed at attracting more visitors to distilleries around the country.

The Irish Whiskey Way is designed to showcase 26 distilleries across the island in the five designated tourist regions, including the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, Ireland’s Ancient East, Dublin and Northern Ireland.

The Irish Whiskey Way was launched at the Kilbeggan Distillery Experience in Co Westmeath

It is aimed at promoting Ireland’s food and drinks trails to international and domestic visitors.

The Irish Whiskey Way was launched by Minister for Enterprise and Tourism Peter Burke at the Kilbeggan Distillery Experience in Co Westmeath.

Mr Burke described it as "a unique initiative that celebrates one of Ireland’s most iconic exports while showcasing the rich culture, heritage and hospitality that makes our country and this region so special".

"This journey will not only highlight the craftsmanship behind Irish whiskey but also connect visitors with the vibrant communities, food experiences and stories that define Ireland," he said.

In the year to June, just over one million people toured Irish whiskey distilleries, a 23% increase in the number of visitors compared to the previous year.

It is hoped the new whiskey trail will help to build on those numbers.

Chief Executive of Tourism Ireland Alice Mansergh said it will provide a boost to the tourism sector.

Director of the Irish Whiskey Association Eoin Ó Catháin the importance of cooperation 'has never been greater'

Ms Mansergh said it will enable visitors to "experience the 700-year history of whiskey on this island".

"It's really significant that the distilleries themselves have reported a million visitors over the past year, so we can see that at the moment, tourism is good for whiskey, and whiskey is good for tourism too," she said.

Director of the Irish Whiskey Association Eoin Ó Catháin said the new initiative was developed by whiskey distilleries "working together to present a unique food and drink trail to the international and domestic visitor".

Mr Ó Catháin said the importance of cooperation "has never been greater, this year more than ever, and the value of every euro spent in Ireland has never been more appreciated".

The initiative has been launched against the backdrop of the 15% tariffs on goods being exported from the EU to the US, which is the biggest export market for Irish whiskey.

Amid the initial uncertainty over the trade levy, up to 90% of whiskey production here was paused.

While for the most part it has resumed, distillers say the levy is putting significant pressure on the sector, as businesses absorb the costs.

Mr Ó Catháin said

[TITLE]Ahead of Black Friday, Report Reveals Attacks on Garment Workers' Right to Organize:
[TEXT]
With clothing companies that will be offering discounted Black Friday deals this week relying heavily on the labor of tens of millions underpaid and overworked garment workers across the Global South, two reports by the human rights group Amnesty International make the case that ensuring these employees are afforded the right to organize their workplaces is key to ending worker exploitation across the fashion industry.

The organization interviewed 64 garment workers in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, and Pakistan from 2023-24, including 12 union organizers and labor rights activists, for its report titled Stitched Up,

Dublin, Nov. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Spain Buy Now Pay Later Business and Investment Opportunities Databook - 75+ KPIs on BNPL Market Size, End-Use Sectors, Market Share, Product Analysis, Business Model, Demographics - Q3 2025 Update" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The BNPL payment market in Spain is expected to grow by 11.6% on annual basis to reach US$8.91 billion in 2025.

The BNPL market in the country experienced robust growth during 2021-2024, achieving a CAGR of 19.5%. This upward trajectory is expected to continue, with the market forecast to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% during 2025-2030. By the end of 2030, the BNPL sector is projected to expand from its 2024 value of USD 7.98 billion to approximately USD 13.34 billion.

This report provides a detailed data-centric analysis of the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) industry in Spain, covering market opportunities and risks across a range of retail categories. With over 75 KPIs at the country level, this report provides a comprehensive understanding of BNPL market dynamics, market size and forecast, and market share statistics.

Spain's BNPL market is rapidly expanding, driven by increased e-commerce penetration and changing consumer payment preferences. Major players such as PayPal, Klarna, Afterpay, and CaixaBank are strengthening their foothold in the sector through strategic acquisitions and partnerships. With the market projected to grow significantly, competition is expected to intensify, leading to further innovation in BNPL offerings and greater adoption among Spanish consumers.

Regulatory changes, particularly the EU's Second Consumer Credit Directive (CCD2), will shape the future of BNPL services in Spain. The directive's new requirements for transparency, affordability checks, and consumer protection will likely impact how BNPL providers operate. While these regulations may introduce compliance challenges, they allow providers to establish sustainable business models and enhance consumer trust.

Rapid Expansion of BNPL Services

Spain's BNPL market is expanding rapidly, this significant increase is largely driven by the growing popularity of installment-based payment solutions among Spanish consumers. As BNPL services become more embedded in the retail and financial sectors, consumers and businesses benefit from greater payment flexibility and increased transaction volumes.

The primary drivers of BNPL adoption in Spain include the rapid expansion of e-commerce and changing consumer preferences for alternative credit solutions. The rise of digital shopping platforms has fueled demand for BNPL options as consumers seek more manageable payment structures. Many prefer BNPL over traditional credit cards due to its transparency and absence of high interest rates, further contributing to its growing acceptance across different retail categories.

Over the next few years, BNPL expansion will lead to heightened competition among BNPL providers, prompting companies to innovate and introduce new service offerings tailored to specific consumer segments. However, regulatory scrutiny may also increase as the market grows, requiring BNPL providers to implement more stringent risk management and consumer protection measures.

Integration of BNPL into E-commerce Platforms

Integrating BNPL services into Spain's e-commerce platforms is accelerating, with local players such as Aplazame and Sequra offering installment payment solutions to online shoppers. As more e-commerce businesses adopt BNPL, consumers can access flexible payment options at checkout, making online shopping more accessible. This trend is reshaping consumer spending habits, encouraging higher transaction volumes and increasing merchant adoption of BNPL services.

The growing demand for flexible financing solutions in Spain's expanding e-commerce sector is a key driver of BNPL integration. By providing installment-based payments, BNPL providers enable consumers to purchase without the immediate burden of full upfront costs. This model benefits consumers, who can manage expenses more effectively, and merchants, who experience increased conversion rates and higher average order values.

Over the next few years, the continued integration of BNPL into e-commerce is expected to accelerate digital payment adoption in Spain further. Consumers who have hesitated to move away from traditional payment methods may become more comfortable with BNPL solutions, contributing to greater financial inclusion. However, as BNPL becomes a dominant payment option, regulatory oversight may increase to ensure responsible lending and consumer protection within the digital finance sector.

Strategic Partnerships Enhancing BNPL Reach

Strategic partnerships between BNPL providers and financial institutions are expanding the reach of BNPL services in Spain. CaixaBank's collaboration with Apple Pay, which allows users to split payments into multiple monthly installments, is an instance of how traditional banks integrate BNPL solutions into their payment offerings. Such alliances provide consumers with more flexible payment options while increasing bank and merchant transaction volumes.

The primary driver behind these partnerships is the ability of BNPL providers to leverage established customer bases and infrastructure to scale rapidly. By collaborating with major financial institutions, tech firms, and retailers, BNPL companies can diversify their offerings and reach a wider audience. This approach enables faster adoption of BNPL services while allowing merchants and payment platforms to offer enhanced financial flexibility to consumers.

Over the next few years, strategic partnerships will accelerate the mainstream adoption of BNPL services in Spain. These collaborations will likely drive further innovation in payment solutions, making BNPL an integral part of digital financial ecosystems. However, as these partnerships expand, regulatory scrutiny may increase to ensure transparency, responsible lending, and consumer protection in the evolving BNPL landscape.

Current State of the BNPL Market

Spain's BNPL market has expanded rapidly, fueled by the rise of e-commerce and shifting consumer preferences toward flexible payment solutions. Consumers opt for installment-based payment models over traditional credit cards as online shopping grows.

As competition intensifies, BNPL providers will continue to innovate, offering tailored financing options to attract more users. However, this rapid growth may also prompt regulatory oversight to ensure responsible lending and consumer protection.

Key Players and New Entrants

PayPal: A prominent player in Spain's BNPL sector, offering installment payment solutions to consumers.

Klarna: The Swedish fintech has entered the Spanish market, providing consumers with flexible payment options at the point of sale.

CaixaBank: In collaboration with Apple Pay, CaixaBank has introduced a payment installment service, allowing users to split their purchases into multiple monthly payments.

Recent Launches, Mergers, and Acquisitions

In October 2024, CaixaBank partnered with Apple Pay to introduce a BNPL installment service, reflecting the increasing integration of deferred payment solutions into mainstream financial services. This collaboration allows CaixaBank customers to split their purchases into multiple payments, enhancing convenience and accessibility. Such strategic partnerships highlight the growing demand for BNPL options in Spain and the push by financial institutions to offer more flexible payment solutions.

Outlook

Over the next 2-4 years, Spain's BNPL market is expected to expand, driven by ongoing digitalization and increasing consumer demand for flexible payment options. The competitive landscape will likely intensify as new entrants emerge and existing players enhance their offerings. Strategic partnerships and technological innovations will be key drivers of differentiation among providers.

Regulatory Changes

Currently, BNPL models in Spain fall outside the scope of the consumer credit regime. However, the European Union's Second Consumer Credit Directive (CCD2) aims to bring BNPL services within the regulatory perimeter, subjecting providers to new obligations and standards. This includes requirements for clear disclosure of terms, affordability assessments, and consumer protection measures. The directive is expected to be implemented by 2026, fundamentally changing how BNPL providers engage with the market.
