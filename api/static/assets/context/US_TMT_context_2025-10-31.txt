[TITLE]GigaCloud Technology Inc Announces Planned Acquisition of New Classic Home Furnishings:
[TEXT]
EL MONTE, Calif., Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GigaCloud Technology Inc (Nasdaq: GCT) (“GigaCloud” or the “Company”), a pioneer of global end-to-end B2B technology solutions for large parcel merchandise, today announced its entry into a binding term sheet for the acquisition of 100% of outstanding equity interest of New Classic Home Furnishing, Inc. (“New Classic”) for $18 million.

Headquartered in Fontana, California, New Classic is a profitable U.S.-based furniture distributor with 25 years of history, primarily servicing brick-and-mortar retailers across North America. New Classic generates approximately $70 million in annual revenues by offering a diverse portfolio of over 2,000 active SKUs and servicing over 1,000 retailer customers. The acquisition strategically combines GigaCloud’s ecommerce marketplace and operational expertise with New Classic’s long-standing brick-and-mortar footprint. The acquisition further diversifies the Company’s supply chain, with New Classic sourcing predominantly from the Southeast Asia and the United States, and less than 3% from China.

“This acquisition is a pivotal step in our long-term vision for building a truly channel-agnostic B2B marketplace,” said Larry Wu, Founder and CEO of GigaCloud. “New Classic provides us with an extensive network of valued suppliers and brick-and-mortar retailers, along with deep expertise in the brick-and-mortar segment. This gives us the strategic foundation we need to begin serving these vital retailers with a new level of support and opportunity.

[TITLE]Trump slashes China tariffs after "amazing meeting" with Xi Jinping:
[TEXT]
Washington — President Trump said Thursday he will cut U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after he sat down with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a high-stakes summit in South Korea in the midst of a months-long trade war between the world's two largest economies.

"On the scale from zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12," Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One while flying back to Washington from the South Korean city of Busan. He called his more than 90-minute session with Xi an "amazing meeting" and a "great success."

Mr. Trump told reporters "we have a deal" on trade, saying he expects to sign an agreement "pretty soon," though he's likely to renegotiate it in future years. "A lot of things we brought to finalization" during Thursday's discussions, the president added, calling Xi a "tremendous leader of a very powerful country."

Mr. Trump said he decided to lower his overall tariff rate on imports of Chinese goods from 57% to 47%, after promises by Xi to curtail shipments of fentanyl ingredients to the U.S. Levies of 47% would still leave China with one of the highest tariff rates the U.S. imposes.

He also told reporters China will resume purchasing U.S. soybeans "immediately" after a boycott by China left Americans farmers reeling, and he said a conflict over Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports was "settled." Details on those agreements remain sparse.

Mr. Trump added that he would go to China in April for new talks, and Xi will "be coming here sometime after that, whether it's in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, D.C."

The two leaders met on a South Korean military base at the tail end of an almost weeklong trip through Asia by Mr. Trump.

Prior to the meeting, Mr. Trump said he has a good relationship with Xi "but he's a very tough negotiator. That's not good."

Xi said trade negotiators from both sides have made progress in addressing "major concerns" and he believes the U.S. and China should be "partners and friends."

"Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye-to-eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then," Xi said through an interpreter, though he noted that relations have been "stable on the whole."

China is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, behind only Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. buying $438.9 billion in Chinese goods last year, while China bought $143.5 billion in goods from the U.S. But Mr. Trump has pushed for higher tariffs on Chinese imports, both due to fentanyl trafficking and alleged unfair trade practices, sparking a trade war.

The two sides briefly levied massive tit-for-tat tariffs on each other in April, before delaying those levies to buy time for negotiations. In August, Mr. Trump signed an executive action delaying the reinstatement of higher tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days, extending the pause until mid-November.

U.S. and Chinese officials have been holding trade talks for months leading up to Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting.

Earlier this month, Mr. Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff rate on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 in retaliation for China's increased export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, which would bring total tariffs on Chinese imports as high as 155%. China has the vast majority of the world's supply of those raw materials, critical for manufacturing in key technology areas like semiconductors and missiles. Those extra 100% tariffs are "effectively off the table" for now, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan."

Bessent said he also expects Mr. Trump and Xi to sign a deal Thursday placing TikTok under majority U.S. ownership, although Chinese-owned ByteDance could still have a minority ownership stake of under 20%.

Defense is another point of tension between China and the U.S.

Mr. Trump's first secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he should commit to Taiwan's independence.

"Xi Jinping is expected to press President Trump for clarity about America's stance toward Taiwan at their meeting this week," Pompeo wrote on social media. "America should oblige — and affirm our unequivocal commitment to Taiwan's sovereignty and independence from Beijing."

But on the trip home, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Xi didn't discuss Taiwan.

Separately, moments before the meeting with Xi began, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he's directed the Pentagon to restart nuclear weapons testing. And the president said earlier Wednesday that he will allow South Korea, a rival of China's, to develop a nuclear-powered submarine.

The last time Mr. Trump and Xi met in person was on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan in 2019, during Mr. Trump's first term in office, although the two leaders have spoken by phone. The last conversation the White House disclosed between the two men was on Sept. 19.

Busan, known as an educational and cultural center along Korea's southeastern coast, is the second most populous city in South Korea behind its capital, Seoul. The Xi meeting is the final agenda item on Mr. Trump's schedule for his five-day Asia tour, concluding a trip primarily intended to strengthen economic ties and cement trade deals in the South Pacific region.

[TITLE]Trump-Xi meeting: What’s at stake and who has the upper hand?:
[TEXT]
From tariffs to TikTok, rare-earth metals to fentanyl, a packed agenda awaits the leaders of the US and China, the world’s two largest economies.

United States President Donald Trump expects “a lot of problems” will be solved between Washington and Beijing when he meets China’s President Xi Jinping in South Korea for a high-stakes meeting on Thursday, amid growing trade tensions between the two.

Relations between the two world powers have been strained in recent years, with Washington and Beijing imposing tit-for-tat trade tariffs topping 100 percent against each other this year, the US restricting its exports of semiconductors vital for artificial intelligence (AI) development and Beijing restricting exports of critical rare-earth metals which are vital for the defence industry and also the development of AI, among other issues.

Officials from Washington and Beijing have been locked in trade talks since August to de-escalate trade tensions, and they also came up with a framework for a trade deal during meetings in Malaysia over the weekend.

On the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, on Wednesday, Trump said an expected trade deal between China and the US would be good for both countries and “something very exciting for everybody”.

But only a meeting between Trump and Xi can confirm if a trade deal is really in the making.

Expectations for the agreement are modest, with analysts expecting the two world powers to continue to clash over their myriad differences long-term.

When are the two leaders meeting?

Trump is scheduled to meet Xi on Thursday in the port city of Busan in southeastern South Korea. The meeting is expected to start at 11am local time (01:00 GMT).

It will be the first time the leaders have met in person since Trump returned to the White House in January.

The US president last met Xi in 2019, during Trump’s first term, on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Osaka, Japan.

“I think we’re going to have a great meeting with President Xi of China, and a lot of problems are going to be solved,” Trump told journalists on Wednesday on Air Force One while en route to South Korea.

On Wednesday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the meeting between Xi and Trump in a statement and said the leaders “will exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest”.

What will Trump and Xi talk about?

Discussions are likely to cover:

Trade tariffs

Trafficking of fentanyl, a drug responsible for tens of thousands of deaths in the US each year

China’s export controls on critical rare-earth metals and its purchase of US soya beans

US export controls on semiconductors

Geopolitical and security issues, particularly Russia’s war in Ukraine and Washington’s position on Taiwan

Port fees on Chinese ships docking in US ports

Finalising a deal to buy TikTok, the social media platform, from its Chinese owners

Alejandro Reyes, adjunct professor at the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera that at this meeting, both sides will want to steady an uneasy rivalry – but for different reasons.

“For Washington, the goal is to show that its tough line on China has delivered results. The Trump team is walking into this summit after signing trade pacts with Malaysia, Cambodia and Japan that link market access directly to national security cooperation. These deals require America’s partners to align with US export controls and supply-chain rules – essentially making ‘economic security’ a shared obligation,” he said.

“For Beijing, the priority is to project calm and endurance. The meeting comes just after the fourth plenum, which reaffirmed Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s authority and set the direction for the next five-year plan. China’s message is that it has weathered Western pressure and is back to focusing on growth and domestic stability,” he added.

But discussions on disputes over trade tariffs, critical rare-earth metals, AI technology and geopolitical strategies, the issues that most define the current relationship between the US and China, according to Reyes, are not going to be easy to resolve.

“The mistrust is structural now – it’s built into how both countries think

[TITLE]Chinese controls on rare earths could create challenges for the west’s plans for green tech:
[TEXT]
China recently announced that it was putting new controls on the export of rare earth elements, sparking a new round in the country’s ongoing trade war with the US.

Donald Trump responded by threatening to ramp up tariffs on Chinese goods by a further 100%. This was under discussion when China’s president Xi Jinping and Trump met on October 30 at the Asia Pacific Economic Conference in South Korea.

Trump and Xi now say they have come an agreement over access to China’s valuable rare earths, but details of what this entails are not yet clear. But it was clear it was important for the US president to walk away with some agreement on this vital component of green tech.

China has built an effective monopoly over rare earth metals, the 17 metallic elements that are not actually rare but are very difficult to mine and process. Most electric vehicles (EVs), smartphones or solar panels depend on these rare earths.

China mines 70% and refines 92% of these increasingly important metals, and manufactures 98% of the world’s rare earth magnets used in EVs, electronics, medical devices and other clean tech. In recent years, these essential minerals have become a crucial part of China’s economic agenda as it tries to focus on “high quality development” in advanced and green technology

The recent announcement from Beijing has raised concerns

[TITLE]Imagine to freeze broadband prices for five years:
[TEXT]

Broadband provider Imagine has committed to freezing prices for its customers for five years, as part of a new strategy to increase its reach in the market.

The telecommunications company, which has 35,000 customers throughout the country, said the price freeze would apply to all fibre customers and would last until 2030.

The most recent data from ComReg shows customers are increasingly opting for high-speed fibre broadband connections, with almost 1 million lines active as of the second quarter. That was a 5 per cent increase on the previous quarter and up 25 per cent year on year.

Imagine, which has Armenian owners, said its decision to freeze prices could save customers more than €1,200 when compared with other providers, based on a standard fibre 500MB plan and over a five-year period.

Imagine said it was taking a different approach to the industry trend of offering short-term deals that resulted in significant price hikes once the promotion had expired, along with inflation-linked price rises each year.

Imagine said research from Ipsos B&A indicated the majority of Irish customers - 79 per cent - found price hikes stressful, with 75 per cent saying they had no choice but to constantly change providers.

“We want to reimagine what broadband can be in Ireland and give customers a real alternative that is fair, honest, and free from the usual tricks,” said Niall Tallon, chief executive of Imagine.

“Nobody wants to deal with annual inflationary price hikes or switching when short-term offers expire. People want price stability and simple, no-nonsense high-speed connectivity.”

Mr Tallon said the company was rewarding loyalty, while also allowing customers who

[TITLE]Cable Billionaire John Malone To Step Down As Chair Of Liberty Empire:
[TEXT]
John Malone, the billionaire cable-TV mogul, is stepping aside as chairman of two major companies in his media and telecommunications empire, part of the continued winding down of his role as a master architect of some of the most significant media and cable deals of the last half-century.

Malone, 84, will cede his position as chair of Liberty Global effective Jan. 1 and will be succeeded by the company’s Chief Executive Officer Mike Fries, according to a statement on Wednesday. Malone is also turning over the chairmanship of Liberty Media to Robert Bennett, who was a previous CEO of the company.

“Serving as Chairman of Liberty Global over the past 20 years has been a tremendous journey,” Malone said in the statement. “From our early investments to the creation of Liberty Global and the many chapters that followed, the return to long-term shareholders has been outstanding — and getting there has been, like the industry itself, never dull and a lot of fun.”

Malone will stay on as chairman emeritus of both companies. He will continue to manage his personal venture capital portfolio and retain his stake in the Atlanta Braves baseball team. He is also still chairman of GCI Liberty Inc., an Alaskan phone company.

Nicknamed the “Cable Cowboy,” and the ringleader of the “cable Cosa Nostra,” Malone rescued Tele-Communications Inc. from near bankruptcy in the 1970s and transformed it into a dominant force in the early days of cable and broadband. By 1993, TCI had cornered

[TITLE]Nvidia is officially the world’s first $5 trillion company. CEO Jensen Huang says it’s on track for ‘half a trillion dollars’ in revenue:
[TEXT]
Nvidia made history Wednesday, becoming the world’s first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization as shares surged more than 3% in early trading. The milestone cements the chipmaker’s position as the most valuable company globally, pulling ahead of Microsoft and Apple, which are each valued at approximately $4 trillion.​

The surge followed remarks from CEO Jensen Huang at the company’s GTC developer conference in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, where he disclosed Nvidia has secured more than $500 billion in orders for its AI chips through the end of 2026. The announcement represents what Huang described as unprecedented visibility into future revenue for a technology company.​

“I think we are probably the first technology company in history to have visibility into half a trillion dollars [in revenue],” Huang said, referring to orders for the company’s current Blackwell generation and upcoming Rubin chips scheduled to launch next year.​

The potential for expanded access to China’s market added momentum to Wednesday’s gains. President Donald Trump said aboard Air Force One he planned to discuss Nvidia’s Blackwell chip with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting Thursday in Busan, South Korea. Trump praised the Blackwell processor as “super-duper” and said it is “probably 10 years ahead of any other chip.”

The discussion carries significant implications for Nvidia, which has been effectively locked out of China—previously one of its largest markets—owing to U.S. export controls and Chinese government restrictions. Huang confirmed earlier in October the company’s market share in China had fallen from 95% to zero. The loss has cost Nvidia billions in revenue, with the company reporting only $2.8 billion from China in its most recent quarter, down from $15.5 billion in the prior period.​

Nvidia had been operating under a proposed arrangement in which it would share 15% of revenue from sales of its H20 chip—a less powerful processor designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions—with the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses. However, the company said in August the agreement had not been formalized, and no H20 chips have been shipped to China under the framework.​

During Tuesday’s conference, Huang also announced Nvidia is manufacturing its Blackwell GPUs in full production at a facility in Arizona, a move he attributed to Trump’s push to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. The company revealed it has shipped 6 million Blackwell chips over the past four quarters and expects to deliver an additional 14 million units over the next five quarters.​

Nvidia unveiled partnerships with Nokia, investing $1 billion to develop telecommunications equipment incorporating its chips for 5G and 6G networks. The company also announced plans to collaborate with Oracle on building seven supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy, with the largest system featuring 100,000 Blackwell AI chips.​

Huang emphasized capital spending by major cloud computing companies—Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and CoreWeave—is projected to reach $632 billion by 2027. Morgan Stanley analysts estimated total hyperscaler capital expenditures would grow 24% next year to nearly $550 billion, while Citi analysts raised their forecast to $490 billion for 2026, up from an earlier estimate of $420 billion.​

Nvidia reached the $5 trillion threshold just three months after becoming the first company to hit $4 trillion, in July. The chipmaker’s ascent has been swift: It crossed $1 trillion in June 2023, $2 trillion in February 2024, and $3 trillion in June 2024. The company was valued at approximately $400 billion before the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022.​

The stock has risen more than 50% in 2025 alone, adding more than $400 billion in market capitalization across just two trading days. Nvidia’s shares closed above $200 on Tuesday for the first time before climbing further Wednesday morning.​

Nvidia’s dominance stems from its graphics processing units, which are essential for training and running large language models used in artificial intelligence. The company controls an estimated 90% market share of AI chips used to build server farms that power the AI systems of Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, OpenAI, and other major technology companies.​

Apple and Microsoft followed Nvidia into the $4 trillion club this week. Apple reached the milestone Tuesday after strong demand for its iPhone 17 models, while Microsoft’s valuation also crossed $4 trillion following news of its stake in a restructured OpenAI.
