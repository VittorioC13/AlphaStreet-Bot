[TITLE]Share Market Today highlights 8 October 2025: Markets end lower as IT outshines amid pre-earnings caution; Gold hits historic high:
[TEXT]
* * Increased macro concerns keeping enterprise clients to remain cautious on spends

* Expect Midcap IT cos to post healthy QoQ sales growth

* * Sector valuations will remain under check and range bound in the near-medium term

Mumbai, October 6, 2025 — Financial services firm Equirus Securities has released a press note detailing a preview of Q2FY26 earnings of the IT sector. As per the press note, the Top-6 large IT companies are likely to report CC US$ Sales growth of 0% to 2.1% QoQ in Q2 (expect LTI Mindtree & Infosys at close to upper end and Wipro IT Services close to lower end). The midcap IT companies are expected to post healthy QoQ sales growth in Coforge, Persistent Systems, R-Systems and eClerx.

The heightened macroeconomic concerns that started in March 2025 has been keeping enterprise clients to remain cautious on incremental Tech led Services spend. But, at the same time demand trends are stable QoQ in Q2. Hence, with likely conversion of increasing deal wins (on cost-take-out side) into revenues, Equirus Securities expect most of the large caps to show some improvement in QoQ CC US$ sales growth rates in Q2 vs Q1FY26. Good execution on EBITM is likely to continue in 2Q with QoQ dip of 36bps (for Wipro IT Services) to increase of 71bps in top-6 large caps considering tailwinds from currency benefits (INR/US$ depreciated by nearly 3% QoQ in Q2 on an average for most companies) and benign supply-side issues, cost optimisation and productivity led gains.

Expect higher QoQ Sales growth in most of Top 6 large caps in 2Q vs. 1Q

Equirus Securities expect top 6 large caps to register QoQ growth of flat to 2.1% in US$ Sales in CC terms in 2QFY26E. A marginally positive impact of 2-28 bps QoQ is expected from cross currency tailwinds across most of the top 6 large caps in Q2. The sales performance will likely be healthy from some of the midcap companies incl. Coforge, Persistent Systems, R-Systems and eClerx with expected US$ Sales growth in the range of 3.6% to 5.8% QoQ (Persistent Systems at the lower end and Coforge at the upper end) in CC terms. Equirus Securities expect CC US$ Sales growth to remain tepid in most the ER&D companies (led by soft demand continuing in Mobility/Auto) with LTTS to lead with expected 1.6% CC QoQ growth in US$ Sales in Q2.

Demand commentary likely to remain cautious

Equirus Securities expects demand commentary to remain cautious (unless some certainty relating to tariff related issues emerges ahead). However, it believes vendors are still witnessing better demand tailwinds in BFSI. For 2QFY26E, they expect mix trends on deal TCV (on Qoq basis). Key thing to watch will be management commentary regarding deal pipeline and any further delays in decision-making regarding deal awards and start/ramp up of earlier won deals.

Expect some tweak in Infosys’s FY26E Sales growth guidance

Equirus Securities expects Infosys to guide for 2.0-3.0% CC growth in US$ Sales (vs. current growth guidance of 1-3%; inorganic growth contribution from Versent Group unlikely to be factored into growth guidance given its pending closure) with no change in its EBITM guidance of 20-22% for FY26E. Equirus Securities expects no change in HCL Tech’s CC US$ Sales growth guidance of 3-5% (c.2-4% Organic) both for Services & Consol. US$ Sales with no change in its Consol. EBITM guidance of 17-18% for FY26E. The research house expects Wipro to guide for (-) 0.5% to (+) 1.5% QoQ growth in IT Services US$ Sales for 3QFY26E in CC terms.

Remain selective

Equirus Securities recommends remaining selective and prefer Infosys/Tech Mahindra amongst large caps and prefer Mphasis/Zensar/KPIT/eClerx amongst midcaps on a relative basis

[TITLE]Banning controversy reveals Bluesky’s federation isn’t there yet:
[TEXT]
When it launched in 2023 in private beta, Bluesky was pitched as a different kind of social network, one that placed openness and user-friendliness at its core. It came along at just the right moment as Elon Musk’s purchase and takeover of Twitter led millions of users head toward any type of exit.

The initial destination for many was Mastodon, but its Linux geek ethos and system of numerous “federated” servers that communicate via the open-source ActivityPub protocol proved to be too complicated for people who just wanted to crack jokes. Acting on the opportunity, Bluesky opened up to the public in February 2024 and saw a rapid influx of users.

[TITLE]What’s up with… Verizon, Ericsson, Telia:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Verizon’s lead director replaces Hans Vestberg as CEO; Ericsson deploys private 5G networks in Germany and France for Airbus, with more in the pipeline; Telia gets its ticket stamped by Swedish train operator SJ; and much more!

Verizon has unexpectedly replaced its CEO of more than seven years, Hans Verstberg, with immediate effect. His replacement is the telco’s independent lead director Dan Schulman, the former CEO of PayPal who has been a member of the US telco’s board since 2018. Mark Bertolini, who has taken over from Vestberg as chairman of the Verizon board, noted: “The board is thrilled to have Dan as Verizon’s next CEO and embark on a new chapter of growth and sector leadership. Dan is a seasoned and decisive leader with a unique set of experiences and a proven record of transformative leadership and operational excellence. He is the right leader to chart Verizon’s next phase of increased customer focus and financial growth,” which is something the new CEO knows about. During his tenure as PayPal’s CEO, Schulman grew the global payments platform’s annual revenues from $8bn to $30bn. Vestberg, meanwhile, will serve as “special advisor” for the next year, during which time he will be “focused on ensuring a smooth transition” and help to manage the integration of Frontier Communications, the broadband network operator that Verizon is acquiring for $20bn – that M&A deal is set to close during the first quarter of 2026. “Hans Vestberg has been an extraordinary leader for Verizon, leading a new era of network investment and creating an innovative culture,” noted Bertolini. “Our company is better for his passion and vision. Having created a network that is unmatched and with the upcoming close of the Frontier transaction, the board and Hans discussed that now is the right time for a CEO transition. On behalf of the entire board, we thank Hans for his outstanding service to all of Verizon’s stakeholders.” As you’d expect, Shulman, who has previously also worked at AT&T and Virgin Mobile US, is pumped

[TITLE]What’s up with… Deutsche Telekom, 6G R&D, AMD and OpenAI:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Deutsche Telekom claims eSIM swap breakthrough in Europe and expands its lineup of smartphones with integrated AI; the Netherlands gets a National 6G Testbed; AMD becomes a “major AI player” as a result of its deal with OpenAI, reckons analyst; and much more!

Deutsche Telekom has announced what it claims to be a first for Europe: The ability for a network operator to transfer embedded SIM (eSIM) profiles between devices with different mobile operating systems, namely Android and Apple iOS. The operator noted that it has been offering eSIM transfer between iOS devices since 2020, and between Android devices since 2023. Now, it is also possible to switch between Android and iOS devices – and vice versa, it said. In this process, the existing profile is transferred, meaning that the phone number and tariff remain the same. Michael Hagspihl, VP of global strategic projects and marketing partnerships at Deutsche Telekom, said the aim is to make it “easier than ever for our customers to switch devices. Simple, flexible, and secure – that is our goal”. The service is initially available for iPhones with software version iOS 26 and Google Pixel 10 devices. More Android models will follow soon, according to the operator. While initially available in Germany, the service will also be provided in other Deutsche Telekom territories in future. The new function is based on the international GSMA specification TS.43, which defines the standardised procedure for service entitlement configuration on devices during activation or verification, and on the entitlement server developed by Deutsche Telekom. This server checks the authorisations, controls the secure process and enables Deutsche Telekom to react quickly to new functions and innovations. For more details, see this Deutsche Telekom announcement. The operator’s move is certainly timely as eSIMs are growing in significance, not least because Apple is phasing out physical SIM cards in favour of the digital versions in certain markets. For example, it released US-exclusive, eSIM-only iPhone 14 models in 2022, and has now launched the more widely available ultra-thin iPhone Air model that also only comes with eSIM. Given these developments, expectations are that the global market for devices supporting eSIM and related technologies is set for “hyper growth” from now until 2028. According to a 2024 report from Counterpoint Research, shipments will surpass 9 billion between 2024 and 2030.

Still with Deutsche Telekom… The German giant is also on a drive to make AI “accessible to everyone – not just tech nerds or enthusiasts”, and has been quick to expand its new lineup of smartphones with integrated AI from one to two, with a focus this time on a device with greater functionality as part of its “T Phone Pro” lineup. After unveiling the first AI-phone (the T Phone 3) in August, Deutsche Telekom has now announced that the AI-phone Pro (T Phone 3 Pro) will be available from 14 October in Germany, as well as Austria, Croatia, Czechia, Greece, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Sales will start in North Macedonia from 20 October and in Montenegro from 23 October. Although more expensive than the earlier device, the AI-phone Pro still retails at a relatively affordable (for a smartphone) €229 without subscription, although prices vary by country. Like the first device, it also integrates generative AI (GenAI) capabilities from AI tech partner Perplexity. The price includes permanent access to the Perplexity Assistant application and free access to the more advanced Perplexity Pro for 18 months from the date of purchase. In addition, customers are offered a 12-month Picsart Pro licence with 500 additional credits per month for the design of individual avatars and backgrounds. According to the operator, the Pro version generally offers “better hardware, extended functions and a strong eco rating” (88/100, apparently). Meanwhile, the companion AI-tablet device (the T Tablet 2) is still available, and is priced at €199 in Germany, for example. Deutsche Telekom has now been plugging these devices for going on for two years and showed off a prototype at this year’s MWC25 event in Barcelona in March. For more details, see this Deutsche Telekom announcement.

We are more than half way through the 5G decade, and operators and vendors are already furiously at work on the next generation of mobile technology, known to all and sundry as 6G (why change a winning formula). The Netherlands is now getting fully on board with the official launch of a National 6G Testbed, which aims to offer Dutch SMEs and startups the “opportunity to develop, test and validate 6G applications under realistic conditions” before 6G is commercially available. The testbed is said to incorporate the latest mobile communications infrastructure and is implemented across a network of five regional 6G field labs in Amersfoort, Delft, Eindhoven, Groningen and The Hague.

[TITLE]Reading the ENISA Threat Landscape 2025 report:
[TEXT]
Reading the ENISA Threat Landscape 2025 report

Pierluigi Paganini October 06, 2025 October 06, 2025

ENISA Threat Landscape 2025: Rising ransomware, AI phishing, and state-backed espionage mark a converging, persistent EU cyber threat landscape.

ENISA Threat Landscape 2025 report provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolving threat landscape in Europe. The report analyzes the events that occurred between July 2024 and June 2025, including nearly 4,900 verified incidents. This year’s edition combines technical depth with strategic insights.

The report emphasizes how the threat landscape is maturing, characterized by the rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities, the professionalization of cybercrime, and the increasing convergence between criminal, state-aligned, and hacktivist operations.

“In parallel, hacktivist tooling and criminal ecosystems increasingly intersect. FunkSec’s emergence in late 2024 brought FunkLocker ransomware, blending political messaging with financial extortion, underscoring how quickly ideology-driven branding can pivot to monetisation.” reads the report. “Hacktivists, seeking funding and visibility, embraced ransomware beyond DDoS and defacements. CyberVolk, operating in line with Russian interests, has used and promoted multiple strains—AzzaSec, HexaLocker, Parano, as well as LockBit and Chaos—since May 2024. KillSec, originally a pro-Russia hacktivist brand aligned with Anonymous, debuted its platform in June 2024.”

Ransomware continues to be one of the most dangerous threats, it represents the most disruptive and economically damaging activity across the EU. ENISA notes that ransomware groups have decentralized operations following major law enforcement actions, adopting aggressive double- and triple-extortion tactics and exploiting regulatory compliance fears to pressure victims.

The growth of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), public leaks of builder tools, and the rise of access brokers have dramatically lowered barriers to entry, fostering a diverse and resilient criminal marketplace.

State-sponsored and state-aligned actors have simultaneously escalated long-term cyber-espionage campaigns, particularly targeting telecommunications, logistics networks, and manufacturing sectors within the EU. These operations showcase advanced tradecraft, including supply-chain compromises, modular malware, and abuse of signed drivers to maintain persistence and evade detection.

A striking element of the report is the dominance of hacktivist operations, which account for almost 80% of all recorded incidents. These are primarily low-impact Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) campaigns motivated by ideology or geopolitics, often leveraging low-cost, easily available tools. While their direct impact remains limited, their scale demonstrates how cyber operations have become instruments of digital protest and influence.

From a sectoral perspective, public administration remains the most frequently targeted (38% of cases), followed by transport, where maritime and logistics infrastructure have faced significant disruption from both ransomware and espionage campaigns. Aviation and freight operations also experienced incidents affecting continuity, while digital infrastructure and online services continue to attract attention from both ransomware operators and espionage actors.

Phishing remains the primary intrusion vector (60%), evolving toward industrialized, subscription-based models such as Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS). These platforms enable even low-skilled adversaries to conduct sophisticated campaigns, leveraging AI-generated content, synthetic media, and automation. Meanwhile, vulnerability exploitation (21.3%) remains a cornerstone of initial access, with adversaries often weaponizing newly disclosed flaws within days. ENISA stresses the urgency of timely patching and robust cyber hygiene as key defense measures.

A growing concern highlighted in the report is the role of Artificial Intelligence. By early 2025, AI-assisted phishing and social engineering accounted for over 80% of observed global activity in this category. Attackers are exploiting jailbroken AI models, synthetic voice and video content, and model poisoning to automate reconnaissance, impersonation, and influence operations, making detection and attribution increasingly difficult.

“As a predictable trend, Large Language Models (LLMs) are leveraged to craft more convincing phishing

emails; with reportedly over 80% of all phishing emails identified between September 2024 and February

2025 using AI to some extent. AI is notably used in vishing and online fraud involving impersonation, with the use of deepfakes, as well as for malware development.” continues the report. “Threat groups were observed to be leveraging commercial LLMs to augment operations, as well as jailbroken or retrained (diverted) LLMs such as WormGPT, EscapeGPT and FraudGPT, to automate social engineering activities and accelerate the development of malicious tools.”

Overall, the ENISA Threat Landscape 2025 describes a convergent and persistent threat environment, one where traditional distinctions between cybercrime, espionage, and hacktivism are increasingly blurred. Rather than single high-impact attacks, Europe now faces continuous, diversified, and overlapping campaigns that collectively erode resilience and trust.

ENISA concludes by urging EU Member States and organizations to prioritize cross-sector collaboration, enhance situational awareness, and embed resilience through improved vulnerability management, threat intelligence sharing, and investment in cybersecurity capacity building. The report paints a clear picture: the European threat landscape is no longer defined by isolated incidents, but by a constant, adaptive pressure on digital infrastructure and society as a whole.

[TITLE]IKEA Acquires Logistics Firm Locus As Online Sales Jump:

IKEA has acquired logistics tech company Locus to capitalize on growing online sales.

Ingka Group, the largest IKEA retailer, announced the deal Tuesday (Oct. 6), calling an investment to strengthen the furniture retailer’s digital capabilities.

“In today’s retail landscape, customers expect a seamless home delivery, taking the complex digital systems that make it possible for granted,” the company said in a news release.

“Historically, IKEA has relied on multiple third-party providers for these essential services. The acquisition of Locus represents a significant move by Ingka Group towards making shopping and delivery even smoother for its customers.”

According to the release, Locus offers an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered logistics management platform, featuring “advanced route optimization,” real-time tracking, along with the “smart use of vehicles and resources.”

By integrating these capabilities, Locus will help IKEA improve efficiency on its supply chain, strengthen how the company delivers home furnishings and support its effort to create a faster and smarter distribution network.

The release notes that the deal is happening at a crucial time, as online sales made up 28% of IKEA’s total retail sales during its 2024 fiscal year, up from 11% five years earlier.

“The integration of Locus’s technology will further strengthen IKEA’s ability to meet this growth, complementing earlier strategic technology investments such as Made4net, which will help enhance the company’s warehouse management, and TaskRabbit, which expanded furniture assembly services,” the release added.

A report on the deal by Reuters noted that the acquisition follows last week’s purchase by IKEA of a $213 million property in Manhattan, underscoring the company’s commitment to U.S. growth in spite of ongoing tariff-related pressures.

“In terms of the macroeconomics around us … probably there’s uncertainty in the quarters ahead,” Parag Parekh, chief digital officer at Ingka Group, told Reuters. “But as a company we remain committed to the U.S.”

Last month, IKEA formed a partnership with Best Buy as it looks to use space inside other locations to boost its customer base in “mature” markets in the United States and Europe.

Tolga Öncü, retail manager at Ingka, told the Financial Times this is part of an experiment to expand IKEA’s presence in a way that’s quicker than simply opening new stores.

Öncü added that the Best Buy partnership would bring IKEA “closer to more of the many people” in the U.S. and could be “yet another component for us to accelerate our reach, especially in big mature countries.”

Tilly Norwood officially launched her acting career this month at the Zurich Film Festival.

She first appeared in the short film AI Commissioner, released in July. Her producer, Eline Van der Velden, claims Norwood has already attracted the attention of multiple agents.

But Norwood was generated with artificial intelligence (AI). The AI “actor” has been created by Xicoia, the AI branch of the production company Particle6, founded by the Dutch actor-turned-producer Ven der Velden. And AI Commissioner is an AI-generated short film, written by ChatGPT.
