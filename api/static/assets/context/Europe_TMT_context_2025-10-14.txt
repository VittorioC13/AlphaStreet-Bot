[TITLE]China’s rare earth power play: New export curb strangles tech and defense supply chains – NaturalNews.com:
[TEXT]
China’s rare earth power play: New export curb strangles tech and defense supply chains

China has intensified export controls on critical rare earth minerals—key to defense, tech and green energy—amid rising global tensions, leveraging its market dominance as a geopolitical tool ahead of a high-stakes U.S.-China meeting.

China's strategic export restrictions on critical minerals—timed ahead of key diplomatic talks—aim to assert geopolitical dominance by disrupting Western defense and tech supply chains amid escalating tensions over Taiwan.

The U.S. is accelerating domestic rare earth production—reviving projects like Alaska's mines—to counter China's export restrictions and reduce vulnerability in critical supply chains amid rising geopolitical tensions.

China's recent restrictions on rare earth exports have exposed critical Western vulnerabilities, forcing the U.S. and EU to urgently seek alternatives—like recycling or deep-sea mining—to reduce reliance on Beijing amid national security and green energy concerns.

Escalating geopolitical tensions and China's dominance in rare earth supplies are pushing the West to decide between securing its own resource independence or risking long-term vulnerability in global stability.

China has quietly expanded its export restrictions on rare earth minerals—a critical resource for defense, electronics and green energy technologies—just days before an anticipated meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

The move, which targets key industries including semiconductors and military hardware, marks Beijing's latest leveraging of its near-monopoly over these essential materials, sending ripples through global supply chains and raising alarms in Washington, Taipei and Brussels.

China's control over the production of rare earth elements is a multifaceted strategy that extends beyond environmental concerns to encompass global economic and political influence, according to Brighteon.AI's Enoch engine.

The new controls, reported by several news outlets, impose stricter licensing requirements and export quotas on rare earth elements like neodymium and dysprosium—vital for everything from F-35 fighter jets to electric vehicle batteries.

Analysts warn this is not merely an economic maneuver but a deliberate escalation in China's broader strategy to assert dominance over Western and allied nations.

The timing, ahead of high-stakes diplomatic talks, suggests Beijing is signaling its ability to disrupt industries that rely on these minerals, from U.S. defense contractors to European chipmakers.

Global supply chains under threat

The restrictions come as Taiwan bolsters its missile defenses amid rising tensions with China, while the U.S. scrambles to secure alternative rare earth sources, including revived mining projects in Alaska.

The Trump administration had previously fast-tracked domestic rare earth production to reduce dependence on China, a move now vindicated by Beijing's latest export clampdown.

Meanwhile, Russia's provocative military flights near Alaska and Iran's collapse of nuclear negotiations with the West underscore a world edging toward multipolar conflict—where control over critical resources like rare earths could decide the balance of power.

With China supplying over 80 percent of the world's rare earths, the new export rules expose the fragility of Western industrial and military infrastructure. The U.S. Department of War has already flagged rare earth shortages as a national security risk, while European policymakers grapple with how to decouple from Chinese dominance without crippling their green energy transitions.

Some experts argue this moment could accelerate investment in recycling technologies or deep-sea mining, but such solutions remain years away from scaling.

China's latest move is a stark reminder that economic interdependence can be weaponized overnight.

As geopolitical fault lines deepen—from Taiwan's missile buildup to Russia's Arctic posturing—the rare earth squeeze forces a reckoning: Will the West finally prioritize resource sovereignty, or will it remain vulnerable to Beijing's resource diplomacy? The answer may shape not just industries, but the very stability of the 21st-century world order.

Watch the Health Ranger Mike Adams as he explains how China controls the key rare earth needed to scale up robot production.

[TITLE]The World’s Chip Supply Chain Is Bracing for Fallout From China’s Rare-Earth Curbs:
[TEXT]
Businesses across the global semiconductor supply chain are bracing themselves for disruptions from an escalating trade war, after China imposed curbs on rare-earth mineral exports and the US responded with additional tariffs and restrictions on software sales to the Asian nation.

China’s restrictions, the most targeted move yet to limit supplies of rare-earth materials, represent the first major attempt by Beijing to exercise long-arm jurisdiction over foreign companies to target the semiconductor industry, threatening to stall the chips powering the AI boom. They prompted US President Donald Trump to announce on Friday that he would impose an additional 100% tariff on China and export controls on “any and all critical software.”

The rare-earth curbs may lead to weekslong delays in shipments for ASML Holding NV, the only manufacturer in the world of machines that make the most advanced semiconductors, a person familiar with the company said.

A senior manager at a major US chip company said the firm is still assessing potential impacts. But the clearest risk the company is facing now is an increase in the prices of rare earth-dependent magnets that are critical to the chip supply chain, this person said, asking not to be identified discussing operations.

An official at another US chip company said the business is rushing to identify which of its products contain rare earths from China and is worried that the country’s requirement for licenses will grind its supply chain to a halt.

It’s not clear what software products from the US might be hit by Trump’s latest proposed export ban. In July, the administration lifted export license requirements for chip-design software sales, rules that had been imposed in May as part of a raft of measures responding to Beijing’s earlier limits on shipments of essential rare earths.

China’s new rules require overseas firms to seek approval for shipping any material containing even trace amounts of Chinese rare earths — and explicitly call out parts used to make certain computer chips and advance AI research with military applications.

“These are the strictest export controls that China has utilized,” said Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals-focused director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It’s quite clear that they have the sticks and the leverage to make, not just US firms, but firms worldwide comply.”

Chipmaking machines, like those sold by ASML and Applied Materials Inc., are especially dependent on rare earths because they contain extremely precise lasers, magnets and other equipment that use these elements.

ASML is preparing for disruptions, particularly due to a clause that requires foreign firms to seek China’s approval for reexports of products containing its rare earths, said the person familiar with ASML, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters and noted that ASML is lobbying Dutch and US allies for alternatives. The company declined to comment.

“Within the semiconductor value chain, China’s new export controls will likely most impact chipmakers that use rare-earth-based chemicals during the chip fabrication process and toolmakers that integrate rare-earth magnets into their equipment,” said Jacob Feldgoise, senior data research analyst at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.

Some have questioned how long the restrictions will last, viewing them as potential posturing ahead of a trip to Asia Trump had planned that was expected to include a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month. It’s unclear how China would even track rare earths at such discrete levels to enforce the rules.

But China’s move has instead escalated tensions with the US. Trump’s announced tariffs would raise import taxes on many Chinese goods to 130% starting next month. That would be just below the 145% level imposed earlier this year, before both countries ratcheted down the levies in a truce to advance trade talks. On Friday, Trump also threatened to call off his meeting with Xi altogether, describing the new rare-earth controls as a “hostile” action.

“I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

This isn’t the first time that rare earths have landed in the center of US-China trade wars. After Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese imports earlier this year, China’s government responded by cutting off mineral exports to US companies. Officials from both sides had agreed to a truce in the spring, under which Trump lowered duties and Xi’s officials agreed to resume the flow of the minerals.

The world’s biggest chipmakers, including Intel Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., rely on ASML to produce semiconductors. Samsung and Intel declined to comment. TSMC didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A White House official said the government and relevant agencies are assessing any impact from the new rules, which were announced without notice and imposed in an apparent effort to exert control over the entire world’s technology supply chains.

The US House Select Committee on China panned the Asian nation for the move, describing the restrictions as “an economic declaration of war against the US.” Committee Chairman John Moolenaar, a Republican, said in a statement on Thursday that China has “fired a loaded gun at the American economy.”

Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, has already introduced measures to diversify its supply of raw materials, and its economic ministry called China’s curbs a “great concern” on Friday. The government said it’s in close contact with affected companies and the European Commission to respond.

Taiwan relies mainly on Europe, the US and Japan for rare-earth supplies. “We still need further assessment before deciding on the impact” on the chip industry, the nation’s economic affairs ministry said in a statement. “We will continue to monitor indirect impact from fluctuations in the pricing of raw materials and supply chain adjustments.”

[TITLE]Nexperia: Dutch government takes control of China-owned chip firm:
[TEXT]
In December 2024, the US government placed Wingtech on its so-called "entity list", identifying the company as a national security concern.

Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval.

In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport, after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport.

The Dutch Economic Ministry said it made the "highly exceptional" decision to invoke the Goods Availability Act over "acute signals of serious governance shortcomings" within Nexperia.

"These signals posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities," the ministry said in a statement.

"Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security."

The statement did not detail why it thought the firm's operations were risky. A spokesperson for the minister of economic affairs told the BBC there was no further information to share.

The measures are aimed to keep European chip supplies flowing and protect Dutch intellectual property, said EU-China researcher Sacha Courtial.

In a crisis, a Chinese-owned company could come under pressure from Beijing to halt supplies or prioritise sales to China, crippling European industries like carmakers and electronics manufacturers, he said.

The Hague's move puts economic security "over free-market investment principles", in what could pave the way for other governments to follow, said Mr Courtial from the Jacques Delors Institute.

The China Semiconductor Industry Association said on Tuesday that it is "seriously concerned" about the Dutch government taking control of Nexperia.

The group described the measures as "selective and discriminatory" against overseas branches of Chinese enterprises and undermine open trade.

[TITLE]China and the US are in a race for critical minerals. African countries need to make the rules:
[TEXT]
Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are essential for modern technologies. They are key to industries ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy, defence, and aerospace systems.

The global demand for these minerals has been growing, as has the competition for them.

The supply and production of these minerals is largely concentrated in the global South. Most of the world’s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It produces almost three-quarters of the global cobalt output. Australia produces nearly half of the world’s lithium. Chile accounts for another quarter of global lithium production, with China following at 18%.

China dominates the supply chain through massive investments in mining operations, particularly in Africa. It is responsible for refining 90% of rare earth elements and graphite, and 60-70% of lithium and cobalt. The United States and European Union — long-term trading partners with African nations — have also adopted policies to secure access to Africa’s resources.

The question is what African countries are doing to take advantage of this demand for these critical minerals, especially to drive their own development.

As development researchers we address this question in a special publication on the rising significance of critical minerals in Africa by the Indian Council of World Affairs. In another publication, we look at how emerging resource diplomacy may reinforce Africa’s position in the global economy as a mere source of raw materials.

We recommend that African countries determine for themselves how to benefit from this global competition. This includes developing national strategies that emphasise local value addition and benefits. Also, national strategies should begin positioning African countries to gain from their resources beyond value addition.

The competition for Africa’s critical minerals underscores the urgency of governance reforms and regional cooperation to transform mineral wealth into sustainable prosperity, avoiding another “resource curse.”

The emerging ‘New World Order’

A Chinese-led ‘New World Order’ is emerging to counter the US-led Western influence. Eastern and global South countries demonstrate this shift through groupings like BRICS and South-South cooperation in technology and development. China has strengthened its influence in the global South through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.

Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious infrastructure project that connects continents by land and sea. Since then, over 200 agreements have been signed with over 150 countries and 30 international organisations. The initiative has expanded China’s access to resources. This is often in exchange for infrastructure development that links mining regions to ports.

In Africa, China has invested heavily in mining and infrastructure. Its firms have spent

[TITLE]Orange lands first Medusa subsea cable in Marseille:
[TEXT]
Telco Orange has revealed the first landing on European soil of the Medusa undersea cable system, designed to transform infrastructure in the Mediterranean region.

Owned by African infrastructure and telecoms operator AFR-IX Telecom, the Medusa Submarine Cable System is 8,760km long, and will be the first and longest subsea cable to connect the main Mediterranean countries, providing access to telecommunications infrastructure and 16 landing points around the Mediterranean Sea.

The cable will have segments with up to 24 fibre pairs, with a capacity of 20Tbs per fibre pair. Its festoon architecture is said to offer a unique design.

Designed as an open-access system, Medusa will look to offer telecom providers across the region with access to advanced connectivity services, supporting the roll-out of 5G, the growth of cloud infrastructure, and the increasing bandwidth demands of artificial intelligence (AI) and future technologies.

Operationally, Medusa will have two main regions: Europe and North Africa. In Europe, it has local operational branches in Ireland, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Cyprus. These branches hold licenses and permits. The Network Operations Centre is based in Europe. In North Africa, Medusa has agreements with local licensed operators for landing parties.

Medusa is seen as being crucial for developing the digital ecosystem of populations in North African countries, taking a significant step towards closing the digital divide between Europe and North Africa, connecting countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria and Egypt with high-capacity fibre-optic links to six European Union (EU) member states: Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Cyprus.

The investment is expected to have a positive impact on the economy of these countries, which will lead to inclusive and sustainable economic growth. It is also backed financially by the EU.

With the arrival of the 1,050km-long submarine cable segment, Orange says it is reaffirming its commitment to international connectivity and digital dynamism in the Mediterranean through the continued development of its infrastructure in Marseille.

The cable is part of the ongoing development of submarine networks connecting both sides of the Mediterranean, from Marseille to Bizerte in Tunisia, meeting growing needs for bandwidth in the region.

With the fully redundant fibre optic infrastructure, Orange says it will provide its Marseille customers with simple, secure and direct access to all of the city’s datacentres, which are now interconnected and also have direct links to major European hubs such as Paris, London and Frankfurt, as well as the rest of the world. All aspects of the cable are fully managed by Orange, including from a technical, regulatory, security and environmental point of view.

The Marseille-Bizerte segment also benefits from co-financing by the EU through the Connecting Europe Facility. Three pairs of fibre belonging to Orange are supported in the framework of the European Global Gateway strategy, aimed at strengthening connections between Europe and Africa, supporting digital transition and reducing the digital divide.

The Medusa cable provider is Alcatel Submarine Networks. Elettra, a subsidiary of Orange and the project coordinator, managed the operation. Orange Marine’s cable ship, Sophie Germain, was tasked with the cable landing operations in Marseille.

“We are proud to bring our leadership and expertise to the Medusa cable, hosted within our secure infrastructure in Marseille, with laying operations carried out by our cable ships, Teliri and Sophie Germain,” said Michael Trabbia, CEO of Orange Wholesale.

“Our infrastructure offers a key link in Mediterranean basin connectivity, ensuring digital resilience and supporting socio-economic development,” he added. “With this landing, Orange enhances Europe’s digital sovereignty and positions Marseille as a global digital hub, now hosting the arrival of 17 submarine cables connected worldwide.”

[TITLE]Everything Blockchain (OTC: EBZT) Strategy Stayed Profitable Through the $19B Market Selloff:
[TEXT]
Jacksonville, Florida, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Everything Blockchain Inc. (OTC: EBZT), a publicly traded company developing AI-driven trading infrastructure for digital assets, today commented on the historic $19 billion crypto liquidation and outlined its vision for the automation of less than twenty-four hours, with 1.6 million traders liquidated. Bitcoin fell over $20,000 intraday, wiping out nearly $380 billion in market value, a single-day swing larger than almost every public company on Earth.

In a move that stunned analysts, a whale on HyperLiquid placed massive short positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum one minute before the Trump administration announced a 100 percent tariff increase on Chinese imports. The final short was executed at 20:49 GMT, with the announcement hitting at 20:50 GMT. Within minutes, the whale closed ninety percent of the BTC short and fully exited the ETH short, capturing an estimated $190 to $200 million profit in a single day.

To many observers, the timing looked like insider trading on a global scale. To professionals who study market structure, it was the predictable result of a system built on overleverage, thin liquidity, and emotion.

Everything Blockchain Read the Data Before the Rest of the Market Saw the Risk

Over the summer, Everything Blockchain Inc. (OTC: EBZT) identified mounting structural risk across the digital asset market.

By early October, aggregate altcoin open interest had surged from approximately 21 billion dollars to more than 38 billion dollars, a 90 percent increase, while total altcoin market capitalization rose only from 825 billion to 1.16 trillion dollars, a 25% increase.

The data revealed a growing disconnect between leverage and real market value. Recognizing this imbalance, Chief Investment Officer Gleb Zemsky advised that the company’s planned Digital Asset Treasury model, a strategy based on directional exposure, would be too vulnerable in a leverage-driven environment.

The team made a decisive shift toward a new principle: the future of finance is the automation of money.

Everything Blockchain Is Teaching Money How to Think

Everything Blockchain began developing AI-assisted systems designed to identify the safest and most consistent yield opportunities on-chain through intelligence and automation. The company’s approach combines quantitative modeling, live blockchain analytics, and adaptive execution to target the most reliable risk-adjusted returns across stablecoin yield pools, liquidity spreads, and delta neutral vaults.

“Artificial intelligence is not replacing traders,” said Chief Investment Officer Gleb Zemsky. “It is extending their reach. Our technology allows human expertise to work hand in hand with automation, creating strategies that think faster, adapt faster, and perform with discipline.”

During this recent liquidation event, the same category of strategies that the company develops internally produced strong positive returns, exceeding 40% annualized, while the broader market collapsed.

Clovermint: The Intelligence Engine for Digital Yield

Everything Blockchain is developing Clovermint, an AI-powered trading and yield infrastructure built to help capital think, react, and perform with precision. Clovermint transforms live blockchain data into actionable insights. Its AI engine scans millions of on-chain signals to identify high-confidence opportunities in stablecoin yield pools, liquidity spreads, and delta neutral strategies that generate returns independent of price direction.

Built for both institutions and sophisticated traders, Clovermint combines human expertise with automation to deliver institutional-grade performance through a simple, transparent platform. The system enhances decision-making, automation, and execution, bridging artificial intelligence, blockchain analytics, and regulated public-market access. The result is an intelligent layer that allows capital to move with purpose, safely, efficiently, and autonomously.

Everything Blockchain’s Institutional Advisory Model

While Clovermint advances toward launch, Everything Blockchain is already applying its expertise through institutional advisory services. The company structures custom delta-neutral and stable yield solutions for institutions, family offices, and high-net-worth investors who want exposure to digital markets without taking price risk.

Proceeds from these advisory engagements will strengthen the company’s balance sheet and, as management has indicated, may be used in future stock buyback initiatives to enhance shareholder value.
