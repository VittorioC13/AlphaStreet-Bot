[TITLE]Iraq Becomes a Battleground for China and Western Oil Giants:
[TEXT]
Iraq is at a crucial tipping point in its history. The past few months especially have seen a surge in activity from Western firms looking to re-enter the country’s oil and gas sector following a prolonged hiatus that had allowed the previous build-up of influence of China and Russia to accelerate and expand. Both sides – West and East – see Iraq as a crucial part of their global strategic plans, with no room for the other in this zero-sum game. As exclusively revealed to OilPrice.com by a very high-ranking official from the Kremlin: “By keeping the West out of energy deals in Iraq, [Russia and China will see] the end of Western hegemony in the Middle East will become the decisive chapter in the West’s final demise.” On the other side of the equation, the U.S. and its allies believe removing the influence of China and Russia in Iraq will critically diminish their ability to project power elsewhere in the region and around the world. Following the recent elections in Iraq, no new prime minister has yet been chosen, so it is little wonder Beijing has been holding talks with Baghdad in the past few days to discuss deeper cooperation.

Specifically, according to local news sources, China outlined priorities under its fifteenth ‘Five-Year Plan’ and expressed interest in strengthening multilateral cooperation with Iraq. Talks covered expanding cooperation under Beijing’s ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ (BRI) and Chinese proposals for deeper and broader initiatives in governance, development and security. On Iraq’s side, Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein described China as a pivotal strategic partner and the largest market for Iraqi oil. It was what was not in the notes that was the interesting bit, but OilPrice.com was exclusively told by two sources who work very closely with Iraq’s Oil Ministry with close knowledge of the talks. “It was stressed that whoever became the new leader [prime minister], Iraq would continue to welcome Chinese investment into the country across all sectors, and also specifically into the oil and gas sectors,” said one of the Iraq sources. “Such developments would continue the ideas contained in the two previous agreements between Iraq and China that are still operational, although the parameters of those that deal with any dual use [for military and civilian purposes] trade or dual use projects, may have to be discussed again in terms of how they are applied,” he said. “In reality, it looked like we [Iraq] are trying to keep China onside for any eventuality that might happen, as we don’t know yet who the new leader will be, but at the same time we don’t want to do anything to upset the Americans either,” he added.

The two previous agreements in question were negotiated during the period in which the U.S. and its allies were nearing or at their weakest point in Iraq since the allied removal of then-President Saddam Hussein in 2003. This saw increasingly active antagonism towards the Western military forces that remained, spearheaded by attacks from Iranian-backed military proxies in Iraq that continued even after the U.S.’s official ‘end of combat mission’ in Iraq in December 2023. Against this backdrop, the groundwork for all future developments by China in Iraq was laid out in the wide-ranging ‘Oil for Reconstruction and Investment’ agreement signed between China and Iraq in 2019. The basic template for this agreement – which includes priority on new field contracts for Chinese firms and substantial discounts for them on oil and gas recovered – was the ‘Iran-China 25-Year Comprehensive Cooperation Agreement’ first revealed anywhere in the world in my 3 September 2019 article on the subject, and analysed in my latest book on the new global oil market order.

The 2019 China-Iraq deal was then substantially broadened and deepened into the ‘Iraq-China Framework Agreement’ of 2021. Part of this featured even bigger discounts given to Chinese firms on oil and gas discovered in Iraq (up to 30%, depending on the field). However, crucially for China’s bigger territorial ambitions in Iraq and the Middle East, it also gave its firms developing such fields wide-ranging rights to station significant security forces in and around these areas and to engage in a massive build-out of accompanying infrastructure. This includes road and rail networks connected to bigger infrastructure hubs with links across the Middle East, the right for the Chinese military to use selected Iraqi military and civilian seaports and airports, and permission to construct further businesses, schools and other support facilities tangential to China’s ongoing interest in the region.

Typical of the underlying idea and structure behind these cooperation agreements were three far-reaching infrastructure deals that heavily involved China in the heartland of Iraq. One was Baghdad’s approval of nearly IQD1 trillion (USD700 million) for infrastructure projects in the city of Al-Zubair in the southern Iraq oil hub of Basra. Judging from comments made by the city’s Governor at the time, Abbas Al-Saadi, China’s heavy involvement in Phase 2 of the projects was part of the broad-based ‘oil-for-reconstruction and investment’ agreement signed by Baghdad and Beijing in September 2019. This agreement allowed Chinese firms to invest in infrastructure projects in Iraq in exchange for oil. The Al-Zubair announcement followed shortly after the awarding by Baghdad of another major contract to another Chinese company to build a civilian airport to replace the military base in the capital of the southern oil rich Dhi Qar governorate. The Dhi Qar region includes two of Iraq’s potentially biggest oil fields – Gharraf and Nassiriya. This airport project, it announced, would include the construction of multiple cargo buildings and roads linking the airport to the city’s town centre and separately to other key oil areas in southern Iraq. This, in turn, followed yet another deal, involving Chinese companies building out Al-Sadr City, located near Baghdad, at a cost of between USD7-8 billion, also within the framework of the 2019 ‘oil-for-reconstruction and investment’ agreement.

Happily for China, much of this investment to secure land in Iraq vital to its key commercial and military strategy underlying its BRI project came indirectly and directly from the dramatically cut-price oil it was able to extract from Iraq in the first place. This, on top of those strategic advantages, was what had made the country so appealing to Beijing (and to Moscow, and Washington, and London, and Paris). As also analysed in depth in my latest book on the new global oil market order, Iraq remains a huge repository of oil at the world’s joint lowest average lifting cost of $2-4 per barrel, together with large quantities of associated and non-associated gas – with both its oil and gas reserves still enormously underestimated. Another strategic advantage, is that it occupies the geographical heart of the region, lying west of Iran, north of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, east of Jordan and Syria (with its long Mediterranean coastline offering access to further critical sea routes), and south of Turkey (affording an entry into the European continent). And a final one is that Iraq is a key member of the ‘Shia Crescent of Power’ geopolitical arc that stretches from Iran through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, where Shia communities and Iran-backed groups exert significant influence over regional politics, economics, and security.

Beijing has done exceptionally well in exploiting these agreements with Baghdad, with some 34% of Iraq's proven reserves and two-thirds of current production now managed by Chinese companies. These combined have direct shares in around 24 billion barrels of reserves and are responsible for production of around 3 million barrels per day. Crucially, though, the past few months have seen Western firms take and consolidate their control over critical projects in Iraq that are vital to its further development as an oil and gas resource. France’s TotalEnergies holds the key to its ability to dramatically increase its oil output via the crucial Common Seawater Supply Project, as detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. And there are three other major projects included in its US$27 billion deal with Baghdad. The UK’s BP is now in a strategically key position to act as a conduit for change in Iraq’s north through its US$25 billion five-field deal recently formally activated. And there have been similar announcements from the U.S.’s Chevron and ExxonMobil, among others. Tellingly as to the direction Iraq may be headed if current Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ al?Sudani emerges again as leader following the ongoing post-election haggling, Iraq recently sent out special invitations to U.S. firms to bid for its huge West Qurna 2 at the expense of forced-out Russian giant Lukoil. Consequently, China may find that any new cooperation deal with Iraq does not in fact continue every element of the 2019 and 2021 versions, if Sudani regains power. If he does not, then the game will be firmly back on for Beijing.

[TITLE]Iraq Pulls the Plug on Iranian Gas:
[TEXT]
Iraq on Tuesday announced a complete suspension of natural gas imports from Iran, a move the electricity ministry said immediately knocked between 4,000 and 4,500 megawatts off the national power grid.

On its face, the decision sounds dramatic. In practical terms, it is but the final step in a process that was already well underway. Iraqi officials have spent the past year declaring victory over fuel imports, first halting shipments of gasoline, diesel, and kerosene while pitching a broader narrative of energy self-sufficiency. Gas was the remaining—and most politically sensitive—piece of that puzzle.

Iranian supplies had been covering roughly 30 to 40 percent of Iraq’s power generation needs. Of course, those volumes had already been diminishing due to payment disputes, U.S. sanctions pressure, and Iran’s own domestic shortages. The “complete suspension” isn’t the sudden cutoff that it appears. Baghdad is merely taking the next logical step in the breakup with Iran through partial import reductions and unreliable flows.

Washington has been steadily pushing Iraq to unwind its dependence on Tehran, and Baghdad has been eager to show compliance without triggering a full-blown electricity crisis. The fallback plan—burning locally produced alternative fuels—is not new, nor is it ideal. It keeps the lights on at a higher cost and with greater strain on infrastructure, but it buys political breathing room.

More importantly, this announcement fits into a much larger strategic shift. Western-backed energy projects are finally moving from paper to production. BP’s $25 billion, five-field development in Kirkuk is now active, with a heavy emphasis on capturing associated gas that would otherwise be flared. TotalEnergies’ multi-billion-dollar integrated gas project in southern Iraq is designed to feed power plants directly, cutting Iran out of the loop altogether.

None of this means that Iraq has solved its power problem. Summer demand still dwarfs the country’s installed capacity, and gas capture takes time. Still, Baghdad wants to send the appropriate message, to Washington, to Tehran, and to investors, that Iranian gas is no longer a pillar of its energy system. Whether the grid can tolerate that ambition is the real test still ahead.

[TITLE]Workers organized by a key union rally in Bolivia against scrapping fuel subsidies:
[TEXT]

LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivian miners marched in downtown La Paz, the country’s capital, and union-organized protesters took to the streets elsewhere on Monday, the first day of a strike over the government’s scrapping of fuel subsidies that have been blamed for contributing to dollar shortages and economic turmoil.

The protests were called for by Bolivia’s Central Union of Workers but many trade groups, including transportation workers, did not join the rallies. Some union leaders said they would go along with the elimination of the subsidies, which had been in place for almost two decades.

Bolivia’s centrist President Rodrigo Paz, who took office on Nov. 8, ended the fuel subsidy that previous left-wing governments had maintained for more than 20 years, keeping gas prices at $0.53 per liter. An emergency decree by Paz last week put the price of gasoline at around $1 per liter.

“The country is sick and must be healed,” Paz said on Sunday in a town hall meeting that was broadcast on state television.

“Every day, $10 million is spent on a subsidy that benefits smugglers” who resell the subsidized fuel in Bolivia and abroad, Paz added.

Business groups in Bolivia have backed Paz’s new economic measures, which are expected to ease dollar shortages and make it easier for companies to import goods and capital.

“We knew that at some point the subsidies would end” said Luis Paco, a union leader representing merchants in the city of El Alto. “There were no negotiations over the new adjustments, but we knew this was inevitable.”

Bus drivers unions stayed away from Monday’s protests after Bolivia’s government said they will be able to import auto parts duty-free. Paz has also mandated a 20% increase in the minimum wage.

Imports of gasoline and diesel — costing the government up to $3 billion a year — had depleted foreign currency reserves and worsened Bolivia’s biggest economic crisis in four decades, following the decline of the nation’s natural gas exports.

But unions that have traditionally aligned with left-wing political leaders — including those representing miners and coca growers — went on strike on Monday, demanding that fuel subsidies be reinstated.

La Paz police sealed off access to the central square where the palace housing the government is located, to prevent demonstrators from entering.

In the neighboring city of El Alto, local councils blocked some avenues. There were also road blocks on highways in six of the country’s nine regions, according to Bolivia’s highway administration agency.

“We are in the streets in a struggle that will continue until that decree eliminating the subsidy is repealed,” mining leader Andrés Paye told reporters. “This government approves regulations to favor business owners and punish the poor.”

Unions aligned with former President Evo Morales, led a massive march in Cochabamba, the Andean country’s third-largest city, and blocked two major highways in the east of the country.

The bus drivers unions did not join the strike, after negotiating over the weekend with Paz’s new government.

“We will continue to work, to serve the people” said Lucio Gomez, a leader of a transport workers union.

Carlos Cordero, a political science professor in La Paz, said the union behind the strike was trying to “show its strength” ahead of next year’s elections for governors and mayors. But the relatively low turnout on Monday showed that the union has been weakened, he said.

“In many sectors of the country, there is a conviction that the adjustment was necessary” Cordero said.

[TITLE]Will SHANTI create turbulence?:
[TEXT]
Last week a pivotal step was taken in shaping the next phase of India’s nuclear journey — the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, was passed by Parliament.

It consolidates and modernises India’s nuclear legal framework, enables limited private participation in the nuclear sector under regulatory oversight, strengthens statutory regulation by granting statutory recognition to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB).

“It supports India’s clean-energy transition and the long-term objective of achieving 100 GW nuclear energy capacity by 2047,” according to the government.

The rationale behind this is to facilitate India’s energy transition process, according to policymakers. There’s a need to revisit the foundation of the country’s nuclear framework to match present-day needs and future ambitions. And with growing electricity demand, India needs to tap all resources available for generating uninterrupted power, this includes nuclear, they argue.

Also, to meet the national target of 100 GW nuclear capacity by 2047 and advance long-term decarbonisation by 2070, a modern legal framework is essential, which enables wider participation, leverages indigenous resources, and integrates innovation with safety, the policymakers aver.

Ankit Jain, Vice-President, Co Group Head-Corporate Ratings, ICRA Ltd, says it allows private companies to build, own, operate, and decommission nuclear reactors, including small modular reactors, which till now has been primarily done by Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL).

“This apart, the Government of India has announced allocation of ₹20,000 crore to set up a dedicated nuclear energy mission aimed at research, development and deployment of SMRs (small modular reactors) with a goal to operationalise at least five indigenously developed SMRs by 2033,” he said.

Fate of coal plants

All these sound good. While debates can happen on the nuances of SHANTI, what also needs to be considered is whether India’s electricity sector is ready for it? Cost and infrastructure are the key components here, knowing that end at the of the day it is the consumers who pay.

What happens to coal? As nuclear capacity grows under the SHANTI framework, it could result in speeding the retirement of old coal plants, especially non-pithead and high-tariff stations. With these units already costly and polluting, signals on converting select retired coal sites to nuclear make them natural candidates for faster exit or repurposing. But will the States where these projects are be willing to adopt it?

Once such coal stations shut, their existing transmission lines can be reassigned to upcoming nuclear plants, saving both time and grid-integration cost. Only short, dedicated links and switch-yard upgrades would typically be needed from the new reactors to the current pooling points, enabling quicker evacuation of nuclear power once they start generating. Therefore, infrastructure or grind connectivity may not be that much of a challenge.

Cost factor

What could be worrisome will be the cost of this energy. SHANTI makes nuclear power tariff more centralised, away from the usual State-level regulatory route. According to reports, a single national tariff framework is expected to give investors and States clearer price visibility and make long-term power purchase deals easier to structure. One will need to see how that evolves in the coming days.

Clause 37 (1) of SHANTI says, “Notwithstanding anything contained in the Electricity Act, 2003, the Central Government shall fix the tariff for supply of electricity from nuclear power plants based on such norms and mechanisms as may be specified by it by notification.”

It allows the Union Government to directly set nuclear tariffs using a notified formula, even if this means departing from the existing Electricity Act set-up. The formula can be a cause of concern if the process is not transparent. Ideally, the formula must factor in fuel costs, spent fuel and waste management, decommissioning and other lifecycle expenses, so these are reflected upfront in the approved tariff.

“The sector faces inherent challenges, including extremely high capital cost (₹16-20 crore per MW), long gestation periods, and plant stabilisation related issues. Private firms lack operational track record in this domain, raising concerns over execution risks and tariff competitiveness,” he said.

Says former Power Secretary Alok Kumar, “While it is a good move, we have to wait and watch, as the projects go to the States. The size of the project States are willing to offtake has to been seen? What kind of generation size and demand profile we are looking at will also play an important factor.”

The interplay of storage and demand flexibility options, and how they work will decide the overall system costs, he said, adding that the nuclear plants will have to have some flexibility. “Pushing one resource beyond a point may lead to a situation where another resource may have to be curtailed. How that will be managed also needs to be looked into,” he said.

Operator’s liability

While cost will have direct impact on the consumer, a worrisome aspect is capping operator liability in a graded manner based on reactor size; the amount is capped at ₹3,000 crore. Further, it removes equipment suppliers’ recourse for damages, in line with global norms.

While this addresses the deterrent for suppliers, what happens with the product is a challenge, critics argue.

“Nuclear projects are inherently highly capital intensive. Further, in India, so far the nuclear power generation rested with NPCIL, and thus private firms lack operational experience. This apart, frameworks for waste management, spent fuel, and decommissioning still remain in nascent stages,” Jain said.

In a nutshell, one will have to wait and watch for the rules that will define how SHANTI will be implemented.

[TITLE]Sweden's Vattenfall Seeks State Funding for New Nuclear Reactors:
[TEXT]
Sweden’s power giant Vattenfall announced on Tuesday it is applying for state aid for an investment in small modular reactors (SMRs) as part of a plan by industrial giants to bet on new nuclear power in the country.

Last month Sweden’s biggest industrial firms signed an agreement with Vattenfall to become shareholders in the power giant’s new company, Videberg Kraft AB, which plans to build SMRs in the country.

One of Europe’s top electric utilities, Vattenfall, created Videberg Kraft AB in April this year as a separate entity to be able to apply for government support.

Now the company and the industry organization, Industrikraft, plan joint investment and collaboration enabling the development of new nuclear power in Sweden.

Industrikraft, whose members include Volvo Group, Saab, Alfa Laval, and Hitachi Energy, will become a shareholder in Videberg Kraft with a 20-percent stake.

The government has previously announced that the state also intends to become a shareholder in the new company.

The Swedish government moved to phase out nuclear power completely in 1980, but that decision was reversed by Parliament in 2010. Five years later, four aging reactors were shut down. Six of 12 reactors remain in operation in Sweden today.

The country is now betting on SMRs to expand its nuclear fleet as Stockholm seeks to further reduce emissions with low-carbon 24/7 energy.

Sweden has tweaked its renewable energy policy, which had called for 100% renewable electricity by 2040, changing the terminology to “100% fossil-free” electricity, paving the way for the construction of more nuclear power plants.

Now Videberg Kraft’s CEO Desirée Comstedt has submitted an application for financing and risk-sharing to the Swedish Government.

When an agreement between the state and Videberg Kraft has been reached, the government may initiate a formal state aid process with the European Commission, Vattenfall said.

Videberg Kraft is planning a project with either five BWRX-300 reactors from GE Vernova Hitachi or three reactors from Rolls-Royce SMR, which will provide a total nuclear power output of about 1,500 MW. There is currently an intensive evaluation process of the two remaining suppliers, and a decision on the final supplier is planned for 2026.

[TITLE]Michigan Regulators Approve State’s First Hyperscale Data Center:
[TEXT]
Despite criticism that they were acting too fast, state utility regulators last week approved DTE Energy’s proposal to supply power for Michigan’s first hyperscale data center — while tacking on a host of conditions that aim to protect ratepayers from subsidizing the facility.

The approval, made over shouts of disapproval from onlookers gathered in a Lansing conference room, drew cheers from business interests and ire from skeptics who had called for a deeper public review of the 19-year deal.

Defending the decision, Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps told the gathered crowd that after reviewing them in detail, “I would put the contracts that are in front of us today on par or better with any that have been approved in the country.”

He and other commissioners said they had concluded the deal would save ratepayers money and would not sacrifice energy reliability.

But a wave of public speakers lined up to condemn the vote, raising concerns

The Swedish government moved to phase out nuclear power completely in 1980, but that decision was reversed by Parliament in 2010. Five years later, four aging reactors were shut down. Six of 12 reactors remain in operation in Sweden today.

The country is now betting on SMRs to expand its nuclear fleet as Stockholm seeks to further reduce emissions with low-carbon 24/7 energy.

Sweden has tweaked its renewable energy policy, which had called for 100% renewable electricity by 2040, changing the terminology to “100% fossil-free” electricity, paving the way for the construction of more nuclear power plants.

Now Videberg Kraft’s CEO Desirée Comstedt has submitted an application for financing and risk-sharing to the Swedish Government.

When an agreement between the state and Videberg Kraft has been reached, the government may initiate a formal state aid process with the European Commission, Vattenfall said.

Videberg Kraft is planning a project with either five BWRX-300 reactors from GE Vernova Hitachi or three reactors from Rolls-Royce SMR, which will provide a total nuclear power output of about 1,500 MW. There is currently an intensive evaluation process of the two remaining suppliers, and a decision on the final supplier is planned for 2026.

[TITLE]Michigan Regulators Approve State’s First Hyperscale Data Center:
[TEXT]
Despite criticism that they were acting too fast, state utility regulators last week approved DTE Energy’s proposal to supply power for Michigan’s first hyperscale data center — while tacking on a host of conditions that aim to protect ratepayers from subsidizing the facility.

The approval, made over shouts of disapproval from onlookers gathered in a Lansing conference room, drew cheers from business interests and ire from skeptics who had called for a deeper public review of the 19-year deal.

Defending the decision, Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps told the gathered crowd that after reviewing them in detail, “I would put the contracts that are in front of us today on par or better with any that have been approved in the country.”

He and other commissioners said they had concluded the deal would save ratepayers money and would not sacrifice energy reliability.

But a wave of public speakers lined up to condemn the vote, raising concerns

Dr. Arun Kumar Nayak , Head of the Nuclear Control and Planning Wing at the Department of Atomic Energy until recently, makes the case for the SHANTI Bill, 2025, arguing that private sector entry into nuclear power is an imperative, not a choice.Speaking to ET, Nayak said Articles 17(b) and 46 of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) created widespread ambiguity among suppliers , preventing the nuclear business from progressing. He noted that the revised framework on right to recourse and liability is now aligned with the Convention on Supplementary Compensation ( CSC ) and international practice.The full interview with ET’s Anubhuti VishnoiIndia is targeting a 35 trillion economy from current 4 trillion in a span of 25 years for which energy has to grow proportionately. Most experts estimate that at least 30000 billion units of energy per year will be needed to support India’s ambitions.Today, we consume just over 10000 billion units per year which is roughly one fourth of China- which has almost the same population but an economy four times bigger than us.Today also almost 90 percent of fuel consumed in the country is from fossil fuel sources such as coal, oil and gas which are the main causes of green house gas emissions.The maximum potential of renewables such as solar, wind, hydro and bio is very limited in India; together, they can produce hardly 4000 to 8000 billion units per year. So, there is a big deficit of at least 20000 billion units of clean energy per year, which needs to be produced by nuclear energy.In installed capacity terms, it is minimum of 2500 GW nuclear power to support energy requirements for VIKSHIT BHARAT. Therefore, the 100 GW nuclear power target by 2047 is just a starter, the main course has to follow.Such a huge nuclear energy transition over next 25 years is impossible to achieve through the current legal business framework which enables only the Central Government ’s nuclear utilities or other PSUs in a Joint venture with them- dependent on government money from annual budget.The opening of nuclear sector to private sector, therefore, is not a choice but an imperative. That is the rationale for having SHANTI BILL 2025. Otherwise. we may have to forget A DECARBONED VIKSHIT BHARAT.This explains the need to repeal the Atomic Energy Act, 1962.The Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 (CLNDA) has also been repealed so as to facilitate nuclear business by private operators and global suppliers by making the new liability law more transparent, CSC compliant and in line with many other countries who do nuclear business globally today. We should be part of global business, and one of our objectives should be to expand our nuclear business outside India. Because many ASEAN countries, African nations and Eastern European countries are entering into nuclear. We cannot afford to lose the business.In the SHANTI BILL 2025, the three key controls – SAFETY, SECURITY AND SAFEGUARDS lie with the Central Government and not with the Operator whether it is PSU or Private.All nuclear facilities will be licensed subject to meeting the requirements on above three. Safety license will be given to any Operator by AERB subject to meeting the stringent AERB safety standards for both design and operation including decommissioning. Security and Safeguards will be completely controlled and monitored by Central Government. Hence, where is the question of compromise?Even if we compare the new N regime with the previous one- the above mentioned three critical aspects are controlled by Central Government and will continue to be controlled by Central Government even in the new regime.Today, private entities build all nuclear plants in India with Government Quality Assurance. In the new bill , private entities can build any nuclear plant subject to meeting the Government Quality Assurance. Any plant to operate, requires safety licensing by AERB irrespective whether the plant to be run by a PSU or private. Security of the nuclear facility will be designed and maintained by Central Government at the cost of operator. Each gram of nuclear material movement by the Operator will be under Central Government’s surveillance and control so as to meet the requirements of IAEA. In fact, the complete irradiated fuel will be handed over by the Operator to the Central Government, so proliferation is out of question.So, I don’t think there is any compromise at any stage or any aspect. Let us remove the fear from mind.In the CLND ACT 2010, similar provisions were there; however, Article 17b and 46, had created many ambiguities in the minds of Suppliers. Of course, the Government had clarified through FAQs, but the Suppliers still did not accept it since FAQs were not enacted by law. So, the nuclear business could not go ahead.Currently, there is only one operator, I.e. NPCIL. In case of any serious accident-causing damage caused to public, NPCIL is liable. NPCIL owns the PHWR technology. So, NPCIL is the Supplier as well.But who manufactures and builds the nuclear power plants today in the country? It is the private utilities not NPCIL. Do these private utilities take the liability as supplier of equipment or construction in case of any nuclear accident? No, not at all. NPCIL takes only the liability both as operator and supplier. Indirectly, today Government of India is liable for any accident in the country.In the new regime, there is no change in the framework of operator liability, irrespective of whether the operator is a government utility or private one.The operator liability is defined very clearly and the amount is graded depending on type of nuclear business activities and power of nuclear reactors. Since SMRs and Micro Reactors are of different technologies and risks are very small, the liability amounts are reduced.This is in line with USA and OECD countries – which are considering keeping SMRs out of liability due to insignificant risk to the public. Apart from Operator liability, the maximum liability of Central Government is also specified. The enables the Government to create a nuclear liability fund to meet the liability due to any accident.Apart from that, if the Supplier is different from the Operator, the Operator has a right of recourse- enabled through a contract between the Operator and Supplier. So, the Supplier is liable whether he is from India or abroad.Also, the Operator has the Right of Recourse on Supplier in case the nuclear incident has occurred due to act of commission or omission of an individual with a malevolent intent. This is in line with many other countries doing nuclear business globally apart from CSC where the country is a signatory.Next question comes – how did an accident occur? Is it because of the operator or due to the supplier? If proven, the Operator has been given the Right of Recourse enabled through the new Act. The right of recourse applies both to domestic and foreign suppliers.Let us understand that in case of any accident, the public who is affected, needs to be compensated according to the law of the soil. Once the compensation amount is decided, the Operator has to compensate the public within the time limits. In case, the amount exceeds his limits, the Central Government has to compensate the balance. In case the amount exceeds Government’s limits, balance amount is compensated through provisions in CSC. So, where is the question of public not being compensated?Today we are building Gen III and Gen III plus reactors which are extremely safe and have several design features to eliminate release of high amounts radioactivity to the public. SMRs are designed to be walk-away safe- in the sense that any accident is managed by the reactor itself to bring it to safe state, no operator action is required. The Gen IV reactors which are in advanced design stage, are targeted for production of minimal waste, higher efficiency and superior safety.So, putting all technologies into same liability limits is illogical. In fact, currently some of the countries including US and OECD are considering keeping SMRs away from liabilities.So, we must honour technological superiority and risk reduction potential of SMRs and Micro Reactors, and credits must be given to design features of GEN III and III plus reactors; and that is why the new liability regime has put a graded liability and capping on the maximum liability on the operators.It is also important to remember that in TMI, Chernobyl and Fukushima, the number of deaths due to release of radioactivity was insignificant due to strong containments- except in Chernobyl. However, in all cases, because of fear, the public was shifted even at very small doses of radiation which caused more panic.I have been saying over years how low dose radiation up to 100 to 200 msV is beneficial to human health, and hence, the regulatory body needs to review the dose limits for public evacuation or sheltering. Once implemented, probably, no emergency in public domain will be called for in any nuclear plant accident. Recently, the INL is pursuing to remove ALARA and increase the radiation dose limits.AERB is one of the most stringent regulators globally, well known for its scientific excellence and maturity. In the new bill, it has got Statutory status, which was long pending. In that sense,AERB is now legally absolute autonomous for its functioning. That is a very timely move.

Dr Arun Kumar Nayak, until recently head of the Nuclear Control and Planning Wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, makes the case for the SHANTI Bill, 2025, arguing that private sector entry into nuclear power is an imperative, not a choice.Speaking to ET, Nayak said Articles 17(b) and 46 of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) created widespread ambiguity among suppliers, preventing the nuclear business from progressing. He noted that the revised framework on right to recourse and liability is now aligned with the Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC) and international practice.India is targeting a $35 trillion economy over the next 25 years. To achieve this, experts estimate that the country will require at least 30,000 billion units of energy annually.At present, India consumes just over 10,000 billion units a year, with nearly 90% sourced from fossil fuels. The maximum potential of renewable energy is also estimated at no more than 4,000-8,000 billion units annually. This leaves a deficit of at least 20,000 billion units of clean energy per year, which can only be bridged through nuclear power.In this context, the target of 100 GW of nuclear capacity by 2047 is merely a starting point; substantially higher capacity will be required to meet India's net-zero commitments.Such a nuclear energy transition is impossible under the existing legal and business framework, which restricts operations largely to central government nuclear utilities or public sector undertakings operating through joint ventures, and remains heavily dependent on government funding.Opening up the nuclear sector to private participation is therefore not a matter of choice but an imperative. Without the SHANTI Act, the goal of a decarbonised Viksit Bharat risks remaining unattainable.In the SHANTI Act, the three key controls - safety, security and safeguards - vest with the Centre, not with the operator, whether a PSU or a private entity. All nuclear facilities will be licenced only after meeting stringent requirements prescribed by the AERB and the Centre on these three aspects.Under the new Act, private entities may build nuclear plants subject to compliance with Government Quality Assurance norms. However, operation of any plant - whether private or PSU - will require safety licencing by the AERB. Security of nuclear facilities will be designed, implemented and maintained by the Centre, at the cost of the operator. Every gram of nuclear material handled by an operator will remain under the Centre's surveillance and control in accordance with IAEA requirements. Moreover, all irradiated fuel will be handed over to the central government, effectively ruling out any risk of proliferation.The conferral of statutory status on the AERB is also timely and reinforces its functional autonomy.Taken together, these provisions ensure that there is no compromise at any stage or on any aspect of nuclear governance. The apprehensions surrounding private participation are therefore misplaced and need to be dispelled.In the CLND Act, 2010, similar provisions existed; however, Articles 17(b) and 46 created significant ambiguity in the minds of suppliers. While the government sought to clarify these provisions through FAQs, suppliers remained unconvinced, as such clarifications did not carry the force of law. As a result, nuclear business could not be pursued at scale. Legal clarity was essential.On liability, there is currently only one operator- NPCIL. In the event of a serious accident causing damage to the public, NPCIL bears the liability. NPCIL also owns the PHWR technology and therefore functions as the supplier as well.However, the manufacturing and construction of nuclear power plants in the country are carried out by private utilities, not NPCIL. Do these private utilities assume supplier liability for equipment or construction in the event of a nuclear accident? They do not. NPCIL alone bears liability, both as operator and as supplier.Indirectly, even today, the Government of India is ultimately liable in the event of a nuclear accident in the country. Under the new regime, there is no change in the fundamental framework of operator liability, whether the operator is public or private.Operator liability is clearly defined, with liability amounts graded according to the type of nuclear activity and the capacity of the reactor involved. The maximum liability of the central government is also specified, along with provisions for the creation of a nuclear liability fund.Where the supplier is distinct from the operator, the operator retains a right of recourse. Accordingly, the supplier-whether domestic or foreign-is liable through contractual arrangements with the operator. In addition, the operator has a right of recourse against suppliers if a nuclear incident occurs due to an act of commission or omission involving malevolent intent. This right of recourse applies equally to Indian and foreign suppliers.These provisions are fully aligned with the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC), to which India is a signatory.In the event of an accident, affected members of the public are entitled to compensation under the law of the land. Once compensation is determined, the operator is required to pay within prescribed time limits. If the amount exceeds the operator's liability cap, the central government is obliged to compensate the balance. Should the compensation exceed the government's limit as well, the remaining amount is covered through the CSC mechanism.In this framework, there is no gap in public protection, and no basis for the concern that victims would be left uncompensated.
