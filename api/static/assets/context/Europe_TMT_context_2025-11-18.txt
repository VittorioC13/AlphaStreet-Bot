[TITLE]A seven-year-old merger plan for insurance weaklings is being dusted off the shelves:
[TEXT]
The Centre is weighing a massive restructuring of National Insurance Co., Oriental Insurance Co., and United India Insurance Co., potentially involving a merger, privatization or both.

The Union finance ministry is discussing various options for the future of the three weak general insurers, the people mentioned above said on the condition of anonymity. These include merging two of them with the listed and profitable New India Assurance; merging all three; and merging only two and preparing the third for privatization.

“The Centre is seeking a structure that aligns with the policy to limit the number of state-owned companies in non-strategic sectors to one or two, while retaining a minimum of four in strategic sectors," one of the two people said on the condition of anonymity. General insurance falls under the non-strategic category.

The discussions are at an early stage, and any decision will follow a deeper study of each insurer’s solvency profile, integration challenges, and the fiscal implications of further capital support, the people cited above added.

Queries emailed to the finance ministry and the four insurers went unanswered.

Back from the back-burner

The discussions to strengthen India's state-owned insurers mark the revival of a seven-year-old plan.

The 2018 plan to merge and subsequently list the three general insurers failed as they battled heavy losses and low solvency margins, leading to repeated capital injections by the government. Despite weak solvency ratios and dependence on regulatory forbearance, all three reported profits in at least some quarters of fiscal year 2025 (FY25), bringing the consolidation plan back on the agenda.

“This time, the conversation is more pragmatic," the second person mentioned above said. “The focus is on what is feasible, what strengthens the sector, and what limits future fiscal exposure."

Discussions to consolidate insurance companies are unfolding alongside similar efforts to reshape India's public banking sector.

Policy push

“It is the government's stated policy to have bare minimum presence of PSUs in the strategic sector, with the remaining to be privatized or merged, or subsidiarized with other central public sector enterprises, or closed," said C.R. Vijayan, former secretary general of the General Insurance Council, adding it is "very natural" that the government attempts merger or privatization in the sector.

Consolidation began with banking, and the same would be rolled out for insurance companies, Vijayan said. "How it is done would be decided by the government. But it will be done now."

Others pointed out that with the insurance sector now fully open to foreign direct investment (FDI), public sector insurers must urgently prepare for a far more competitive marketplace. The move is set to reshape the market: more global players are expected to enter or expand, bringing capital, technology, and product innovation that will pressure public sector insurers to modernise, improve efficiency, and strengthen customer service.

“Competition elevates the quality of customer focus and the need to bring

[TITLE]EQT Billionaire Takes On Wall Street Titans With Big Asia Push:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire investor Jean Eric Salata’s first foray into Asia was painful: Five write-offs in India and mounting losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Times were so tough, he changed his computer password to “perseverance” as a daily reminder to keep going.

Fast forward two decades, Asia is now a key growth driver for Salata’s current firm, EQT AB, which is taking the private equity world by storm with sizable cash outs and top level returns. It’s aiming to triple Asia investments to as much as $110 billion in five years, outpacing deployment in its home turf of Europe. Executives project another $10 billion in exits from the region over the next year, people familiar with the matter said.

Salata, 59, who was nominated global chairman of the Swedish buyout firm last month, said EQT is capitalizing on global investors’ quiet shift from US political turbulence toward Europe and Asia. From its base in Stockholm, EQT is wagering it can break the decades-long grip of the world’s biggest alternative asset managers.

“Being European, being Nordic in its roots and heritage, we have a good position globally in this new world order where we can be a little bit more neutral in the way we view things,” said Salata, EQT’s second-largest shareholder after the billionaire Wallenberg family.

EQT may not be a household name but it’s grown to become the largest non-US private equity firm in the world, with $310 billion in assets. Operating under the shadows of rivals like KKR & Co. and Blackstone Inc., its total fundraising over the past five years is just shy of KKR’s, according to Private Equity International.

The new Asia fund, BPEA IX, secured $600 million in fresh commitments from two major US pension funds over the last six months, a person familiar said. That’s in addition to $200 million from the New Jersey Pension Fund early this year. Repeat investors include the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, the person said.

Under Salata and new Chief Executive Officer Per Franzen, EQT is now embarking on its next chapter, aiming to raise €100 billion ($116 billion) in the current fundraising cycle, while investing $650 billion globally in the next half decade. The firm has returned €25 billion to investors in the past 12 months, of which Asia has accounted for a sizable percentage.

The buyout fund is riding a shift toward non-dollar assets, even while it targets infrastructure and real estate in the US, including data centers, student housing and medical offices, Franzen said.

EQT’s pace of cash distributions has stood out amid a broader slowdown, as many private equity firms contend with weak payouts and prolonged fundraising challenges. It offloaded $9.3 billion of Galderma Group AG shares with other investors this year, the biggest single-year cash out by a private equity firm, eclipsing the London Stock Exchange Group Plc’s $8.2 billion sale in 2023, according to people involved in the sale.

In Asia, the asset manager generated $10.1 billion for investors from selling Nord Anglia Education Inc., among Asia’s top exits, bringing total distributions from the Asia fund and its co-investors to $16 billion in the past 12 months, Salata said.

Asia will take center stage in EQT’s growth plans. Its merger with Baring Asia, founded by Salata in 1997, has opened a major gateway to the world’s fastest-growing markets. Regional deal flow has more than doubled, fueled by Japan, Korea and Australia, while India has remained consistently active, Salata said. EQT’s pipeline of deals is

[TITLE]Student Lost Her 2024 Tesla Internship, Rebounded With Newsletter:
[TEXT]
As an immigrant from Taiwan, Arlina Yang said she thought landing a Tesla internship proved she had made it. Losing the offer made her rethink her Big Tech dream.

As an immigrant from Taiwan, Arlina Yang said she thought landing a Tesla internship proved she had made it. Losing the offer made her rethink her Big Tech dream. Arlina Yang

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Arlina Yang, a junior at the University of California, Davis. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified Yang's employment history.

I came to the US in 2019. As an immigrant from Taiwan going to UC Davis, a non-target school, Big Tech was a dream that I didn't think I could have.

As an immigrant, I lacked a lot of parental guidance. My parents don't really know anything about tech, let alone job applications.

I had to figure everything out on my own — meeting with university career counselors, talking with friends, and learning from creators on social media. But there's only so much others can offer when they haven't walked the same path or experienced the specific opportunities I'm pursuing.

When I landed a software and digital media communications internship at Tesla last year, it was almost like a dream come true because it felt like a stamp of approval that I was good enough.

It was my first Big Tech internship, and I was really excited to tell my parents because I would be the first person in the family on both sides to ever work at such a big and well-known company.

My Tesla offer got rescinded

I received a call in April last year that my internship would be rescinded. The entire summer 2024 intern cohort was laid off.

On top of that, more than 14,000 employees were unfortunately part of the layoff.

I immediately called my sister and told her that I would no longer have a job for the summer. I was really worried because, at that point, it was quite late in the recruitment timeline. Internships were almost close to nonexistent.

Right after the call, I sat at Pete's Coffee just wondering what to do. I sat there for like six hours, re-edited my résumé, and tried to apply to every single job I could see on LinkedIn.

It was more sad to tell my parents than anyone else that I had lost my offer because it was ultimately something I couldn't control. Telling my parents felt like I was disappointing not only them but also myself.

I was constantly thinking about the what-ifs. If I had tried harder, would anything have changed? Would they have kept me?

I learned that I couldn't control what happens

The layoff taught me that I'm more resilient than I think I am. I persevered through this whole issue and combated a lot of my perceptions of self-worth.

Before Tesla, I applied to about 250 jobs, and after Tesla, I applied to another 250.

It was not meant to be that I ended up at another internship, so I took that summer to really reflect on what I could do and what was actually within my control.

The layoff is not something you can control, but the way that you react is something you can control.

I started Career Now, a newsletter to help other students like myself who might have lacked career guidance from their family or education, or the time to focus on their early career journey because of family responsibilities, part-time jobs, or other commitments.

I wanted my newsletter to be an outlet where students can learn about these job opportunities and level the field with those who have more privilege, support, and guidance in their early career journey.

What I've accomplished for Career Now has a much greater impact than whatever I could have done at Tesla because I'm helping more than 73,000 students in my daily life.

I post content that encourages students on a daily basis. I share opportunities that these students would never have known if I hadn't posted about them.

I'm now a campus leader for Notion and working part-time as a content marketing intern at Siemens during the school year. Looking ahead, I plan to study abroad in Europe in the fall while continuing to document my recruitment journey for a social media summer internship next year.

A job is never fully secure, and Big Tech is especially volatile

No job in this economy right now is fully secure. Job hunting is so different with the power of AI. Many résumés are scrapped ahead of time, even before getting into the hands of recruiters.

Big Tech is also very volatile. The layoff that happened last summer was only a sneak peek into what is happening this year, with a lot of big companies laying off new grads and employees cutting a lot of departments that are now, quote unquote, replaceable with the power of artificial intelligence.

An internship was honestly the best time to be laid off. Heaven forbid I got laid off as a full time employee where I had a mortgage to pay, or a family to raise. I definitely had the least to lose.

I do encourage students to see a layoff as a pause instead of the end — more of a redirection rather than a sign that it's game over.

[TITLE]US-China tech war: Nexperia saga exposes Europe's loosening grip on chip supply chain:
[TEXT]
"Chinese wafer fabs possess the technical capability to fulfil Nexperia's orders," said Arisa Liu, chief director and research fellow at Taiwan Industry Economics Services, a databank of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.

Experts, however, suggested that Chinese fabs might be ready to supply the wafers needed by Nexperia's local facility.

Nexperia's Chinese management refused to comply with directives from its head office and planned to switch to local wafer suppliers, a transition that could take at least six months. Meanwhile, the Dutch headquarters warned clients that products from the Chinese facility may be substandard.

Nexperia's Chinese facility had relied on wafers from its fabrication plants in the United Kingdom and Germany, but those shipments were abruptly halted as the Dutch-based company grappled with an internal conflict.

Wafers, which are cut into dies, are the core materials in assembling integrated circuits used in computing, communications and power switch applications.

For nearly a month, parts of Nexperia's Dongguan production lines have sat idle. Two factory workers said this week that some machinery had been turned off due to a wafer shortage since late last month, with one estimating that a third of the machines were idled - echoing earlier reports by the Post.

The Nexperia saga, which has created a global car chip shortage, reveals a new reality: Europe's once-vaunted neutrality and industrial sovereignty are eroding, while China's foundational role in manufacturing has become too large to fail and too complex to legally unwind.

The United States and Switzerland announced a framework agreement which significantly reduces US tariffs on Swiss goods from a steep 39% to a balanced 15%, marking a major step in improving trade relations and addressing longstanding barriers.The deal also includes a commitment by Swiss and Liechtenstein companies to invest $200 billion in the US, with $67 billion slated for 2026 alone, aiming to create thousands of American jobs and reduce the US trade deficit with Switzerland.The agreement, announced by US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer and Swiss officials, reflects the successful culmination of constructive negotiations to promote “Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade."ALSO READ: Trump plots major tariff cuts to slash soaring grocery bills for millions of Americans Ambassador Greer highlighted the deal as a continuation of the "America First Trade Policy" that removes tariff and non-tariff barriers, expands market access for U.S. exports, and welcomes sizable Swiss investment into the US economy.Key features of the agreement include:Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said the agreement “puts Switzerland on an equal footing with the European Union.” The framework contains sectoral safeguards (the United States will cap tariffs at 15% for Swiss goods, and some sectors, notably pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, have special treatment or caps under the arrangement), but detailed implementation and any sectoral exemptions will be specified as negotiations proceed.The US trade deficit with Switzerland and Liechtenstein stood at $38.3 billion in 2024, and this agreement is expected to pave the way for levelling that deficit by 2028 by fostering more balanced, reciprocal trade ties.This trade deal ends months of tariff tensions that began when the Trump administration imposed the 39% tariffs in 2025 as part of a broader strategy to address trade imbalances and alleged unfair trade practices by key partners.The agreement is seen as a mutually beneficial framework that strengthens economic ties, secures supply chain resilience, and supports job growth on both sides of the Atlantic through expanded market access and substantial new investments.

[TITLE]US-China tech war: Nexperia saga exposes Europe's loosening grip on chip supply chain:
[TEXT]
"Chinese wafer fabs possess the technical capability to fulfil Nexperia's orders," said Arisa Liu, chief director and research fellow at Taiwan Industry Economics Services, a databank of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.

Experts, however, suggested that Chinese fabs might be ready to supply the wafers needed by Nexperia's local facility.

Nexperia's Chinese management refused to comply with directives from its head office and planned to switch to local wafer suppliers, a transition that could take at least six months. Meanwhile, the Dutch headquarters warned clients that products from the Chinese facility may be substandard.

Nexperia's Chinese facility had relied on wafers from its fabrication plants in the United Kingdom and Germany, but those shipments were abruptly halted as the Dutch-based company grappled with an internal conflict.

Wafers, which are cut into dies, are the core materials in assembling integrated circuits used in computing, communications and power switch applications.

For nearly a month, parts of Nexperia's Dongguan production lines have sat idle. Two factory workers said this week that some machinery had been turned off due to a wafer shortage since late last month, with one estimating that a third of the machines were idled - echoing earlier reports by the Post.

The Nexperia saga, which has created a global car chip shortage, reveals a new reality: Europe's once-vaunted neutrality and industrial sovereignty are eroding, while China's foundational role in manufacturing has become too large to fail and too complex to legally unwind.

[TITLE]Benchmarks, features testing, and AI workloads on Ubuntu 24.04:
[TEXT]
Earlier this month, I started the review of the Intel-based UP AI development kits with an unboxing of the UP TWL, UP Squared Pro TWL, and UP Xtreme ARL single board computers. I’ve now had time to test the first model, the credit card-sized, Intel Processor N150-based UP TWL SBC with 64GB eMMC flash preloaded with Ubuntu 24.04.

As usual, I’ll run a few benchmarks and test the board’s key hardware features, but I’ll then focus on the AI part since that’s what the kit is for. Note that the UP TWL AI Dev Kit is an entry-level solution, and all AI workloads will be running on the CPU or the integrated GPU, since there’s no dedicated AI accelerator or an M.2 slot to add one on this model. In the next parts of the review, the UP Squared Pro TWL adds an Hailo-8L AI accelerator, and the UP Xtreme ARL delivers up to 83 TOPS through a 14-core Intel Core Ultra 5 225H “Arrow Lake” processor.

UP TWL SBC system information

The UP TWL quad-core SBC comes preloaded with Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS installed on a 64GB (62.6GB) eMMC flash, and the system also features 8GB of RAM.

We can get more information with the inxi utility:

The UP TWL runs super cool thanks to its built-in fansink, and the heatsink is cool at all times. It’s, however, rather noisy like most other hardware platforms from AAEON. They design hardware for the industrial market, so low noise may not be as important as in consumer devices.

In terms of performance, the UP TWL SBC achieved 6810 MIPS in the 7-zip benchmark on average, which compares to 9730 MIPS on the Zimaboard 2 with the same Intel N150 SoC and rather poor cooling.

The PL1/PL2 power limits can explain the difference:

PL1 set to 6W and PL2 to 25W, which compares to 12W and 20W for the Zimaboard 2 and 6W and 12W for the Intel N100-based MINIX Z100 0dB fanless mini PC. The results are widely different. I ran the test again, this time without background activity detected, and the results were the same. I tried to change the PL1 to 12W in the BIOS…

11,410 MIPS in 7-zip is more like it. Note that all other tests below were done with PL1 set to 6W (default), rather than 12W. It’s not the first time AAEON set their board to a conservation PL1 value, potentially for improved stability in high temperature environments, and they let customers select an optimal value in the BIOS as needed..

UP TWL SBC features testing

I’ve also checked the key hardware features of the UP TWL SBC as follows:

[TITLE]Student Lost Her 2024 Tesla Internship, Rebounded With Newsletter:

As an immigrant from Taiwan, Arlina Yang said she thought landing a Tesla internship proved she had made it. Losing the offer made her rethink her Big Tech dream. Arlina Yang

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Arlina Yang, a junior at the University of California, Davis. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified Yang's employment history.

I came to the US in 2019. As an immigrant from Taiwan going to UC Davis, a non-target school, Big Tech was a dream that I didn't think I could have.

As an immigrant, I lacked a lot of parental guidance. My parents don't really know anything about tech, let alone job applications.

I had to figure everything out on my own — meeting with university career counselors, talking with friends, and learning from creators on social media. But there's only so much others can offer when they haven't walked the same path or experienced the specific opportunities I'm pursuing.

When I landed a software and digital media communications internship at Tesla last year, it was almost like a dream come true because it felt like a stamp of approval that I was good enough.

It was my first Big Tech internship, and I was really excited to tell my parents because I would be the first person in the family on both sides to ever work at such a big and well-known company.

My Tesla offer got rescinded

I received a call in April last year that my internship would be rescinded. The entire summer 2024 intern cohort was laid off.

On top of that, more than 14,000 employees were unfortunately part of the layoff.

I immediately called my sister and told her that I would no longer have a job for the summer. I was really worried because, at that point, it was quite late in the recruitment timeline. Internships were almost close to nonexistent.

Right after the call, I sat at Pete's Coffee just wondering what to do. I sat there for like six hours, re-edited my résumé, and tried to apply to every single job I could see on LinkedIn.

It was more sad to tell my parents than anyone else that I had lost my offer because it was ultimately something I couldn't control. Telling my parents felt like I was disappointing not only them but also myself.

I was constantly thinking about the what-ifs. If I had tried harder, would anything have changed? Would they have kept me?

I learned that I couldn't control what happens

The layoff taught me that I'm more resilient than I think I am. I persevered through this whole issue and combated a lot of my perceptions of self-worth.

Before Tesla, I applied to about 250 jobs, and after Tesla, I applied to another 250.

It was not meant to be that I ended up at another internship, so I took that summer to really reflect on what I could do and what was actually within my control.

The layoff is not something you can control, but the way that you react is something you can control.

I started Career Now, a newsletter to help other students like myself who might have lacked career guidance from their family or education, or the time to focus on their early career journey because of family responsibilities, part-time jobs, or other commitments.

I wanted my newsletter to be an outlet where students can learn about these job opportunities and level the field with those who have more privilege, support, and guidance in their early career journey.

What I've accomplished for Career Now has a much greater impact than whatever I could have done at Tesla because I'm helping more than 73,000 students in my daily life.

I post content that encourages students on a daily basis. I share opportunities that these students would never have known if I hadn't posted about them.

I'm now a campus leader for Notion and working part-time as a content marketing intern at Siemens during the school year. Looking ahead, I plan to study abroad in Europe in the fall while continuing to document my recruitment journey for a social media summer internship next year.

A job is never fully secure, and Big Tech is especially volatile

No job in this economy right now is fully secure. Job hunting is so different with the power of AI. Many résumés are scrapped ahead of time, even before getting into the hands of recruiters.

Big Tech is also very volatile. The layoff that happened last summer was only a sneak peek into what is happening this year, with a lot of big companies laying off new grads and employees cutting a lot of departments that are now, quote unquote, replaceable with the power of artificial intelligence.

An internship was honestly the best time to be laid off. Heaven forbid I got laid off as a full time employee where I had a mortgage to pay, or a family to raise. I definitely had the least to lose.

I do encourage students to see a layoff as a pause instead of the end — more of a redirection rather than a sign that it's game over.

[TEXT]
Shareholders approved all proposals, confirming Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (“Faraday Future”) as the Company’s new majority and controlling shareholder.

Faraday Future will nominate a majority of board seats prior to November 20 as part of the Company’s strategic transformation.

The Company will host an official renaming and ticker activation ceremony at Nasdaq Headquarters in New York on November 20, adopting the new ticker symbol AIXC.

During the ceremony, the Company will unveil a new business model, ecosystem structure, and three-year development roadmap positioning AIxCrypto as a leading gateway to the AI × Web3 era .

The transition introduces cross-ecosystem enablement between the two companies.

Carlsbad, CA, Nov. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Qualigen Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: QLGN) (“Qualigen” or the “Company”) today announced the certified voting results of its Special Meeting of Stockholders. All proposals passed with majority approval.

As a result of the approved actions, Faraday Future is expected to become the Company’s majority and controlling shareholder with an estimated 55% direct equity ownership. Including affiliated stockholders such as YT Jia and Jerry Wang, this increases this amount to approximately 63%.

Faraday Future will designate the majority of the reconstituted Board of Directors. Governance restructuring will be completed ahead of the Company’s planned public renaming on November 20 to support execution of the new strategic direction.

As part of the ceremony, AIxCrypto will present its new business framework, ecosystem architecture, and three-year development roadmap.

This brand evolution signifies more than a change in name — it marks a strategic shift from traditional biotechnology into a Web3-driven decentralized artificial intelligence technology platform.

The transformation is expected to establish a reciprocal strategic enablement dynamic between AIxCrypto and Faraday Future, accelerating innovation, ecosystem integration, and long-term value creation. Additional details will be presented during the November 20 event.

The biggest investors in the world often have a greater focus on the private than public markets, but with the artificial intelligence boom set to reshape the economy for decades to come, they can't afford to not pay close attention to what's taking place with the largest publicly traded tech stocks, and they are not worried.
