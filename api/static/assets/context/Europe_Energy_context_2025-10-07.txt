[TITLE]Populist party of billionaire Andrej Babiš wins big in Czech parliamentary election:
[TEXT]
PRAGUE (AP) — Four years ago, it seemed that the days in politics of billionaire Andrej Babiš were numbered.

The ANO movement Babiš created (an abbreviation of Action of Dissatisfied Citizens that means “Yes” in Czech) to counter mainstream political parties was defeated in October 2021 by a coalition of pro-Western groups. The populist leader was expected to make good on his promise to quit, rather than end up in opposition.

Instead, he immediately launched an aggressive campaign blaming the ruling coalition for every problem, from the energy crisis to soaring inflation. He promised to revoke a much-resented increase in the state pension age and to end help for Ukraine, while ridiculing Prime Minister Petr Fiala for being a better prime minister of Ukraine than of Czechia.

On Saturday, ANO claimed its greatest election victory since its foundation in 2011.

“It’s for me the culmination of my political career,” said Babiš, 71, who was a member of the Communist Party before the 1989 Velvet Revolution in the former Czechoslovakia and has drawn comparisons to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Implications for Ukraine

Babiš’s victory deprives Ukraine of a staunch supporter and steers Czechia toward the pro-Russian path taken by Hungary and Slovakia.

He is expected to join the ranks of Viktor Orbán of Hungary and Robert Fico of Slovakia, whose countries have refused to provide military aid to Ukraine, continue to import Russian oil and oppose sanctions on Russia.

Babiš said he was planning to abandon an internationally recognized Czech initiative that acquires artillery shells for Ukraine on markets outside the EU. He also opposes a NATO commitment to significantly increase defense spending and criticized a deal to purchase 24 U.S. F-35 fighter jets.

In Europe, Babiš already joined forces with his friend Orbán to create a new alliance in the European Parliament, the “Patriots for Europe,” to represent hard-right groups critical of EU migration and climate policies, and favoring national sovereignty.

Tomáš Weiss, associate professor of international relations at Charles University in Prague, said he would expect Babiš to apply a pragmatic approach to the EU due to his business interests. Babiš might be a vocal EU critic at home but would not present big obstacles in Brussels, he said.

“Fico and Orbán might be celebrating but they’re not the players who matter at the European level,” Weiss said.

Troubles in the past

Babiš made his first impact on the Czech political scene in the 2013 election, finishing second and becoming finance minister.

Among his moves, he proposed lowering taxes on beer by more than half — a policy which resonated among the beer-loving Czechs.

As the owner of the Agrofert conglomerate of some 200 agriculture, food, chemical and media companies, Babiš faced allegations that finance ministry officials used their powers to force his business competitors into liquidation. Fearing a combination of wealth and power, Parliament approved a law that compelled Babiš to transfer Agrofert to an independent trust fund. He was eventually fired as finance minister in 2017 over unexplained business dealings.

His popularity was unharmed, and he won the 2017 election, becoming prime minister and forming a minority government with the Social Democrats that governed with the support of the maverick Communists.

During his turbulent term in office, police recommended that he should be indicted over alleged fraud involving EU subsidies. A quarter of a million people took to the streets — the biggest such demonstrations since 1989 — twice in 2019 to demand that Babis step down due to his scandals, including the conflict of interest over EU subsidies.

He was hit by yet another scandal in 2021 that linked him and hundreds of other wealthy people to offshore accounts in findings dubbed the “Pandora Papers.” He lost the parliamentary election a short time afterward and two years later was defeated in a run for the largely ceremonial post of president by Petr Pavel, a retired army general.

Troubles ahead

Babis bounced back but problems remain.

He still faces fraud charges in the EU subsidies case and the new Parliament will have to lift his official immunity for a court to issue a verdict.

He also has to meet the requirements of an amended conflict of interest law. The current stricter legislation does not allow the transfer of ownership to trust funds or relatives.

Without a majority in the lower house, Babiš prefers to govern alone, but his minority Cabinet would need the tacit support of the Freedom and Direct Democracy anti-migrant party and the right-wing Motorists for Themselves to win a mandatory parliamentary confidence vote to rule.

Another option for the three is to rule together with a comfortable majority. Babiš shares with the Motorists the rejection of EU climate and migration policies and other issues but the Freedom party wants to lead the country out of the EU and NATO, a red line for Babiš and the Motorists.

There are also questions over the stability of any support from the Freedom party, which ran on a joint ticket with three fringe extremists groups, with the possibility that disagreements over numerous issues might come to light soon.

“We’re entering an unknown future,” analyst Vladimíra Dvořáková from the Czech Technical University in Prague told Czech public television.

[TITLE]From fossil fuels to ‘green capitalism’: the dilemmas of a just energy transition:
[TEXT]
Extraction: The Frontiers of Green Capitalism Thea Riofrancos W. W. Norton & Company (2025)

It was meant to be the world’s grand fix for the climate crisis: nations would make their economies greener by transitioning to renewable-energy technologies, electrifying transport and digitalizing the global economy to reduce material use. After years of fraught negotiations, countries agreed to this global transition at a momentous summit in Paris in 2015. But the fix has proved to be more complex.

In Extraction, an illuminating examination of the emerging renewable economy, political scientist Thea Riofrancos takes a close look at one crucial element: lithium, which is essential for producing batteries and other technologies. Drawing on fieldwork with affected communities and analyses of projections that anticipate a massive increase in mining to propel emerging green technologies, she argues that the narrow focus on emissions has fuelled the illusion of “capitalism without carbon”, exposing a moral dilemma at the core of the green transition.

Why the green-technology race might not save the planet

Riofrancos challenges these assumptions and, working with specialists, models alternatives: more public transport, cycling, walking, denser cities, fewer cars and higher recycling rates. Instead of chasing a single net-zero future, in which the amount of carbon emissions emitted is balanced against the amount removed, she suggests multiple zero-emissions worlds that balance climate goals against the protection of people and ecosystems.

Throughout Extraction, the reader learns how treating carbon emissions as a purely technical problem has produced a race to procure lithium, opening up vulnerable regions to companies that often act like neo-colonial powers.

Chile provides a strong case study. Riofrancos focuses on the country’s lithium-rich Atacama Desert, a high-altitude, bone-dry landscape of “dazzling days and spectacularly starry nights”. Humans have lived there for at least 12,000 years. In fact, for 1,500 years, trade networks across the plateau linked the mountains to the Pacific Coastal Plain. Yet, as early as the sixteenth century, those seeking the region’s minerals described the landscape as barren and lifeless — a claim used to justify Spanish colonial rule and mineral extraction. After independence in 1818, the Chilean government recast the region as having “economic potential”.

Why the EU must reset its Green Deal — or be left behind

Riofrancos’s fieldwork highlights the science and technology of extracting and processing key minerals. Through interviews with Indigenous communities, environmentalists, union members, scientists, lawyers, regulators and corporate actors, she reveals competing agendas and visions of green futures.

It’s through these interviews that she first encounters her central dilemma: the clash between renewable energy and Indigenous rights and between climate action and biodiversity. She follows this tension from South America to decision-making centres in the European Union and the United States, where major powers are trying to ‘de-risk’ their economies by shifting supply chains — either towards allies or back home.

These strategies are a result of wealthy industrial nations belatedly waking up to the fact that China has leapfrogged them and scaled up the production of electric vehicles and renewables and secured dominance across supply chains, from mine to market. Importantly, and driven mainly by competition between the United States and China, this re-ordering of industrial leadership has fuelled geopolitical tensions. It has unravelled ties of interdependence and sparked a race for crucial minerals, as well as a battle over who will control the technological imperium.

Riofrancos’s close-up study of the lithium supply chain suggests that the worst is yet to come. Trade barriers and the growing reliance on transactional deals risk turning entire regions back into sites of exploitation, undermining hopes for a just transition to green energy.

[TITLE]ESG: The high price of good intentions * WorldNetDaily * by Tammy Nemeth, Real Clear Wire:
[TEXT]
This fall, the European Union’s (EU) government in Brussels is set to finalize a sweeping ESG “due diligence” directive that will attempt to reshape global business in Brussels’s image.

The controversial law, several years in the making, has faced stiff resistance from companies and policymakers both within and outside the EU because the directive forces large companies—including non-EU multinationals—to meticulously audit their human rights, emissions, and environmental footprints across entire value chains.

Faced with energy and defense realities in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, it has become a flashpoint for competing priorities within the EU: the Green Deal’s draconian climate action on one hand, and economic competitiveness on the other. Can a continent truly champion industrial competitiveness while imposing costly and burdensome climate rules that shift focus from manufacturing and innovation to an expanding compliance bureaucracy? Who truly benefits, and does this path risk sacrificing Europe’s industrial vitality on the altar of regulatory and climate idealism?

A lot has changed since Europe formally introduced the law – the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, or “CS3D” – on 23 February, 2022. Exactly one day after the legislative proposal was docketed for public comment, Russia launched its ground invasion of Ukraine, setting off a series of diplomatic, military, and energy crises in Europe.

Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe enjoyed plentiful natural gas supplied by a mostly reliable but not adversarial partner in Russia. This abundance allowed policymakers in Brussels to pursue ambitious green policies, positioning the continent at the forefront of global efforts to demonize fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.

The crown jewel of this era was CS3D, meticulously shaped from the 2018 OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. The European Commission’s intent was clear: CS3D would compel domestic and multinational businesses not only to comply with strict climate and human rights standards, but also to serve as global ambassadors of compliance-driven green commerce.

The promise of CS3D was always predicated on the notion that Europe, and multinational businesses, could afford to bear the cost of being the world’s climate conscience. And it is costly. For most businesses, the CS3D represents a seismic financial shift. Compliance means overhauling reporting systems, hiring armies of consultants, and enduring relentless audits. The Danish Presidency of the Council of the European Union’s own analysis estimates that a single company could spend up to EU 2.3 million annually in compliance. Other estimates suggest affected firms could see costs shoot up by 10 to 30 percent.

Oil and gas companies, already under the microscope for their emissions, face additional headaches: they must monitor and report on every supplier’s methane output, overhaul procurement protocols, and invest millions in new software and third-party verification. All companies must also provide a net zero transition plan annually updated to demonstrate fulfillment of emissions reduction targets or lack thereof. Failing to comply is no trivial matter—penalties can reach 5% of global net turnover, and civil liability for damages is now firmly on the table.

Operationally, firms will devote resources to ongoing risk assessment, staff training, and documentation stretching from the boardroom to the field. These are not one-off expenses: the directive requires annual updates, investment disclosures, and persistent scrutiny of supply chains and emissions reduction targets. The bureaucratic load is compounded by the need to chase down compliance across both upstream suppliers and downstream customers, often in countries with no direct link to EU regulation.

Thus, CS3D, by its very design, incentivizes a shift away from material production—the factories, smelters, refineries, and manufacturers that form the backbone of the European economy—toward a white-collar managerial economy, redirecting capital from the business of “building things” to the business of auditing, accounting, and legal compliance. It is a costly model that prioritizes greenhouse gas accountants over engineers and tradespeople at a time when EU leaders say the continent faces a potential war with Russia.

A path towards further deindustrialization is directly at odds with the EU’s “competitiveness” imperative. After Russia’s invasion disrupted gas supplies and exacerbated a cost-of-living crisis throughout the bloc, the European Commission requested an assessment from Mario Draghi, former European Central Bank President, of how to address Europe’s failing competitiveness. Draghi’s September 2024 report put into words what many other world leaders already knew: “the energy landscape has changed irreversibly with the Russian invasion of Ukraine […] fossil fuels will continue to play a central role.” But due to Europe’s decarbonization targets, “EU industries that use energy intensively face higher investment costs than their competitors,” Draghi wrote.

Draghi’s diagnosis of Europe’s self-inflicted stasis gave leaders in Brussels air cover to dethrone climate change as the EU’s top policymaking priority, focusing instead on competitiveness and self-defense. But despite recent rhetoric, Europe continues to forge ahead with its most onerous climate regulations, even as allied trading partners warn of impacts on Europe’s energy supply.

State-owned LNG supplier Qatar Energy, which supplies between 12 and 14% of the EU’s natural gas supply, said in December 2024 that the country would cease doing business with Europe rather than comply with CS3D’s extraterritorial demands. American supermajor ExxonMobil said the directive would “challenge” the US-EU energy deal, comments echoed by US Secretary Chris Wright. Notably, the US currently supplies 45% of the EU’s gas needs.

A second pivotal moment was the election of Donald Trump in November 2024. With the United States adopting a more skeptical and nationalistic stance on climate agreements, European regulators suddenly faced the real prospect of trade friction, energy supplier resistance, and diminished cooperation. CS3D is at the center of these tensions, an archaic holdover from Europe’s pre-war, transatlantic consensus.

In response, talk of “simplifying” CS3D and delaying its implementation until 2028 has gained momentum. Indeed, this fall, Brussels will roll out a “simplified” version of CS3D. The hard truth is that the best version of CS3D is no CS3D at all; but absent scrapping the directive altogether, Brussels must calculate how much of the law it can salvage without risking energy and trade partnerships.

If Brussels is playing a game of chicken, it’s a dangerous game. Reduced gas flows from the US and Qatar would intensify already crippling energy costs across the region, driving further cost-of-living increases in both household spending and industrial operating costs. As Russia continues to encroach on NATO’s eastern border, Europe could not pick a worse time to deprioritize industrial competitiveness seemingly to save face with the green lobby. European leaders know this – this fall, they have a chance to show it.

[TITLE]Balancing act: Can Turkey do without Russian energy? – DW – 10:
[TEXT]
Both the US and G7 nations have asked Turkey to stop buying Russian oil and gas. However, Turkey remains dependent on Russia for its energy and is pursuing a different strategy altogether.

The scene in the Oval Office as US President Donald Trump met Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan was noteworthy. Trump was effusive as he lavished praise on Erdogan in front of assembled journalists.

"It's a pleasure to be with President Erdoğan of Turkey," Trump said, "and we've been friends for a long time … he's a highly respected man. He's respected very much in his country and all throughout Europe."

He's doing an "amazing job," Trump added.

However all the sweeteners did come with a demand: Turkey should stop buying oil and gas from Russia.

There has also been increased pressure from the Group of Seven, or G7, nations around this topic.

Following a virtual meeting last week, finance ministers of the seven leading industrialized nations — Germany, the UK, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and the US — said they would take steps to increase pressure on Russia by targeting countries that are continuing to increase purchases of Russian oil or countries that are facilitating circumvention of energy sanctions.

Over half of oil imports from Russia

So far though Turkey hasn't responded to either Trump's requests or to the G7 statement. Then again maybe this shouldn't be surprising as Turkey is hugely dependent on Russia for its energy supplies.

According to Turkey's Energy Market Regulatory Authority, or EPDK, 66% of Turkish oil imports came from Russia last year. According to Turkish energy expert, Necdet Pamir, a year earlier, the number was 68%. At the end of 2022, it had been 41%.

Last year, Turkey also sourced 41% of its natural gas imports from Russia.

The high percentages are a direct consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Under sanctions from the European Union, Russia has been selling its oil at lower prices. Stopping Russian oil imports would not only jeopardize Turkey's energy security, it would also negate the price advantages Turkey is currently benefitting from.

Immediately after the Trump-Erdogan meeting, the Kremlin spoke out. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian gas pipelines to Turkey were operating at full capacity.

"We are continuing our trade and economic cooperation with the Republic of Turkey," Peskov said. "It is a sovereign state that decides for itself in which areas to cooperate with us. If certain types of trade in certain goods are considered profitable by the Turkish side, then it will continue to buy them."

Forcing buyers to abandon Russian gas is 'the simplest way is to force the entire world to pay more for American oil and LNG,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov complained Image: Mikhail Tereshchenko/TASS/dpa/picture alliance

A different strategy for Turkey

In fact, observers do not expect Turkey to stop buying Russian energy in the future. Instead the Turkish are quietly pursuing a different strategy: diversification.

During Erdogan's recent visit to the US, BOTAS, the state-owned company responsible for Turkey's oil and gas infrastructure and gas trade, announced two long-term contracts that would expand its sources of natural gas.

One was with US company Mercuria for a total of 70 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas, to run for 20 years, starting 2026. The other was with Australian firm Woodside Energy, for 5.8 billion cubic meters of LNG.

The Turkish government has been making significant efforts recently to diversify its energy sources in order to ensure energy security, notes Kadri Tastan, a senior non-resident fellow with the German Marshall Fund's Brussels office. At the same time it's also been promoting domestic energy sources and renewables.

A report by the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects indicated that in 2022, fossil fuels still made up around 84% of Turkey's energy market while renewable energies sit at around 16%.

Defense contractors brace for climate threats despite Trump's denials

by Bridget Erin Craig

Washington DC (UPI) Oct 2, 2025

President Donald Trump repeatedly calls climate change a "hoax," but the nation's five largest defense contractors say they are challenged to balance the Earth's warming with operational demands, technological adaptations and emission liabilities, according to a review of their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
