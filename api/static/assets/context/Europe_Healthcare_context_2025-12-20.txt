[TITLE]Athira Pharma Announces Exclusive License to Lasofoxifene Phase 3 Development Program for Metastatic Breast Cancer Candidate and a Financing for up to $236 Million:
[TEXT]
Phase 3 Development Program of Novel Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) Represents Potential Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity as Treatment Option for Patients with ESR1-Mutations

Financing Co-Led by Commodore Capital, Perceptive Advisors and TCGX Supports Development of Lasofoxifene through Phase 3 Clinical Topline Data Readout and Regulatory Milestones

Conference Call Today at 8:30 am Eastern Time

BOTHELL, Wash., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Athira Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATHA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of novel therapeutics for high unmet medical needs, today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire the rights for the development and commercialization of lasofoxifene, a promising clinical asset in a potentially registrational Phase 3 trial. The ongoing Phase 3 ELAINE-3 clinical trial (NCT05696626) is greater than 50% enrolled with data expected in mid-2027.

Athira has acquired an exclusive global license (excluding Asia and certain countries in the Middle East) from Sermonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for rights to develop and commercialize lasofoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for the potential treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

In conjunction with this transaction, Athira also announced an upfront financing of $90 million in private placement financing of common stock and warrants, with the warrants providing, if exercised, up to an additional $146 million to support development of the new program through key clinical and regulatory milestones. The financing was co-led by Commodore Capital, Perceptive Advisors, and TCGX, with participation from ADAR1, Blackstone Multi-Asset Investing, Kalehua Capital, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Spruce Street Capital, and 9vc. The Company anticipates the upfront financing will support lasofoxifene development through its topline data readout and key regulatory milestones, with sufficient capital for runway into 2028.

“Today marks a defining moment for our company. This agreement for the rights to the Phase 3 lasofoxifene program for metastatic breast cancer is a significant step in building a pipeline with the potential to change lives and create enduring value,” said Mark Litton, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Athira. “This program provides a near-term opportunity to generate pivotal data necessary for the approval of lasofoxifene and to establish it as the new standard of care to treat ESR1-mutant breast cancer in patients who have progressed on aromatase inhibitors and prior CDK4/6 inhibitors. Supported by compelling Phase 2 clinical data and backed by blue-chip investors, we have a clear development strategy and are committed to advancing therapies that matter to patients while delivering value for our shareholders.”

“In the ELAINE-2 clinical trial, lasofoxifene demonstrated the potential to provide meaningful combination efficacy with 13 months of progression-free survival in heavily pre-treated second- and third-line ESR1-mutated metastatic breast cancer patients. We believe lasofoxifene has the potential to be the preferred endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients given its tissue-selective SERM profile may allow for the preservation of estrogen function in non-breast tissue, which provides tolerability and potential bone protection and quality of life benefits,” noted David Portman, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Sermonix. “With the Phase 3 trial now more than 50% enrolled, we look forward to delivering pivotal data in mid-2027 and advancing toward a regulatory submission.”

“We are excited to announce this financing to help accelerate the development of lasofoxifene,” said Cariad Chester, Managing Partner at TCGX. “With its differentiated profile, lasofoxifene has the potential to become the endocrine therapy of choice for the approximately 40% of breast cancer patients who develop ESR1 mutations and have progressed on aromatase inhibitors and prior CDK4/6 inhibitors. The accomplished team at Athira is committed to efficiently executing the ongoing pivotal trial of lasofoxifene, and we believe, lasofoxifene, may become the treatment of choice for oncologists and patients who are battling this challenging disease.”

“The scientific and clinical data supporting lasofoxifene are compelling, and we are confident in Athira’s leadership to drive the Company’s next chapter with clarity, urgency, and excellence. We’re proud to support this evolution and excited by the opportunity to deliver meaningful impact for patients and shareholders alike,” stated Joseph Edelman, Founder and CEO of Perceptive Advisors.

Details of the Transaction

[TITLE]Ex-FDA Commissioners Against Higher Vaccine Standards Took $6 Million From COVID Vaccine Makers:
[TEXT]
Ten of the twelve former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioners and acting commissioners opposed to the Trump administration’s stiffer standards for vaccines quietly disclosed ties to the pharmaceutical industry, a Daily Caller News Foundation review shows.

The FDA old guard criticized the new leadership in a Dec. 3 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) letter over a higher regulatory bar for vaccines, namely the expectation that most new vaccine approvals will require randomized clinical trials, arguing it could hamper the market.

“Insisting on long, expensive outcomes studies for every updated formulation would delay the arrival of better-matched vaccines when new outbreaks emerge or when additional groups of patients could benefit,” the former commissioners wrote. “Abandoning the existing methods won’t ‘elevate vaccine science’ … It will subject vaccines to a substantially higher and more subjective approval bar.”

But while the former commissioners disclosed their conflicts of interest to the medical journal — per standard practice in scientific publishing — reporters didn’t relay them to the broader public in reports in the Washington Post, STAT News and CNN.

Abivax Announces Acceptance of 22 Abstracts Evaluating Obefazimod in Inflammatory Bowel Disease at ECCO 2026, Featuring an Oral Presentation on Preclinical Anti-Fibrotic Findings

Breadth of Scientific Evidence: The acceptance of 1 oral presentation, 5 digital oral presentations and 16 posters reflect an expanding dataset for obefazimod, including additional efficacy, safety, and cytokine data from the Phase 3 ABTECT Induction Trials in moderate-to-severely active ulcerative colitis (UC)

Novel Anti-Fibrotic Preclinical Findings: Oral presentation on Saturday, February 21, 2026, “Obefazimod shows first evidence of anti-fibrotic activity in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease," will disclose new preclinical data addressing a critical complication in Crohn's disease (CD)

PARIS, France – December 17, 2025 – 10:05 pm CET – Abivax SA (Euronext Paris: FR0012333284 – ABVX / Nasdaq: ABVX) (“Abivax” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, today announced that 22 scientific abstracts detailing advancements in the understanding of obefazimod for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will be presented at The European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization’s (ECCO) 21st Annual Congress taking place February 18-21, 2026 in Stockholm, Sweden.

Subgroup Analyses from Phase 3 ABTECT Induction Trials

The accepted abstracts, based on subgroup analyses from ABTECT Induction Trials, illustrate obefazimod’s clinical activity across a wide range of patient subpopulations, demonstrate downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IL-6), and highlight early symptomatic improvement along with other clinically meaningful benefits. The data also reinforces obefazimod’s favorable tolerability profile.

Obefazimod Shows First Evidence of Activity in Preclinical Fibrotic Models

The upcoming oral presentation on anti-fibrotic activity addresses a significant unmet medical need in IBD. Fibrosis, or the excessive formation of scar tissue, is a serious complication, particularly in patients with CD. This scarring can lead to strictures (narrowing of the intestine) that often necessitate surgery. To date, no efficacious anti-fibrotic treatment is available for IBD patients.

The objective of the preclinical study was to assess the anti-fibrotic effects of obefazimod in an in vitro fibrosis model using human small-intestinal fibroblasts and in an in vivo TNBS-colitis mouse model. The data from this study, titled “Obefazimod shows first evidence of anti-fibrotic activity in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease,” will be presented during the oral presentation session on Saturday, February 21, 2026.
