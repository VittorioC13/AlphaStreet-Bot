[TITLE]Toyota CEO goes full MAGA at NASCAR event as carmaker unveils $912M investment in US manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Toyota on Tuesday unveiled a $912 million investment in US manufacturing, days after CEO Akio Toyoda hosted a red, white and blue NASCAR event in Japan while sporting a Trump-Vance shirt and red MAGA hat.

The Sunday spectacle at Toyota’s Fuji Speedway featured top drivers, a crowd waving American flags and an appearance from US Ambassador to Japan George Glass, according to Automotive News.

The top Toyota exec nodded to recent US-Japan trade tensions during his bold display of pro-Trump sentiment.

“I’m not here to argue whether tariffs are good or bad. Every national leader wants to protect their own industry,” Toyoda said ahead of the endurance race.

“We are exploring ways to make tariffs a winner for everyone. The people we want most to be winners are our customers.”

Japan is facing a roughly 15% baseline tariff on auto imports, slashed down from 27.5% as part of a trade agreement in September.

“Start your engines!” Glass’ account tweeted Sunday alongside pics of him and Toyoda, who’s the grandson of Toyota Motors founder Kiichiro Toyoda. “Looking forward to celebrating the culture of [US] motorsports again next year” as part of America’s 250th-anniversary festivities in Japan, he added.

Toyota, the second-largest seller of new vehicles in the US behind General Motors, on Tuesday announced its nearly $1 billion investment will ramp up hybrid vehicle production across the Southern US.

It’s part of a previously announced plan by the Japanese automaker to invest up to $10 billion in the US by 2030, which President Trump revealed last month. Most of the investments are expected to be completed by 2027.

Toyota already leads hybrid vehicle production with more than 51% market share through the third quarter of this year, according to Motor Intelligence data.

But the company is looking to further increase manufacturing of hybrid-compatible engines and vehicles at certain American facilities.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our US manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president of manufacturing operations, said in a statement.

“Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our US footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.”

Of the investments announced Tuesday, the largest is $453 million toward Toyota’s Buffalo, W. Va., plant to ramp up the assembly of four-cylinder, hybrid-compatible engines.

Another $204.4 million is going toward the automaker’s Georgetown, Ky., plant to increase production of the same engines.

Toyota says it is also sending $125 million to expand production of Corolla vehicles and add hybrid vehicle production at its Blue Springs, Miss., factory.

The automaker is also investing $71.4 million in its Jackson, Tenn., plant and $57.1 million in its Troy, Mo., facility.

The investments are expected to create 252 new jobs, according to Toyota.

[TITLE]AI-powered manufacturing platform Keychain raises $10m in funding:
[TEXT]
Artificial Intelligence-powered manufacturing platform Keychain has raised $10 million (€8.6 million) to support its expansion, launching its next-generation supply chain and product management platform as it targets private label brands.

British supermarket giant Tesco is among the investors of the fund that is backing this latest capital raising by company cofounded by Irish entrepreneur Oisin Hanrahan.

The new operating system, Keychain360, will help give retailers full control over their supply chains, helping them manage their private label brands more efficiently and reduce product development timelines.

Keychain, initially launched in the US before it expanded into Ireland in September before following with the UK this month.

“Keychain 360 is a true supply chain insights tool for the biggest brands and retailers in the world. We’ve already got some of them using it,” explained Mr Hanrahan, saying that he expected it to significantly expand the business.

“We think that the world is moving more and more to private label and to outsource.”

The company is planning further expansion in Europe.“We have a lot more expansion to do,” he said. “There’s a lot more features and there’s a lot more markets that people are pushing us to go into.”

Keychain360 is the third element of Keychain’s system that puts brands, retailers and manufacturers in touch with manufacturing partners, cutting out brokers and making the process more efficient and cost-effective, according to the company.

The launch is part of the company’s European expansion. Keychain counts eight of the 10 top US retailers among its customers, with seven of the top 10 CPG brands, including General Mills, the Hershey Company, and Schreiber Foods, also using the platform.

It has raised $78 million to date, including a $30 million Series B funding round led by Wellington Management and existing investor BoxGroup.

Among the investors backing the latest funding round is W23 Global, a fund backed by well-known groups such as Tesco, Ahold Delhaize, Woolworths Group, Empire Company Limited and Shoprite Group.

“Keychain’s AI-powered platform streamlines private label sourcing and enables retailers to bring quality private label products to customers faster and more efficiently,” said Ingrid Maes, chief executive and chief information officer of W23 Global.

[TITLE]Government selects 17 projects worth ₹7,172 crore investment in electronics manufacturing:
[TEXT]
The Centre on Monday approved 17 projects entailing around ₹7,172 crore investment across six categories under the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS), underlining India’s resolve and its decisive push into producing high-value components.

These projects will lead to production of electronics worth ₹65,111 crore and 11,808 direct jobs cumulatively.

The ECMS would drive the next phase of value chain integration and steer India’s electronics manufacturing to $500 billion by 2030–31, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw said here.

The approved units are spread across nine states -- Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh, reinforcing the government’s commitment to balanced regional growth and creation of high-skill jobs beyond metropolitan clusters, he said.

The second tranche of the scheme includes a wide range of components and sub-assemblies, such as India’s first-ever Optical Transceiver (SFP) manufacturing facilities by Jabil Circuit India and Zetchem Supply Chain Services; Oscillators for precise timing applications in communication devices, computers, and industrial electronics by Rakon India Private Limited; high-end precision enclosures for laptops and smartwatches by Aequs Consumer Products; and camera modules by ASUX Safety Components, Uno Minda Limited, and Syrma Mobility.

Meanwhile, talking about electronics manufacturing in India, Vaishnaw said that developing design teams is crucial for long-term success and global competitiveness because the way geo-economics are emerging, the challenges will be bigger.

He also urged the industry to focus on getting six sigma quality in every product that they manufacture and support each other in the process.

“Make sure that you hold hands and get them up the value chain. That will define your success in the coming years because sooner or later when the world the way geopolitics, the way geo-economics are emerging, the challenges will be bigger and in those challenging periods your ability to have a good control of the supply chain behind you will define your resilience and will define your ability to compete during the difficult times,” Vaishnaw said.

He added that with schemes like ECMS, India could get some of the global large manufacturers of finished products into the country, and that has given the opportunity to create the market and demand for components.

On quality manufacturing, he said, already the manufacturing sector has created new standards, especially in the automobile sector, aerospace sector, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, where the quality is today compared with the global benchmarks.

The government also continues to focus on skilling of youth using these facilities and capabilities. “Hopefully very soon we’ll come out with a new skilling framework also for electronics manufacturing where we will be tying up with certain organisations who have done very good work in the social fields,” he added.

[TITLE]FDIC Sues Capital One in Dispute Over Special Assessment for 2023 Bank Failures:
[TEXT]
Another lawsuit has reportedly been filed in a dispute between the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Capital One over how much the bank should pay to help bail out depositors of two financial institutions that failed in 2023: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

The FDIC filed a lawsuit Monday (Nov. 17) alleging that Capital One paid nearly $100 million less than it should have to help with the bailout, Reuters reported Tuesday (Nov. 18).

The regulator said in its suit that Capital One underreported its uninsured deposits by excluding a $56 billion position between two subsidiaries, according to the report.

The FDIC uses deposit data to calculate the special assessments it charges banks to replenish its deposit insurance fund after bank failures, the report said.

The regulator alleged in its suit that Capital One’s exclusion of those uninsured deposits resulted in the bank calculating a special assessment at $324.84 million rather than the correct $474.08 million, per the report.

Capital One did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment.

It was reported in September that Capital One sued the FDIC, alleging that the regulator overcharged the bank by $149.2 million during the special assessment.

Capital One alleged in its complaint that the FDIC inflated the assessment by incorrectly counting the $56.2 billion of positions between the bank’s subsidiaries as uninsured deposits.

The bank also said in its complaint that it had communicated with the FDIC about this issue for two years but that the regulated continued to seek the special assessment “based on its erroneous calculation.”

The FDIC announced in May 2023 that it planned to extract $15.8 billion in extra fees over two years to recoup its losses after the rescues of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

The regulator said 113 banks would pay this special assessment, starting in early 2024, with those that have at least $50 billion in assets covering 95% of the cost. Banks with less than $5 billion in assets were exempt from the assessment.

The FDIC also said in May 2023 that the banking crisis had strained the government’s deposit insurance fund.

[TITLE]Federal government shutdown delayed capital for over 100 small businesses in Florida, SBA says:
[TEXT]
ORLANDO, Fla. — The recent federal government shutdown delayed access to federally guaranteed loans for small businesses in Florida, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration.

During the shutdown, Florida small businesses lost $461 million in federal loans, while nationwide, the SBA reported that $5.3 billion in lending was blocked.

The SBA estimated that Florida small businesses missed out on tens of millions of dollars in federally guaranteed loans during the shutdown. These loans are typically used to hire employees, fund expansions, or cover operating costs.

The SBA’s 7(a) and 504 loan programs offer federally guaranteed financing vital for small businesses to grow or stabilize. President Trump signed a funding bill on November 12 to reopen the government, ending the shutdown and allowing the SBA to resume processing loans applications.

[TITLE]Doroni Aerospace Launches a Reg CF Raise to Accelerate Commercial Production of H1-X Personal Aircraft:
[TEXT]
Coral Springs, USA, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FAA-Certified Aviation Startup Is Raising Capital to Deliver the First Generation of Personal eVTOL Aircraft in $1T+ Urban Air Mobility Market

Doroni Aerospace, the advanced air mobility company pioneering personal electric flight, has launched a new Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) raise to scale toward commercial production of its flagship personal eVTOL aircraft, the Doroni H1-X.

After eight years of R&D and rigorous flight testing, Doroni has developed a first-of-its-kind personal aircraft designed for everyday people. With intuitive controls and advanced safety systems, the H1-X is positioned to become a breakthrough in the $1 trillion Urban Air Mobility (UAM) sector.

With the H1-X showroom model nearly completed and set to debut early next year, this new capital raise supports Doroni’s transition from prototyping to production. FAA-certified and already approved for manned flight testing, Doroni is building for a future where short-distance air travel is safe, personal, and practical.

The H1-X is engineered for real-world use, built to fit in a two-car garage and takeoff and land directly from driveways. From there, it can reach top speeds of 120 mph, travel up to 100 miles on a single charge, and recharge in as little as 25 minutes. With enclosed ducted fans instead of exposed propellers, it offers increased safety and efficiency. And after just 25 hours of training, anyone can pilot this joystick-driven, user-friendly aircraft.

“While the industry races to build flying taxis, we are focused on something far more transformative: empowering individuals with the freedom of personal flight,” said Doron Merdinger, Founder & CEO of Doroni Aerospace. “We aren’t just creating a new vehicle; we are creating a new era of mobility where people take back control of their time and their travel.

Interest is already mounting. Doroni has received over 600 pre-orders, representing an estimated $175M+ in potential revenue, and is targeting first deliveries in 2028.

Regulatory advancements are now unlocking certification for personal eVTOL aircraft, making the dream of flying your own vehicle a reality. Doroni is a key player in this revolution, having successfully achieved one of the first-ever manned test flights in the U.S.

Doroni’s investment round is now open to the public. Learn more and invest at invest.doroni.io
