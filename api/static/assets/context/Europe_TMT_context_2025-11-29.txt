[TITLE]Exclusive-Huawei, ZTE seal 5G deals in Vietnam after US tariffs, as ties with China warm​:
[TEXT]
By Francesco Guarascio

HANOI (Reuters) -China's leading telecommunication firms Huawei and ZTE have won a string of contracts this year to supply 5G equipment in Vietnam, in another sign of Hanoi's strengthening bonds with Beijing, stirring concern among Western officials, seven people with direct ​knowledge of the situation told Reuters.

For years, Vietnam was seen as reluctant to use Chinese technology in sensitive infrastructure, but in recent months it ‌has embraced Chinese tech companies as sometimes frosty relations with its northern neighbour have warmed while ties with Washington have soured over tariffs on Vietnamese goods.

While Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia secured contracts for Vietnam'‌s 5G core infrastructure, with U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm providing network equipment, Chinese companies have begun winning smaller tenders with state-owned operators, so far unreported public procurement data shows.

A consortium including Huawei was awarded a $23 million contract for 5G equipment in April, weeks after the White House announced tariffs on Vietnamese goods. ZTE has won at least two contracts, one last week, totalling more than $20 million for 5G antennas. The first publicly disclosed deal came in September, a month after U.S. tariffs took effect.

Reuters ⁠could not establish whether the timing of these wins was linked ‌to U.S. tariffs, but the deals raised concerns among Western officials.

The exclusion of Chinese contractors from Vietnam's digital infrastructure, including undersea fibre-optic cables, has long been identified by Washington as a key condition for support in advanced technologies.

Huawei and ZTE ‍are banned from U.S. telecom networks as an "unacceptable risk" to national security. Sweden and other European countries have similar restrictions.

Ericsson declined to comment on Chinese companies, but said it was "fully committed to support its customers in Vietnam."

Huawei, ZTE, Nokia, Qualcomm, the U.S. embassy in Vietnam, China's embassy, Sweden's ​foreign ministry or Vietnam's tech ministry responded to requests for comment.

VIETNAM-CHINA TIES WARM

The unaligned Southeast Asian nation is a crucial battleground in the competition for global influence.‌ Its proximity to China has made it a major industrial hub for multinationals such as Apple, Samsung and Nike, which rely on Chinese components and Western consumers.

Under Western pressure, Vietnam long took "a wait-and-see approach" to Chinese technology, said Nguyen Hung, a specialist in supply chains at RMIT University Vietnam. But "Vietnam has its own priorities," he added, noting the new deals could spur deeper economic integration with China.

European stocks edged up on Thursday although traders noted that activity was “muted” as Wall Street was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday in the US.

DUBLIN

Traders said the Irish market had a quiet day, partly blaming the US Thanksgiving holiday.

Insurer FBD Holdings rose 4.17 per cent to €15. Energy investor, Greencoat Renewables added 1.72 per cent to 71 cent.

PTSB shed 1.59 per cent to €3.09. There was little activity in its rivals. AIB edged 0.86 per cent up to €8.755, Bank of Ireland rose 0.41 per cent to €15.91.

LONDON

Gambling software specialist Playtech surged 8.58 per cent to 278.5 pence sterling despite British chancellor Rachel Reeves’ plan to boost betting tax.

Britain will increase betting duty from April 2027, exempting horse racing and wagers placed in bookie shops.

The news hit other gambling stocks. William Hill owner, Evoke, which runs several online casino businesses, was 4.09 per cent down at 29.3p ahead of the close of business. Casino owner Rank Group slid 9.3 per cent to 107p.

However, Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment, whose main listing is in New York, climbed 2.2 per cent 15,460p.

Banks emerged as budget winners. Lloyds Banking Group was up 3 per cent at 96.6p, NatWest gained 2.2 per cent to 632.4p and Barclays added 1.7 per cent to 429.95p.

St James’s Place, seen as a beneficiary from changes aimed at boosting contributions to stock and shares savings products, rose 2 per cent to 1,388 pence.

Centrica, owner of Irish electricity and gas supplier, Bord Gáis Energy, added 2.83 per cent to 170.7p.

Housebuilder Persimmon advanced 3.1 per cent to 1,342p.

Miner Rio Tinto slid 1.94 per cent to 5,355p on a tough day for the industry.

EUROPE

Shares in Italian lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena tumbled after it announced that chief executive Luigi Lovaglio had been notified he is under investigation for alleged market manipulation and obstructing regulators in the bank’s takeover of rival Mediobanca.

Its stock fell as much as 7 per cent during trade on Thursday, but had recovered some ground by the close to trade at €8.33, more than 4.5 per cent off its opening quote.

Monte Paschi, one of the world’s oldest banks, completed the €17 billion acquisition of Mediobanca in September, creating Italy’s third-largest lender by assets in a deal backed by the Italian government under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

News agency Bloomberg reported that global equities were holding firm after four days of gains, following a recovery fuelled by bets that the Federal Reserve – the US central bank – would cut interest rates faster than previously thought.

The MSCI All Country World Index was little changed after trimming its drop for November to 0.4 per cent in the prior sessions. The gauge had been down nearly 4 per cent for the month just over a week ago. European and Asian benchmarks posted modest moves, with US markets closed for Thanksgiving. S&P 500 futures were steady.

In another sign that risk appetite is returning, Bitcoin traded above $91,000 for the first time in a week. The dollar paused a two-day retreat.

The CAC 40 in Paris closed little changed, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt gained 0.2 per cent.

European Central Bank officials said a “broadly unchanged outlook” provided the basis for its decision to leave interest rates unchanged at its most recent meeting, despite acknowledging two-sided risks to inflation, according to minutes from October’s meeting.

US markets were closed for the Thanksgiving public holiday.

[TITLE]Will boats be a breakthrough for 3D printing tech?:
[TEXT]
Will boats be a breakthrough for 3D printing tech?

1 day ago Share Save Matthew Kenyon Technology Reporter, Delft, Netherlands Share Save

The sledgehammer test

The final test was a blunt one. Maarten Logtenberg wielded a sledgehammer, which simply bounced off the sample, barely leaving a scratch. After two years of experimentation, the material was finally right: a particular mix of thermoplastics and fibreglass that is strong, has no need of extra coating to protect it from sunlight, and is resistant to fouling and marine growth. The perfect base, says Mr Logtenberg, from which to 3D print a boat. Boats need to withstand the unforgiving nature of the marine environment. It's one of the reasons why boatbuilding is a notoriously labour-intensive business. But after months of tweaking the chemistry, it took just four days for the first hull to roll off the printer at the new factory that Mr Logtenberg and his colleagues run. "We're automating almost 90% of the boat-building process, and in superfast time," he says. "Normally it takes weeks to build a hull. We print one now every week." It's the kind of story that 3D printing has long promised. A quick, labour-saving production process that drastically reduces costs.

Those promises haven't always been fulfilled – but Mr Logtenberg is convinced that the maritime sector is one where 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, can play a transformational role. Mr Logtenberg is the co-founder of CEAD, a company that designs and builds large-format 3D printers at its base in the Dutch town of Delft. Until now, its business has been to provide the printers for others to use, but with boatbuilding CEAD decided to get involved in production as well. "3D printed boats still need to be accepted by the market," says Mr Logtenberg. "People are not going to invest and then just hope that the market will develop. They would rather buy in capacity first. [So] instead of just building machines, we're going to do it ourselves."

CEAD The printer builds the boat one layer at a time

Traditional fibreglass boat building requires a mould and considerable manual work to make sure the vessel is of the required strength. In additive manufacturing, the work has already been done at the design stage, in creating the software and the printer itself (which is labour intensive). 3D printers work by building up tiny layers of the basic material, to a predetermined digital design. Each layer then bonds to the previous one to allow the creation of a single, seamless object. In the production phase, as long as there is a supply of the base material, there is little or no need for human intervention. The design can also be adjusted without the need for major changes in the build process.

Much 3D printing operates on a relatively small scale – dentistry is one area where it has made a major impact. To create a boat capable of operating in real world conditions is a different challenge. CEAD's largest 3D printer is nearly 40m (131ft) long, and has been used by a customer in Abu Dhabi to print an electric ferry. And in the 12 months since they have been operating the Marine Application Centre in Delft, they have already built a prototype 12m fast boat, similar to a RIB, for the Dutch Navy. "Normally when the Navy buys a boat, it takes them years before they receive it and they pay quite some money," says Mr Logtenberg. "We did it in six weeks and for a very limited budget. And we can learn from it and build another one in six weeks and even recycle the first one." Another fast growth area is the use of unmanned vessels – nautical drones. CEAD recently took part in a test with Nato Special Forces in which drones were built on site in a matter of hours, with designs changing according to operational requirements. The ability to relocate production makes 3D printing incredibly flexible, according to Mr Logtenberg. Even a substantial printer can be carried in a shipping container and taken much closer to the end user. "It doesn't matter whether it's a 6m small work boat or a 12m military boat. The machine just takes it all as long as we have the design. "The only transport we need to do is the base material, which comes in big bags and it's very transport efficient, compared to a boat."

Matthew Kenyon Maarten Logtenberg stands with an 8m-long printed hull

Raw Idea Raw Idea uses recycled plastic in the hulls of its boats

Not far from CEAD, in the port city of Rotterdam, a company called Raw Idea and their 'Tanaruz' brand are looking at making a similar impact in the leisure market, especially rentals. "Consumers are hesitant [because of the novelty], but the rental market is really keen," says Joyce Pont, Raw Idea's managing director. "It's marketing, you can go to the socials and say, 'we've got a 3D printed boat', and everybody wants to look at and touch that boat." Another selling point is that Raw Idea uses a mix of glass fibre and recycled consumer plastics (fizzy drinks bottles and so on). That's one reason why the price is currently comparable to a traditionally-built boat, because recycled material costs more to buy. But Ms Pont says scale and flexibility will bring costs down significantly. "I'm convinced that in five years from now, 3D printed boats will take over the market for the fast-driving boat, like work boats, like speed boats," she tells me.

[TITLE]Telehealth Usage Disparities in Israel in Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Cohort Study of Intersectional Sociodemographic Patterns and Health Equity Implications:
[TEXT]
Conclusions: Telehealth expansion benefits remain unevenly distributed across populations in Israel’s universal health care system. Significant disparities along age, socioeconomic, cultural, and geographic lines suggest that digital health innovations may widen existing health care inequities without interventions. Intersectional disparities require multidimensional approaches to overlapping barriers. Health care systems must intentionally address equity considerations to ensure digital health and telehealth integration reduces, not worsens, existing health care disparities in routine care delivery.

Results: Telehealth usage among unique members more than doubled from 4.06% (20,264/499,607) pre-COVID-19 to 9.38% (46,868/499,607) post-COVID-19. Significant intersectional disparities emerged across multiple dimensions. In the post-COVID-19 period, young adults (25‐35 years) used telehealth at 3.1 times the rate of older adults (≥70 years; 18,333/102,533, 17.9% vs 4129/72,280, 5.7%). Women consistently showed higher usage than men (26,702/258,471, 10.3% vs 20,166/241,136, 8.4% post-COVID-19). Profound socioeconomic disparities persisted, with high socioeconomic status members using telehealth at nearly 4 times the rate of low socioeconomic status members (19,064/172,011, 11.1% vs 1328/56,154, 2.4% post-COVID-19). Cultural differences were striking: religious Jewish sector members demonstrated nearly 10-fold higher usage than Arab and Bedouin members (904/7630, 11.8% vs 1125/76,895, 1.5% post-COVID-19). A U-shaped relationship with peripherality (geographic distance from major urban centers and service availability) persisted after adjusting for socioeconomic status. In geographic analyses, this pattern remained across locations. After-hours telehealth usage declined from 65% (324,744/499,607) of all telehealth visits pre-COVID-19 to 49% (244,807/499,607) post-COVID-19, indicating telehealth’s evolution from an after-hours alternative to an integrated health care component. Multivariable analysis confirmed these disparities remained significant after adjusting for demographic and health factors.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using health and administrative data from the electronic database of Clalit Health Services’ Sharon-Shomron District in Israel. The study population comprised 499,607 adult members (≥25 years; mean age 50.6, SD 16.5 years) with continuous enrollment from March 2019 to February 2022. We analyzed telehealth usage across 3 periods that are pre-COVID-19 (March 2019-February 2020), COVID-19 (March 2020-February 2021), and post-COVID-19 (March 2021-February 2022). Telehealth services included telephone consultations, video consultations, and TYTO (Tytocare) remote diagnostic device usage. Primary outcomes were telehealth usage rates and after-hours usage patterns. We used descriptive statistics, temporal trend analysis, and multivariable logistic regression with bootstrapping.

Objective: This study aimed to examine telehealth usage patterns across sociodemographic groups in Israel’s universal health system to identify equity issues. We investigated variations across intersecting demographic characteristics during pre-, mid-, and post-COVID-19 periods and assessed evolving after-hours usage patterns.

Background: Telehealth has become a transformative health care delivery approach post the COVID-19 pandemic. Although telehealth improves health care access and reduces disparities, mounting evidence suggests usage patterns may exacerbate pre-existing health care inequities. Understanding these patterns across diverse populations is crucial for equitable digital health implementation.

Introduction

Background

Telehealth has emerged as a transformative approach to health care delivery, particularly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic [ , ]. While this digital modality offers potential solutions to health care access challenges by connecting patients with providers regardless of geographic constraints, growing evidence suggests that telehealth adoption and usage patterns reflect and potentially amplify existing disparities within health care systems [ , ].

The concept of telehealth—the delivery of health care services through information and communication technologies across distance [ ]—has transformed from a convenient alternative to a fundamental component of modern health care systems [ ]. This digital transformation promises to revolutionize health care delivery by offering patients real-time clinician access without physical clinic visits [ , ], potentially increasing care access and reducing health disparities among rural and underserved populations [ - ].

Telehealth provides substantial benefits, particularly for nonemergency care, reducing health center resource usage while improving access and ensuring care continuity [ , ]. It offers expanded access to specialists and demonstrates cost savings with equal or superior care quality compared to traditional care models [ - ]. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered exponential implementation, making telehealth exceptionally valuable during mandated social isolation [ ]. Although in-person visits have resumed, telemedicine remains integral to health care delivery [ ]. However, significant barriers persist for technologically challenged individuals, those with limited health literacy, and patients experiencing operational difficulties [ - ].

The rapid telehealth expansion raises critical equity concerns. People with limited digital literacy, inadequate access to digital devices or reliable internet, and those with limited language proficiency face unique challenges. Research confirms that racial and ethnic minorities, lower-income individuals, and rural residents have significantly lower broadband access rates [ , ]—a prerequisite for effective telehealth engagement.

Health equity, defined as the absence of avoidable and unfair health differences between population groups [ ], stands at the center of telehealth evaluation. Equity in telehealth requires acknowledging that different populations may need different levels of support to achieve comparable health care outcomes [ , ], contrasting with equality’s emphasis on uniform resource distribution [ , ]. The World Health Organization identifies complex social determinants of health that significantly impact health outcomes [ ].

The concept of intersectionality [ ] provides a critical framework for understanding how overlapping sociodemographic characteristics create unique experiences of advantage or disadvantage in telehealth access [ , ]. When applied to telehealth, intersectionality reveals that factors such as age, race or ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and geographic location interact in complex ways that influence health care engagement patterns [ - , , ].

Global Perspectives and Intersectional Frameworks

Research has identified concerning patterns in telehealth adoption: lower usage among older adults [ , ], racial and ethnic minorities [ , ], individuals with lower incomes [ , ], those with limited English proficiency [ , ], and rural residents [ , ]. These disparities correlate with broader health care service usage differences and health outcomes [ , ].

The digital divide significantly influences telehealth usage patterns. Research by Perzynski et al [ ] found that patients with limited digital access were less likely to use patient portals, while Ramsetty and Adams [ ] documented how technological barriers intersect with social determinants of health to exacerbate health care disparities. These technological disparities cannot be viewed in isolation from cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic factors [ - ].

Recent US research reveals troubling patterns: ethnic minorities use telehealth significantly less than White populations [ ], with telehealth widening gaps in sexual and reproductive health services [ ]. Even when used, telehealth effectiveness varies across demographic groups, with documented racial disparities in diabetes management outcomes [ ] and socioeconomic digital divides in primary care settings [ ].

Current literature frequently examines sociodemographic factors in isolation rather than considering intersectional effects [ , ], failing to capture how multiple dimensions combine to create unique barriers [ , ]. Recent work by Husain and Greenhalgh [ ] and Velasquez and Mehrotra [ ] has begun applying intersectional frameworks to reveal nuanced adoption patterns. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted these disparities [ , ], with evidence showing varied telehealth experiences based on intersecting identities [ - ].

Israeli Context

Examining telehealth equity in Israel is particularly crucial. The Israeli health care system operates under the National Health Insurance Law, ensuring all residents receive standardized health care services through 4 nonprofit Health Funds. Clalit Health Services covers nearly 50% of the population [ ]. Despite universal coverage, widening health care access gaps affect non-Jewish populations, economically disadvantaged groups, and geographically peripheral residents [ ].

Recent Israeli research documents significant telehealth disparities. Reges et al [ ] found ethnicity as the most discriminatory predictor of telemedicine use, with Jews and Arabs accounting for 85% and 52% of users, respectively. Penn and Laron [ ] identified compounded barriers among Arab Israeli women older than the age of 65 years, including a lack of awareness, lower digital literacy, and language barriers [ ]. Geographic disparities between central urban areas and peripheral communities, particularly affecting Bedouin populations, have been documented [ ].

Research Question and Purposes

This study examines health equity considerations in telehealth usage, focusing on intersections between ethnic background, geographic location, and SES. We seek to identify disparity patterns and inform policies ensuring telehealth expands rather than restricts health care access.

The study addresses how telehealth services are used among population groups characterized by combined social determinants of health. Our objectives are to (1) describe sociodemographic and health characteristics of telehealth users and service implications, (2) examine whether telehealth implementation reflects health care access gaps, (3) analyze after-hours telehealth usage patterns to understand telehealth’s evolving role in health care delivery and accessibility, and (4) identify strategies to improve telehealth accessibility across diverse populations.

Methods

Study Design and Setting

This retrospective cohort study analyzed telehealth usage patterns among adult members of Clalit Health Services (CHS) in Israel’s Sharon-Shomron District. CHS is Israel’s largest health fund and integrated delivery system, serving nearly 50% of the Israeli population under the National Health Insurance Law. The organization functions as both insurer and provider, directly operating hospitals and clinics while ensuring universal health care coverage.

The Sharon-Shomron District was selected as the study setting for three strategic reasons: (1) it represents the second-largest district within CHS, encompassing both central metropolitan areas with major tertiary medical centers and peripheral rural communities; (2) the district serves diverse populations including Jewish and Arab residents, individuals across socioeconomic strata, secular and Ultra-Orthodox patients, and cultural minorities including immigrants from former Soviet Union and Ethiopia; and (3) established research collaborations facilitated data access subject to institutional ethics approval.

Data Source and Population

Data Extraction and Management

Data were retrieved from CHS using the Clalit Research Data sharing platform powered by MDClone [ ] for the Sharon-Shomron District, which includes populations from representative subregions and according to SES, ethnicity (Arab, Jewish-orthodox, and Jewish-general), and area of residence (central or remote according to geographic information system location data, and urban or rural). Our sample consisted of health records of all insured patients in the Sharon-Shomron District who met the inclusion criteria (“users of telehealth services”) and those who did not meet such criteria (“nonusers”).

Data included five characteristics: (1) sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, demographic sector, area level SES, residency, and periphery types), (2) number and types of chronic health conditions, overall morbidity burden score (Charlson Comorbidity Index), (3) telehealth services usage (number of telehealth service visits per period for each service type), (4) regular (in-person) family physician services usage (number of visits per period), and (5) telehealth and regular family physician consultation outcomes: related medical diagnosis and care received post-visit (emergency room or hospitalization within 7 days).

The databases integrate electronic health records, insurance claims, demographic information, and geographic data. The database captures all health care encounters, including traditional in-person visits and telehealth consultations, providing comprehensive longitudinal health information for all enrolled members.

Study Population Definition

The target population comprised all CHS members aged 25 years and older residing in the Sharon-Shomron District. We established a baseline population of adults who maintained continuous membership throughout the entire study observation period.

Eligibility Criteria and Final Study Cohort

The inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in .

Textbox 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Inclusion criteria Active Clalit Health Services membership in Sharon-Shomron District.

Age ≥25 years at study initiation (March 1, 2019).

Continuous enrollment throughout the entire study period (March 1, 2019-February 28, 2022).

Complete demographic and administrative data available. Exclusion criteria Membership gaps or termination during the study period.

Incomplete demographic or geographic classification data.

Age <25 years (to focus on adult health care usage patterns).

After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final analytical cohort comprised 499,607 adult members with complete data across all study variables.

Temporal Analysis Framework

We chose the years 2019‐2021 since they represent an era where there has been an increase in the use of telehealth as a result of COVID-19 worldwide, in Israel, and in Clalit Health care services. This timeframe allows us to consider a substantial number of medical files of patients who have used telehealth in CHS.

Study Period Division

We designed a 3-period temporal analysis framework to capture telehealth usage patterns in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic:

Pre-COVID-19 period: March 1, 2019-February 28, 2020 (baseline telehealth patterns). COVID-19 period: March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021 (acute pandemic response). Post-COVID-19 period: March 1, 2021-February 28, 2022 (sustained adoption patterns).

This framework allows examination of telehealth adoption trajectories, identification of pandemic-specific effects, and assessment of sustained behavioral changes in health care seeking patterns.

Temporal Trend Analysis

For each time period, we calculated (1) overall telehealth usage rates by demographic subgroups, (2) service-specific usage patterns (telephone vs video vs TYTO services), (3) after-hours consultation frequency and timing, and (4) longitudinal changes in usage patterns across the 3 periods.

This study represents an analysis of telehealth usage patterns across 3 distinct time periods rather than longitudinal tracking of individual changes over time. Our design examines usage rates within each period among the eligible population during that specific timeframe, not repeated measures of identical individuals across periods. Each time period (pre-COVID-19, COVID-19, and post-COVID-19) includes all CHS members who met the inclusion criteria during that respective timeframe, regardless of their membership status in other periods. This cross-sectional approach to each time period allows for examination of population-level telehealth adoption patterns and demographic disparities within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic timeline, but does not permit analysis of individual-level behavioral changes or temporal interaction effects that would require following the same cohort longitudinally. The temporal framework serves to understand how telehealth usage evolved across different population segments during distinct phases of the pandemic rather than to track changes in disparity magnitude among identical individuals over time.

Variable Definitions and Measurements

Primary Outcome Variables

In telehealth usage, we focused on the data obtained for “telemedicine users,” that is, those with at least 2 telemedicine visits per year, in contrast to “nonusers”—those with less than 2 telemedicine visits annually. We also examined a binary indicator defined as ≥1 telehealth consultation during each study period for broader usage analysis.

By “use of telehealth services,” we refer to 3 types of services representing different levels of involvement of patients and health care providers mentioned below.

Telehealth Service Categories

The telehealth service categories are listed below:

Telephone or video conference visits or consultations with the treating physician: voice-only or real-time video-based consultations with the patient’s regular health care provider during standard clinic hours. Telephone or videoconference visits or consultations with off-hour online (“after-hours”) physician services: remote consultations available during evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays when regular clinic services are unavailable. Virtual conversations through the use of “TYTO”: a small device aimed at performing 8 types of medical tests through which a health care provider can supply their rapid diagnosis. This device was reported to outperform the stand-alone digital stethoscope and otoscope and was better able to provide usable data to support a clinical encounter [ ]. The TYTO Care system enables remote diagnostic consultations using integrated medical devices, including a digital stethoscope, otoscope, thermometer, blood pressure monitor, pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram, dermatoscope, and general camera.

In after-hours usage, telehealth consultations occurring outside standard clinic operating hours (evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays), calculated as a percentage of total telehealth visits. Exploring the use of telehealth consultations during after-work hours is crucial for understanding its role in enhancing health care accessibility and equity. Specifically, it is important to examine the usage trends, for example, how the demand for after-work hours telehealth services compares to traditional primary care physician visits during the same timeframe. The examination of the impact on health care outcomes is also of high importance, for example, exploring whether after-work-hours telehealth usage reduces strain on emergency departments or facilitates timely medical interventions.

Sociodemographic Variables

Age is categorized into 5 groups (25‐35, 35‐50, 50‐60, 60‐70, ≥70 years) based on the age at study initiation, and sex has a binary classification (male and female) based on administrative records. The demographic sector has a four-category classification reflecting Israel’s diverse population:

General Jewish (secular and traditional Jewish populations) Arab and Bedouin (Arabic-speaking populations) Religious Jewish (Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities) Druze and Cherkess (minority ethnic-religious communities)

The SES has a 3-level classification (low, medium, and high) based on Israel Central Bureau of Statistics neighborhood-level socioeconomic indices, incorporating income, education, employment, and housing quality indicators.

Residency type has a six-category classification based on community characteristics:

Non-Jewish settlement Kibbutz (collective agricultural communities) Moshav or Kfar (small agricultural communities with private farms) Moatza or Ayara (regional councils and local authorities) Small town Large town

The periphery is classified into a five-level geographic classification based on distance from major urban centers and service availability:

Very peripheral Peripheral Medium peripheral Central Very central

Health Status Variables

Charlson Comorbidity Index

Validated measure of comorbidity burden incorporated 16 chronic conditions weighted by their association with mortality risk. Individual conditions included diabetes mellitus, hemiplegia or paraplegia, leukemia, lymphoma, AIDS or HIV, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, dementia, liver disease, malignancy, myocardial infarction, peptic ulcer disease, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, and rheumatic or connective tissue disease.

Individual Chronic Conditions

Binary indicators for each of the 16 Charlson Comorbidity Index components were extracted from diagnostic codes in electronic health records. Variable definitions are enclosed in .

We used descriptive statistics to describe the sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of the target population, types of telehealth services used, and their frequency and consultation outcomes.

We calculated frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and means with SDs for continuous variables. Telehealth usage rates were computed for each demographic subgroup across all 3 time periods, with 95% CIs calculated using exact binomial methods.

Temporal Trend Analysis

We assessed changes in telehealth usage across the three study periods using:

Chi-square tests for trend to evaluate linear changes over time. Interrupted time series analysis to assess pandemic impact. Calculation of rate ratios comparing the COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods to the pre-COVID-19 baseline.

Univariate Analysis

We have conducted univariate analyses to examine the relationships between sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and the various types of telehealth service use during each study period.

We examined bivariate associations between each sociodemographic factor and telehealth usage using chi-square tests of independence for categorical variables and t tests for continuous variables. Statistical significance was set at P<.05 for all analyses.

Multivariate Analysis

We constructed multivariable logistic regression models to assess independent associations between sociodemographic factors and telehealth usage while controlling for potential confounders. The models included all sociodemographic variables and the Charlson Comorbidity Index as predictors.

A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to assess the independent association of each sociodemographic and health-related factor with the likelihood of telehealth usage. Bootstrapping (1000 resamples) was applied to ensure robust estimates. The adjusted bootstrapped odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs were reported to quantify the strength and direction of associations. The model controlled for confounding by including all predictors simultaneously. Statistical significance was set at P<.05. Model fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Multicollinearity was examined using the variance inflation factor to ensure no strong correlations between independent variables.

Model Specification

The model specification is classified into three categories:

Outcome: binary telehealth usage (≥1 consultation per period). Predictors: age group, sex, demographic sector, SES, residency type, periphery classification, Charlson Comorbidity Index Reference categories: age 25‐35 years, female sex, General Jewish sector, high SES, large town residency, very central periphery

For robust estimation, we applied bootstrapping with 1000 resamples to obtain robust SEs and 95% CIs, accounting for potential nonnormal distribution of residuals and heteroscedasticity.

Model Diagnostics

The model diagnostics are classified into three categories: (1) Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test to assess model calibration, (2) variance inflation factor analysis to detect multicollinearity (variance inflation factor>10 considered problematic), and (3) residual analysis to identify influential observations.

After-Hours Analysis

We conducted specialized analyses of after-hours telehealth usage, including (1) calculation of after-hours usage percentages by demographic subgroups and time periods, (2) chi-square tests to assess differences in after-hours usage patterns, and (3) logistic regression models predicting after-hours versus regular-hours telehealth use.

Missing Data Management

We assessed patterns of missing data across all variables. Given the administrative nature of the data source, missing data rates were minimal (<1% for most variables). Complete case analysis was performed for the primary analyses, with sensitivity analyses conducted using multiple imputation for variables with >1% missing data.

Software and Reproducibility

All analyses were conducted using R version 4.0 or later (R Core Team). Statistical code and analysis protocols are available upon request to ensure reproducibility.

Ethical Considerations

This study was approved by the CHS Institutional Review Board (IRB number 0085-22-COM). Given the retrospective nature of using deidentified administrative data, informed consent was waived. All analyses adhered to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) privacy standards and institutional data use agreements. Patient confidentiality was maintained throughout the research process, with no individual-level identifiers retained in the analytical dataset.

Results

Cohort Characteristics

Our study population comprised 499,607 adult Clalit Healthcare Services members (aged ≥25 years) in the Sharon-Shomron district with continuous membership throughout the study period (from March 1, 2019, to February 28, 2021).

The population was 51.7% (258,471/499,607) female with a mean age of 50.6 (SD 16.5) years at baseline. The majority (413,940/499,607, 82.9%) belonged to the General Jewish demographic sector, while 15.4% (76,895/499,607) were from the Arab and Bedouin sector. Most participants (271,442/499,607, 54.3%) were classified as having medium SES, and the majority resided in small (187,315/499,607, 37.5%) or large towns (124,157/499,607, 24.8%) within central (170,734/499,607, 34.2%) or very central (186,121/499,607, 37.3%) areas.

Telehealth Usage Patterns

Temporal Trends in Telehealth Adoption

Telehealth usage demonstrated a marked increase during the study period. In the pre-COVID-19 period (March 2019-February 2020), 4% (20,146/499,607) of members used at least 1 telehealth service. This proportion more than doubled to 8.9% (44,678/499,607) during the COVID-19 period (March 2020-February 2021) and further increased slightly to 9.4% (46,868/499,607) in the post-COVID-19 period (March 2021-February 2022).

Telephone services constituted the primary mode of telehealth delivery across all periods, with usage increasing from 4% (20,146/499,607) pre-COVID-19 to 8.7% (43,494/499,607) during COVID-19, and 9.1% (45,225/499,607) post-COVID-19. TYTO online services, while less frequently used, exhibited proportionally greater growth, with usage rates increasing from 0.04% (178/499,607) pre-COVID-19 to 0.4% (1787/499,607) during COVID-19 and 0.5% (2363/499,607) post-COVID-19.

Gender Differences

Women consistently demonstrated higher telehealth adoption rates than men across all periods. These rates are listed as follows:

Pre-COVID-19: females (11,985/258,471, 4.6%) versus males (8279/241,136, 3.4%); 35% higher usage by females. COVID-19: females (24,581/258,471, 9.5%) versus males (20,097/241,136, 8.3%); 14% higher usage by females. Post-COVID-19: females (26,702/258,471, 10.3%) versus males (20,166/241,136, 8.4%); 23% higher usage by females.

This gender disparity was statistically significant (P<.01) and persisted throughout all study periods.

Age-Related Patterns

A pronounced inverse relationship was observed between age and telehealth usage. The youngest age group (25‐35 years) exhibited the highest usage rates (pre-COVID-19: 8059/102,533, 7.9%; COVID-19: 16,749/102,533, 16.3%; post-COVID-19: 18,333/102,533, 17.9%), while the oldest age group (≥70 years) demonstrated the lowest rates (pre-COVID-19: 1871/72,280, 2.6%; COVID-19: 4137/72,280, 5.7%; post-COVID-19: 4129/72,280, 5.7%; P<.01).

The youngest adults (25-35 years) consistently used telehealth at nearly triple the rate of older adults (70+ years). This pattern persisted across all time periods, with the difference remaining statistically significant (P<.01). Notably, while both groups showed substantial increases in adoption from pre- to post-COVID-19 periods, the absolute gap in usage (between those groups) widened from 5.3 percentage points to 12.2 percentage points.

Ethnocultural Variations

Substantial disparities in telehealth usage were observed across ethnocultural sectors. The Religious Jewish sector exhibited the highest usage rates (pre-COVID-19: 443/7630, 5.8%; COVID-19: 966/7630, 12.7%; post-COVID-19: 904/7630, 11.8%), while the Arab and Bedouin sector demonstrated markedly lower rates than the general Jewish population (pre-COVID-19: 438/76,895, 0.6%; COVID-19: 1214/76,895, 1.6%; post-COVID-19: 1125/76,895, 1.5%; P<.01).

The nearly 10-fold difference between the highest-adopting sector (Religious Jewish) and the lowest-adopting sector (Arab and Bedouin) represents one of the most pronounced disparities in the study. Each demographic sector category proportion differed significantly from the others at the 0.05 level during each study period, suggesting deep-rooted cultural, linguistic, technological, or structural barriers to telehealth adoption in certain communities.

Socioeconomic Gradient

The data revealed one of the most profound disparities in telehealth adoption across socioeconomic lines: a strong positive association was observed between SES and telehealth usage. Members with high SES used telehealth services at nearly 4 times the rate of those with low SES (pre-COVID-19: 8256/172,011, 4.8% vs 587/56,154, 1.0%; COVID-19: 18,151/172,011, 10.6% vs 1404/56,154, 2.5%; post-COVID-19: 19,064/172,011, 11.1% vs 1328/56,154, 2.4%; P<.01).

This nearly 5-fold difference between high and low SES groups represents a significant digital divide with important health equity implications. While both groups saw increases in adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportional gap remained relatively unchanged across the periods, suggesting that the pandemic did not meaningfully close the socioeconomic telehealth divide.

Geographic Variations

Telehealth usage varied significantly by residence type and peripherality. Members residing in large towns demonstrated the highest usage rates (pre-COVID-19: 6761/124,157, 5.4%; COVID-19: 14,524/124,157, 11.7%; post-COVID-19: 14,845/124,157, 12%), while those in non-Jewish settlements exhibited the lowest rates (pre-COVID-19: 371/73,969, 0.5%; COVID-19: 1072/73,969, 1.4%; post-COVID-19: 993/73,969, 1.3%; P<.01).

The data show more than a 10-fold difference in telehealth adoption between large towns and non-Jewish settlements. There were no significant differences in usage between patients residing in a Kibbutz (a collective community in Israel, traditionally based on agriculture, where members share ownership, resources, and responsibilities), a Moshav (small agricultural community with personally owned household farms), or small towns, suggesting that the urban-rural divide may be less pronounced than cultural or community-specific factors.

Notably, a U-shaped relationship was observed with peripherality, with both very peripheral and very central locations demonstrating higher usage rates (pre-COVID-19: 466/10,259, 4.5% to 9698/186,121, 5.2%; COVID-19: 980/10,259, 9.6% to 21,173/186,121, 11.4%; post-COVID-19: 1115/10,259, 10.9% to 21,986/186,121, 11.8%) compared to medium peripheral locations (pre-COVID-19: 3500/186,121, 3%; COVID-19: 7576/118,320, 6.4%; post-COVID-19: 1115/10,259, 6.9%; P<.01) ( ).

There were no significant differences in the percentage of telehealth services usage between patients who reside in locations of peripheral and central types, as well as between patients who reside in locations of peripheral and very peripheral types.

[TITLE]FDI insurge: Robust inflows into future-focused fields could help India stare down global economic uncertainty:
[TEXT]
Foreign direct investment (FDI) has a long history of transforming industries—from steel to semiconductors. This has been true in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and India.

But there’s an FDI shake-up underway, according to a new study from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).

As investment decisions increasingly follow geopolitical lines, India stands as the world’s top emerging-market destination for announced ‘greenfield’ FDI—that is, cross-border investment projects that create net new production capacity.

From 2022 through the first five months of 2025, India’s greenfield FDI inflow announcements have averaged $83 billion a year—24% higher than in the 2015 to 2019 period.

Of those billions pledged to India since 2022, nearly 80% were destined for advanced manufacturing, communications and software, and resource-related sectors—industries poised to shape tomorrow’s global economy.

These are neither the conventional textile nor basic product investments that played large roles in years past. While India’s large and growing domestic market continues to pull in foreign investors, it is far from the only factor in play in the post-pandemic years.

[TITLE]Exclusive-Huawei, ZTE seal 5G deals in Vietnam after US tariffs, as ties with China warm​:
[TEXT]
By Francesco Guarascio

HANOI (Reuters) -China's leading telecommunication firms Huawei and ZTE have won a string of contracts this year to supply 5G equipment in Vietnam, in another sign of Hanoi's strengthening bonds with Beijing, stirring concern among Western officials, seven people with direct ​knowledge of the situation told Reuters.

For years, Vietnam was seen as reluctant to use Chinese technology in sensitive infrastructure, but in recent months it ‌has embraced Chinese tech companies as sometimes frosty relations with its northern neighbour have warmed while ties with Washington have soured over tariffs on Vietnamese goods.

While Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia secured contracts for Vietnam'‌s 5G core infrastructure, with U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm providing network equipment, Chinese companies have begun winning smaller tenders with state-owned operators, so far unreported public procurement data shows.

A consortium including Huawei was awarded a $23 million contract for 5G equipment in April, weeks after the White House announced tariffs on Vietnamese goods. ZTE has won at least two contracts, one last week, totalling more than $20 million for 5G antennas. The first publicly disclosed deal came in September, a month after U.S. tariffs took effect.

Reuters ⁠could not establish whether the timing of these wins was linked ‌to U.S. tariffs, but the deals raised concerns among Western officials.

The exclusion of Chinese contractors from Vietnam's digital infrastructure, including undersea fibre-optic cables, has long been identified by Washington as a key condition for support in advanced technologies.

Huawei and ZTE ‍are banned from U.S. telecom networks as an "unacceptable risk" to national security. Sweden and other European countries have similar restrictions.

Ericsson declined to comment on Chinese companies, but said it was "fully committed to support its customers in Vietnam."

Huawei, ZTE, Nokia, Qualcomm, the U.S. embassy in Vietnam, China's embassy, Sweden's ​foreign ministry or Vietnam's tech ministry responded to requests for comment.

VIETNAM-CHINA TIES WARM

The unaligned Southeast Asian nation is a crucial battleground in the competition for global influence.‌ Its proximity to China has made it a major industrial hub for multinationals such as Apple, Samsung and Nike, which rely on Chinese components and Western consumers.

Under Western pressure, Vietnam long took "a wait-and-see approach" to Chinese technology, said Nguyen Hung, a specialist in supply chains at RMIT University Vietnam. But "Vietnam has its own priorities," he added, noting the new deals could spur deeper economic integration with China.

[TITLE]Growth and security at the forefront in UK funding boost for European Space Agency:
[TEXT]
Agreed during the ESA Council of Ministers (CM25) in Bremen, this new funding brings sharper focus to deliver maximum value for money, sustain thousands of high-skilled jobs, and drive science and innovation that directly benefits people and businesses, from increased connectivity to more resilient infrastructure and public services.

Building on existing commitments, the new funding increases the UK’s current level of support for ESA programmes to £2.8 billion over the next decade (2025/26 to 2034/35), with further commitments set to be made in 2028 at the next ESA Council of Ministers.

This funding returns to UK industry and universities as contracts, supporting the development of new technologies, while putting British scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs at the forefront of global space programmes. Evaluation shows that every £1 invested in ESA returns £7.49 in direct benefits to the UK economy.

Space Minister Liz Lloyd CBE said:

Our space sector is a key driver of our economic growth and national security, and also supports our allies in Europe and beyond. After these negotiations in Bremen, during what remains a challenging time for economies across Europe, we have secured backing for our priority ESA programmes, which will support thousands of jobs, greater resilience and cutting-edge science and technology across the UK.

The new commitments include a record £162 million for launch programmes, including the European Launcher Challenge. This initiative is designed to improve access to space by opening up the European market to commercial operators, increasing resilience and driving down the cost of launching the satellites that deliver services like communications, navigation and weather forecasting.

This commitment supports the aim of securing assured access to space for the UK, enhancing our national security in an uncertain world, and ensuring the UK benefits from the fast-growing global space market, which makes an outsized contribution to our economy. Through these initiatives, the government will continue to work with launch companies that can deliver our assured access objectives, and develop and strengthen existing partnerships with NATO and European allies.

The UK-led Vigil mission to monitor and forecast dangerous space weather, in partnership with the US, will proceed, with a new £131 million commitment from the UK and significant support from European partners. Space weather – which generated displays of the Northern Lights over parts of the UK this month – can disrupt vital technology on Earth and in space.

These rare but extreme events risk impacting our daily lives, damaging power grids, satellites, and satellite navigation and timing signals used by emergency services. Vigil will improve forecasting of solar storms to help manage these risks and protect national security.

Europe’s first Mars rover, built in the UK by Airbus and named after British scientist Rosalind Franklin, secured further backing in Bremen, bringing its launch a step closer in 2028. The mission will drill down into the red planet to hunt for signs of past life, putting the UK at the forefront of the race to answer one of the longest standing scientific questions

[TITLE]Comcast to pay $1.5M fine for vendor breach affecting 270K customers:
[TEXT]
Comcast will pay a $1.5 million fine to settle a Federal Communications Commission investigation into a February 2024 vendor data breach that exposed the personal information of nearly 275,000 customers.

The breach occurred in February 2024, when attackers hacked into the systems of Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a debt collector Comcast had stopped using two years earlier.

The FCBS data breach was initially believed to have affected 1.9 million people in total, but the tally was raised to 3.2 million in June and, finally, to 4.2 million in July.

FBCS, which filed for bankruptcy before revealing a data breach in August 2024, notified Comcast on July 15 (five months after the attack) that customer data had been compromised, affecting 273,703 Comcast customers. Previously, it had assured Comcast in March that the breach did not affect any of its customers.

The threat actors stole personal and financial information between February 14 and February 26, including the names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and Comcast account numbers of affected current and former customers. Affected customers had used Comcast's Xfinity-branded internet, television, streaming, VoIP, and home security services.

Under the consent decree announced by the FCC on Monday, Comcast has also agreed to implement a compliance plan that includes enhanced vendor oversight to protect data and ensure customer privacy, ensuring its vendors properly dispose of customer information they no longer need for business purposes, as required by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984.

The telecommunications giant must also appoint a compliance officer, conduct risk assessments of vendors handling customer data every two years, file compliance reports with the FCC every six months over the next three years, and report any material violations within 30 days of discovery.

However, Comcast said in a statement to Reuters that it "was not responsible for and has not conceded any wrongdoing in connection with this incident," noting that its network wasn't breached and that FBCS was contractually required to comply with security requirements.

A Comcast spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer.

Comcast is an American mass media, telecommunications, and entertainment multinational company, and the fourth-largest telecom firm in the world by revenue, after AT&T, Verizon, and China Mobile.

It also has over 182,000 employees, hundreds of millions of customers worldwide, and reported revenues of $123.7 billion in 2024.

[TITLE]Senators push bill to boost U.S. role in undersea cable security:
[TEXT]
Senators push bill to boost U.S. role in undersea cable security

ROC Central News Agency

11/26/2025 10:47 AM

Washington, Nov. 25 (CNA) Several United States senators proposed the "Strategic Subsea Cables Act of 2025" on Monday to spur U.S. government engagement related to the security, installation and maintenance, and repair of undersea fiber-optic cables.

One of those proposing the bill, ranking Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Jeanne Shaheen, referred to fiber-optic cables as "strategic" and "critical infrastructure" that "form the bedrock of global internet traffic," according to a committee statement.

She said the U.S. must respond to the rise of cable cuts in the Baltic Sea and the Taiwan Strait, according to a committee news release.

Another of the bill's sponsors, Republican John Barrasso, echoed Shaheen's views, saying that adversaries such as China and Russia continue to target the cables to "disrupt communications in Taiwan and for our allies across Europe and the Middle East."

Because of that, Barrasso argued, the U.S. should ensure that the vital telecommunications infrastructure is safeguarded from "terrorist threats."

The bill calls for greater U.S. participation in international bodies such as the International Cable Protection Committee and increased State Department investment, including hiring at least two full-time staff dedicated to the effort.

It would require the U.S. president to impose sanctions against foreign individuals who intentionally damage undersea cables and establish an inter-agency committee to coordinate related efforts.

It would also mandate a federal strategy to work with industry partners and require federal agencies to develop procedures to ensure timely communication of threat information with private undersea cable operators.

Undersea cables connected to Taiwan have faced ongoing disruptions in recent years.

The National Security Bureau said in September that around seven to eight undersea cable breaks occurred around Taiwan over the past three years, with four occurring within two months of the beginning of 2025.

A Chinese captain was found responsible for one of the aforementioned incidents in June.
