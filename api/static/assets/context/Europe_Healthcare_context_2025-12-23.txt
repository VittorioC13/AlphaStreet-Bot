Further details on each of these updates is provided below.

Illuccix China Phase 3 Registration Study

Telix is pleased to announce positive top-line results from its Phase 3 registration study of TLX591-CDx (Illuccix®, Kit for the preparation of 68Ga-PSMA-11) for prostate cancer imaging in Chinese patients. The Illuccix China2 trial met its primary endpoint of patient-level positive predictive value (PPV) for the detection of tumors in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer following prior radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. The study confirms that the clinical experience of TLX591-CDx PSMA-PET3 imaging in Chinese patients is comparable to that observed in patients studied elsewhere.

Illuccix China is a Phase 3 prospective, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study conducted in collaboration with Telix’s strategic commercial partner for the Greater China region, Grand Pharmaceutical Group Limited (Grand Pharma). The study in 140 patients delivered a strong result for the primary endpoint, with an overall patient-level PPV of 94.8% for the detection of tumors with TLX591-CDx (95% confidence interval [CI]: 85.9%, 98.2%), with the lower bound of the 95% CI (85.9%). The region-level PPV was 100.0% in the prostate bed and in the extra-pelvic soft tissue, lymph nodes, and organ metastases (non-bone); 94.7% in the pelvic region outside of the prostate bed, including lymph nodes; and 87.0% in bone metastases.

In the study, patients with suspected BCR were stratified into groups according to their baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. TLX591-CDx PSMA-PET imaging demonstrated high PPV in all patient groups, including at very low baseline PSA levels.

Baseline PSA PPV (95% CI) ≥ 5.0 ng/mL 100.0% (78.5%, 100.0%) < 5.0 to 2.0 ng/mL 100.0% (67.6%, 100.0%) < 2.0 to 1.0 ng/mL 90.9% (62.3%, 98.4%) < 1.0 to 0.5 ng/mL 90.0% (59.6%, 98.2%) < 0.5 to 0.2 ng/mL 93.3% (70.2%, 98.8%)

More than two-thirds (67.2%) of patients experienced a change in their treatment plan as a consequence of TLX591-CDx PSMA-PET imaging compared with the initial plan at baseline. This outcome confirms that PSMA-PET imaging with TLX591-CDx had a meaningful impact on clinical decision-making in Chinese patients, potentially leading to improved treatment strategies for participants with BCR. Final data from the study will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication.

Dr. David N. Cade, Group Chief Medical Officer, Telix, commented, “This is an outstanding result. The primary endpoint of the study was met decisively, with the positive predictive value significantly exceeding the performance threshold agreed with the Chinese regulator. Importantly, the high PPV was consistent even in patients with very low PSA values, and across differing metastatic locations, demonstrating broad clinical applicability. These compelling data will enable Telix and our partner Grand Pharma to submit a New Drug Application for Illuccix in China, a strategically important market.”

In China, more than 134,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 20224, increasing by approximately 6% each year5. In line with government policy supporting wider geographic access to nuclear medicine, the number of PET/CT cameras installed in China is expected to surpass 1,600 by the end of 20256, compared with 133 in 20107.

FDA Resubmission Update: TLX101-CDx

Telix advises that its New Drug Application (NDA) resubmission for TLX101-CDx, (Pixclara®1, 18F-floretyrosine) to the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is progressing well. The Company has had collaborative interactions with the FDA around providing additional clinical data and a revised statistical analysis plan.

Following a productive Type A meeting to review the basis of the Complete Response Letter (CRL)8, Telix is currently finalizing its package for resubmission. The Company will provide a further near-term update when the resubmission has been filed and accepted by the FDA. The approved Expanded Access Program (EAP)9 remains active for TLX101-CDx, reflective of Telix’s commitment to serving patients.

FDA Resubmission Update: TLX250-CDx

Telix has recently participated in a Type A meeting to discuss the CRL it received following review of the Biologics License Application (BLA)10 for TLX250-CDx (Zircaix®1, 89Zr-DFO-girentuximab). Telix believes it has reached alignment with the FDA on the remediation of identified deficiencies regarding the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) package, which formed the substantive basis of the CRL.

The FDA has collaboratively granted Telix an additional meeting in January to review Telix’s plan for the additional data requested to establish comparability between the drug product used in the ZIRCON Phase 3 clinical trial11 and the scaled-up manufacturing process intended for commercial use. Telix will provide a further update following receipt of the official FDA meeting minutes of both Type A meetings. The approved Expanded Access Program (EAP)12 remains active for TLX250-CDx, reflective of Telix’s commitment to serving patients.

[TEXT]
Novo Nordisk CEO Maziar Mike Doustdar shakes hands with U.S. President Donald Trump during an event to announce a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to reduce the prices of GLP-1 weight‑loss drugs during an event in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 6, 2025.

Among the 10 largest biopharmaceutical companies in the Stoxx 600 health index, five have a majority of their total sales from the U.S.: Roche , Novo Nordisk , GSK , Argenx , and UCB .

But exactly how exposed are Europe's biggest pharma companies to the U.S. market?

President Donald Trump has pushed for lower drug prices for Americans through so-called Most Favored Nations drug pricing, whereby the prices in the U.S. are set at the lowest price paid by other wealthy countries. That could have a tremendous impact on companies' balance sheets.

As the largest single market for most pharma and biotech firms, higher drug prices in the U.S. — often nearly three times as costly as in other countries — are a key factor in the industry's reliance on American sales, with branded drugs commanding even steeper premiums.

Drug pricing has emerged as one of the biggest issues for pharmaceutical companies this year, as the U.S. looks to dramatically reduce the costs paid by consumers.

Argenx is the most exposed, with 85% of total sales originating in the U.S. in its last reported period.

The least exposed are Germany's Merck KGaA and Bayer , with

Especially, AI and patient digital twins simulate patient responses, particularly in Alzheimer's or G12C KRAS mutation cases, for minimising trial durations and identifying efficient therapies rapidly, bypassing some physical trials. Furthermore, immersive Dassault Systèmes facilitates "Virtual Twin as a Service" for healthcare and life sciences, employs AI for virtual human body twins ("Emma") and improves processes. PapAI/Datategy offers AI layers by integrating with digital twins to provide predictive insights and boost operations across the value chain.

By deployment mode analysis

What Made the On-Premises Segment Dominant in the Market in 2024?

The on-premises segment led with the largest share of the digital manufacturing in life sciences market in 2024. Many life science firms, specifically pharma companies, deal with highly sensitive patient data, R&D, and intellectual property, which makes on-premises a preference for maximum control against breaches. The latest developments include Siemens Xcelerator adoption, FDA support for Process Analytical Tech (PAT), and modular, lean manufacturing cells for devices.

Moreover, the public cloud/SaaS segment is estimated to witness the fastest growth. Their adoption is bolstered by data explosion (AI/ML needs), regulatory compliance, legacy system modernization, expedited time-to-market, and escalated R&D/clinical trial assistance. Currently, advanced solutions comprise GE HealthCare's cloud-first clinical apps (CareIntellect) for better care and Carrier's Lynx FacTOR SaaS for automated pharma cold chain release.

By end-user analysis

How did the Large Pharmaceutical Companies Segment Lead the Market in 2024?

The large pharmaceutical companies segment registered dominance in the market in 2024. Huge players, such as Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Roche, and Johnson & Johnson, are increasingly using digitalized solutions, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and digital twins. Although Roche emphasizes data integration across its diagnostics and pharmaceutical divisions, utilising cloud-based platforms, such as NAVIFY.

Whereas the biotechnology startups segment is predicted to register rapid expansion. The prospective progression is driven by the increasing demand for efficiency, quality, speed (AI/cloud adoption), and tailored medicine (cell/gene therapy). For automating lab workflows, sample handling, and complex tasks, boosting safety and productivity, like CytoTronic’s live cell analysis, are also fostering the adoption. Alongside, Systemic Bio & OminiWell have immensely contributed to the development of platforms for 3D bioprinting and 3D cell cultures.
