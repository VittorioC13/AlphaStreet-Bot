[TITLE]EU pushes for Chips Act 2.0 investment as it looks set to miss global silicon production targets by a wide margin — seeks quadrupling of semiconductor investment as $50 billion initiative flounders:
[TEXT]
All the member nations of the EU have signed on to a Dutch-led coalition that wants to encourage additional investment in semiconductor manufacturing in the EU. This revision of the 2022 European Chips Act would see the EU pivot its plan to take over global production and instead target specific weaknesses in the EU's semiconductor strategies, as per Reuters.

The EU's Chips Act budgeted 43 billion euros ($50.4 billion) in semiconductor manufacturing, chip design, and better supply chain monitoring that could allow state intervention in key areas. The idea was to counterbalance the USA's investment in encouraging chip manufacturing in the United States with the Chips Act and Inflation Reduction Act efforts, investing tens of billions in American semiconductor manufacturing. The EU Chips Act hoped to regain some market share from Taiwanese TSMC, too, targeting control of some 20% of the supply chain by 2030.

However, the EU is reportedly only on target to reach 11.7% of the world's supply by that date, a rise of just under two percent since 2022. With that in mind, the new Dutch coalition is pushing for even greater funding - up to a quadrupling of existing semiconductor investment - as well as a pivot to more targeted support for EU industry.

The initiative was launched in March and led by the Netherlands, with support from eight other member states. Since then, the rest of the EU countries have all come on board, and the coalition has received support from industry groups like SEMI, which represent some 3,000 companies, as well as 50 dedicated semiconductor manufacturers. These include US-based manufacturing and chip design firms like Nvidia, ASML, and Intel, as well as European-based STMicroelectronics and Infineon.

The coalition now wants to revise the 2022 Chips Act to its 2.0 form, encouraging the speeding of approvals for infrastructure spending, and improving access to skills and finance for the semiconductor supply chain in the EU. It also wants the EU to better secure access to critical chip design and manufacturing technologies, and even have the EU set a separate budget exclusively for semiconductor manufacturing and investment.

Although the 2022 Chips Act did encourage a wave of investment in silicon fabrication and design in the EU, it fell short of its intended goals, especially after US-based Intel pulled out its plans to build a new factory in Germany.

[TITLE]EU member states back calls for Chips Act changes:
[TEXT]
Momentum is gathering behind calls for a Chips Act 2.0 to strengthen Europe's competitiveness in the semiconductor sector amid growing geopolitical uncertainty over global markets and supply chains.

The Semicon Coalition, a group now composed of all 27 EU member states, has signed a declaration [PDF] setting out its goal for a stronger Chips Act to bolster Europe's position in the global semiconductor industry.

It follows earlier calls from European chipmakers to look beyond the Chips Act and do more to support other areas of the sector, not just manufacturing, while the European Semiconductor Industry Association (ESIA) also previously said it would like to see more public funding and greater input on decisions.

In response, the European Commission says it is already conducting an evaluation and review of the initiative, and opened a public consultation and call for evidence earlier this month. Those with an interest in the sector are invited to share their views on how the Chips Act is performing today and how it should be adapted.

The declaration says a revised version of the strategy must address Europe's vulnerabilities, and aim to make its chip industries stronger in response to geopolitical, technological, and environmental challenges. This is to build on existing strengths as well as emerging market opportunities highlighted in the Draghi report on European competitiveness.

Those challenges include volatility with America - the Trump administration is using every trick it can think of to force tech companies to dance to its tune - and China's attempts to push chipmakers in other countries out of business by flooding the global market with cheap subsidized products.

However, on the strategic objectives for an updated silicon initiative, the declaration says the amibiton to achieve 20 percent share of the global semiconductor market by 2030 is currently unachievable – something many critics had already pointed out – because it lacks clear strategic direction on where and why Europe should lead in the semiconductor supply chain.

Instead, a revised Chips Act 2.0 must be "grounded" in three overall objectives: enabling a competitive European semiconductor ecosystem that can deliver prosperity; developing technological leadership at critical points in the supply chain; and building a stable and reliable supply of trustworthy semiconductors for Europe's critical industrial sectors.

These objectives need to be backed up by measurable targets, periodically reviewed by the European Commission working with member states and relevant stakeholders in the semiconductor ecosystem, the declaration proposes.

A long list of policy priorities is identified, most of which can be grouped into creating a strong ecosystem within Europe, ensuring enough funding, and developing a workforce with the right skills.

The latter would involve support for greater collaboration between academic institutions in the EU, with the establishment of a European Chips Skills Program. Fostering collaboration between industries across Europe and boosting R&D efforts all the way up to first deployment of a particular technology, are also part of the mix.

Funding suggestions include aligning national and European-level finance streams, as well as encouraging private capital to back up the public money.

Also mentioned are issues that hold back construction of new industrial infrastructure: permits, grid access, power supply, and other preconditions.

"We will explore emergency permitting legislation to fast-track strategic investments in the semiconductor ecosystem," the declaration states, echoing similar measures being implemented in the US and UK to allow projects seen as vital to side-step the usual planning checks.

The declaration issues a call to action, saying the signatories are ready to work with the European Commission on a revision of the Chips Act that will drive the development of a stronger local sector.

"Together, we can out-innovate, out-compete, and out-perform," it says rather optimistically, "ensuring Europe's leadership in the critical technologies that will define our future."

Luis Fernandes, IDC Senior Research Manager for EMEA Digital Infrastructure Strategies, said that a review is quite normal for this type of initiative since it has reached its two-year anniversary.

"That being said, it is hard to classify the first iteration of the European Chips Act as a resounding success," he told The Register.

"The first Act was focused on a limited number of projects. This next iteration has the potential to enlist other member states that might want to partake in this endeavor and expand the capabilities and resilience of the initiative," he added.

The Semicon Coalition was formed earlier this year, initially composed of Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the Netherlands.

In a published statement, Minister Vincent Karremans of Economic Affairs for The Netherlands said: "Today all EU Ministers agreed on the fact that Europe's industrial strategy should adapt to the increasing geopolitical tensions in the world. This unique unity is a landmark step forward in securing future strategic autonomy and broad prosperity."

Peter Burke, Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Enterprise in the Irish government, said: "This morning I am proud to stand with my European colleagues in endorsing the Declaration of the European Semiconductor Coalition. And I join with them in calling for a revitalized European Chips Act to secure Europe's place at the forefront of the global semiconductor industry."

"This is Europe's moment to align national ambitions with a shared vision: to build a semiconductor ecosystem which secures our sovereignty, drives innovation while ensuring prosperity for generations to come."

Gaurav Gupta, VP Analyst in Gartner's Emerging Trends and Technologies team, said that Chips Act 2.0 needs to better define the end goal.

"The original plan of 20 percent market share was too optimistic and broad – I would say it was rather vague. Once there is a better understanding of what the EU wants to achieve with 2.0, it should channel resources in the right direction. Then it would be a matter of execution," he told us.

Where the original act largely just followed what the US and China were doing, the EU should play to its strengths, Gupta believes, such as in research, automotive and industrial chips, emerging energy-efficient technologies, and wafer fabrication tech (think ASML).

"The EU doesn't have the same resources that China and US have with regards to investing in and leading in advanced semiconductor process nodes. It must rather rely on collaboration for certain aspects, while ensuring better utilization of its own resources.

"Another challenge [the] EU has is that with many participating nations drafting these policies, rather than crisp decision making, it can fall into the trap of interests that serve a particular entity. [The] EU needs to overcome those issues and be quick and aggressive." ®

[TITLE]Melanion Capital Pioneers First Private Bitcoin Treasury Model in Europe:
[TEXT]
Firm to raise €50m to Bitcoin and offer treasury blueprint for other private companies to follow

PARIS, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Melanion Capital today announced the launch of a new strategic initiative, positioning itself as the first private regulated asset management company to implement a Bitcoin treasury operated model (BTOC). This marks a new phase in the investment management firm's evolution as a leader in Bitcoin (BTC) investment, and unlocking opportunities for other private companies to follow in its footsteps.

The move reflects Melanion's conviction that Bitcoin is not just a tactical hedge, but the foundation of a historic monetary transition. The transformation towards Bitcoin treasuries has become a significant trend for public companies, including those outside the crypto space, where a portion of their cash reserves is allocated to the decentralized currency.

Unlike public company models, Melanion's private structure provides greater flexibility to navigate volatility, structure deals, and manage liquidity. The firm will apply its strategy directly on its own balance sheet, offering a demonstration of what a sustainable Bitcoin treasury looks like, ahead of providing the framework to other private businesses to become a BTOC.

"Melanion was founded as a forward-thinking asset manager with traditional roots," said Jad Comair , Founder & CEO of Melanion Capital. "In time, it became clear that Bitcoin represents not just an asset, but a destination as the long-term anchor of capital preservation and growth, especially for Bitcoin treasuries. Our pivot to a regulated treasury is a commitment to that belief: that we can overperform on an asset which is already successful and make this model available for other private businesses to follow."

Melanion differentiates itself from passive treasury approaches by engineering alpha on top of Bitcoin exposure. The firm applies advanced capital structuring, treasury optimisation, and liquidity design to deliver enhanced performance beyond Bitcoin's own repricing cycle.

To accelerate this strategy, Melanion's board is set to raise €50 million in capital dedicated entirely to Bitcoin allocation. This will represent one of the largest private treasury commitments to Bitcoin in Europe, underlining both the scale of Melanion's ambitions and its belief that corporate treasuries must adapt to the new monetary order.

Paul Dalziel , Head of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy at Melanion Capital, said, "By anchoring our own treasury in Bitcoin, we demonstrate its potential role as a superior long-term store of value. But our ambition is larger, as we hope to show how private companies can compound that exposure, turning Bitcoin from a defensive allocation into a source of active outperformance."

Building on the firm's pioneering track record of bridging traditional and decentralized finance, including the launch of Europe's first Bitcoin Equities UCITS ETF in 2021, Melanion views its private treasury model as an actionable playbook for others.

"Our long-run vision is simple and we mean to lead by example," added Comair. "Every company will one day become a Bitcoin treasury company, and our strategy will help them achieve that".

Investment in Bitcoin carries a risk of partial or total loss of capital.

About Melanion Capital:

Founded in Paris in 2013, Melanion Capital is an independent alternative asset management firm and Bitcoin treasury company, bridging traditional finance and innovation. Recognised as a "Jeune Entreprise Innovante" by the French Ministry of Research, the firm launched its digital asset business in 2020 and was the first to offer a UCITS-compliant Bitcoin thematic ETF in 2021.

Today, Melanion is defining the standard for private Bitcoin treasuries: proving the resilience, compliance, and profitability of its own model, ahead of enabling its use to other private businesses.

[TITLE]EU housing plan to tackle speculation, short-term rentals:
[TEXT]
Jørgensen confirmed the EU's first-ever plan to take on the crisis — which is expected to be unveiled later this year — will include a revision of state aid rules, allowing national governments to use public funds to build homes for middle-class Europeans priced out of the market.

As public cash alone will be insufficient, the commissioner explained these funds will need to be combined with private investment. Stressing that such investments need to "balance steady returns with social responsibility," he said the Commission was working with the European Investment Bank and other financial institutions to ensure homes built through public-private schemes are genuinely affordable.

In addition to measures aimed at slashing byzantine EU and national rules delaying the construction of new homes, Jørgensen announced the upcoming plan will also target short-term rentals.

The conversion of housing stock into tourist flats is seen as a major factor in rising costs, with authorities moving to ban these properties altogether in places like Barcelona. The commissioner vowed to address the “complex” issue “firmly but fairly.”

"This crisis presents a defining test for our European democracy," Jørgensen said. " It is a fight we cannot afford to lose."

[TITLE]Finland government tax proposal worries datacentre investors:
[TEXT]
Finland’s long-term ambition to position itself as the most attractive low-cost Nordic cold climate hub for datacentres could be derailed in the wake of a budget proposal by the Finnish government to eliminate energy tax breaks provided to the sector.

The Ministry of Finance (MoF), which is tasked with amending the Energy Taxation Act to remove the tax breaks for datacentres in the 2026 budget, justified the action as being part of a wider tax reform focused on all core sectors of business and industry.

Finance minister Riikka Purra told the Eduskunta (national parliament) in August that the MoF is on course to finalise the budget’s tax reform provisions by the end of October. The MoF said the tax breaks provided to the datacentre sector are projected to be worth a total of €50m in 2025.

Although the MoF could, from a legislative standpoint, abolish the tax break for datacentres by adding an amendment to the existing Energy Taxation Act, it will be mindful of the repercussions and fall-out from such an action. The removal of tax breaks could significantly impact the country’s ability to not only lure new datacentre investments, but may also dissuade companies already operating facilities in Finland from planning expansion.

Blunt response The data sector’s response to Finland’s tax reform proposal was blunt and immediate. XTX Markets, the London-based algorithmic trading company, warned that it was re-evaluating a €1bn investment to build a mega-sized datacentre in Finland. Michael Irwin, XTX’s chief operating officer, said it had placed its long-term investment roadmap for Finland under review “due to the proposed changes in electricity taxation”. The MoF’s tax reform deliberations are being closely watched by global companies like Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services and IBM, all of which have invested heavily in Finland’s fast-growing datacentre sector. Other interested investors, including private equity groups and hedge funds, are also monitoring the MoF’s future actions. The government proposal under review by the MoF includes the abolition of electricity tax breaks for datacentres, together with an amendment to change the energy rate charged to the sector’s facilities from its current low level of €0.0006 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to the standard Finnish industry rate of €0.0225/kWh. In addition, the MoF is also reviewing a separate advantage available to datacentre operators that provides accelerated depreciation allowances to new build projects. This provision allows for the write-off of capital investments at a greater speed for companies, offering datacentre builders and operators the opportunity to boost early-stage cash flow. The MoF is collaborating on the proposed tax reform bill with the Ministry of Employment and Economy. Together, the two ministries are working to prepare a new and broader tax model that will alter how datacentres are taxed in the future.

Silver lining? A possible silver lining for datacentre operators and investors comes in the form of a September statement by finance minister Purra that the MoF is open to applying specific tax rates to different types of datacentres depending on their size and energy usage. Purra said a redefinition of datacentres for tax purposes, against the backdrop of a government plan to conduct a wider cross-industry tax appraisal, was “overdue”. The uncertainty shadowing the government’s tax reform proposal will hinder the country’s ability to attract new datacentre capital investment projects, said Jouni Salonen, a senior advisor at Business Finland, the state agency for trade and investment promotion. “As long as the taxation issue remains unclear, it is difficult to contemplate any investment decisions being made. The electricity tax has such a significant impact on the operational costs of datacentres that decisions are difficult to make in this situation,” said Salonen, who leads Business Finland’s communications, mobility, software and datacentre department. Finland’s tax reform deliberations are taking place alongside a separate initiative by the Orpo government to appoint Veli-Matti Mattila, a technology industry career professional, to produce a national roadmap to evaluate the role of datacentres in the greater Finnish economy. Mattila, a former chief executive of the Finnish telecom group Elisa, is expected to present the datacentres national roadmap report in November 2025. The mission tasked to Mattila involves a deep dive into the positives and negatives of having a substantial datacentre presence in a small-sized European economy like Finland. The Mattila-headed national roadmap analysis, which will also examine taxation around tax centres, sets out to scrutinise the advantages and challenges of developing Finland as a major Nordic hub. The final report will examine the impact of a large datacentre presence on key areas of economic concern, including the sector’s effect on energy production, consumption and prices. The Mattila report will also investigate the state’s future role as both a legislator and “stakeholder-investor”. This is to ensure that increased industry demands for electricity are met by forward-planning and cost-efficient capital investment schemes that can match production to future demand by scaling up supply capacity.

[TITLE]Electric aircraft maker Beta Technologies files for US IPO:
[TEXT]
Electric aircraft maker Beta Technologies filed for an initial public offering in the United States on Monday, the latest company to join the rush to tap a record-breaking bull run in the equity market.

Easing trade tensions, robust stock markets and pent-up investor demand have combined to create one of the busiest windows for listings in years, with technology, aerospace and green energy firms leading the charge.

Beta Technologies designs, manufactures and sells high-performance electric aircraft, advanced electric propulsion systems, charging systems and components.

Electric aviation remains a niche segment of the transportation industry, with only a handful of companies developing and testing commercial aircraft.

"Beta's IPO plays into two narratives that are resonating with investors: the long-term electrification trend and renewed appetite for selective growth stories," said Kat Liu, vice president at IPO research firm IPOX.

Beta Technologies, citing internal estimates, said operating costs for its aircraft are 42 per cent lower than conventional planes, thanks to a simplified design.

"Our aircraft's design eliminates the need for complex components such as gear boxes, in-flight liquid cooling systems, and thrust vectoring mechanisms," it said in the IPO prospectus.

The company said its ALIA CTOL electric aircraft has completed thousands of flights, covering nearly 83,000 nautical miles, including operations in North America and Europe.

Its aircraft has been used by the U.S. military in training missions and flown by the Federal Aviation Administration.

Beta also said it is partnering with GE Aerospace to co-develop a hybrid electric turbogenerator for defense and civil applications. As part of the deal, GE Aerospace will make a $300 million equity investment in the company.

The broader electric vehicle and technology industries have been in the spotlight for years, drawing investment and fueling growth across the automotive and clean-tech sectors.

Interest, however, has been uneven, with some segments and regions growing rapidly, while others face adoption and infrastructure challenges.

"Electric aircraft fit into the same sustainability and clean-mobility narrative that has driven interest in electric cars, though aerospace faces far longer certification and commercialization timelines," Liu said.

Beta Technologies, which did not disclose the size or terms of its offering, posted a net loss of $25.57 per share for the six months ended June 30, compared with $19.38 per share a year earlier.

The company is aiming to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "BETA".

Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are the lead underwriters of the offering.
