[TITLE]HKEX CEO Bonnie Chan says geopolitics and economic uncertainty may dim IPO outlook:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) CEO Bonnie Chan Yiting cautioned that the fundraising bonanza in the city, which leads the global initial public offering (IPO) rankings this year, could slow down amid geopolitical and economic risks.

"I would say that we need to be very conscious that the world is still under a lot of stress geopolitically and macroeconomically," she said at the Bund Summit financial forum in Shanghai on Thursday. "I think it's too early [for the HKEX] to claim victory."

Chan issued the warning despite a strong pipeline of more than 300 companies waiting to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange, home to the world's two largest share sales - Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and Zijin Gold International - this year.

[TITLE]HKEX vets 300 listing applications after city becomes the world's largest IPO market:
[TEXT]
Bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), which topped this year's global rankings as the largest initial public offering (IPO) market, said the city continued to see strong momentum, as it vets hundreds of new listing applications.

Bonnie Chan Yiting, CEO of HKEX, on Wednesday said at an event in Shanghai that Hong Kong has more than 300 companies in the listing pipeline, which would ensure another strong quarter for fundraising in the city.

"International investors have been actively involved in new listings in Hong Kong this year," Chan said at a HKEX-organised summit in mainland China's financial capital. "These included long-term investors from Europe, the US, the Middle East and emerging markets."

Hong Kong stocks rose on Thursday, as investors looked for signs of easing geopolitical tensions following US leader Donald Trump's remarks that he had a "pretty long meeting scheduled" in South Korea with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week.

The Hang Seng Index advanced 0.7 per cent to 25,976.98 at 3.05pm local time, after falling by 0.4 per cent earlier. The Hang Seng Tech Index gained 0.7 per cent. On the mainland, the CSI 300 Index lifted 0.3 per cent and the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.2 per cent.

Leading the gainers, sportswear producer Li Ning jumped 6.7 per cent to HK$18.57, while property developer Sun Hung Kai Properties advanced 1.5 per cent to HK$93.75. Search-engine giant Baidu rose 1 per cent to HK$116.20, and WeChat operator Tencent Holdings added 1.1 per cent to HK$636.50.

Investors are watching closely for any signs that the potential talks between Xi and Trump could help stabilise markets rattled by geopolitical risks and uncertainty over global trade flows. Trump said the talks would range from soybean purchases to rare earth exports and the Russia-Ukraine war.

Chinese oil firm CNOOC advanced 2.5 per cent to HK$19.98 and peer PetroChina added 1.4 per cent to HK$8, after Trump announced sanctions on Russia's largest oil producers.

Meanwhile, the White House was reportedly weighing export restrictions of US-made software to China, adding to the trade and geopolitical tensions.

"The market is adopting a wait-and-see attitude right now, as Donald Trump's remarks often change," said Kenny Tang, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Financial Analysts. "Investors will stay cautious until the meeting [with Xi] is confirmed. So for the time being, market conditions will likely remain volatile."

Tang said there was support at the lower end of the trading range, such as around the 100-day moving average. "However, I believe the market will become more volatile when it goes above the 26,000-point level," he said.

[TITLE]City-States Without Limits – Part 2:
[TEXT]
In Part 1, we discussed the NRx technocrats’ ideas and how they have influenced the city-state model that seeks to capitalise on the global proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). We examined the role of functional oligarchies in this endeavor. In Part 2, we look at how that city-state model manifests internationally and what it implies, not just for global governance structures, but for humanity.

In Part 1, we explored the ideology that has been adopted by a powerful group of NRx technocrat-oligarchs and how their proposals align with the interests of their international oligarch partners. We discussed the venture capital impact investment strategy the NRx technocrats call “accelerationism” and how governments are actually “functional oligarchies.”

The model of “government” the NRx technocrats propose is unlike anything we are currently familiar with. It is much more akin to the kind of authoritarian dictatorships exercised by the feudal monarchs of Medieval Europe. These gov-corp Technates, as envisaged, effectively amount to dictatorial city-states under the direct control of oligarchs.

The NRx technocrats seek to break nation-states apart into technologically governed “enclaves” (gov-corp Technates). These “realms” will form an international “Patchwork,” with each enclave or “network archipelago” represented as a digital node, almost certainly on a single, overarching blockchain or “unified ledger.” The digital access permissions to the node, which serves as the digital twin for the physical realm of the city-state “enclave,” will be controlled by the “founder” or their selected administrators of the realm. This forms a gov-corp Technate ruled by a CEO King (oligarch) where “nothing officially exists” unless it is represented digitally on the realm’s ledger (blockchain).

The citizens of the realm are customers of the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) that rules the gov-corp Technate. The customers will have no individual sovereignty unless they purchase it from the “founder.” All value is digital in the realm. The life of your “digital twin,” monitored through the requirement to use digital ID, seamlessly links a customer’s offline life to that of their online digital twin.

By controlling the programmable digital currency allotted to the customer’s digital twin, via their digital ID, any misbehaviour can be punished by the founder or their delegated system administrators. For example, by freezing “their deposits” or locking people “out of all doors for a time period as a punishment.” There are no means of recourse in a gov-corp Technate. The only option open to the persecuted customer is to flee, if they have the means.

We also discussed how governments around the world have already started carving out nascent gov-corp Technates in the form of thousands of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Some of which, such as Shenzhen in China, have already been established as de facto city-states with their own increasingly independent jurisdictions and embryonic city-state governments.

At the heart of this effort to create a global patchwork of city-states are the NRx technocrats, perhaps most notably Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen in the US, and venture capital firms like NeWay Capital and Pronomos Capital. But they are far from alone. The NRx technocrat network is global and, at the highest governmental and intergovernmental level, the hope is to bring

MANILA, Philippines -- MANILA, Philippines (AP) — World shares were mixed on Thursday following a retreat on Wall Street, while crude prices jumped more than $2 after U.S. President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Russian oil giants.

The sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil are intended to drive Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and help end Moscow’s brutal war on Ukraine.

Meanwhile, European Union leaders were holding a summit Thursday, aiming to greenlight still more sanctions against Russia and press ahead with plans to use Moscow’s assets that are frozen in Europe to fund Ukraine’s war effort and economy for at least the next two years.

U.S. benchmark crude oil gained $2.70 to $61.21 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose $2.85 to $65.44 per barrel.

The future for the S & P 500 was up more than 0.1% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1%.

In early European trading, Germany's DAX slipped 0.3% to 24,083.89. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.1% to 9,527.33, while in Paris, the CAC 40 rose 0.4% to 8,238.47.

Chinese shares rose from losses earlier in the day as leaders in Beijing were wrapping up an important Communist Party meeting that will set the agenda for the coming five years.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 0.7% to 25,967.98 while the Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.2% to 3,922.41 as reports indicated Washington may tighten restrictions on exports to China of products made using U.S. software.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 shed nearly 1.4% to 48,641.61 on reports that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is preparing a stimulus package larger than last year’s of nearly 14 trillion yen (about $92 billion). SoftBank Group led losers, with shares shedding more than 4% after it unveiled plans to finance its investments in artificial intelligence by issuing U.S. dollar and euro dominated bonds.

Takaichi has also said she favors keeping interest rates near their current low level of close to zero, and that has caused the Japanese yen to weaken against the dollar. The dollar rose to 152.59 Japanese yen Thursday, up from 151.94 yen.

South Korea's Kospi fell 1% to 3,845.56, with investors remaining cautious while trade negotiations with the U.S. made limited progress.

Australia's S & P/ASX 200 added less than 0.1% to 9,032.80.

Taiwan's Taiex slipped 0.4%, while India's BSE Sensex rose 0.6%.

On Wednesday, the S & P 500 sank 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7%, from its record set the day before. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.

Netflix helped drag the market lower after delivering a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The pressure is on the video streamer and on companies broadly to deliver solid growth in profits. That would counter criticism that their stock prices shot too high following a 35% romp for the S & P 500 from a low in April.

Capital One Financial rose 1.5%, and Western Alliance Bancorp climbed 3.2% following their own profit updates that beat analysts’ expectations. The report from Western Alliance was particularly welcome after it helped shake confidence in the industry last week. It’s one of several banks that had warned of potentially bad loans on its books, possibly because of fraud.

Beyond Meat, meanwhile, swung sharply through a manic Wednesday. After surging as much as 112% in the morning, its stock erased all of that to finish with a drop of 1.1%. It’s still up 454.5% for the week so far in the midst of its meme-stock run.

The maker of plant-based meat alternatives was the biggest holding in the Roundhill Meme Stock exchange-traded fund, as of Tuesday. The ETF holds stocks where investors have piled in because they’re hoping to catch a wave of momentum, almost regardless of how or even what the businesses themselves are doing.

In other dealings early Thursday, the price of gold recovered about 1.6% to $4,131.80 after sliding for two days from its record high.

The euro slipped to $1.1595 from $1.1610.

[TITLE]Asian stocks soar to record peak on trade deal optimism:
[TEXT]
Asian stocks surged while gold and bonds retreated on Monday as signs of easing trade tensions between China and the US buoyed risk appetite, in a strong start to a week that will be headlined by central bank meetings and megacap earnings.

Top Chinese and US economic officials hashed out on Sunday the framework of a trade deal for US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to decide on later this week in their eagerly anticipated meeting in South Korea.

A trade deal would pause steeper American tariffs and Chinese rare earths export controls, helping soothe investor nerves that were frayed due to escalating trade tensions between the world's top two economies.

That sent stocks sharply higher, with South Korea's KOSPI, Taiwan stocks and Japan's Nikkei adding more than 2 per cent each and crossing landmarks to record highs. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose 1.3 per cent to a record peak.

"Investors will want to see confirmation that the trade truce holds and that China's stimulus and reform signals translate into tangible growth momentum," said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo.

US stock futures jumped, with Nasdaq futures up 1 per cent. European futures were 0.5 per cent higher. The Nikkei breached 50,000 for the first time, while the Kospi rose above 4,000.

George Boubouras, managing director of K2 Asset Management, said the market is content with the US-China momentum in recent days. "Over the past few months the market has been looking through global tariff negotiations understanding that some commentary can be a bit of theatre and noise."

The Australian dollar, often seen as a risk and China proxy, climbed 0.42 per cent to $0.6541, near a two-week high. Chinese blue-chip stocks added 0.84 per cent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.78 per cent.

Safe-haven gold eased 1 per cent, while US Treasuries fell, leaving the benchmark 10-year bond yield up 3.8 basis points. Commodities, including soyabeans, wheat and corn rose on trade deal prospects.

Central bank meetings await

Investor focus this week will also be on central bank meetings in Japan, Canada, Europe and the US.

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points after data showed US consumer prices increased slightly less than expected in September, but the government shutdown and its impact on data remain a concern.

The dollar was slightly higher at 151.13 yen, hovering near a two-week high. The euro last bought $1.16215. The dollar index was flat at 98.982.

The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are both broadly expected to hold rates steady later this week.

Although the BOJ is likely to debate whether conditions are ripe to resume rate hikes as worries about a tariff-induced recession ease, political complications may keep it on hold for now.

Focus on megacap earnings

The busiest part of the US earnings season is upon us, with megacaps Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms all due to report results this week.

While the profit edge of the "Magnificent Seven", a group of companies with huge market capitalisations whose shares dominate equity indexes, over the rest of the index is narrowing, they are still expected to post stronger results for this period.

A number of the megacap companies are also key players in the artificial intelligence industry, enthusiasm for which has been the main driver of stock market performance.

Saxo's Chanana said the US earnings season and guidance from big tech will be key to gauging how resilient corporate profits remain in a slowing economy.

"So while sentiment has improved, the coming week will test whether optimism can turn into durable conviction."
