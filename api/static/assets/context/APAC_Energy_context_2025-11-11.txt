Wall Street logged tiny gains before the bell Thursday with markets relying heavily on corporate earnings data for insight into how the U.S. economy is doing in the absence of government data due to the shutdown.

Futures for the S & P 500 and Nasdaq were up 0.2% ahead of the market's open, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1%.

Shares of Lyft rose 6.2% after hours, even as the ride-hailing app badly missed Wall Street's sales and profit targets. However, Lyft did post some of its best-ever numbers across several categories and investors seemed optimistic

showed a downward trend in early trading on Tuesday. The movement followed a mixed session on Wall Street , where gains driven by artificial intelligence optimism were offset by valuation concerns and uncertainty in upcoming earnings reports.US stock market futures, Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq today opened lower as investors reassessed the surge in technology shares.S&P 500 futures dropped 0.9%, Nasdaq 100 futures fell 1.3%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures declined 0.6%. Monday’s rally had been fueled by Amazon’s new partnership with OpenAI, which pushed the Nasdaq Composite up 0.46% and the S&P 500 higher by 0.17%, though the Dow fell 0.48%.The deal, valued at $38 billion, will see Amazon Web Services providing computing power for OpenAI’s next-generation artificial intelligence models. The announcement strengthened Amazon’s position in AI services, helping major indices recover some earlier losses before Tuesday’s decline.Palantir Technologies reported strong third-quarter results, raising its annual revenue outlook to $4.4 billion and beating analyst estimates. Despite this, Palantir stock fell over 4% in extended trading as analysts pointed to an overvaluation.The company’s shares had risen more than 150% this year, closing Monday at $207.18, with a price-to-sales ratio of 85—the highest in the S&P 500 Index. Analysts at D.A. Davidson commented that the stock’s valuation was disconnected from fundamentals, even with a 63% growth rate.Palantir’s decline reflected broader market caution around high-growth technology companies that had surged due to AI-driven expectations but now face valuation scrutiny.US stock market futures, Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq today also reacted to anticipation surrounding upcoming corporate results. Over 100 companies are set to report earnings this week.Key reports expected include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Uber (UBER), Spotify (SPOT), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Pfizer (PFE), Pinterest (PINS), and Rivian (RIVN).These earnings are expected to provide insight into consumer demand and corporate spending amid ongoing uncertainty in the US economy and potential delays in federal economic reporting.Investors are watching developments in Washington as the US government shutdown continues. The shutdown has delayed several key economic releases, including the monthly jobs report. This delay has reduced clarity on labor market conditions and inflation trends, making it difficult for investors to assess the Federal Reserve’s next policy moves.The lack of data has added to market volatility, as traders rely more on earnings and global signals to guide short-term positions.At 3:41 a.m. EST on November 4, Nasdaq 100 futures were down 1.25%, S&P 500 futures declined 0.94%, and Dow Jones futures dropped 0.73%. The US 10-year Treasury yield hovered near 4.09%, while WTI crude oil futures traded around $60.67 per barrel. Gold spot prices fell to

[TITLE]39 firms honoured in 1st Asia ESG Positive Impact Awards:
[TEXT]
PETALING JAYA: The role of the public and private sectors in ­driving sustainability took centre stage at the Asia ESG Positive Impact Awards (PIA) 2025 as 39 winners from across Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia took home a total of 52 awards in recognition of their environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts.

The awards mark the first regional accolades for the Asia ESG Positive Impact Consortium (A-EPIC), which was launched in 2024 by Star Media Group (SMG) from Malaysia, KG Media from Indonesia and the Inquirer Group of Companies from the Philippines.

The winners were awarded based on 12 different categories, which included biodiversity conservation, waste management, renewable energy, energy efficiency, supply chain management, innovative partnership and transformation, by an international panel of judges.

Social achievements and contributions were also acknowledged through the categories of diversity, equity and inclusion; relations with local communities; human rights and labour standards; ­talent management; and good health and well-being.

They had all previously won in the consortium’s local awards – ESG PIA by SMG, Lestari Awards by KG Media and ESG Edge Impact Awards by the Inquirer Group of Companies.

These companies consisted of small and medium enterprises to mid-tier, as well as large corporations and were honoured for their exceptional dedication to sustainability, championing climate ­resilience, and ethical business practices.

Guest of honour Energy Transition and Water Transfor­mation Deputy Minister Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir praised the winning companies for leading ESG efforts across the region.

“Climate change, resource scarcity and social inequality know no borders and therefore, neither can our solutions.

“Under the National Energy Transition Roadmap, we are working towards achieving 70% renewable capacity by 2050.”

“Government action alone is not enough, as we need the ­commitment of the private sector, civil society and media organisations to raise awareness, mobilise communities and drive lasting behavioural change.

“We firmly believe that regional collaboration is key to accelerating a just, equitable and ­inclusive energy transition,” he said in his speech at the awards ceremony yesterday at Sunway Resort Hotel.

He said the awards served as an important platform to elevate corporate efforts in ESG leadership while shaping public values around sustainability.

“Through these awards, we see how collaboration between Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines can foster a shared sustainability mindset across South-East Asia.

“This partnership sends a strong message that Asia is not only ready to adopt global sustainability standards, but we are ready to lead, with solutions rooted in our cultural strengths, economic priorities and community values.

“Your efforts remind us that sustainability is not a final destination, but an ongoing commitment grounded in integrity and continuous improvement,” he added.

SMG group chief executive officer Chan Seng Fatt said the awards marked a historic milestone towards making sustainability a defining force in business, society and the economy going forward.

“This is not just another award but a movement – a collective step forward for regional collaboration among media giants in our evolution beyond just reporting and becoming connectors.

“Through linking businesses, policymakers, investors and ­communities through these awards, we media giants now help to exchange knowledge and accelerate the ESG transformation.

“By celebrating these winners, we accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices across our countries and inspire more businesses to embed ESG into their strategies,” he said in his speech at the event.

Chan added that the awards also showcased the increased importance of inclusiveness ­during the ESG transition through the recognition of every organisation, whether they are large or small.

He called on all stakeholders to use the awards as a catalyst to deepen partnerships, share best practices, and scale solutions that deliver measurable impact for the good of all.

“Together, let us build a region that is responsible, resilient, and ready for the future – a region that turns purpose into progress and ambition into action,” he added.

Philippine Daily Inquirer chief operating officer Rudyard Arbolado said the awards were not just a recognition of ESG efforts but a platform for change.

“Celebrating achievement is important, but the greater value lies in showcasing what’s possible and in sharing successful models that can inspire and educate others.

“We want to show that ESG is not just a compliance exercise or a CSR checkbox. It is a core driver of value, growth, and resilience in today’s business environment,” he said at the event.

KG Media sustainability vice president Wisnu Nugroho hoped that the awards would become a rallying point for a shared ESG transformation throughout the region.

“By celebrating authentic, measurable impact, we want to inspire companies to embed ESG in their DNA, not as compliance, but as culture. Over time, this recognition should shape a generation of enterprises that drive inclusive growth, protect natural capital, and define the region’s future economy through responsibility and resilience,” he said at the event.

“Together, we can amplify the stories of progress and collaboration that make sustainability not just a Western benchmark, but an Asian movement that is rooted in empathy, inclusivity and a collective vision for the future, he added.

Sime Darby Property chief marketing and sales officer Datuk Lai Shu Wei said the awards accelerate practical ESG adoption across industries in the region through the showcase of proven frameworks.

“It reinforces that nature and development can be integrated meaningfully when supported by clear frameworks, encouraging others to translate similar ambitions into practice.

“This shifts sustainability from an intention to proven evidence, positioning long-term value creation as the future norm rather than an exception,” he said.

Also present at the event were the Philippine Ambassador to Malaysia Maria Angela A. Ponce, Indonesia Deputy Chief of Mission to Malaysia Danang Waskito, DBKL valuation and property management department deputy director Siti Maizun Arshad, SMG chairman Tan Sri Wong Foon Meng, SMG chief operating officer Lydia Wang and SMG chief content officer Datin Paduka Esther Ng.

The Asia ESG PIA was the culmination of the consortium’s year-long efforts, including the Asia ESG Summit 2025, which began on Nov 5 and ends today. It is a platform for companies to engage with thought leaders and decision-makers in shaping the region’s sustainable future.

Besides Indonesia and the Philippines, the A-EPIC’s inaugural summit also saw participation of delegates from Cambodia, India, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Germany, Singapore, Brunei and South Africa.

Both the awards and the ­summit are organised by SMG with Sime Darby Property as the Urban Biodiversity Partner.

[TITLE]Unlocking new pathways:
[TEXT]
Time for Asia to balance economic growth with green ambition

PETALING JAYA: Asia must strike a balance between economic development and green ambition, moving towards growth that is inclusive and enduring, whereby sustainability isn’t just a destination but a sign of progress.

Science, Technology and Inno­vation Minister (Mosti) Chang Lih Kang said the global sustainabi­lity agenda is accelerating, as environmental standards are becoming more stringent.

“Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting is becoming mandatory, and investors are demanding greater transparency and accountability.

“While these trends raise the bar for all organisations, they also present Asia with a significant opportunity,” he said.

“By embedding sustainability at the very heart of business strategy, we can unlock new pathways into the green economy. To navigate the path to net-zero while sustaining economic vibrancy, we must be strategic, inclusive and grounded in local realities.”

Chang said this in his keynote address at the Asia ESG Summit 2025 titled “Navigating the Path to Net-Zero: Overcoming Resource Limitations and Rising Environ­mental Standards in Asia to Balance Global Sustainability Targets with Local Economic Realities.”

To achieve this, Chang said that global targets must be contextua­lised locally, followed by empowering science, technology and innovation (STI) to unlock opportunities in renewable energy, green materials and digital innovation.

Additionally, he said public-­private partnerships must be strengthened through policies and direction set by the governments, and the agility and creati­vity of the private sector.

He added that the ministry continues to collaborate with investors, research institutions and enterprises across Asean to implement solutions.

Chang said the transition must be just and inclusive to ensure sustainability uplifts both rural entrepreneurs and skilled professionals.

“No Malaysian should be left behind as we build a knowledge-­based green economy. Malaysia also remains fully aligned with Asean’s shared agenda to advance sustainability and innovation across the region.

“Through platforms such as the Asia ESG Summit, we exchange experiences, accelerate regional initiatives and strengthen cooperation in clean energy, climate resilience and circular economy systems,” he said.

Meanwhile, Star Media Group (SMG) group chief executive officer Chan Seng Fatt said hosting the first Asia ESG Summit reflects the trust placed in the company to spearhead this regional initiative and set the tone for meaningful dialogue and collaboration on sustainability.
