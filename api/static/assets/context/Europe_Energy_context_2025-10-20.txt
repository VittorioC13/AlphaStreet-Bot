[TITLE]United Lithium Announces LOI to Acquire Uranium and Rare Earth Explorer Swedish Minerals AB, Creating a Diversified Nordic Strategic Metals Platform and Financing:
[TEXT]
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UNITED LITHIUM CORP. (“United” or the “Company”) (CSE: ULTH; OTCQX: ULTHF; FWB: 0UL) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with Swedish Minerals AB (“SM”) to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of SM (the “Transaction”).

The combination of United and SM will seek to establish a leading Nordic-based strategic-metals explorer with a diversified portfolio of lithium, uranium, and rare-earth assets positioned to support Europe’s accelerating clean-energy transition and nuclear-power resurgence.

Transaction Summary

Acquisition: United will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares (each, a “SM Share”) of SM.

United will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares (each, a “SM Share”) of SM. Consideration: In consideration for the SM Shares, SM shareholders will receive an aggregate of 25,000,000 common shares (each a “Share”) of United at a deemed price of $0.20 per Share (pre-consolidation), and $450,000 in cash, payable as a $50,000 non-refundable deposit upon execution of the LOI and $400,000 at Closing (as defined below) (unless an exclusivity extension is exercised, in which case the balance shall be adjusted as set forth below), all on a pro rata basis. All Shares issued in connection with the Transaction shall be subject to applicable resale restrictions and prior Canadian Securities Exchange (the “Exchange”) approval.

All Shares issued in connection with the Transaction shall be subject to applicable resale restrictions and prior Canadian Securities Exchange (the “Exchange”) approval. Share Consolidation: In connection with the closing of the Transaction (the “Closing”), United will conduct a consolidation of its issued and outstanding shares on the basis of one post-consolidation Share for every two (2) pre-consolidation Shares (the “Consolidation”), which is anticipated to result in a total of approximately 43,870,527 Shares being issued and outstanding.

In connection with the closing of the Transaction (the “Closing”), United will conduct a consolidation of its issued and outstanding shares on the basis of one post-consolidation Share for every two (2) pre-consolidation Shares (the “Consolidation”), which is anticipated to result in a total of approximately 43,870,527 Shares being issued and outstanding. Leadership & Board: Upon Closing, the board of directors of United will be reconstituted to comprise five members, with three directors nominated by United and two directors nominated by SM (the “United Board Reconstitution”). All director nominees will be mutually agreed upon by both parties prior to execution of the definitive agreement. In addition, Andrew Bowering will be appointed Interim Chief Executive Officer and Jonathan Franklin will be appointed President of the Company, following the Closing (together, the “Management Appointments”).

Upon Closing, the board of directors of United will be reconstituted to comprise five members, with three directors nominated by United and two directors nominated by SM (the “United Board Reconstitution”). All director nominees will be mutually agreed upon by both parties prior to execution of the definitive agreement. In addition, Andrew Bowering will be appointed Interim Chief Executive Officer and Jonathan Franklin will be appointed President of the Company, following the Closing (together, the “Management Appointments”). Royalty: Upon Closing, United will grant to the shareholders of SM a 1.75% net smelter return royalty on all properties currently held by SM on terms to be agreed upon by the Parties.

Either party has the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the LOI at any time prior to the expiry of the exclusivity period (including any extension) if, upon completion of due diligence investigations (including legal, financial, technical, and operational matters), title search, or financial review, either party is not satisfied with the results, or if any material adverse financial matter is identified. In the event of termination by United, any deposit(s) paid by United to SM shall be retained by SM as consideration for exclusivity. In the event of termination by SM, all deposits are to be repaid.

For a period of 30 days following execution of the LOI (the “Exclusivity Period”), SM has agreed to not solicit, negotiate, or accept any alternative acquisition or financing proposals relating to SM or its assets. United may, at its sole discretion, extend the Exclusivity Period for an additional 30 days by paying a further non-refundable deposit of $50,000, which shall also be creditable against the purchase price at Closing.

Strategic Rationale

The acquisition unites United’s lithium development portfolio with SM’s high-grade uranium and rare-earth portfolio spanning Finland and Sweden, two of Europe’s most mining-friendly and energy-independent jurisdictions.

SM’s uranium division controls one of the largest privately held uranium portfolios in the EU, including:

Riutta Project (Finland): A 100%-owned exploration-stage property located in southeast-central Finland near the town of Eno. The project covers a large area within an established mining region with road access, nearby infrastructure, and proximity to the Terrafame mining operation.

The property benefits from excellent access to road, power, and other regional infrastructure within a proven mining district. Norr Döttern Project (Sweden): The Norr Döttern Project is a 100%-owned, 2,900-hectare exploration-stage property located near Arvidsjaur in north-central Sweden. The project lies within a well-known mineral belt and is accessible year-round by existing road and power infrastructure.

The Norr Döttern Project is a 100%-owned, 2,900-hectare exploration-stage property located near Arvidsjaur in north-central Sweden. The project lies within a well-known mineral belt and is accessible year-round by existing road and power infrastructure. Märrviken Project (Sweden): A 100%-owned, 2,710-hectare exploration-stage property located near Ånge in central Sweden. The project lies within a well-established mineral belt and is supported by nearby road and power infrastructure.

The LOI is an arms-length transaction. Closing of the Transaction is subject to conditions precedent customary for transactions of a similar nature, including but not limited to: completion of satisfactory due diligence of SM by United, completion of the Consolidation, United Board Reconstitution and the Management Appointments, and receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, including all required filings with the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms contemplated above, or at all.

Unit Financing

United also announces a non-brokered private placement to raise aggregate gross proceeds of up to $2,250,000 (the “Unit Financing”), through the issuance of up to 15,000,000 pre-Consolidation units (each, a “Unit”) at a price of $0.15 per Unit. Each Unit will be comprised of one pre-Consolidation Share and one pre-Consolidation share purchase warrant (each, a “Warrant”), with each Warrant exercisable in to one additional pre-Consolidation Share at a price of $0.30 per Share for a period of 24 months, subject to an acceleration provision whereby in the event that the pre-Consolidation Shares have a closing price on the Exchange (or such other exchange on which the Shares may be traded at such time) of $0.60 or greater per Share for a period of ten (10) consecutive trading days at any time after the Closing, United may accelerate the expiry date of the Warrants at any time after the date that is four months and one day after Closing, by giving notice to the holders thereof (by disseminating a news release advising of the acceleration of the expiry date of the Warrants) and, in such case, 100% of the then unexercised Warrants will expire on the thirtieth day after the date of such notice.

The Unit Financing is not conditional upon the closing of the Transaction, and United intends to proceed with same whether or not the Transaction completes. The proceeds from the offering are anticipated to be used for general working capital purposes and for continued exploration of the Company’s properties. A portion of the proceeds may be used in connection with the Transaction and for exploration activities on SM’s properties following the Closing. All securities issued in connection with the Unit Financing will be subject to applicable resale restrictions.

[TITLE]US ready to tariff China over Russian oil buys, but Europe must follow, Bessent says:
[TEXT]
The United States is ready to impose tariffs on China over its purchases of Russian oil, but Washington's European allies must be willing to take part in such action, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a news conference on Wednesday.

"It is the purchase of Russian oil by China that fuels the Russian war machines. China buys 60%, six zero percent, of Russian energy. They buy 90 per cent of Iranian energy," he said.

The U.S. would produce photographs supplied by the Ukrainian government that showed Chinese parts were used in Russian drones operating in Ukraine, Bessent said through a spokesperson.

[TITLE]Big Tech's AI ambitions are remaking the US power grid. Consumers are paying the price.:
[TEXT]
This past week, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market monitor for PJM Interconnection, filed a brief with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission arguing that the federal regulator should reject a recently signed transmission agreement between Pennsylvania utility PECO Energy and Amazon's ( AMZN ) Data Services division.

While it is unclear whether utilities had begun to spend money building out connections for those projects, it is evidence of the potential threat that TD Cowen analysts attributed to an oversupply of the computers that power AI technology.

Microsoft ( MSFT ), one of the largest data center developers in the country, decided in March to walk away from proposed data center projects in the US and Europe with a combined 2-gigawatt load, according to Bloomberg.

AI has pushed a bevy of tech companies into deals with utilities across the country, but some cracks have started to show in these best-laid plans as the AI boom rapidly evolves.

Should demand ultimately fall short of estimates, utilities can be stuck with stranded assets generating no revenue. Their options then are to find a way to pass that cost — which averages around $102 per kilowatt, or $102 million for a 1-gigawatt load — on to ratepayers or write down the loss themselves.

When a utility receives a power load request, such as from a tech company looking for, say, 2 gigawatts for a new data center, the utility spends millions buying the equipment, materials, and hiring the personnel to make it happen.

But the speed-at-all-costs approach has its risks. "What are the long-term business models? How much compute will those services actually require? [There's] just huge amounts of uncertainty

[TITLE]Clean energy jobs boom to bring thousands of new jobs:
[TEXT]
Government publishes first ever national plan to recruit workers needed for clean energy mission, with over 400,000 extra jobs by 2030

31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians and welders are particularly in demand

5 new clean energy Technical Excellence Colleges to train next generation of workers, as part of government’s drive for two-thirds of young people to be in higher-level learning

Energy Secretary to set out measures ensuring companies receiving public grants and contracts need to deliver good jobs across the clean energy sector

A generation of young people across Britain will benefit from the good jobs and high wages that the booming clean energy economy can bring, under new plans announced by the government today as part of the clean energy superpower mission

Backed by record government and private sector investment in clean energy such as renewables and nuclear, the clean energy economy is sparking a boom in demand for good industrial jobs in all regions and nations of the UK – with 31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians, and welders particularly in demand.

For the first time, government will today (Sunday 19 October) publish a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030, ensuring jobs are high quality and well paid.

Setting clear workforce estimates for the first time will galvanise industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how this government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70% in the mid 90’s to around 30% today. Recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen. Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders. This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden, said:

We’re giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry - and will drive growth across the nation. Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country’s future, as part of our Plan for Change.

The government’s clean energy mission is already delivering for the UK, with the certainty and stability of the government’s mission having galvanised over £50 billion of private investment since last July.

The government has also given Sizewell C the green light, which will support 10,000 jobs at peak construction, announced Rolls Royce as the preferred bidder for the small modular reactor programme to support up to 3,000 jobs, and kickstarted the Acorn and the Viking projects in Scotland and the North East that is estimated to support a combined 35,000 jobs, including 1,000 apprenticeships. This builds on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay- with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23% more than the same occupations in other sectors.

Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

New initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers - 5 new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans - Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades

Upskill existing workers - Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world class pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and Great British Energy

It comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50% today.

With at least 1 in 6 ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.

The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 60,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

Wales’s growing clean energy industry is delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future. Projects right across the country from Pembrokeshire to Flintshire are creating opportunities for hundreds of our young people and will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.

Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC , said:

After years of previous governments starving British industry of investment, this represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy - as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.

Crucially, it puts decent work at the heart of our energy system. And it shows that when government makes a plan with unions and workers, the whole country can benefit. Whether it’s welders in Wrexham or pipefitters on Teesside, the firm commitment to clean energy jobs being good union jobs is one which will improve working lives the country over. We now look forward to government delivering a similarly robust and funded plan for the North Sea transition, which safeguards jobs and livelihoods.

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, National Officer at the GMB, said:

GMB has long campaigned for a jobs first transition. The government is listening and having a jobs plan to underpin the industrial strategy is exactly what this country needs. GMB welcomes this roadmap for clean energy jobs and the cast iron expectation unions and their members will be at the heart of this. We need fair work agreements and taxpayers’ cash has to be spend where good jobs are going to be created. Today’s plan not only sets out that expectation but crucially, how good jobs can be measured.

Eddie Dempsey, General Secretary of the RMT , said:

RMT welcomes the government’s commitment to closing loopholes in maritime and offshore employment law, which should in turn create domestic opportunities in coastal communities that support the entirety of the offshore wind supply chain. This plan has the potential to create hundreds of thousands of good jobs across the UK, offering real opportunities for those wishing to transition from oil and gas and for a new generation of workers in their own communities.

Christina McAnea, General Secretary of UNISON said:

Clean, homegrown energy is essential in tackling climate change and delivering economic growth. This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs. Extra investment for retraining will mean experienced staff already employed in the sector are able to take on new roles. Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future.

Alasdair McDiarmid, Assistant General Secretary of Community, said

After long years of managed decline and neglect under previous governments, we now have an ambitious government which is serious

[TITLE]Europe’s Aging Grids Buckle Under Renewable Energy Demands:
[TEXT]
The world’s power grids need a major upgrade to keep pace with growing rates of electrification and the ever-increasing energy demands of big data. A cleaner energy landscape means a whole lot more electricity demand, as we switch from gas-powered vehicles and appliances to newer, cleaner models that need to plug into the grid to charge. This means that expanding grid capacity and making our aging grids smarter and more flexible will be essential to maintaining energy security for the future – but grid infrastructure remains woefully neglected, and we’re already starting to see some of the fallout.

“To achieve countries’ national energy and climate goals, the world’s electricity use needs to grow 20% faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one,” states a 2023 report from the International Energy Agency. As a result, grids need to expand at an unprecedented rate. “Reaching national goals also means adding or refurbishing a total of over 80 million kilometres of grids by 2040, the equivalent of the entire existing global grid,” the report goes on to say.

Failure to prioritize investing in grid modernization and expansion poses a major threat to the clean energy transition and to energy security as grids become increasingly reliant on renewable energy sources. Solar and wind energy are variable, meaning that their production levels wax and wane according to factors that have nothing to do with demand trends. Plus, energy production is increasingly dispersed, especially so thanks to the proliferation of residential solar panels. These factors introduce an extra level of complexity for grids that were designed with just a few major utilities in mind, and with only one direction of energy flow.

All of this is already leading to some hiccups for grid stability. In Europe, where renewable expansion and EV adoption have soared, critical grid congestion and catastrophic blackouts have become an increasing issue. At the end of April, cascading grid failures in Spain and Portugal resulted in the worst blackout in European history, and highlighted how woefully insufficient grid investment has been to date. At the time, Eurelectric reported that the “extraordinary event” in Iberia served as “a stark reminder that the grid is the backbone of our society. With electricity playing an increasingly important role in our society, we need to create all the conditions to enable a secure electricity supply.”

Unfortunately, many countries are now facing the consequences of failing to create all of those conditions. In the Netherlands, massive success with clean energy capacity installation and EV adoption without commensurate grid infrastructure expansion has resulted in a new norm of power cuts and energy consumption austerity measures. And it’s going to take a lot of money and time to fix the issue.

"They have a grid crisis because they haven't invested enough in their distribution networks, in their transmission networks, so they are facing bottlenecks everywhere, and it will take years and billions of dollars to solve this," Damien Ernst, professor of electrical engineering at Belgium's Liege University, recently told the BBC. The problem is causing ripples throughout the Netherlands economy. New housing, for example, is now facing long waiting lists in order to connect to grids that are already operating over maximum capacity.

But the issue is not limited to the Netherlands. Much of Europe has neglected to properly invest in grid infrastructure as a part of national clean energy planning. "We have an enormous amount of solar panels being installed, and they are installed at a rate that is much, much too high for the grid to be able to accommodate," Ernst went on to say.

[TITLE]Europe’s Aging Grids Buckle Under Renewable Energy Demands:
[TEXT]
The world’s power grids need a major upgrade to keep pace with growing rates of electrification and the ever-increasing energy demands of big data. A cleaner energy landscape means a whole lot more electricity demand, as we switch from gas-powered vehicles and appliances to newer, cleaner models that need to plug into the grid to charge. This means that expanding grid capacity and making our aging grids smarter and more flexible will be essential to maintaining energy security for the future – but grid infrastructure remains woefully neglected, and we’re already starting to see some of the fallout.

“To achieve countries’ national energy and climate goals, the world’s electricity use needs to grow 20% faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one,” states a 2023 report from the International Energy Agency. As a result, grids need to expand at an unprecedented rate. “Reaching national goals also means adding or refurbishing a total of over 80 million kilometres of grids by 2040, the equivalent of the entire existing global grid,” the report goes on to say.

Failure to prioritize investing in grid modernization and expansion poses a major threat to the clean energy transition and to energy security as grids become increasingly reliant on renewable energy sources. Solar and wind energy are variable, meaning that their production levels wax and wane according to factors that have nothing to do with demand trends. Plus, energy production is increasingly dispersed, especially so thanks to the proliferation of residential solar panels. These factors introduce an extra level of complexity for grids that were designed with just a few major utilities in mind, and with only one direction of energy flow.

All of this is already leading to some hiccups for grid stability. In Europe, where renewable expansion and EV adoption have soared, critical grid congestion and catastrophic blackouts have become an increasing issue. At the end of April, cascading grid failures in Spain and Portugal resulted in the worst blackout in European history, and highlighted how woefully insufficient grid investment has been to date. At the time, Eurelectric reported that the “extraordinary event” in Iberia served as “a stark reminder that the grid is the backbone of our society. With electricity playing an increasingly important role in our society, we need to create all the conditions to enable a secure electricity supply.”

Unfortunately, many countries are now facing the consequences of failing to create all of those conditions. In the Netherlands, massive success with clean energy capacity installation and EV adoption without commensurate grid infrastructure expansion has resulted in a new norm of power cuts and energy consumption austerity measures. And it’s going to take a lot of money and time to fix the issue.

"They have a grid crisis because they haven't invested enough in their distribution networks, in their transmission networks, so they are facing bottlenecks everywhere, and it will take years and billions of dollars to solve this," Damien Ernst, professor of electrical engineering at Belgium's Liege University, recently told the BBC. The problem is causing ripples throughout the Netherlands economy. New housing, for example, is now facing long waiting lists in order to connect to grids that are already operating over maximum capacity.

But the issue is not limited to the Netherlands. Much of Europe has neglected to properly invest in grid infrastructure as a part of national clean energy planning. "We have an enormous amount of solar panels being installed, and they are installed at a rate that is much, much too high for the grid to be able to accommodate," Ernst went on to say.

[TITLE]Big Tech's AI ambitions are remaking the US power grid. Consumers are paying the price.:
[TEXT]
This past week, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market monitor for PJM Interconnection, filed a brief with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission arguing that the federal regulator should reject a recently signed transmission agreement between Pennsylvania utility PECO Energy and Amazon's ( AMZN ) Data Services division.

While it is unclear whether utilities had begun to spend money building out connections for those projects, it is evidence of the potential threat that TD Cowen analysts attributed to an oversupply of the computers that power AI technology.

Microsoft ( MSFT ), one of the largest data center developers in the country, decided in March to walk away from proposed data center projects in the US and Europe with a combined 2-gigawatt load, according to Bloomberg.

AI has pushed a bevy of tech companies into deals with utilities across the country, but some cracks have started to show in these best-laid plans as the AI boom rapidly evolves.

Should demand ultimately fall short of estimates, utilities can be stuck with stranded assets generating no revenue. Their options then are to find a way to pass that cost — which averages around $102 per kilowatt, or $102 million for a 1-gigawatt load — on to ratepayers or write down the loss themselves.

When a utility receives a power load request, such as from a tech company looking for, say, 2 gigawatts for a new data center, the utility spends millions buying the equipment, materials, and hiring the personnel to make it happen.

But the speed-at-all-costs approach has its risks. "What are the long-term business models? How much compute will those services actually require? [There's] just huge amounts of uncertainty

[TITLE]Heat Pumps Face Their Toughest Test Yet:
[TEXT]
For years, I have followed the rise of heat pumps as one of the central technologies for decarbonising heating. The numbers have been impressive, the policy support has been strong, and the narrative has been almost unstoppable. But as with so many technologies that capture political and public imagination, there comes a moment when promises have to turn into results. For heat pumps, that moment is now.

After several years of double-digit growth, the global market is showing signs of fatigue. Sales have dropped sharply in some of the key European markets, with declines of up to 40 percent compared to the previous year. The causes are familiar: lower gas prices have weakened the cost advantage, consumers are confused by shifting subsidy regimes, and supply chains are struggling to deliver affordable installations. A shortage of skilled technicians has also slowed deployment.

This slowdown doesn’t mean the end of the story. It marks the start of what I would call the “reality phase” of the heat pump rollout, a stage where the technology must prove itself not in theory or in targets, but in practice, across diverse climates, building types, and customer segments.

The fundamentals still work

Despite the short-term turbulence, the underlying case for heat pumps remains extremely strong. The technology is both elegant and efficient. By transferring heat rather than generating it, heat pumps can deliver three to five units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed. That kind of performance is hard to match by any other heating technology.

In colder regions, technical advances are also closing the performance gap. The new generation of “cold-climate” heat pumps can operate efficiently even at temperatures well below freezing. That changes the economics for markets like Northern Europe, Canada, and parts of the U.S., where conventional wisdom once held that heat pumps simply wouldn’t work.

For homeowners and businesses, the long-term economics can be compelling. As electricity grids increasingly draw on renewable power, the carbon footprint of electric heating continues to decline. And in markets where heat pump adoption is combined with improved insulation and energy-efficiency upgrades, energy bills are already falling.

A system challenge, not a product rollout

Where the story gets more complicated is at the system level. Installing a heat pump is not like swapping out an old boiler for a newer model. It often requires upgrades to insulation, radiators, and sometimes the grid connection itself. That means the real challenge isn’t just selling more units, it’s integrating heat pumps into a much broader ecosystem of building renovation and power-system planning.

In many cases, performance shortfalls have more to do with poor installation than with the technology itself. Field studies have shown that badly configured systems can wipe out much of the theoretical efficiency advantage. I’ve spoken to installers who admit that, under pressure to meet demand, they’ve had to cut corners or rely on limited training. If governments truly want to accelerate deployment, they need to invest as much in building a skilled workforce as they do in subsidising the hardware.

There’s also the issue of grid readiness. Heat pumps add significant new electrical load, especially in colder months. In areas where electricity infrastructure is already strained, this could cause problems unless grid reinforcement and smart-load management are rolled out in parallel. Policymakers love to quote the potential of electrified heating, but many have yet to grapple with the practical consequences of shifting millions of buildings to electric systems that will peak just when everyone needs heat the most.

The investment gap

The financial picture also needs realism. Many early adopters benefitted from generous subsidies and low financing costs. Those conditions are no longer guaranteed. Rising interest rates and budget constraints have forced many governments to trim support programs. For households facing tighter finances, the upfront cost of a heat pump, often two to three times that of a gas boiler, remains a significant barrier.

Private finance can play a bigger role, but only if projects are de-risked and performance is verified. Too often, investors lack reliable data on how heat pumps actually perform in real-world conditions. That creates hesitation and higher risk premiums. Creating transparent, standardised performance metrics could unlock a new wave of investment in building-scale electrification.

A question of momentum

What matters now is not whether heat pumps work, they do, but whether the sector can build the credibility and consistency needed for mass adoption. This is the same transition dynamic I’ve seen in other technologies: an early boom, a period of reality testing, then a second wave of disciplined, professional growth.

That second wave will depend on coordination. Manufacturers must focus on quality and after-sales service, not just volume. Governments must maintain stable, long-term policy frameworks instead of stop-start incentives that confuse consumers. Utilities need to plan ahead for flexible demand management so that electrified heating becomes part of the solution, not another strain on the grid.

Above all, the industry needs to shift its mindset from hype to performance. The promise of heat pumps will not be measured in units shipped or subsidies distributed, but in comfort delivered, emissions reduced, and trust earned.

Looking ahead

I believe the current slowdown is less a sign of failure than of growing pains. We are learning what works, what doesn’t, and where the bottlenecks really are. Technologies that change entire systems always go through this phase. The same thing happened with solar power and electric vehicles: a burst of optimism, followed by a tough adjustment, and then a period of steady, scaled growth.

If that pattern holds true, the next few years could define the place of heat pumps in the global energy transition. The fundamentals remain too strong for them to disappear. But turning those fundamentals into reliable, large-scale deployment will require competence, patience, and policy stability.

Heat pumps are past the phase of promise. They are in the phase of proof. Whether they become the quiet workhorse of the decarbonised home, or the next victim of premature hype, depends on how we manage that proof from here.
