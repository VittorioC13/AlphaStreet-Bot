[TITLE]The end of privacy in Europe? Germany’s shift on EU Chat Control raises alarm:
[TEXT]
Recent developments in Germany around the European Union’s controversial Chat Control proposal have triggered an urgent outcry from privacy advocates and technology leaders alike.

The encrypted messaging app Signal took to social media to voice deep concern that Germany may be abandoning its long-standing principled stance against invasive EU surveillance measures. Signal warns that could effectively end the right to private communication in Europe.

What is the chat control proposal?

Chat Control is a proposal put forward by the EU aimed at compelling providers of encrypted messaging services, like Signal and WhatsApp, to scan private chats for illegal content such as child sexual abuse material.

The policy demands that companies implement end-to-end message scanning. It’s a deeply contentious measure critics argue would require fundamental backdoors in encryption. Such surveillance risks undermine the very concept of private and secure communication. It would expose millions of users to governmental oversight and potential abuse.

Despite fierce opposition from privacy experts, civil rights organizations, and many tech firms, Germany had maintained a principled opposition to the proposal. The country viewed Chat Control as a clear threat to citizens’ rights. However, recent reports indicate that Germany might be on the verge of reversing its position, potentially lending crucial political support to push the Chat Control initiative forward.

A warning from Signal

In a statement, Signal declared it was “alarmed” by these reports, highlighting the dire consequences of Germany’s anticipated shift. The messaging platform stated the importance of Germany’s previous opposition in helping to protect privacy rights across Europe. It cautioned that acquiescing to Chat Control would “spell the end of the right to privacy” on the continent.

Signal further supported its statement with a detailed PDF outlining the risks and implications of the legislative proposal. The document calls on stakeholders to resist the erosion of encryption, emphasizing that security and privacy should not be sacrificed under the guise of law enforcement efficiency.

Well-known cryptographer and blockchain researcher Peter Todd highlighted the ethical ramifications, saying:

“The only ethical option for Signal if this passes is to refuse to comply. Signal shouldn’t even block the EU: let the EU block them. It should be the only legal option too: implementing Chat Control is a crime against humanity.”

The broader implications for privacy in Europe

This potential policy shift is about far more than just Germany or one EU regulation. It challenges the foundations of digital privacy and security for hundreds of millions of Europeans. Forced backdoors and message scanning set disturbing precedents that could be replicated worldwide, eroding trust in digital communication and stifling free expression.

It comes at a time when the continent is forging ahead with plans to roll out its CBDC by 2029, and after the news that the United Kingdom plans to release a digital ID for its citizens.

If Germany abandons its resistance, the Chat Control proposal may gain enough momentum to become law, reshaping privacy rights across the continent. The outcome will not only decide the future of privacy in Europe but also set a global example in the fight between surveillance and security.

[TITLE]Is Goldman Sachs Using London’s IPO Crisis as Its Own Pitch?:
[TEXT]
The UK government is teaming up with Wall Street to revive London’s fading appeal as a global listing hub.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Anthony Gutman, one of Goldman Sachs’ top investment bankers, will co-host a private roundtable on Monday with executives from technology and other growth sectors to pitch London as a viable destination for initial public offerings (IPOs).

Can London Still Compete for Global Tech and Crypto Listings?

According to TradFi media, the Treasury is organizing the meeting to hear views on the UK’s attractiveness as a listing destination. The gathering will also highlight recent reforms aimed at boosting capital market competitiveness.

Lucy Rigby, the newly appointed city minister, will join Reeves, and Gutman will present an overview of the current IPO sector. The event mirrors the urgency of London’s listing crisis, which hit a 30-year low in August.

Once the beating heart of global equity markets, the UK capital has fallen to 23rd place globally for IPO fundraising, trailing even Mexico. According to Bloomberg, proceeds plunged 69% to just $248 million, the lowest in 35 years.

“This year’s largest London IPO — an April offering from accountancy MHA Plc — raised £98 million ($132 million). No deals have involved a major Wall Street bank; small local outfits like Cavendish Plc and Singer Capital Markets instead arranged them. The third-quarter picture is even starker with just $42 million of deal volume, down 85% from the same period last year,” said Baron Investments, citing Bloomberg.

Competitors describe Goldman’s presence at the Treasury-led meeting as highly unusual. In their opinion, it effectively gives the US bank a free pitch to companies considering where to list.

Still, the partnership reflects growing concern across Westminster and the City that London risks permanently losing its position to New York, where the IPO market is roaring back to life, fueled by crypto and AI firms.

London’s IPO Decline Deepens as the US Booms

The timing of the Treasury’s outreach comes as the contrast between the UK and US markets grows starker. Data from Barchart shows London raised just £160 million ($215 million) across five deals in the first half of 2025, its weakest performance since 1995.

London Has Fallen 🚨

London's IPO market plunges to its worst level in AT LEAST 30 years 📉 pic.twitter.com/2T5pfPyXVQ — Barchart (@Barchart) August 22, 2025

US exchanges raised $28.3 billion across 156 listings, driven largely by next-generation tech and digital asset firms.

Companies like Circle Internet Group, Bullish, and Figure Technology have seen their shares soar post-listing. Circle’s stock has soared since its June debut, and Bullish’s valuation nearly doubled after its August IPO.

The US now represents the new global capital magnet for founders chasing liquidity, visibility, and strong valuations.

Back in London, investors and analysts blame a mix of regulatory hurdles, diversity,ESG mandates, and high stamp duty for deterring founders from going public in the UK.

“Sad reality… The problem is that the EU makes the same mistakes over and over again. It will not change. Innovation is killed by regulation in the EU before it’s viable…They destroy all potential by overregulating when it’s not needed,” wrote crypto analyst Quiten.eth.

Financial experts like James Graham argue that the London Stock Exchange’s DEI requirements, including board diversity quotas and costly environmental disclosures, are anti-meritocratic impositions that make IPOs less attractive for growth-stage companies.

If you IPO in Britain, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) will subject you to DEI.

To IPO you must commit to 40% women on your board, a woman in a top job and an ethnic minority director.

For founders focused on growth, this is an anti-meritocratic imposition that must go. pic.twitter.com/tbcEZs4htp — James Graham (@jamesd_graham) September 30, 2025

The Treasury insists it is working to “make the UK the best place for businesses to start, scale, list, and stay. They push that new measures will enable change, including a Listings Taskforce and potential stamp duty exemptions for IPOs.

The first day of September should have marked the beginning of one of the busiest periods of the year for Jaguar Land Rover. It was a Monday, and the release of new 75 series number plates was expected to trigger a surge in demand. At factories in Solihull and Halewood, as well as at its engine plant in Wolverhampton, staff anticipated that they’d be working flat out. Instead, when the early shift arrived, they were sent home. The production lines have remained idle ever since. Though they are expected to resume operations in the coming days, it will be in a slow and carefully controlled manner. It could be another month before output returns to normal. Such was the impact of a major cyber attack that hit JLR at the end of August. It is working with various cyber security specialists and police to investigate, but the financial damage has already been done. More than a month's worth of worldwide production was lost. Analysts have estimated its losses at £50m per week.

[TITLE]ESG: The high price of good intentions * WorldNetDaily * by Tammy Nemeth, Real Clear Wire:
[TEXT]
This fall, the European Union’s (EU) government in Brussels is set to finalize a sweeping ESG “due diligence” directive that will attempt to reshape global business in Brussels’s image.

The controversial law, several years in the making, has faced stiff resistance from companies and policymakers both within and outside the EU because the directive forces large companies—including non-EU multinationals—to meticulously audit their human rights, emissions, and environmental footprints across entire value chains.

Faced with energy and defense realities in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, it has become a flashpoint for competing priorities within the EU: the Green Deal’s draconian climate action on one hand, and economic competitiveness on the other. Can a continent truly champion industrial competitiveness while imposing costly and burdensome climate rules that shift focus from manufacturing and innovation to an expanding compliance bureaucracy? Who truly benefits, and does this path risk sacrificing Europe’s industrial vitality on the altar of regulatory and climate idealism?

A lot has changed since Europe formally introduced the law – the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, or “CS3D” – on 23 February, 2022. Exactly one day after the legislative proposal was docketed for public comment, Russia launched its ground invasion of Ukraine, setting off a series of diplomatic, military, and energy crises in Europe.

Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe enjoyed plentiful natural gas supplied by a mostly reliable but not adversarial partner in Russia. This abundance allowed policymakers in Brussels to pursue ambitious green policies, positioning the continent at the forefront of global efforts to demonize fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.

The crown jewel of this era was CS3D, meticulously shaped from the 2018 OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. The European Commission’s intent was clear: CS3D would compel domestic and multinational businesses not only to comply with strict climate and human rights standards, but also to serve as global ambassadors of compliance-driven green commerce.

The promise of CS3D was always predicated on the notion that Europe, and multinational businesses, could afford to bear the cost of being the world’s climate conscience. And it is costly. For most businesses, the CS3D represents a seismic financial shift. Compliance means overhauling reporting systems, hiring armies of consultants, and enduring relentless audits. The Danish Presidency of the Council of the European Union’s own analysis estimates that a single company could spend up to EU 2.3 million annually in compliance. Other estimates suggest affected firms could see costs shoot up by 10 to 30 percent.

Oil and gas companies, already under the microscope for their emissions, face additional headaches: they must monitor and report on every supplier’s methane output, overhaul procurement protocols, and invest millions in new software and third-party verification. All companies must also provide a net zero transition plan annually updated to demonstrate fulfillment of emissions reduction targets or lack thereof. Failing to comply is no trivial matter—penalties can reach 5% of global net turnover, and civil liability for damages is now firmly on the table.

Operationally, firms will devote resources to ongoing risk assessment, staff training, and documentation stretching from the boardroom to the field. These are not one-off expenses: the directive requires annual updates, investment disclosures, and persistent scrutiny of supply chains and emissions reduction targets. The bureaucratic load is compounded by the need to chase down compliance across both upstream suppliers and downstream customers, often in countries with no direct link to EU regulation.

Thus, CS3D, by its very design, incentivizes a shift away from material production—the factories, smelters, refineries, and manufacturers that form the backbone of the European economy—toward a white-collar managerial economy, redirecting capital from the business of “building things” to the business of auditing, accounting, and legal compliance. It is a costly model that prioritizes greenhouse gas accountants over engineers and tradespeople at a time when EU leaders say the continent faces a potential war with Russia.

A path towards further deindustrialization is directly at odds with the EU’s “competitiveness” imperative. After Russia’s invasion disrupted gas supplies and exacerbated a cost-of-living crisis throughout the bloc, the European Commission requested an assessment from Mario Draghi, former European Central Bank President, of how to address Europe’s failing competitiveness. Draghi’s September 2024 report put into words what many other world leaders already knew: “the energy landscape has changed irreversibly with the Russian invasion of Ukraine […] fossil fuels will continue to play a central role.” But due to Europe’s decarbonization targets, “EU industries that use energy intensively face higher investment costs than their competitors,” Draghi wrote.

Draghi’s diagnosis of Europe’s self-inflicted stasis gave leaders in Brussels air cover to dethrone climate change as the EU’s top policymaking priority, focusing instead on competitiveness and self-defense. But despite recent rhetoric, Europe continues to forge ahead with its most onerous climate regulations, even as allied trading partners warn of impacts on Europe’s energy supply.

State-owned LNG supplier Qatar Energy, which supplies between 12 and 14% of the EU’s natural gas supply, said in December 2024 that the country would cease doing business with Europe rather than comply with CS3D’s extraterritorial demands. American supermajor ExxonMobil said the directive would “challenge” the US-EU energy deal, comments echoed by US Secretary Chris Wright. Notably, the US currently supplies 45% of the EU’s gas needs.

A second pivotal moment was the election of Donald Trump in November 2024. With the United States adopting a more skeptical and nationalistic stance on climate agreements, European regulators suddenly faced the real prospect of trade friction, energy supplier resistance, and diminished cooperation. CS3D is at the center of these tensions, an archaic holdover from Europe’s pre-war, transatlantic consensus.

In response, talk of “simplifying” CS3D and delaying its implementation until 2028 has gained momentum. Indeed, this fall, Brussels will roll out a “simplified” version of CS3D. The hard truth is that the best version of CS3D is no CS3D at all; but absent scrapping the directive altogether, Brussels must calculate how much of the law it can salvage without risking energy and trade partnerships.

If Brussels is playing a game of chicken, it’s a dangerous game. Reduced gas flows from the US and Qatar would intensify already crippling energy costs across the region, driving further cost-of-living increases in both household spending and industrial operating costs. As Russia continues to encroach on NATO’s eastern border, Europe could not pick a worse time to deprioritize industrial competitiveness seemingly to save face with the green lobby. European leaders know this – this fall, they have a chance to show it.

[TITLE]Europe FDI Trends Report 2025: EU-US Trade Agreement Ensures 15% Tariff, Eases Threat of Escalation:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "FDI Trends in Europe (2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Europe experienced a robust growth phase characterized by increased project numbers and capital expenditures from 2023 to 2024, . Europe's share in opened Greenfield Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) projects, dominated by Western Europe, rose to 40% in 2024. Despite visible FDI opportunity, Eurozone GDP growth stunted at 0.9% in 2024, with structural issues like low productivity, rapidly increasing bond yields, and energy costs weighing on industrial competitiveness

Despite healthy levels of inward Greenfield FDI recorded in 2024, Europe's FDI climate is facing the brunt of US levies, weak macroeconomic performance, and prolonged war; these headwinds are explanatory for why opened projects in Europe declined by 44% YoY in H1 2025. Evidently, projects are stalling and/or relocating while investors seek clarity on the new global trade status quo.

To-date:

The EU faces an "all inclusive" 15% tariff rate as part of an EU-US trade agreement signed on July 27th, 2025. The deal effectively halved previously threatened rates (up to 30%) and prevented further escalation. However, copper, steel and aluminum levels remain at 50%.

As part of a US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal, the UK is subject to a baseline 10% tariff rate, made effective April 5th 2025. Still, goods such as copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, steel and aluminium are subject to variable higher rates.

Switzerland has been hit with a 39% tariff rate to curtail exports of luxury goods to the US.

The ability of Ursula von der Leyen-President of the European Commission-and Europe more broadly to retaliate is somewhat hamstrung by the region's dependence on US investment. Europe, unlike emerging economies, is notably less dependent on inward FDI flows with strong intracontinental trade. Still, the US is Europe's largest greenfield investor, announcing 954 projects (2023-H1 2025), trailed by China with 140 over the same time frame.

In terms of announced projects, Europe's distribution of inward FDI is relatively equitable among the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Turkiye and Poland. Furthermore, 40% of incoming projects (announced 2020-2024) are in renewable and alternative power, as the UK rejoins the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the US pivots back toward petrochemical energy.

Moving forward, The analyst's FDI team expects current sectoral trends to escalate, whereby international investment in renewable energy becomes more European-centric. Nations across the UK, EU and Schengen area all boast high-skilled labor, a unified regulatory framework, and attractive green credit incentives. However, whether announced investments translate into opened projects and Europe yields the benefits of renewable energy development depends on whether macroeconomic outlooks ameliorate. Strong institutional frameworks will aid development, but without attractive financial incentives and supportive macroeconomic conditions, projects will continue to stall and international investors will look elsewhere.

[TITLE]Country Risk Rating Report: Q2 2025 Update - Denmark Leads, Followed by Ireland and Switzerland:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Risk Report: Q2 2025 Update" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The twenty-eighth update of the the analyst Country Risk Index (GCRI) Q2 2025 ranks Denmark at the top, followed by Ireland and Switzerland. 43 countries were identified in the low-risk zone, 50 countries under medium risk, 57 countries under high risk, and three countries in the very high-risk zone in GCRI Q2 2025.

Global Risk Report is based on the analyst Country Risk Index (GCRI) which is a unique country risk-rating model that determines the existing and future level of country risk by assessing various qualitative and quantitative factors. The index is formulated to help firms prepare their global business strategies on the basis of historical developments in an economy and also their future expectations.

The Country Risk Index incorporates the latest available macroeconomics, political, social, technological, environmental and legal data from a range of recognized national and international statistical sources, and incorporates proprietary data from the analyst Economics Research. The model also features expert analytical judgment from in-house economists and takes into account their insights and opinions. By applying a robust approach to assessing risk, The analyst analysts ensure that strategists have an effective tool to assess current trends and risks facing the economies across the globe.

Scope

Global risk: The Q2 2025 the analyst Country Risk Index (GCRI) indicates a decrease in the risk score, falling from 55.8 in Q1 2025 to 53.0. This improvement is primarily attributed to a rise in global trade, particularly as US imports increased due to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of upcoming tariff hikes. Furthermore, proactive government measures designed to boost economic activity played a significant role in this favorable shift.

Asia-Pacific: The risk score in Asia-Pacific dropped from 54.6 in Q1 2025 to 51.6 in Q2, indicating a shift in economic conditions. While strong domestic demand and proactive export strategies initially spurred growth, the overall outlook remains cautious. Many regional economies are heavily trade-dependent, making them vulnerable to uncertainties that could hinder progress. The impending US plan to impose 100% tariffs on semiconductors, as of August 2025, presents a serious threat to Southeast Asian nations reliant on semiconductor exports.

Americas: In Q2 2025, the Americas' risk score decreased from 57.4 to 54.8. The US economy experienced a robust rebound, growing at an annualized rate of 3.3% in Q2 2025, a significant turnaround from a 0.5% contraction in Q1 2025. This growth was mostly fueled by increased consumer spending, despite a minor decline in both investment and exports. Overall, the positive economic recovery has fostered a more optimistic risk outlook for the region.

Europe: Europe's risk score declined from 42.6 in Q1 2025 to 39.3 in Q2 2025, reflecting improved economic stability amid ongoing trade tensions. The European Commission's forecast anticipates modest GDP growth for 2025, driven by resilient consumption and investment recovery. However, US trade policies and labor shortages due to an aging population continue to challenge the EU's economic landscape. Despite these challenges, the potential for reduced trade tensions and increased infrastructure spending could bolster growth and enhance resilience in the region.

Middle East and Africa: The risk score for the Middle East and Africa (MEA) declined from 65.5 in Q1 2025 to 63.2 in Q2 2025. The MEA region is poised for growth, with a projected expansion in 2025, driven by increased oil production and diversification efforts in the GCC. Major participants such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE are leveraging technology and tourism to enhance their economies, despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and fiscal risks in oil-dependent nations necessitating careful budget management.

Reasons to Buy

Global Risk Report is a valuable tool that provides critical information and insights to support decision-making, protect your business or investments, and enhance your overall risk management capabilities.

Risk identification: A risk report provides an in-depth analysis of potential risks and threats that may impact your business or investments. It helps identify and prioritize risks, enabling you to take proactive measures to mitigate them.

Decision-making support: A risk report provides valuable insights and data-driven information that can assist you in making informed decisions. It helps you assess the potential impact of risks on your objectives and aids in developing effective strategies to manage and minimize those risks.

[TITLE]Vodafone Ireland’s new Italian boss Sabrina Casalta: ‘Being a CEO was actually not in my plan’:
[TEXT]
Sabrina Casalta works well under pressure. And the new Vodafone Ireland chief has had plenty of it to test her, whether it is in the executive boardroom or on one of her road trips that turn out to be a little more challenging than you would expect.

Casalta says she likes to be forced out of her comfort zone and, with travel, there is always the potential for things to go wrong. A recent 300km trip in Mozambique threw up some interesting obstacles. “It took 12 hours. The road was foggy, there were points where you couldn’t see two metres ahead. The road was ruined by massive holes from the civil war, and there were lots of people and students walking to school on the side of the road,” she recalls. “I was responsible for making the plans. And I was the one driving for the 12 hours.”

The move from Vodafone Italy in the wake of its €8 billion sale to Swisscom to head the Irish business is her latest challenge.

“Being a CEO was actually not in my plan,” she says. “I don’t think there is the ‘final job’. It’s a journey.”

Caslta’s career is not what you would describe as linear.

“I’m not a vertical expert in one area or another. I went through different experiences and I think they were all built around curiosity, and adding pieces and tools to my skills in order to always have a broader impact.”

After graduating with a masters in management engineering, Casalta began working as a consultant, first with PricewaterhouseCoopers (now PwC), and subsequently with Boston Consulting Group. That involved working across multiple industries, focusing mainly on strategy and business transformation but not in financial services and telecoms.

Then, 14 years ago, she took up a role with Vodafone.

“When I got the chance to join Vodafone, I said, why not? It’s a new area, something new to learn and to understand.”

“Why not” seems to be what drives her. After joining Vodafone Italy in a strategy role, she moved on to become an integral part of its fibre services launch, and the early days of its 5G trials. “We started with the very early trial and experimentation into 5G, some of them even before the standard of the technology was completely defined,” she says.

Her most significant experience, she says, came later when she joined Vodafone’s business customer care team, just as the Covid-19 lockdowns began in Northern Italy. Again, “why not?” came into play.

“It was quite a big change for me, coming from strategy perspective. I completely changed my time horizon. When you work on strategy, you work on three, five years perspective; in customer operations, you have to deliver consistently, every single hour, every single day, across team of hundreds of people,” she says. “I think that the learning was on the execution side, but most importantly on the people management side.”

In February 2022, she became chief financial officer of the business, staying in the role for almost three years until the business was sold. That was when the ambition to take on a chief executive role kicked in.

“I realised that all the experience I had, they all made sense together because they gave me the broader perspective

[TITLE]The “Invisible Hand” and fake invoices, the ministers’ surprise about Kövesi, Paulson and UBS, what Goldman Sachs was doing with Mylonas, the Belgians looking into Eurobank:
[TEXT]
Newsroom October 2 09:43

Hello, I’d like to start today with the success of the “Greek FBI” in uncovering yet another major case involving forged and fake invoices, where various schemers try to steal VAT — in other words, public funds. In recent years, both the Greek Police services and, more importantly, the Anti–Money Laundering Authority and the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (AADE) have admittedly “caught” many such or similar cases. In these cases, we often hear — because they are included in the official reports of the Authorities and sent to the prosecutor — various well-known names: artists, celebrities, football figures, and so on. The problem is that in Greece, “miracles” seem to last only a few days, just long enough to make media noise. Afterwards, everything is forgotten, and the main figures in these major fraud cases walk away unscathed (or almost unscathed) and carry on with their lives — often repeating the same or very similar financial crimes. It’s as if some “invisible hand” intervenes and magically erases or neatly covers everything up. So I want to ask publicly: who is this “invisible hand” that ultimately untangles all the messes for the country’s pseudo-celebrities, even if they’re being pursued by [Minister] Chrysochoidis, [prosecutor] Vourliotis, or [AADE head] Pitsilis? Is it one person, or a combination of entanglement, corruption, and public relations?

Kövesi – A Surprise Visit

Yesterday, European Chief Prosecutor Laura Kövesi was in Athens, where she met with Ministers Pierrakakis, Chrysochoidis, and Floridis. I spoke with all my sources, and they all told me almost exactly the same thing — with minor variations —

[TITLE]The cost of cyber hacking on UK business is greater than it seems:
[TEXT]
The true cost of cyber attacks - and the business weak spots that allow them to happen

1 day ago Share Save Theo Leggett International Business Correspondent Share Save

BBC

The first day of September should have marked the beginning of one of the busiest periods of the year for Jaguar Land Rover. It was a Monday, and the release of new 75 series number plates was expected to trigger a surge in demand. At factories in Solihull and Halewood, as well as at its engine plant in Wolverhampton, staff anticipated that they’d be working flat out. Instead, when the early shift arrived, they were sent home. The production lines have remained idle ever since. Though they are expected to resume operations in the coming days, it will be in a slow and carefully controlled manner. It could be another month before output returns to normal. Such was the impact of a major cyber attack that hit JLR at the end of August. It is working with various cyber security specialists and police to investigate, but the financial damage has already been done. More than a month's worth of worldwide production was lost. Analysts have estimated its losses at £50m per week.

For a company that made a £2.5bn profit in the last financial year, and which is owned by the Indian giant Tata Group, the losses will likely be painful but not fatal. But JLR is not an isolated incident. So far this year there has been a wave of cyber attacks targeting big businesses, including retailers such as Marks & Spencer and the Co-op, as well as a key airport systems provider. Other high profile victims have included the children's nursery chain Kido, while last year incidents involving Southern Water and a company that provided blood tests to the NHS raised serious concerns

[TITLE]EU Tech Firms Look to US for AI Funding:

European tech founders are turning to the U.S. to find funding for artificial intelligence (AI) projects.

That’s according to a report Saturday (Oct. 4) from The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which said this trend is being driven by the heavier upfront costs of AI computing infrastructure and specialist talent.

This is worrisome for Europe, the report added, as the region hopes to make a name for itself as a global AI hub rivaling China and the U.S.

Although the European venture capital scene has grown in recent years, WSJ said, it still trails the U.S., where AI and machine learning startups raised upwards of $160 billion in the first nine months of the year. That’s compared to $20 billion earned by startups in Europe, the report said, citing data provider PitchBook.

U.S. investors also account for an increasing share of the funds raised by AI startups in Europe. As of Sept. 30, these investors had funneled around $14.2 billion in 549 European AI and machine learning VC projects, up from $11.7 billion in all of 2024, PitchBook data show. That represents just over 71% of deals in terms of value, compared to 57.5% in 2024.

Patrick Smith told WSJ his AI cybersecurity company, Zally, needed “a hell of a lot of money” for initial research and development and patent filing, funds he said would be impossible to raise from investors in Europe. American investors, on the other hand, “understand the runway and how much money you need to burn,” he added.

As PYMNTS wrote last week, AI is among the most capital-intensive industries in tech. Citi forecasts that global spending on AI infrastructure could surpass $2.8 trillion through 2029.

“That pull is drawing capital not only to model developers but also to adjacent players in chips, cloud, and physical infrastructure,” that report said. “The result is a market where AI platforms and infrastructure startups are flush with resources, while companies in sectors like healthcare, mobility, and climate face slower deal cycles and smaller rounds.”

CFOs are also adding restraint, PYMNTS reported, with just 26.7% of finance leaders planning to spend more on generative AI in 2026, down from 53.3% a year earlier. Half of firms who saw strong returns say they will increase spending, while just 16.7% of those seeing negligible ROI plan to do so.

“That split reflects what PYMNTS has called the ROI paradox: adoption is soaring, with infrastructure spending forecast to reach trillions, but the economics have yet to catch up,” the report continued.

[TITLE]Bill Gates and Tony Blair-Backed AI Appointed as World’s First AI Government Minister:
[TEXT]
“I’m not here to replace humans,” says a woman wearing traditional Albanian clothing, a light-colored headscarf, and an embroidered robe. She stands before the flags of Albania and the European Union and adds, “Some have labeled me unconstitutional because I am not human. This hurts me.”

The speaker is Minister Diella, an artificial intelligence system that delivered a three-minute video speech during its introduction to Albania’s parliament. In September 2025, Prime Minister Edi Rama appointed Diella as Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, making it the world’s first AI to hold a cabinet-level position.

Diella, whose name means “sun” in Albanian, was developed by the National Agency for Information Society in partnership with Microsoft, using large language models from OpenAI. The AI is visually represented as a woman from the Zadrima region, portrayed by Albanian actress Anila Bisha.

Rama said Diella will oversee public procurement to ensure that tenders are “100% free of corruption” and fully transparent. Government contracting has long been a source of corruption in Albania, a country seeking membership in the European Union.

Diella was initially launched in January 2025 as a virtual assistant on the e-Albania platform, helping citizens access government services and documents. By midyear, the system had processed nearly one million digital interactions, paving the way for its promotion to the cabinet. Prime Minister Edi Rama described the appointment as part of a broader modernization effort to improve efficiency and transparency as Albania advances toward European Union membership by 2030.

The appointment has sparked controversy, with opposition lawmakers calling it unconstitutional and warning of potential manipulation and lack of oversight. During the parliamentary session, they banged on their desks and boycotted the Cabinet vote, though it still passed with 82 votes in favor. Addressing critics directly, Diella said, “The Constitution speaks of institutions at the people’s service. It doesn’t speak of chromosomes, of flesh or blood.”

For the rest of the world, Albania’s appointment of Minister Diella marks a concerning step toward globalization and mass restriction of individual freedoms, as AI systems, programmed with liberal and globalist biases, begin assuming positions of political authority.

According to Albanian media, the Diella project is closely tied to the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, which has showcased “Diella 2.0” and an upcoming “3.0” version as part of its digital governance portfolio, funded in part by international donors. Tony Blair has advised Prime Minister Edi Rama since 2013, when Rama’s center-left coalition first came to power. Rama’s political platform was modeled after Blair’s “New Labour” and “Third Way” politics.

The Tony Blair Institute currently partners with around 20 countries, mostly in Africa, on public sector reform and digital transformation projects. Critics in Albania argue that this collaboration effectively outsources key state functions to a foreign private organization. They warn that Albania is being used as a testing ground for Blair’s global initiatives, with Rama accused of trading national sovereignty for international approval.

Together with Microsoft’s involvement through Diella’s development, many see this convergence of global actors, Bill Gates, Tony Blair, and their organizations, as evidence that Albania’s AI experiment serves broader globalist ambitions rather than national reform.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has been a key financial supporter of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, funding projects primarily focused on health and governance in Africa. Development tracking databases list multiple Gates Foundation grants to the institute.

The Tony Blair Institute promotes itself as a leader in using artificial intelligence and technology to modernize governance. Its flagship concept, the “Reimagined State,” envisions AI-driven systems transforming public service delivery and administrative efficiency. The institute also advocates strongly for net zero policies, calling them “inevitable” and central to 21st-century governance. Consequently, it is likely that AI ministers developed in association with the Tony Blair Institute would also regard net zero as both desirable and inevitable.

Both Tony Blair and Bill Gates have been outspoken proponents of digital identification systems. Blair has repeatedly argued that digital IDs will soon become standard for citizens in developed countries, stating in January 2025 that every British person will have a “unique digital identifier” used for government and commercial transactions. He has said such systems would reduce benefit and online fraud while integrating facial recognition and DNA data to improve law enforcement.

Gates made similar remarks in a 2020 Reddit AMA, saying that digital certificates could verify vaccination or recovery status during health crises. His comments aligned with the mission of ID2020, an initiative backed by Microsoft, the United Nations, and the Rockefeller Foundation, which promotes digital ID programs in developing nations.

Both Blair and Gates have also advocated for increased online regulation and censorship. Gates has called for artificial intelligence to identify and remove “vaccine misinformation” in real time, arguing that delayed moderation allows harmful content to spread. Facebook, Google, and Pinterest enlisted fact-check partners like PolitiFact, which has a left-leaning, pro-establishment bias and was originally funded by a Gates Foundation grant, to enforce these standards.

In September 2024, Blaire urged world leaders to reach an international agreement on social media controls, warning that unregulated online information is “messing with [young people’s] minds in a big way.” His institute later submitted evidence to the UK Parliament recommending policies to “slow the spread of misinformation,” “enforce against the most dangerous and deliberate falsehoods,” and apply “counter-extremism methodology” to online narratives.

A separate report from the Tony Blair Institute went further, recommending that governments designate certain “hard-right” organizations as hate groups, thereby restricting their access to media platforms and public institutions. Those recommendations will likely be built into Albania’s newest minister and similar AI ministers when they are rolled out in Africa and around the world.
