The broadcast television industry knows it needs to consolidate. It's just struggling with how to do it. In August, Nexstar Media Group, the largest owner of broadcast stations in the U.S., announced a proposed $6.2 billion deal to buy Tegna — a combination that would bring together more than 260 stations across the U.S. Last week, Sinclair , the owner of 179 local TV affiliates, made a hostile offer to acquire its smaller peer E.W. Scripps after buying up nearly 10% of the company on the open market. Both potential deals remain in limbo, and executives are getting antsy. Companies like Sinclair and Nexstar run the affiliate stations of the major networks across the U.S. known for local news, sports and other broadcast content. They face the same headwinds as their cable and content studio counterparts — the shrinking number of pay-TV customers due to the rise of streaming and tech options. Broadcast station owners remain profitable, largely from the hefty fees they receive from pay-TV distributors.

[TITLE]Capitol Hill Examines Rulemaking as Nonbanks Gain Ground:
[TEXT]
Testimony revealed the need to update regulatory thresholds to keep pace with the new era of digital fund flows and technologies.

Regulators told Capitol Hill that equal capital and liquidity rules for nonbanks and stablecoin issuers are essential to protect safety and soundness.

A Capitol Hill hearing Tuesday (Dec. 2nd) on prudential oversight made clear one problem looms over bank regulation: rulebooks designed for a different era.

Lawmakers from the House Financial Services Oversight Committee heard from senior officials from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve, FDIC and National Credit Union Administration describe a regulated banking system under competitive pressure from nonbanks, FinTech companies and stablecoin issuers, and a supervisory framework that needs rapid modernization to keep up.

Jonathan Gould, Comptroller of the Currency, said the agency’s objective innovation, including artificial intelligence (AI) and payment stablecoins, must be integrated into oversight through rulemaking that protects safety without stymieing emerging technology.

Nonbanks and Competitive Pressure

Michelle Bowman, Vice Chair for Supervision at the Federal Reserve, warned that nonbank financial institutions already control a significant share of lending. She said nonbanks are “providing strong competition to regulated banks without facing the same capital, liquidity, and other prudential standards.”

Bowman told lawmakers that banks must be “empowered to compete effectively with nonbanks” by innovating in payments and digital assets with regulatory clarity.

FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill echoed the point from a different direction, telling lawmakers that the FDIC is reviewing its bank resolution bidding process to “enable the participation of nonbank entities” under a pre-qualification system for failed-bank auctions that will begin piloting in early 2026.

NCUA Chairman Kyle Hauptman described a credit union sector facing new technology directly. The responses must be rooted in “leveraging artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies” while focusing on “measurable and material risks.”

Health of the Financial System

The regulators described a financial system that is healthy. Bowman reported that “the banking system remains sound and resilient” with “strong capital ratios and significant liquidity buffers.”

Loan performance has improved and profitability is strong across most categories. Hauptman said the credit union system remains stable, noting that as of mid-2025 “more than 81% of federally insured credit unions have a composite CAMELS rating of 1 or 2.”

Asset growth and net worth ratios have risen and the industry remains profitable.

Hill described supervisory reforms intended to promote financial stability by improving the timeliness and focus of bank examinations and by refining capital requirements to support “low-risk activities that are critical to the functioning of the financial system.”

Technology in the Banking System

Every agency representative tied technology directly to rulemaking. Bowman said regulators must provide “clarity in treatment on digital assets” and “regulatory feedback on proposed new use cases” so banks can experiment responsibly.

Gould said the OCC plans to use rulemaking to integrate emerging technologies, including AI, into bank supervision and internal agency operations. He said modernizing OCC operations through “technology, data, and AI” would produce “more efficient supervision and lower assessment fees.”

Hauptman offered a granular example: NCUA launched an AI resources page to guide credit unions through AI implementation, risk management, cybersecurity and data safeguards, positioning regulation as a support structure rather than a barrier.

Rulemaking: A Shift in How Regulators Govern

Regulators provided unusually detailed testimony on active rulemaking efforts. Hill said the FDIC and OCC jointly issued a proposed rule to define an “unsafe or unsound practice” and to set “uniform standards for matters requiring attention and non-binding supervisory observations as part of the examination process.” That rule would move enforcement into a clearer legal structure and narrow examiner discretion to material safety-and-soundness concerns rather than process issues.

Bowman said the Federal Reserve is considering a rule to “clarify the standards for enforcement actions based on an unsafe or unsound practice, Matters Requiring Attention, and other supervisory findings.”

She also described separate rulemakings on stress test disclosure and changes to the supplementary leverage ratio to prevent capital rules from becoming binding constraints that discourage low-risk banking activities. Witnesses also referenced the GENIUS Act, which requires stablecoin regulation. Gould said the OCC is drafting rules to “balance innovation with prudence” for payment stablecoins.

Hill said the FDIC expects to issue a proposed rule to “establish our application framework” in December and a proposed rule to implement prudential requirements early next year.

During the back and forth with lawmakers, Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Georgia) stated that his own interactions with local businesses revealed that government regulation are their largest costs. He directed questions to Hill tied to the Bank Secrecy Act, and specifically lower dollar vs. higher dollar reporting. “Those thresholds have not been changed for many years,” said Hill, “and the amount of reports that are filed by financial institutions is extremely large … taking a close look at this makes a lot of sense.”

Regarding security, Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) said noted the rise of fraud, including check fraud. Fraud is the “number one concern that I am hearing from banks and credit unions,” said Beatty. With a nod towards the agencies’ request for comment tied to check fraud, Bowman said that account openings are among the most critical areas to examine. Hauptman said that public blockchains help “eliminate some of these issues that can happen with other forms of payment.”

Recommendations and Regulatory Outlook

Witnesses offered direct suggestions to Congress. Bowman said statutory thresholds in bank regulation “have not been updated for years” and that inflation has caused small banks to fall under rules “intended for much larger banks.”

Hill urged lawmakers to support reforms that ensure supervisory criticisms remain tied to safety and soundness rather than reputational or political considerations. Hauptman recommended that Congress support regulatory relief that encourages innovation at credit unions.

[TITLE]IIT placements bring startups into a hiring war with the bigwigs, who wins?:
[TEXT]
Startups are offering higher salaries, bigger bonuses and more employee stock options (Esops) at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) this year, but despite securing first-day slots too, they are struggling to attract top talent as campus hiring shifts from mass hiring to picking a few high-quality candidates amid an AI-led productivity boost.

At IIT placements, venture-backed startups like Razorpay, Fractal Analytics, Battery Smart, OYO, Navi, Meesho and SpeakX are aggressively competing with tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia, as well as high-frequency trading (HFT) firms, to secure top engineering talent.​​

While startups have long recruited from IITs—Flipkart alone extended over 100 offers across campuses for the 2014 batch—they are now more assertive, often sharing prime slots with established players and HFT majors as many edge toward initial public offering (IPOs). Mint's review of their job descriptions to the IITs shows that these firms lure candidates with stocks, bonuses, rapid career growth, and generous Esops that promise quicker rewards than slower paths at legacy companies.

Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal's Navi is among the major recruiters from the IITs this season. Bansal, an alumnus of IIT Delhi and the poster boy of Indian startups, is seeking to hire for multiple roles in fintech, offering salaries in the range of ₹38.2-45.2 lakh, along with additional perks including bonuses, relocation allowances, and Esops.

In response to Mint’s queries, Subeer Bakshi, group head of HR at Navi, said the company is hiring from IITs this year and is present on all major campuses, including IIT Bombay, Delhi, Madras, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Roorkee, Guwahati, and Hyderabad.

Navi also hired IIT interns from the 2026 batch, though pre-placement offers decisions are still pending. Bakshi said median salaries have increased this year, with performance-linked pay and Esops remaining central to its compensation structure.

“We continue to maintain a compensation structure that is both performance-linked and wealth-aligned through Esops, ensuring long-term incentives remain a core part of how we attract and retain talent."

Talent shortage

Razorpay is scouting for software engineers to join its Bengaluru office. Founded by IIT Roorkee alumni Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar, the IPO bound fintech major is expected to offer around ₹20 lakh in compensation, along with a joining bonus of ₹3 lakh and ₹20 lakh of Esops with a vesting period of four years. The company declined to comment on Mint's emailed queries.

SpeakX, an over 1-year-old edutech startup in its current form, made its IIT hiring debut this year but struggled to close top candidates despite increasing compensation. The English learning platform is expected to hire backend software engineers for its Gurugram office and may offer ₹10 lakh joining bonus and ₹10 lakh Esops alongside its compensation.

“Upwards of ₹50 lakh CTC, including Esops," the company said, adding that “even that isn’t competitive with the top-paying recruiters." The company, however, managed to secure a slot on Day Zero.

Still, many of the top 20 students at IIT Madras and IIT Kanpur had “either backed out or were already placed," and some didn’t turn up despite clearing the online test.

The company eventually hired five engineers, but said interest in early-stage startups was stronger at the National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and the Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs). “The enthusiasm for startups is much higher at NITs and IIITs than at IITs." With AI now writing “70% of our code internally," SpeakX said companies increasingly need fewer but exceptional hires.

“We had to raise our comp(ensation) bands…If you want to play in that league, there’s no other way. But because we hire fewer people, the cost structure balances out."

IPO lure

Battery swapping firm Battery Smart, founded by Pulkit Khurana and Siddharth Sikka, IIT Kanpur alumni, may also offer postings in its Gurugram office to data analysts and strategy and operations associates against ₹25 lakh, inclusive of ₹2 lakh of performance bonus, ₹1 lakh of joining bonus and Esops worth ₹7 lakh.

“At Battery Smart, IITs continue to be a key talent pool as we scale the next phase of India’s EV transition. This placement season, we’re hiring across product, technology, supply chain, and operations from select campuses," Nitasha Sharma, talent acquisition director, said.

To attract top talent in a competitive landscape, Battery Smart focuses on more than compensation, she added. “We offer a well-rounded compensation package comprising fixed salary, performance-based incentives, and long-term value through Esops. Beyond competitive roles and career progression, we offer a culture where innovation, autonomy, and purpose come together, and the chance to help shape a category-defining business from the ground up."

While more traditional firms use Esops, bonuses and clawbacks to retain employees and prevent them from exiting early, as Mint reported on Tuesday, for IPO-bound startups, it is a way to attract candidates to the firm. Of the 23 IITs, the newer ones, along with some other major engineering colleges, including NITs, began their placements in September, before the older IITs.

Mumbai-based artificial intelligence and analytics firm Fractal Analytics, which is also exploring an upcoming IPO, is seeking AI engineers for its Mumbai, Gurugram, and Bengaluru offices. The company may offer a salary of ₹35 lakh, accompanied by a retention bonus of ₹3 lakh after 13 months, with a 12-month clawback period. The firm declined to comment on queries shared by Mint.

Retention tool

IPO-bound OYO Rooms is seeking candidates to join its leadership programme in Gurugram and can offer a salary of around ₹11.5 lakh. Similarly, Meesho, too, has multiple openings with a likely compensation range of ₹37.25-60 lakh, ahead of its IPO. “A majority of our hires are technology folks.

[TITLE]Titan OS raises $58 million from Highland Europe for its smart TV OS:
[TEXT]
TV makers need to get more lifetime value from a customer after selling a unit. With more competition in the market, companies often need to sell TVs at a discounted price with lower margins. The best way for them to recover the money is by striking partnerships with channels, streaming services, and advertisers.

This is the core thesis around Barcelona-based Titan OS, which provides a smart TV operating system to TV makers with a promise to get better lifetime value out of the customer.

The company said today it has raised €50 million ($58 million) in Series A funding, led by Highland Europe, with participation from Mangrove Capital Partners. The company didn’t specify how much money it has raised to date, but said that its seed round, raised in 2023, was in double-digit millions.

The startup was founded in 2023 by Jacinto Roca, Timothy Edwards, Miquel Barba, and Tobias Pfalzgraff. Roca previously founded a streaming startup called Wuaki.tv and sold it to Rakuten. Other co-founders have also held various roles at Rakuten.

Titan OS now serves 18 million users, largely across Europe and Latin America, via partnerships with Philips and JVC.

The software is designed to help users discover content easily, as Nielsen said in 2023 that the time spent trying to find content to watch has increased. Titan OS aims to use data insights from users and its vast content portfolio to reduce that time. Across the OS, users have access to a mix of broadcast TV, streaming apps that they subscribe to, along with FAST (free ad-supported television) channels from Titan OS’s partners.

For the company, revenue opportunity lies in a few key areas. First, it partners with many FAST services to help them reach the local audience. Second, there are advertising opportunities on the home screen of the TV and during streams that reach millions of users. The company said its content partners are eager to reach new audiences through advertising, especially event-heavy content channels that show sports.

Titan OS also offers shoppable ads that have customers perform actions like scanning a QR code to buy an item. The startup said that through these areas, it has grown 10x in revenue in two years.

While TV makers like Sony might not shed their core operating system, they are keen to partner with companies like Titan OS to offer more FAST channels to their customers. Multiple reports suggest that for TV makers, advertising is becoming a more lucrative revenue-earning option than hardware itself. Titan OS COO Edwards buys into this ethos.

“It used to be the case that hardware manufacturers made most of their profit from selling the device itself. But now, some hardware manufacturers that have their own operating system make more profit from ongoing content and advertising revenues than they do from actually selling the hardware. And this is a big change,” he told TechCrunch over a call.

“What we offer them [TV companies] is an ability to generate ongoing content and advertising revenues after the device is sold, which is not the status quo in the market.”

Edwards said that, to expand the company’s footprint in Europe, the company is bolstering its portfolio of local language ad-supported channels catered to each geography. With this strategy, the startup, which competes with the likes of Whale TV and Xperi’s TiVO, offers over 100 channels in these markets.

The company currently has 200 people across three offices in Barcelona, Amsterdam, and Taipei. The additional funding will help Titan OS bolster the staff across product and sales, work on new partnerships, and create new advertising projects. The company aims to maintain its growth curve and raise additional funding next year.

Laurence Garrett, a partner at Highland Europe, equated Titan OS with WeTransfer, the VC firm’s investment that was acquired by Bending Spoons.

“With Titan OS, there is the beauty of the advertising model on top of the actual core OS. It was something we could identify with [from their experience with WeTransfer], and the partners loved it,” he said.

Garrett added that with Titan OS’s European roots, the company can better understand the nitty-gritty of the local market as compared to players coming in from abroad.

[TITLE]Rare earth magnet sops to lift India’s EV, chip plans: Industry:
[TEXT]
The Union Cabinet’s approval of a Rs 7,280 crore scheme to promote manufacturing of sintered rare earth permanent magnets ( REPM ) will help address a crucial missing link in India’s electric vehicle (EV) and chip supply chains, electronics and semiconductor industry executives said.The programme aims to create 6,000 metric tonnes per annum of integrated REPM capacity through five globally bid projects, backed by sales-linked incentives and capital subsidy over a seven-year period.Under the scheme, India will, for the first time, support end-to-end REPM manufacturing, from rare earth oxides to metals, alloys and finished magnets, in order to cut import dependence and serve fast-growing demand from EVs, renewables, industrial electronics and defence.The government has earmarked Rs 6,450 crore for sales-linked incentives over five years and Rs 750 crore as capital support to set up the targeted 6,000 metric tonnes per annum capacity, with each of the five selected players expected to get up to 1,200 metric tonnes per annum.Officials expect India’s REPM consumption to roughly double between 2025 and 2030, driven primarily by EVs and clean energy, making domestic capacity critical to supply chain security and the country’s Net Zero 2070 roadmap.The scheme’s seven-year timeline includes a two-year gestation period for plants to come up, followed by five years of incentive disbursal linked to magnet sales.The REPM scheme complements ongoing semiconductor and electronics initiatives by addressing a core upstream vulnerability in India’s EV and chip ecosystem, said industry executives.Mayank Shrivastava, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru and cofounder of AGNIT Semiconductors that specialises in gallium nitride semiconductor technology, said the programme is “as critical as building fabs”. This is because advanced electronics depends on magnetic materials as much as on silicon, and the initiative shores up a key weak link in the country’s electronics supply chain.Rajoo Goel, secretary-general of the Electronic Industries Association of India , called the government scheme a first of its kind initiative focused on the core of the supply chain for electronics. Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnet available, making them critical for emerging technology applications like electric motors for vehicles, defence and aerospace, renewable energy, computer hard drives and smaller electronics such as smartphones, he said.These magnets are efficient, long-lasting, and have higher resistance to corrosion and high temperatures, he explained. With rapidly growing demand for electronic products and technology, magnets and inputs made of rare earth materials have become critical, he added.The electronics industry is becoming increasingly dependent on the same and the countries which control their supply chain and technology have a geopolitical advantage and can dictate terms to the rest of the world, Goel said. Vivek Tyagi , executive council member at the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association, said the scheme could quickly reduce import dependence for two- and three-wheeler manufacturers while also benefiting four-wheeler players over time.Several executives view the move as a logical follow-on to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology's India Semiconductor Mission, aligning magnet manufacturing incentives with policies to attract chip fabs and advanced packaging units.The policy push comes as Andhra Pradesh emerges as a hub for downstream electronics and semiconductor manufacturing linked to EVs and industrial applications.Advanced System in Package (ASIP) Technologies is setting up an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facility in the state in partnership with South Korea’s APACT, with an initial investment of Rs 468 crore.Chennai-based Syrma SGS, through its unit Syrma Strategic Electronics, is also building a Rs 765 crore multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) plant in Andhra Pradesh under the Centre’s electronic component manufacturing scheme, strengthening local PCB availability for automotive and industrial original equipment manufacturers.ASIP Technologies chief executive Venkata Simhadri said the rapid transition to EV two-wheelers and four-wheelers makes it “very important for India to create the local ecosystem and supply chain”, pointing to both semiconductors and REPMs as key components in the new mobility stack.He highlighted that the REPM scheme, along with ISM incentives for fabs and advanced packaging, addresses crucial elements of the EV supply chain, from permanent magnet motors on the mechanical side to compound semiconductor-based motor control and battery charging systems on the electronics side.While many electronics manufacturing services (EMS) players do not directly process rare earth materials, they expect second-order benefits from improved magnet availability.Syrma SGS managing director Jasbir Singh Gujral said REPMs are critical inputs for EV and semiconductor industries, and a domestic magnet ecosystem will indirectly help EMS companies by making the supply of magnet-based components more predictable and reducing the risk of supply chain disruptions.Syrma’s own operations rely on components made using REPMs, rather than raw magnets themselves, so greater upstream resilience should translate into smoother sourcing for finished parts, he said."It's a very well curated scheme that is coming at the apt time. It's going to take some time for these capacities to get created but the reactions I'm getting from my peers are quite positive," an EMS company executive said on the condition of anonymity."There is a belief that the investments are going to come in. And this is again de-risking from the borderland country which is absolutely prudent," he said.For fabless firms such as BigEndian Semiconductors, which designs custom system-on-chip (SoC) solutions from its Bengaluru base while partnering with a foundry in Taiwan, the scheme stresses India’s intent to build deeper hardware value chains.Cofounder and chief executive Sunil Kumar cautioned that gestation-heavy incentive schemes tend to favour already established large organisations. However, innovation often comes from smaller challengers, making it important for policy to be calibrated to company size, he argued.Academia and skill-development experts expect the REPM scheme to catalyse new electronics manufacturing clusters, particularly for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and startups in advanced materials and magnet-based components.T Senthil Siva Subramanian, who heads the Institute Industry Interface programme at Hindustan College of Science and Technology in Mathura, said the scheme can help create MSME-focused electronics clusters that bridge lab-to-market gaps, generate new job roles through skilling, and encourage startups in REPM and related applications.He added that such clusters can feed into broader initiatives like “Vocal for Local” and “One District One Product” by nurturing “swadeshi” proof-of-concepts, while also advancing UN Sustainable Development Goals related to industry, innovation, infrastructure and climate action.Experts argue that domestic REPM capacity carries strategic weight beyond EVs, given its applications in defence, medical devices, nuclear research reactors and precision agriculture equipment.Subramanian pointed out that magnets such as samarium-cobalt and neodymium-iron-boron are critical across defence security systems, electronic traction motors, therapeutic medical equipment, nuclear research reactors and electronic farm machinery, and that local design and production capabilities can enhance India’s strategic autonomy and global ranking in high-tech manufacturing.He also expects the scheme to spur intangible investments in design tools, miniaturised products, software and intellectual property around rare earth magnets, boosting India’s standing in global innovation indices and helping domestic products progress across technology, customer, manufacturing and investment readiness levels.For policymakers and industry, the REPM push is increasingly seen as a foundational layer that strengthens everything from chip packaging and compound semiconductors to EVs, robotics and flexible electronics.(With inputs from Dia Rekhi in Chennai)

[TITLE]FDI insurge: Robust inflows into future-focused fields could help India stare down global economic uncertainty:
[TEXT]
Foreign direct investment (FDI) has a long history of transforming industries—from steel to semiconductors. This has been true in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and India.

But there’s an FDI shake-up underway, according to a new study from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).

As investment decisions increasingly follow geopolitical lines, India stands as the world’s top emerging-market destination for announced ‘greenfield’ FDI—that is, cross-border investment projects that create net new production capacity.

From 2022 through the first five months of 2025, India’s greenfield FDI inflow announcements have averaged $83 billion a year—24% higher than in the 2015 to 2019 period.

Of those billions pledged to India since 2022, nearly 80% were destined for advanced manufacturing, communications and software, and resource-related sectors—industries poised to shape tomorrow’s global economy.

These are neither the conventional textile nor basic product investments that played large roles in years past. While India’s large and growing domestic market continues to pull in foreign investors, it is far from the only factor in play in the post-pandemic years.

[TITLE]ITU unveils four-year plan to “bring connectivity to everyone around the world”:
[TEXT]
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)’s World Telecommunication Development Conference (WTDC-25) held in Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, has closed after two weeks of debate and deliberations. Its final communique, the Baku Declaration and Action Plan, reports that delegates agreed on a roadmap “to bring connectivity to everyone around the world”.

The United Nations body claims the action plan document “sets the agenda for human-centred digital development driven by telecommunications and information and communication technologies with focus on the needs of developing countries, unserved communities and vulnerable populations” via “universal, meaningful connectivity” (UMC).

The new four-year plan will run from 2026 until the end of 2029. It will support initiatives to spread global, meaningful and affordable digital connectivity to the remaining 2.2 billion people who, even after all the years devoted to attempt after attempt to finally bridge the digital divide, still have no broadband access and remain disenfranchised from the internet and the global digital economy.

Speaking at the WTDC-25 closing ceremony, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, the secretary general of the ITU, said: “WTDC-25 has brought us closer to our goal of making connectivity universal, meaningful and affordable for everyone, everywhere, in this decade.” She added, “The new plan is our roadmap towards human-centred digital development that leaves no one behind.”

WTDC-25 was hosted by the government of Azerbaijan and, as is par for the course for these events, it produced masses of wordy worthiness. Nonetheless, between them, the 2,000 delegates from the 153 member states of the ITU did reach a broad consensus on practical plans to map out a route to bring the benefits of sustainable broadband and digitisation to, and for, all.

The communique once again proves that the venerable organisation, founded back in 1865 as the International Telegraph Union and specialised agency of the United Nations (UN) since 1947, still has a major role to play in the era of AI and quantum computing. To this day, the ITU continues to coordinate the global use of the radio spectrum and satellite orbits, establishes international technology standards and strives to enable universal connectivity and access to digital services.

In addition to both new and revised resolutions to focus the agency’s digital development works, the Baku Declaration and Action Plan also includes recommendations on how the ITU’s Telecommunication Development Sector (ITU-D) unit might address key digital development priorities in ITU-D regions.

Cosmas Luckyson Zavazava, the director of the ITU’s Bureau of Telecommunication Development, commented: “The plan outlines the roadmap of action to bridge the remaining digital divides, while addressing the unique needs of [the] least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small-island developing states. We look forward to delivering tangible results and accelerating digital transformation by working with governments and regulators to create an enabling policy and regulatory framework that paves the way for industry and private sector to invest and contribute to our efforts to close infrastructural gaps so we may achieve meaningful connectivity and bring everyone online.”

During the course of WTDC-25, the ITU published its Global Connectivity Report 2025. It is based on the agency’s newly released Facts and Figures 2025 document and provides “policy guidance, measurement frameworks and detailed analysis across the key dimensions of universal and meaningful connectivity: Quality, availability, affordability, devices, skills and security.”

The WTDC also agreed on a two-year project to enhance the sustainability of national smart villages and smart islands programmes in the Asia Pacific region. This project, to be carried out in collaboration with Australia’s Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications, Sport and the Arts, is mooted as a model via which digital skills and access to digital services is enhanced in rural and remote communities, directly benefitting seven countries and 3,000 people. Not many, but not unimportant either – every little helps.

A further, rather vague, declaration to “promote capacity building and digital skills in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), was also agreed. The CIS is a russophone Eurasian intergovernmental organisation that was formed after the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991. The CIS charter has it that all its members are “sovereign and independent nations”. The organisation “encourages cooperation in economic, political and military affairs”, which is both very dated and horribly ironic given that Ukraine has been illegally invaded by fellow-CIS member, Russia. Unsurprisingly Ukraine no longer participates in the CIS and another member country, Moldova, has announced that it will withdraw from the CIS.

Ongoing massive disparity between high-income and low-income nations

The ITU’s 129-page Global Connectivity Report 2025 (GCR) is jam-packed with facts, figures and statistics as it takes stock of the current state of connectivity worldwide and highlights the continuing divides between and within countries. It reports that broadband connectivity is now a defining feature of the global economy and a major driver of human development. What’s more, there is an ever-increasing body of evidence to show the correlation between broadband expansion, the availability of connectivity and improved socioeconomic performance.

However, the expansion of connectivity around the globe also throws up what the GCR calls “a connectivity paradox” whereby, although connectivity provides immense benefits, it also introduces new challenges and vulnerabilities. The fact is that unequal access, uneven quality, high costs and limited digital skills leave billions of people still unable to participate fully. What’s more, these digital divides often compound pre-existing ‘analogue’ socioeconomic inequalities.

Furthermore, affordability (or the lack of it) plays a decisive role in whether or not universal, meaningful connectivity can be achieved. ‘Digital poverty’ results in exclusion from digital opportunities. High costs for both ICT services and devices are constantly cited as barriers to internet access, especially among low-income households. In economies where the price of mobile broadband amounts to a significant share of monthly gross national income (GNI) per capita, not only is the share of internet users lower but so too is data usage per subscription.

In contrast, economies that meet the Broadband Commission’s target of ensuring that entry-level broadband services cost less than 2% of monthly GNI per capita have the highest shares of internet users in the population and benefit from much higher data traffic. (The Broadband Commission is a public/private partnership co-founded by the ITU and UNESCO to advance broadband technology for sustainable development.)

Where domestic subscriptions are concerned, spend on ICT services varies widely. In the richest countries, ICT services account for 2% to 3% of household expenditure, while in lower-income economies, this climbs to 9% higher. As has been the case for so long, rural populations generally spend a bigger part of their income for broadband connectivity than urban populations. Not only that, rural subscribers can, and often do, get lower-quality services than their urban counterparts because deploying broadband outside urban areas costs more and so the tariffs are higher.

Fortunately, as the Global Connectivity Report notes, between 2013 and 2025 global affordability eased, with the median price of entry-level mobile broadband falling by some 50% during those years. However, in nine out of ten low-income economies, a 5 gigabytes mobile broadband package costs more than 10% of the average monthly income, five times more than the Broadband Commission’s 2% target.

The report also reveals that the cost of connectivity for the lowest earners can be prohibitive. For at least 40% of earners in the least-developed countries (LDCs) and low-income economies, the cost of broadband services can be as high as 20% of their gross national income per capita. That’s 10 times the Broadband Commission’s target.

The ITU says achieving universal, meaningful connectivity will depend on sustained investment in the “statistical foundations of digital development”. Many countries still face gaps in data, capacity and financing that constrain evidence-based policy-making. Thus, the strengthening of national data ecosystems should be a central objective of the global digital agenda.

Governments need to treat ICT statistics as a strategic public good and integrate them into national development and statistical strategies. Strong institutional arrangements – linking national statistical offices, regulators and digital ministries – are essential to ensure regular data collection, stable financing and the effective use of statistics in policy design. At the international level, current support for data systems remains fragmented, and few mechanisms focus specifically on ICT and digital inclusion. Establishing a coordinated, multipartner financing facility could provide predictable resources, align donor efforts with national priorities, and promote sustained, comparable data production.

Innovation will also be key. The use of mobile phone, geospatial and other alternative data sources can complement traditional surveys, offering timelier and more granular insights. To harness these opportunities, countries must invest in data literacy, privacy safeguards and modern infrastructure.

The report also stresses that continued international cooperation and standardisation will be essential, and this is where the ITU emphasises its own pedigree and asserts that it will continue to “lead global efforts to harmonise definitions, methodologies and tools for ICT measurement, while supporting capacity development and providing technical assistance. Strengthened collaboration across the United Nations system, development partners and the private sector can ensure that all countries are equipped to produce and utilise high-quality digital-development statistics, establishing data as a cornerstone for inclusive and effective digital transformation,” it noted.

Meanwhile, the ITU’s Facts and Figures 2025 report shows that some 6 billion people around the world,

[TITLE]2025 CPA-Zicklin Index Finds Strong Corporate Support for Robust Political Disclosure and Accountability:
[TEXT]
The number of leading U.S. companies with the most robust policies for transparency and accountability around their political spending increased significantly from 103 in 2024 to 112 this year, according to the recently released 2025 CPA-Zicklin Index.

For the first time, representatives of five major U.S. public companies – all of them Trendsetters – participated in the announcement event. From the telecommunications, payments technology, and utilities sectors, the companies in attendance were Visa Inc. (Index score of 100.0 percent); Comcast Corp. (94.3 percent); Consolidated Edison Inc. (100.0 percent); Sempra (100.0 percent); and FirstEnergy Corp. (94.3 percent). Each were awarded certificates for earning Trendsetter status; all other Trendsetter companies are receiving the recognition digitally.

The 2025 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, the annual benchmarking of the political disclosure and accountability policies of the Russell 1000, was released at an event at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. It is a joint effort of the Center for Political Accountability, a Washington, DC based non-profit, and The Wharton School’s Zicklin Center for Governance and Business Ethics.

These public companies scoring 90 percent or above in the benchmarking study, designated Trendsetters, comprised more than 22 percent of all S&P 500 companies evaluated. This reflected a continuing trend “despite [companies] facing the greatest pressures of a lifetime,” in a period of turmoil and national division, the study said.

Company representatives made strong statements

[TITLE]Telco Market Tracker Report, 2Q25: Performance for 140 Telcos from 1Q11 Through 2Q25 - Revenue, Labor, Capex, Opex, and Profitability Data:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Telco Market Tracker, 2Q25: Capex pullback persists even as revenues surge 4.6%" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

This report delivers a detailed analysis of the global telecommunications network operator (telco) industry, drilling down into performance for 140 telcos from 1Q11 through 2Q25. It captures revenue, labor, capex, opex, and profitability data with a focus on the most recent quarter (2Q25).

Key findings:

Global telco revenues climbed 4.6% year-over-year (YoY) in 2Q25 to reach $456.8 billion (B), supported by broad-based recovery across major markets. On an annualized 2Q25 basis, revenues grew 1.7% YoY to $1.8 trillion (T). Airtel (20.0%), Etisalat (18.7%), SoftBank (7.3%), Deutsche Telekom (4.6%), and China Unicom (3.7%) led growth in the annualized 2Q25 period, while Vodafone (-11.6%) and Orange (-7.1%) declined sharply.

Capex declined 2.1% YoY in 2Q25 to $67.5B, while the annualized total fell 2.6% to $292.9B. That's the lowest 12-month total since 2011, and the lowest capital intensity since 2013. China Mobile remained the largest investor with $24.4B in annualized capex (+7.8% YoY) in 2Q25, while America Movil (-24.5%), China Telecom (-22.9%), and China Unicom (-17.7%) made significant cutbacks. Telco tech spending continues to shift modestly towards software and services, which may be recorded as opex rather than capex, but telcos remain vigilant cost cutters across the board.

Labor costs fell 1.3% YoY to $258.1B in the annualized 2Q25 period, with telco headcount shrinking to 4.36 million. Labor represented 21.7% of opex (excluding D&A) for the annualized 2Q25 period, down a bit from 22.2% in 2Q24.

Profitability margin inched higher in the latest annualized period from a year ago, with EBITDA at 33.8%, suggesting stable operational efficiency despite cost pressures. EBIT margin also edged up a bit, from 14.9% in 2Q24 to 15.5% for the 12 months ended June 2025.

Regionally, Asia maintained its lead with 36.8% of global telco revenues in 2Q25, slightly ahead of the Americas (36.3%). On the capex spending front, the Americas outspent all other regions, boosted by network spending from AT&T and Verizon.

[TITLE]IIT placements bring startups into a hiring war with the bigwigs, who wins?:
[TEXT]
Startups are offering higher salaries, bigger bonuses and more employee stock options (Esops) at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) this year, but despite securing first-day slots too, they are struggling to attract top talent as campus hiring shifts from mass hiring to picking a few high-quality candidates amid an AI-led productivity boost.

At IIT placements, venture-backed startups like Razorpay, Fractal Analytics, Battery Smart, OYO, Navi, Meesho and SpeakX are aggressively competing with tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia, as well as high-frequency trading (HFT) firms, to secure top engineering talent.​​

While startups have long recruited from IITs—Flipkart alone extended over 100 offers across campuses for the 2014 batch—they are now more assertive, often sharing prime slots with established players and HFT majors as many edge toward initial public offering (IPOs). Mint's review of their job descriptions to the IITs shows that these firms lure candidates with stocks, bonuses, rapid career growth, and generous Esops that promise quicker rewards than slower paths at legacy companies.

Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal's Navi is among the major recruiters from the IITs this season. Bansal, an alumnus of IIT Delhi and the poster boy of Indian startups, is seeking to hire for multiple roles in fintech, offering salaries in the range of ₹38.2-45.2 lakh, along with additional perks including bonuses, relocation allowances, and Esops.

In response to Mint’s queries, Subeer Bakshi, group head of HR at Navi, said the company is hiring from IITs this year and is present on all major campuses, including IIT Bombay, Delhi, Madras, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Roorkee, Guwahati, and Hyderabad.

Navi also hired IIT interns from the 2026 batch, though pre-placement offers decisions are still pending. Bakshi said median salaries have increased this year, with performance-linked pay and Esops remaining central to its compensation structure.

“We continue to maintain a compensation structure that is both performance-linked and wealth-aligned through Esops, ensuring long-term incentives remain a core part of how we attract and retain talent."

Talent shortage

Razorpay is scouting for software engineers to join its Bengaluru office. Founded by IIT Roorkee alumni Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar, the IPO bound fintech major is expected to offer around ₹20 lakh in compensation, along with a joining bonus of ₹3 lakh and ₹20 lakh of Esops with a vesting period of four years. The company declined to comment on Mint's emailed queries.

SpeakX, an over 1-year-old edutech startup in its current form, made its IIT hiring debut this year but struggled to close top candidates despite increasing compensation. The English learning platform is expected to hire backend software engineers for its Gurugram office and may offer ₹10 lakh joining bonus and ₹10 lakh Esops alongside its compensation.

“Upwards of ₹50 lakh CTC, including Esops," the company said, adding that “even that isn’t competitive with the top-paying recruiters." The company, however, managed to secure a slot on Day Zero.

Still, many of the top 20 students at IIT Madras and IIT Kanpur had “either backed out or were already placed," and some didn’t turn up despite clearing the online test.

The company eventually hired five engineers, but said interest in early-stage startups was stronger at the National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and the Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs). “The enthusiasm for startups is much higher at NITs and IIITs than at IITs." With AI now writing “70% of our code internally," SpeakX said companies increasingly need fewer but exceptional hires.

“We had to raise our comp(ensation) bands…If you want to play in that league, there’s no other way. But because we hire fewer people, the cost structure balances out."

IPO lure

Battery swapping firm Battery Smart, founded by Pulkit Khurana and Siddharth Sikka, IIT Kanpur alumni, may also offer postings in its Gurugram office to data analysts and strategy and operations associates against ₹25 lakh, inclusive of ₹2 lakh of performance bonus, ₹1 lakh of joining bonus and Esops worth ₹7 lakh.

“At Battery Smart, IITs continue to be a key talent pool as we scale the next phase of India’s EV transition. This placement season, we’re hiring across product, technology, supply chain, and operations from select campuses," Nitasha Sharma, talent acquisition director, said.

To attract top talent in a competitive landscape, Battery Smart focuses on more than compensation, she added. “We offer a well-rounded compensation package comprising fixed salary, performance-based incentives, and long-term value through Esops. Beyond competitive roles and career progression, we offer a culture where innovation, autonomy, and purpose come together, and the chance to help shape a category-defining business from the ground up."

While more traditional firms use Esops, bonuses and clawbacks to retain employees and prevent them from exiting early, as Mint reported on Tuesday, for IPO-bound startups, it is a way to attract candidates to the firm. Of the 23 IITs, the newer ones, along with some other major engineering colleges, including NITs, began their placements in September, before the older IITs.

Mumbai-based artificial intelligence and analytics firm Fractal Analytics, which is also exploring an upcoming IPO, is seeking AI engineers for its Mumbai, Gurugram, and Bengaluru offices. The company may offer a salary of ₹35 lakh, accompanied by a retention bonus of ₹3 lakh after 13 months, with a 12-month clawback period. The firm declined to comment on queries shared by Mint.

Retention tool

IPO-bound OYO Rooms is seeking candidates to join its leadership programme in Gurugram and can offer a salary of around ₹11.5 lakh. Similarly, Meesho, too, has multiple openings with a likely compensation range of ₹37.25-60 lakh, ahead of its IPO. “A majority of our hires are technology folks.
