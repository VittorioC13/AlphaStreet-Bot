European Energy has agreed to sell a 50% stake in its Saldus project in Latvia to Sampension, a Danish pension fund.

The Saldus project integrates a 65MW solar photovoltaic (PV) facility with a 46MW battery energy storage system (BESS).

Construction of the project commenced in July 2025 and is anticipated to be completed by May 2026.

Upon completion, the project will supply renewable electricity to the Latvian grid and offer enhanced power system flexibility through the integrated battery storage.

European Energy deputy CEO Jens-Peter Zink said: “This divestment is a clear example of our ability to take large-scale renewable energy projects from development through construction and into the hands of long-term institutional investors.

“The capital recycled from projects like Saldus enables us to expand our pipeline of wind, solar, and hybrid projects across Europe.”

[TITLE]Crude Oil Falls Back After Thursday's Rally on US and EU Sanctions on Russian Energy:
[TEXT]
December WTI crude oil (CLZ25) on Friday closed down -0.29 (-0.47%), and December RBOB gasoline (RBZ25) closed down -0.0043 (-0.23%).

Crude oil and gasoline prices on Friday ran into some pre-weekend long liquidation pressure after the sharp gains seen on Wednesday and Thursday. Crude oil prices rallied after the US and EU ramped up sanctions on Russian energy and energy infrastructure, raising the prospect of major disruptions to Russian crude production and exports and potentially removing oil supplies from the global market.

The Trump administration late Wednesday announced sanctions on Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC, Russia's biggest oil producers, due to "Russia's lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine." The new sanctions could bar foreign countries or companies from conducting business with the oil companies and cut them off from much of the international financial system.

Also, the EU adopted a new package of sanctions targeting Russia's energy infrastructure and sanctioned 117 additional shadow-fleet vessels and 45 entities that have helped Russia evade sanctions, including 12 companies in China and Hong Kong. The EU also adopted a transaction ban on Rosneft and Gazprom Neft.

Crude also had carryover support from Tuesday, when the Trump administration announced plans to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by 1 million bbl in December and January.

[TITLE]Renewable energy surpasses coal for first time in 6 months: International Solar Alliance DG Ashish Khanna:
[TEXT]
For the first time, in the initial six months of this calendar year, the total energy generated from renewable energy was higher than that from coal according to International Solar Alliance (ISA) Director General Ashish Khanna.

Khanna said this in his address to the 8th session of the ISA Assembly at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi on Tuesday. Highlighting the rapid global growth of solar energy, Khanna said, "It took 25 years for the world to reach 1000 gigawatt of solar capacity, yet in just two years, the next 1000 gigawatt has been reached." He added that projections indicate this capacity could double again within the next four years, "reaching 4600 gigawatt globally."

The ISA Director General said that around 71 per cent of new solar installations are taking place in the Asia Pacific region, while Latin America is emerging as the next major growth hub. He also emphasized Africa's untapped potential, calling it "the continent with the best solar radiation yet to be fully tapped."

Khanna noted that the ISA is working to attract greater private-sector investment through initiatives such as the Global Solar Facility, which will begin operations in Africa before expanding to the Asia Pacific. He added that ISA is also focusing on capacity building to help countries develop local solutions and reduce investment risks.

"We are setting up a new technology roadmap and policy to guide member countries on how solar and new technologies can be most useful," he said.

Announcing a major initiative, Khanna said the Africa Solar Facility will be launched next year. He also revealed plans for a new programme on regional interconnection, aimed at reducing dependence on battery storage.

hanna further outlined ISA's focus areas, including the management of waste and recycling materials as part of a critical mineral strategy. "We will discuss harmonizing of standards using India's experience and IEC of how we can all work towards shared standards for all 125 countries," he added

.He also announced plans to establish an ISA Academy and Global Capability Centre to bring digital learning solutions to all 125 member countries. "Wherever you are, in whatever strata of income, you will have access to all the information on what solar can do for your countries," he said.

Khanna said the ISA will also launch several flagship reports, including those on global solar trends, solar compass, ease of doing solar, and floating solar.

[TITLE]Too Much of a Good Thing: Solar Overloads Europe’s Electricity System:
[TEXT]
When the official report on the Spain and Portugal blackout from April came out, it described a grid made vulnerable to excess voltage as a result of the fast growth of weather-dependent generators. But this excess voltage problem is not just reserved for the Iberian Peninsula. The whole of Europe has become vulnerable.

Last year, a total of 65.5 GW of solar generation capacity was installed across the European Union. It was a record high, and the fourth record-high year of installations in a row, as reported by the EU’s solar power industry association. However, the annual growth rate in additions was markedly lower than in previous years, at just 4.4%, Solar Power Europe noted. Since the start of this year, things have only got worse, with total new installations expected to be a decline on 2024 rather than an increase. It would be the first decline in ten years.

Solar is one of the pillars on which the European Union’s transition plans are built. Solar, along with wind, is instrumental for what Brussels strategists call a decarbonisation of the European grid. However, there have been unforeseen circumstances that have interfered with these plans and are going to interfere with them increasingly frequently because of the nature of solar, affecting growth plans.

Related: U.S. Nuclear Output Forecast to Surge 27% After 2035

One obvious problem that was not anticipated is negative prices. The phenomenon, sometimes called a cannibalization effect, refers to periods of excessive generation from wind and/or solar that plunges electricity prices on the wholesale market below zero because supply exceeds demand by a very wide margin.

In Europe, the problem has become especially pronounced in the past couple of years, thanks to all those record solar capacity additions—and it has started affecting investment decisions for further capacity because negative prices affect the profitability of existing installations. Some governments have considered support for solar operators forced to switch off their installations when there is excess generation, but not all.

Switching off a solar installation is what grid operators order whenever generation threatens to become excessive. This is also problematic for solar operators, because when their installations do not generate electricity, the operators do not make money. Sure, they can be paid to not generate, like wind turbine operators in the UK, but that does not necessarily guarantee profits—government handouts never do.

Finally, there is the voltage surge problem that caused the Spain and Portugal blackout, and that Bloomberg this week reported is getting more serious across Europe. The solution proposed: change the grid.

The argument that Europe’s grid is not fit for a decarbonized energy system has been put forward repeatedly by transition advocates who claim we need a more flexible electricity supply and distribution network that would reduce—and maybe even eliminate—the waste of electricity generated by wind and solar installations during periods of low demand. Flexibility, including on the demand side, is being made a top priority. The problem is that solar is not very flexible. When the sun shines, the panels generate, regardless of demand. When the sun stops shining, the panels stop generating, also regardless of demand.

According to one Dutch grid expert who Bloomberg interviewed, the problem is one of scale. There are simply way too many solar installations to control all at the same time and make sure the grid does not get overloaded on sunny days. “The speed of the change is extreme,” Jan Vorrink, who was in charge of the control room of the Netherland’s grid, told Bloomberg. “The strong increase in solar is pushing the boundaries of the system.”

Obviously, the simplest solution would be to put caps on solar capacity additions to make the grid more manageable. Yet this is not the preferred solution in Europe. The preferred solution is to continue building more installations and transform the grid to be better able to incorporate these installations productively.

The transformation would essentially involve building a lot more transmission lines to bring electricity from generators to demand hotspots to reduce curtailment. This would include better interconnectivity between EU member states to tap into cross-border electricity demand. However, this would not do much

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday approved energy company Enbridge’s plans to encase a segment of an aging oil pipeline that runs beneath a Great Lakes channel, pushing past its own findings that construction could ruin the environmentally sensitive area.

The corps initially planned to issue a permitting decision early next year. The agency fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

“The approval of the Enbridge Line 5 reroute application is a great success and will advance the President’s energy dominance agenda for America," Adam Telle, assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, said in a statement.

The corps released an environmental analysis in May that concluded tunnel construction would protect the pipeline but the work could destroy wetlands and archeological sites, harm bat habitats, disturb aquatic life, mar lake vistas and potentially trigger an underwater explosion.

The corps still issued Enbridge a permit, saying Wednesday that the application complied with all applicable federal laws and regulations.

Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Enbridge now needs only a permit from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to begin the $500 million-plus project. Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the application.

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, a channel linking Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.

New Delhi: HMEL - steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal 's refinery joint venture in India with state-run Hindustan Petroleum - said on Wednesday it has suspended purchases of Russian oil following newly announced Western curbs.The company added that it cannot verify the FT report alleging the use of sanctioned ships in past deliveries because it buys crude on a delivered-at-port basis.The purchase suspension follows "new restrictions on imports of crude oil from Russia by the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, pending receipt of any outstanding orders," the company said.HMEL operates an 11-million-tonne-per-annum refinery at Bathinda in Punjab and is owned 49% each by the Mittal Group and HPCL, with the remainder held by financial institutions.The FT reported that HMEL received at least four crude cargoes worth nearly $280 million, transported mostly from Russia on U.S.-blacklisted vessels between July and September. The final leg into India was completed by the Samadha, a tanker not on the U.S. sanctions list, though blacklisted by the EU. The report said the ships attempted to conceal their movements by switching off transponders or transmitting false coordinates.HMEL said all transactions are subject to due diligence, including counterparty KYC, sanctions screening and vessel history checks.HMEL accepts Russian cargoes on a delivered-at-port basis, it said. "That means the company will not be aware of the details of other ships that crude may have been transported on, nor any attempts by those ships to conceal their position to pick up crude from sanctioned vessels."HMEL said Samadha, the ship named in the FT report which delivered the crude to the Indian port was not under US sanctions at the time of delivery.Last week, the U.S. sanctioned Russia's top producers Rosneft and Lukoil, prompting a rethink among Indian refiners that had been buying significant volumes from Russia. Top refiners Indian Oil and Reliance Industries have already said they will comply with all international sanctions.

We recorded net loss attributable to Methanex shareholders of $7 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to net income of $64 million in the second quarter of 2025. Net income in the third quarter of 2025 was lower compared to the prior quarter primarily due to a lower average realized price, the mark-to-market impact of share based compensation, lower New Zealand gas sale net proceeds, higher depreciation and higher finance costs, partially offset by higher sales of produced product.

We sold 2,476,000 tonnes of methanol in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 2,133,000 tonnes of methanol in the second quarter of 2025. Sales of Methanex-produced methanol were 1,891,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 1,528,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2025.

Production of methanol for the third quarter of 2025 was 2,212,000 tonnes compared to 1,621,000 tonnes for the second quarter of 2025. Production was higher in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the second quarter of 2025 due to new production contribution from Beaumont and Natgasoline, following the close of our acquisition of OCI Global's international methanol business ("OCI Acquisition"). This was combined with higher production from Geismar, Medicine Hat, and New Zealand. Higher production from the third quarter is expected to result in higher sales of produced product in the fourth quarter of 2025.

In the third quarter of 2025 we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.185 per common share for a total of $14.3 million and repaid $125 million of the outstanding Term Loan A.

At September 30, 2025, we had a strong liquidity position including a cash balance of $413 million. We also have access to a $600 million revolving credit facility.

2 The annual operating capacity of the Beaumont and Natgasoline facilities are 910,000 tonnes and 850,000 tonnes (50% interest), respectively. The actual production for Q2 2025 reflects 4 days of ownership. 3 The operating capacity of Trinidad consists of the Titan facility (100% interest). The Atlas facility (63.1% interest) is excluded as it is currently idle. Refer to the Trinidad section below.

4 The operating capacity of New Zealand consists of one Motunui facility, with the other excluded as it is currently idle. Refer to the New Zealand section below.

5 The annual operating capacity of Beaumont ammonia facility is 340,000 tonnes. The actual production for Q2 2025 reflects 4 days of ownership.

Key production and operational highlights during the third quarter include:

United States

Geismar produced 931,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 829,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2025. Production was higher in the third quarter as all Geismar plants were running from early July onwards and the second quarter was impacted by an unplanned outage.

Beaumont produced 239,000 tonnes of methanol and 88,000 tonnes of ammonia in the third quarter compared to 11,000 tonnes of methanol and 4,000 tonnes of ammonia in the four days of operation in the second quarter. The Natgasoline plant produced 222,000 tonnes of methanol (Methanex share) in the third quarter compared to 10,000 tonnes of methanol (Methanex share) in the four days of operation in the second quarter. Both plants have been operating safely and at high rates since acquisition.

Chile

Chile produced 224,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 295,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2025. Third quarter production was lower than the second quarter primarily due to the seasonal reduction in gas supply from Argentina during the Southern Hemisphere winter. The Chile I plant operated at full rates for the whole quarter for the first time in more than ten years. Chile IV successfully completed a planned turnaround during the quarter and returned to operations at the start of October with increased gas availability from Argentina, which we believe will allow both plants to operate at full rates through to April 2026. We have gas contracts in place with Chilean and Argentinean gas producers until 2030 and 2027, respectively, which underpin approximately 55% of the site's gas requirements year-round. While seasonality in production is expected to continue, we are seeing generally positive developments in natural gas availability.

Trinidad

In Trinidad, the Titan plant produced 203,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the 216,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2025.

New Zealand

New Zealand produced 123,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 53,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2025. Third quarter production increased compared to the second quarter with Motunui II operating for the full period. The plant restarted in early July after the completion of a short-term commercial agreement to redirect contracted natural gas to the New Zealand electricity market. Future production will be dependent on the performance of existing wells, future upstream development and any on-selling of gas into the electricity market to support New Zealand’s energy needs. Gas supply availability in New Zealand continues to be challenged and we continue to work with our gas suppliers and the government to sustain our operations in the country.

Egypt

Egypt produced 260,000 tonnes (Methanex interest - 130,000 tonnes) in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 248,000 tonnes (Methanex interest - 124,000 tonnes) in the second quarter of 2025. Gas availability in Egypt is influenced by several factors, including domestic production levels, gas imports and seasonal demand fluctuations. We are monitoring the gas market closely and may experience some curtailments, particularly in the summer months, depending on gas supply and demand dynamics. The plant returned to full rates at the start of September.

Canada

Medicine Hat produced 140,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 83,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2025. After completing a planned turnaround in the second quarter, the Medicine Hat facility has been operating at full rates.

Outlook

We expect our 2025 production, inclusive of our newly acquired assets, to be approximately 8.0 million tonnes (Methanex interest), of which 7.8 million tonnes are methanol and 0.2 million tonnes are ammonia. Actual production may vary by quarter based on gas availability, turnarounds, unplanned outages and unanticipated events.

In the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect meaningfully higher Adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter, with higher produced sales combined with a slightly lower average realized price. Based on our October and November posted prices we expect that our average realized price range will be approximately $335 to $345 per tonne for these two months.

Selected Financial and Other Data

As of and for the Three Months Ended ($ in thousands, except per share amounts) 9/30/2025 6/30/2025 9/30/2024 Amount of loans originated $ 1,789,736 $ 1,483,179 $ 1,448,251 Net income $ 4,891 $ 4,097 $ 3,454 Diluted EPS(1) $ 0.34 $ 0.29 $ 0.25 Return on average assets 2.2 % 2.0 % 2.1 % Return on average equity 10.6 % 9.2 % 8.3 % Yield on loans 13.09 % 11.70 % 14.16 % Cost of interest-bearing deposits 4.06 % 4.07 % 4.85 % Net interest margin 9.01 % 7.81 % 9.70 % Efficiency ratio(2) 47.6 % 59.5 % 67.5 % Tangible book value per share(3) $ 13.84 $ 13.51 $ 12.90 Tangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets(3) 20.9 % 21.6 % 24.9 % Leverage ratio (Bank under CBLR) 17.2 % 18.0 % 20.3 % Full-time equivalent employees 194 200 194

(1) FinWise uses the two-class method to calculate basic and diluted EPS as the restricted stock awards are deemed to be participating securities.

(2) Efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. The efficiency ratio is defined as total non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income. The Company believes this measure is important as an indicator of productivity because it shows the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of this measure to its most comparable GAAP measure.

(3) Tangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible shareholders’ equity is defined as total shareholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is total shareholder’s equity to total assets. The Company had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the end of any period indicated. The Company has not considered loan servicing rights or loan trailing fee assets as intangible assets for purposes of this calculation. As a result, tangible shareholders’ equity is the same as total shareholders’ equity at the end of each of the periods indicated.

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

Net interest income was $18.6 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $14.7 million for the prior quarter and $14.8 million for the prior year period. The increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in the Bank’s credit enhanced balances in the held-for-investment portfolio of $29.6 million, the higher contractual interest on the credit enhanced balances, and increased average balances in the Strategic Program loans held-for-sale portfolio of $12.9 million, and was offset in part by increased average balances in brokered certificates of deposit accounts. The increase from the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in the Bank’s credit enhanced balances in the held-for-investment portfolio of $40.7 million and increased average balances in the Strategic Program loans held-for-sale portfolio of $62.2 million and was offset in part by growth in the brokered CD portfolio used to fund the loan portfolio growth.

Loan originations totaled $1.8 billion for the third quarter of 2025, an increase from the $1.5 billion recorded in the prior quarter and the $1.4 billion recorded in the prior year period mostly reflecting the expansion of originations from newly onboarded strategic programs, the continued increase in originations by certain established strategic programs, and two strategic programs originating higher volumes of student loans during the quarter.

Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2025 was 9.01%, compared to 7.81% for the prior quarter and 9.70% for the prior year period. The increase in net interest margin from the prior quarter was mainly attributable to growth in the credit enhanced portfolio of $29.6 million offset in part by accrued interest reversals on loans migrating to nonaccrual status during the prior quarter. The decrease in net interest margin from the prior year period was mostly attributable to the Company’s strategy to reduce the average credit risk in the loan portfolio by increasing its investment in higher quality but lower yielding loans which was offset by the growth in the credit enhanced portfolio of $40.7 million.

Provision for Credit Losses

The Company’s provision for credit losses was $12.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $4.7 million for the prior quarter and $2.2 million for the prior year period. The increase in the provision for credit losses from the prior quarter and the prior year period resulted primarily from growth of the credit enhanced loan portfolio as well as higher net charge-offs.

Non-interest Income

Three Months Ended ($ in thousands) 9/30/2025 6/30/2025 9/30/2024 Non-interest income Strategic Program fees $ 6,180 $ 5,404 $ 4,862 Gain on sale of loans 1,854 1,483 393 SBA loan servicing fees, net (242 ) (96 ) 87 Change in fair value on investment in BFG 200 300 (100 ) Credit enhancement income 8,762 2,275 47 Other miscellaneous income 1,298 971 765 Total non-interest income $ 18,052 $ 10,337 $ 6,054

The increase in non-interest income from the prior quarter was primarily due to increases in credit enhancement income, Strategic Program fees, gain on sale of loans, and other miscellaneous income. Credit enhancement income mirrors the provision for credit losses on credit enhanced loans and increased principally due to the higher credit enhanced loan balances outstanding at September 30, 2025. The higher Strategic Program fees resulted from increased originations. The gain on sale of loans increased as FinWise increased its sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loan balances to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Other miscellaneous income increased primarily from an increase in dividends received from BFG as well as an increase in operating lease rental income. Offsetting these non-interest income increases in part was a decrease in SBA loan servicing fees due to an increase in the provision for SBA servicing losses due to a change in assumptions used in valuing the SBA servicing asset.

The increase in non-interest income compared to the prior year period was primarily due to higher credit enhanced loan balances, which generated higher credit enhancement income. Additionally, the increased sales of the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans led to an increase in gains on loan sales, while higher originations resulted in increased Strategic Program fees. Other miscellaneous income also increased, largely because of an increase in dividends received from BFG as well as an increase in operating lease rental income. The decrease in SBA loan servicing fees, net was primarily due to a change in assumptions used in valuing the SBA servicing asset.

Non-interest Expense

Three Months Ended

($ in thousands) 9/30/2025

6/30/2025

9/30/2024

Non-interest expense Salaries and employee benefits $ 10,814 $ 10,491 $ 9,659 Professional services 876 949 1,331 Occupancy and equipment expenses 456 445 544 Credit enhancement guarantee expense 1,720 78 3 Other operating expenses 3,583 2,949 2,512 Total non-interest expense $ 17,449 $ 14,912 $ 14,049

The increase in non-interest expense from the prior quarter resulted primarily from increases in credit enhancement guarantee expense largely related to growth in credit enhanced loans. Additionally, other operating expenses increased due to greater servicing costs linked to the balance sheet programs, along with elevated FDIC assessments reflecting our increased deposit balances, data processing services and expenditures on computer software.

The increase in non-interest expense from the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in credit enhancement guarantee expense related to growth in credit enhanced loans, salaries and employee benefits mainly from the amortization of deferred compensation awards incurred to retain and motivate our employees, and increases in other operating expenses due to greater servicing costs linked to the balance sheet programs, operating lease depreciation, elevated FDIC assessments reflecting our increased deposit balances, data processing services and expenditures on computer software.

FinWise’s efficiency ratio was 47.6% for the third quarter, compared to 59.5% for the prior quarter and 67.5% for the prior year period. This reduction in the efficiency ratio was primarily from the increase in credit enhanced income previously mentioned. Looking ahead, it is anticipated that the efficiency ratio is likely to reduce further as revenues are realized in future periods from interest earned on credit enhanced loan balances, along with the contributions from BIN sponsorship offerings and payments initiatives developed throughout 2024 and 2023.

Tax Rate

The Company’s effective tax rate was 23.7% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 24.5% for the prior quarter and 25.1% for the prior year period. The decrease from the prior quarter and prior year period was principally due to the increase in deferred tax assets related to restricted stock, increased allowances for credit losses, and accrued bonuses. However, these benefits were partially offset by greater deferred tax liabilities associated with other reserves and qualified tax leases as well as an increase in permanent differences, particularly due to non-deductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Net Income

Net income was $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $4.1 million for the prior quarter and $3.5 million for the prior year period. The changes in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior quarter and prior year period are generally the result of the factors discussed in the foregoing sections.

Balance Sheet

The Company’s total assets were $899.9 million as of September 30, 2025, an increase from $842.5 million as of June 30, 2025 and $683.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The increase in total assets from June 30, 2025 was primarily due to continued growth in the Company’s net loans held-for-investment of $27.0 million, interest- bearing cash deposits of $14.6 million, loans held-for-sale portfolios of $9.4 million, and an increase in the credit enhancement asset of $8.7 million. The increase in total assets compared to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in the Company’s net loans held-for-investment of $115.5 million, loans held-for-sale portfolio of $72.7 million, an increase in interest-bearing cash deposits of $17.2 million, and an increase in the credit enhancement asset of $11.1 million. The increased loan balances are generally consistent with our strategy to grow the loan portfolio with higher quality lower risk assets.

The following table provides the composition and gross balances of loans held-for-investment (“HFI”) as of the dates indicated:

Note: SBA loans as of September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024 include $132.2 million, $144.3 million and $154.5 million, respectively, of SBA 7(a) loan balances that are guaranteed by the SBA. The HFI balance on Strategic Program loans without credit enhancement with annual interest rates below 36% as of September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024 was $3.9 million, $2.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively.

Total gross loans HFI as of September 30, 2025 increased $37.8 million and $133.8 million compared to June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company experienced growth primarily in its commercial real estate loans for owner occupied properties and commercial leases consistent with its strategy to expand its loan portfolio with loans that offer higher quality and lower interest rates. The credit enhanced portfolio of the Strategic Program loans increased $29.6 million in the quarter to $41.4 million consistent with the Company’s strategy to increase the outstanding balance of lower credit risk loans.

The following table presents the Company’s deposit composition as of the dates indicated:

As of ​ 9/30/2025 6/30/2025 9/30/2024 ($ in thousands) Amount Percent

Amount

Percent

Amount

Percent

Noninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 130,601 19.2 % $ 120,747 19.0 % $ 142,785 29.2 % Interest-bearing deposits: Demand 89,443 13.1 % 67,890 10.7 % 58,984 12.1 % Savings 11,495 1.7 % 11,623 1.8 % 9,592 1.9 % Money market 22,634 3.3 % 21,083 3.3 % 15,027 3.1 % Time certificates of deposit 428,137 62.7 % 413,831 65.2 % 262,271 53.7 % Total period end deposits $ 682,310 100.0 % $ 635,174 100.0 % $ 488,659 100.0 %

The increase in total deposits as of September 30, 2025 from June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by growth in brokered time certificates of deposits, which were added to fund loan growth and enhance the liquidity of the balance sheet. The increase in total deposits from September 30, 2024 was also driven by a higher volume of interest-bearing demand deposits, which resulted largely from new and ongoing customer relationships, partially offset by reductions in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, as customers moved funds into interest-bearing products offering higher yields.

Total shareholders’ equity as of September 30, 2025 increased $5.8 million to $187.8 million from $182.0 million at June 30, 2025. Compared to September 30, 2024, total shareholders’ equity increased by $17.4 million from $170.4 million. The increases from June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024 were primarily due to net income generated throughout the respective periods.

Bank Regulatory Capital Ratios

The following table presents the leverage ratios for the Bank as of the dates indicated as determined under the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation:

As of

Capital Ratios 9/30/2025

6/30/2025

9/30/2024

Well-Capitalized Requirement

Leverage ratio 17.2 % 18.0 % 20.3 % 9.0 %

The decrease in the leverage ratio from the prior quarter and prior year period resulted primarily from the growth in the loan portfolio exceeding the relative growth in capital from earnings. The Bank’s capital levels as of September 30, 2025 remain sufficiently above the regulatory well-capitalized guidelines as of September 30, 2025.

Share Repurchase Program

Since the share repurchase program’s inception in March 2024, the Company has repurchased and subsequently retired a total of 44,608 shares for $0.5 million. There were no shares repurchased during the third quarter of 2025.

Asset Quality

The recorded balances of nonperforming loans were $42.8 million, or 7.5% of total loans held-for-investment, as of September 30, 2025, compared to $39.7 million, or 7.5% of total loans held-for-investment, as of June 30, 2025 and $30.6 million, or 7.1% of total loans held-for-investment, as of September 30, 2024. The balances of nonperforming loans guaranteed by the SBA were $23.3 million, $21.2 million, and $17.8 million as of September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in nonperforming loans from the prior quarter and prior year period was primarily attributable to an increase in the SBA 7(a) loan portfolio being classified as nonaccrual mainly due to the negative impact of sustained elevated interest rates on the Company’s small business borrowers. The Company’s allowance for credit losses to total loans held-for-investment was 4.5% as of September 30, 2025 compared to 3.1% as of June 30, 2025 and 2.9% as of September 30, 2024. The increase in the ratio from the prior quarter and prior year period was primarily due to the provision for credit losses related to the growth of the credit enhanced loan balances.

The Company’s net charge-offs were $3.1 million, $2.8 million and $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025, and September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to an higher charge-offs associated with strategic program loans, while the increase from the prior year period was primarily due to charge-offs on certain held-for-investment balances that were reclassified to nonaccrual status as well as an increase in the charge-offs for strategic program loans.

The following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses and credit quality data for the periods indicated:

Brazil may emerge as a leader in sustainable crypto mining.

Brazilian solar energy firm Thopen is considering a bold new move to address one of the country’s most pressing renewable energy challenges of excess electricity generation.

The company plans to explore Bitcoin mining as a way to convert surplus solar energy into a profitable and sustainable business model.

Turning surplus energy into digital gold

Brazil’s rapid expansion of solar and wind power has brought both opportunities and challenges.

While the country now generates abundant clean energy, transmission bottlenecks and limited local demand have resulted in an oversupply in several regions.

This surplus often leads to energy curtailment, where producers are forced to reduce output, causing financial losses.

Thopen’s CEO, Gustavo Ribeiro, has acknowledged this growing concern and revealed that the company is studying ways to transform the problem into an advantage.

During an interview with BN Americas, Ribeiro explained that Thopen is considering setting up Bitcoin mining operations and data centers near its energy generation sites.

The goal, Ribeiro said, is to “convert energy into capital” — a strategy that could help absorb excess electricity, stabilize local supply, and ensure that renewable power is not wasted.

A breakthrough for Brazil’s renewable energy sector

The proposal comes at a time when Brazil’s renewable energy industry is facing limits on the amount of solar power it can feed into the grid.

By channeling surplus electricity into Bitcoin mining, Thopen aims to reduce curtailment losses and create a steady revenue stream.

Analysts note that this integration of renewable energy and digital mining could offer a flexible, scalable solution for the nation’s energy sector.

Similar models are emerging across the globe.

In the United Kingdom, Union Jack Oil has begun converting excess natural gas into electricity to power Bitcoin mining operations.

In Canada, AgriFORCE Growing Systems announced plans to use stranded gas to run mining rigs.

Thopen’s venture could position Brazil as the next country to merge clean energy with crypto mining on a large scale, showcasing an innovative way to monetize renewable resources.

Sustainable Bitcoin mining and grid stability

One of the most promising aspects of Thopen’s strategy is its potential to improve both environmental and economic outcomes.

Using surplus renewable power for Bitcoin mining eliminates the need for fossil fuel-based energy, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of the process.

It also provides solar farms with a new income source, turning what would otherwise be wasted electricity into a productive asset.

Experts say this model can also enhance grid stability.

When power generation exceeds demand, mining operations can consume the surplus, balancing the system and preventing instability.

During low-output periods, operations can scale down, allowing electricity to flow back to the grid when it is needed most.

This flexibility makes Bitcoin mining an ideal companion to variable renewable sources like solar and wind.

The challenges and opportunities ahead

Despite its potential, Thopen’s plan is not without obstacles.

Brazil’s regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and energy integration remains under development.

Companies venturing into this space must navigate evolving policies, infrastructure demands, and the volatility of the crypto market.

However, industry observers believe that the benefits far outweigh the risks.

Ribeiro’s vision aligns with Brazil’s broader renewable energy goals — promoting efficiency, innovation, and sustainable economic growth.

If successful, Thopen’s approach could reshape how nations handle renewable energy surpluses, offering a model that is both profitable and environmentally sound.

[TITLE]£55 billion R&D funding boost to unlock UK breakthroughs from health to clean energy:
[TEXT]
Funding boost for science and tech breakthroughs that improve lives, create jobs and grow our economy

£55 billion long-term backing for the UK’s research agencies and bodies is a real-terms rise, with DSIT making its largest-ever investment in R&D

making its largest-ever investment in Every £1 spent by government on R&D delivers £8 of wider economic benefit – from the invention of new cancer treatments, to new ways of harnessing renewable energy – delivering national renewal

From the tech that screens airport luggage to keep us safe, to life-changing new medical treatments, the inventors and innovators behind Great British breakthroughs that drive growth and improve our daily lives are in line for a £55 billion funding boost to take their work to the next level.

The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology has today (Thursday 30 October) confirmed long-term R&D funding for the UK’s research agencies and bodies, with bumper investment for the bodies that are making science and tech breakthroughs that improve lives and grow our economy. These allocations give visibility and clarity on the development of DSIT ’s plans for R&D budgets, with the Department’s overall R&D budget growing in real terms.

New analysis published today shows the value of public investment in R&D to the UK – with every £1 spent delivering £8 in net economic benefits over the long-term. Crowding in private investment is a key part of this, with every £1 of public money invested in R&D crowding in a further £2 in private investment, on average.

The Science and Tech Secretary announced today’s allocations while visiting IBM’s London base, to see first-hand how private investment is supporting the strength of the UK’s public offer on R&D , boosting work from quantum to robotics. Publicly-funded UK research has already resulted in some of the most important breakthroughs of recent years, including the first cutting-edge antibody products which have transformed some cancers from a guaranteed death sentence to manageable chronic conditions.

IBM is also working in partnership with publicly-funded researchers through UKRI ’s £210 million Hartree Centre, to bring AI , quantum computing and supercomputing to bear to discover new medicines, and breakthroughs in clean energy. While the company is also one of several technology vendors providing access to cutting edge quantum computing resource via the National Quantum Computing Centre - which will benefit from a first-of-its-kind 10-year government funding commitment.

By investing in R&D now, the government is putting a down-payment on Britain’s future that will deliver dividends for decades to come and put money in people’s pockets – delivering on our Plan for Change. We know businesses grow faster because of public R&D . In the 6 years after receiving their first R&D grant funding, employment increases in the average business by 21% and turnover grows by 23% relative to similar firms who didn’t get support. Some of the UK’s most innovative businesses have had public R&D funding help springboard them to success.

Oxford Nanopore, who are developing the world’s first pandemic early warning system, and Cobalt Light Systems, who make the tech that’s used to screen liquids at airports, have both benefitted from UKRI funding in previous years. Today, Oxford Nanopore is a FTSE 250-listed company, while Cobalt Light Systems’ equipment is used in over 70 airports worldwide.

Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said:

Backing our best and brightest researchers and innovators is essential. They are making the impossible, possible, from health to clean energy and beyond. Their ideas will create tomorrow’s industries, boosting growth and transforming public services now and in the future. By investing in their work, we are backing the long-term success of the UK, by paving the way for breakthroughs that will help us all to live and work better.

Publicly-funded research makes a difference to everyone’s health, wealth and wellbeing, with examples from the last year including:

£129 million in government support for BioNTech, who are setting up UK R&D centres to advance innovative cancer medicines and in turn unlocking £1 private billion investment over 10 years

centres to advance innovative cancer medicines and in turn unlocking £1 private billion investment over 10 years £80 million for 100 nationwide research projects ranging from better prosthetics, to better tests for blood clots

£44 million to put technologies like AI and engineering biology to work, to make manufacturing cleaner, less wasteful, and less reliant on fossil fuels

and engineering biology to work, to make manufacturing cleaner, less wasteful, and less reliant on fossil fuels £32 million for novel medical scanners which are up to 40 times more sensitive and up to 10 times faster than existing machines, to help diagnose cancer and heart conditions

£19.6 million for developing cutting-edge materials for the next generation of computers and medical scanners

Over £22 million for work to make usable quantum computers a reality, which can discover new medicines and treatments in a fraction of the time and cost it takes today

R&D is also at the heart of around 3 million jobs in the UK, with the power to create many more as discoveries advance.

British quantum firm Oxford Quantum Circuits, meanwhile - founded off the back of public-funded research - has gone on to raise $100 million Series B and deploy the first ever quantum computer in New York City.

The R&D funding being confirmed today, covering the Spending Review period ending 2029/2030, includes:

UKRI , the UK’s national funding agency for science and research, will deliver more than £38 billion across the period, including nearly £10 billion in 2029/2030 alone

, the UK’s national funding agency for science and research, will deliver more than £38 billion across the period, including nearly £10 billion in 2029/2030 alone The budget for ARIA – the UK’s agency backing bold, long-term breakthroughs – to rise from £220 million a year to £400 million a year by 2029/2030. One area that ARIA is supporting, is how robots could potentially help meet the growing need for adult social care

[TITLE]Public comment opens for renewable energy megaproject on Eastern Shore:
[TEXT]
A group that wants to build an industrial plant on the Eastern Shore to produce fuels out of hydrogen and biomass has filed for environmental assessment with the province, kicking off a 40-day period when the public can have their say.

The application details Phase 1 of the project, which includes the construction and operation of a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, N.S.

It says production would require 60 truckloads of biomass per day and 586 cubic metres of fresh water per hour. Biomass is organic matter — for example, wood — that is used to generate energy.

According to the application, the biomass would be sourced locally following the European Union’s sustainability requirements, and the fresh water would come from two nearby lakes, Meadow Lake and Ocean Lake, through pipelines.

If the province grants environmental approval, construction could begin in 2028 and operations in 2031, the application says. The proponent expects the project to have a minimum 50-year lifespan, followed by decommissioning.

The site is on the coast in the community of Goldboro, N.S., on land that was previously owned by Pieridae Energy. That firm had proposed building a liquefied natural gas terminal, but after abandoning that plan it sold the land and all its permits and approvals to the new proponents.

The project was first imagined by Irish firm Simply Blue Group but was bought earlier this year by European energy giant Octopus Energy Generation. Octopus created a local entity, Nova Sustainable Fuels, to manage the project.

In its application to the province, Nova Sustainable Fuels says it wants to use water, biomass and electricity from wind turbines to generate hydrogen gas. The gas would then be converted into methanol and sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, a lower-emission alternative to conventional jet fuel.

The liquid fuels would then be shipped by boat to distributors and airlines.

Phase 2 of the project would include a wind farm and transmission line to feed electricity directly to the plant, but that is not included in the current environmental assessment.

The application for Phase 1 says the project will require an initial capital investment of $4 billion to $6 billion. Construction is expected to create 1,000 jobs and operations are expected to require 60 to 80 staff.

Public comments are open online or by mail until Dec. 8.

[TITLE]India Mulls Rs 1.2 Lakh Crore Bailout For State Power Discoms, Eyes Privatisation: Report:
[TEXT]
India is considering a bailout of Rs 1.2 lakh crore for financially stressed state-run power distribution companies, news agency Reuters reported, citing government officials and a power ministry document.

To qualify for the funding, states will need to privatise their electricity distribution utilities and hand over managerial control, or alternatively retain control but list the companies on a stock exchange, according to the report.

The planned move, as claimed in the report, represents the government's most aggressive reform attempt yet to fix the loss-making state power distributors — long seen as the weakest link in the country's energy ecosystem.

The power and finance Ministries are reportedly working out the final details, with an announcement expected in the Union Budget in February. Under the plan, states must ensure that at least 20% of their total power consumption is handled by private companies and must absorb part of the power retailer's debt, the report said.

One option requires states to create a new distribution company and divest 51% equity in return for a 50-year, interest-free loan to clear debt and access to five years of low-interest federal loans, the news agency said. A second approach allows states to privatise up to 26% equity of an existing distribution company in exchange for five years of low-interest federal financing. States that do not privatise will have to list their utilities within three years to be eligible for low-interest loans, it added.

State power retailers currently have accumulated losses of Rs 7.08 lakh crore and outstanding debt of Rs 7.42 lakh crore as of March 2024, despite multiple bailouts over the past 20 years, according to the report.

At present, only a few regions in the country, including Delhi, Maharashtra and Gujarat, have privatised distribution zones. The government also plans to amend laws in the next Parliament session to allow private firms to use state-owned power networks, as per the report.
