By Air Marshal Anil Chopra (Retired), an Indian Air Force veteran fighter test pilot and is the former Director-General of the Center for Air Power Studies in New Delhi.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to visit India on December 5 for a bilateral summit. The visit is significant as it will reaffirm and strengthen the “special and privileged strategic partnership” amid challenging global geopolitics and increasing Western pressure on India. This is the 23rd annual summit, and will be Putin’s first to India since the Ukraine conflict began in February 2022, underscoring its importance.

Amid US President Donald Trump’s aggressive policies and rhetoric, India has maintained its composure and handled tariff negotiations with great maturity and with a ‘little give and more take’ approach. Despite the threat of sanctions on Indian entities, the Modi government has reaffirmed and strengthened its longstanding strategic ties with Russia. India’s patient approach has paid dividends. Trump had to partially backtrack on pharmaceuticals and H-1B visas, among other points, reinforcing India’s resolve to pursue strategic autonomy and potentially strengthen its alignment with Russia.

As India prepares to host Putin, defense cooperation has moved to the center of an increasingly intense diplomatic week. The visit is expected to see major announcements across the defense sector. The diplomatic groundwork has already been underway between Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In New Delhi, Nikolai Patrushev, one of Putin’s closest advisers, met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to coordinate positions ahead of the summit, while Jaishankar called on Putin in Moscow.

Expectations regarding Putin’s visit are high. Beyond Su-57 collaboration, pending S-400 deliveries and additional contracts, discussions on possible S-500 cooperation, expansion of joint production of Su-30MKI aircraft and T-90 tanks, and upgrades to the BrahMos missile program will be discussed. It could mean the beginning of a new era of co-development rather than a traditional buyer-seller arrangement.

Indo-Russian relations stand firm

In the last four years, India has withstood American pressure to distance itself from Russia. Indo-Russian friendship stands on firm footing. The general perception that India is inching towards the Western fold is not backed by the reality on the ground; India clearly believes in strategic autonomy. It has remained officially neutral on the Ukraine conflict, but has been visibly inclined towards Russia. Despite the threat of Washington’s Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), India went ahead with the S-400 deal with Russia. Despite Western sanctions and tacit pressure, India stepped up petroleum purchase from Russia and continued rupee-based trade.

Putin has made nine visits to India, three during Modi’s tenure, (2016, 2018, and 2021). This December will be his tenth. Modi has made seven visits to Russia. There is a decades-old annual India-Russia summit format. The friendly chemistry between Putin and Modi has been visible in their body language.

Indo-Soviet cooperation began in the 1950s with steel plants, large infrastructure including dams and nuclear plants, and cooperation in space, but the most enduring has been the defense equipment purchases by India. At the peak, the Indian Armed Forces had nearly 80% defense hardware of Soviet/Russian origin, and the figure still remains at 60%. India did look towards the West for sourcing some high-end military hardware, and also to balance the basket.

In August 1971, as insurance against the potential US or Chinese threat to support Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani war, the Soviet Union signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation with India. This has since become the India-Russia Strategic Partnership. India and Russia also work closely within BRICS, SCO, and RIC, among other forums.

Both want to take the relationship to next level. “The bond between the people of Russia & India is very strong. Our nations have stood by each other through thick and thin,” Modi said during his last visit to Russia.

Military aviation remains the biggest Indo-Russian ‘Bear Hug’ with the most significant hardware transfers.

How the aviation connection began

In the mid-1950s, the Indian Air Force (IAF) received Ilyushin IL-14 turbo-prop medium cargo aircraft. Mi-4 helicopters were inducted in the early 1960s and became part of the military ‘folklore’ after the Meghna River crossing operation in the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war. Around the same time, 10-ton payload class An-12 transport aircraft were inducted. These were used in the 1962 war for airlifting army reinforcements. In the 1971 war, they were also used for heavy bombing.

In 1962, the Soviets agreed to transfer technology to co-produce the MiG-21 aircraft in India, something they had earlier denied to China. Nearly 11,500 MiG-21s were built around the world. India inducted or built more than 1,200. The Soviets helped India set up license production of MiG-21 in early 1960s. Three new divisions of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) were created at Nasik (aircraft), Koraput (engines), and Hyderabad (avionics). These factories later built, overhauled, and upgraded all types of Russian aircraft.

In the mid-1960s, the IAF also inducted swept-wing high-speed Sukhoi SU-7B strike aircraft. The swing-wing MiG 23 aircraft and its air defense variant, the MiG-23MF, joined the IAF in the early 1980s. A more advanced strike variant of the MiG-23, the MiG-27, was inducted in 1986, and these were assembled in India and later upgraded.

The Soviets developed MiG-29s and Su-27s in the 1970s to counter American F-16 and F-15 aircraft. The highly maneuverable MiG-29 with modern airborne radar and a host of advanced air-to-air missiles joined the IAF in the mid-1980s. Upgraded variants of these will continue to fly for at least a decade; 125 MiG-21 Bis (Bison) aircraft were upgraded jointly with Russia starting in the late 1990s. The MiG-21 Bison fleet was retired in September 2025.

Nearly 45% of the IAF’s fighter fleet is currently made up of the Sukhoi SU-30MKI air superiority fighter. Jointly developed with Russia in the early 2000, it is under license production by HAL. Nearly 272 were inducted and these will soon see a major upgrade.

Russia has pitched in two aircraft for India’s 114 aircraft Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) project, which has yet to fully unfold. The MiG-35 was earlier a part of the 126 aircraft Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), and has been evaluated. The Su-35 is the second aircraft.

The transport and rotary wing fleet

Specially made for the IAF, the An-32 medium transport aircraft started inducting in 1984. Of the 125 bought, nearly 100 aircraft are still operating and have been upgraded. The IAF also acquired the 40-ton-plus payload IL-76 multi-purpose four-engine strategic airlifter. The IAF continues to operate the IL-76MD (freighter), IL-78MKI (air refueller), and the A-50 with Israeli Phalcon radar as AWACs. IL-76s along with An-32 are the workhorse of the IAF and logistically sustain the Indian Army in the Northern Himalayas and for inter-theater air transportation.

Mid-sized utility and assault Mi-8s helicopters joined the IAF in the early 1980s. Capable of carrying up to 24 troops, they were also used for VVIP communication duties. Subsequently more advanced versions – Mi-17s, Mi-17-1Vs, and Mi-17V-5s – followed. Significant numbers of Mi-17s are also being acquired by the Home Ministry for the BSF. The IAF also acquired heavy-lift Mi-26 helicopters, three of which are still operating. The first dedicated attack helicopters of the IAF, Mi-25/35s, were acquired in 1983.

Missiles and maritime assets

India also received its first set of missiles from the Soviets. The K-13 was the first-generation air-to-air missile that came with the MiG-21. The R-73, R-27, and R-77 RVVAE were among those that followed. Similarly, the SA-2 (Dvina) was India’s first surface-to-air missile. The SA-3 Pechora and SAM-8 joined the armed forces later. The state-of-the-art, jointly developed Indo-Russian BrahMos cruise missile is already inducted in the Indian Armed Forces in large numbers. The IAF has also inducted the formidable S-400 air defense system. Three units have been delivered and two more systems will be inducted by 2026.

By the early 1980s, the Indian Naval air-arm was dominated by many types of Russian maritime fixed and rotary wing aircraft. These included the Ilyushin IL38, Tupolev Tu-142M, and many Kamov Ka-25, Ka-28, and Ka-31 helicopters. Aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya (the former Russian Admiral Gorshkov) is an important element of the long-standing Russian aviation connection with the Indian Navy. The navy also inducted carrier-capable MiG-29Ks.

Fifth-generation fighter aircraft

In 2007, Russia and India signed a contract between Sukhoi and HAL to jointly develop a derivative of the evolving Su-57. In 2010, both agreed on a preliminary design contract in which each country was to invest $6 billion. The development of the fifth-generation stealth fighter was expected to take 8-10 years. By 2014, there were issues related to performance, cost, and work-share. India eventually left the partnership in 2018. Russia pursued the program, and today has the successful Su-57 Felon, impressing spectators and professionals around the world. Russia’s single-engine and smaller Su-75 Checkmate also looks attractive but is still under development.

At the Dubai Airshow in November, Russia made what officials describe as its most significant military proposal to India in years, one that could potentially reshape the future of Indian air power. Moscow announced an offer of full licensed production of the Su-57 in India, along with unrestricted transfer of technology – a level of access no Western defense partner has ever offered India. Russia is proposing an initial supply of Su-57E fighters produced in Russia, followed by manufacturing in India with increased indigenous content. This goes far beyond assembly from imported kits. Russia is willing to open the entire fifth-generation ecosystem, which includes engines, sensors, stealth materials, avionics, and other classified systems. Russia is also prepared to provide technological learning in areas such as fifth-generation engines, optics, AESA radar, artificial intelligence, low-signature technologies, and advanced air weapons, many of which have been denied by the West. The reported base price of the aircraft is unbelievably as little as $45 million. The Su-57 is being termed as the ‘mother of all offers’, with complete technology transfer and co-production in India.

Russia proposes the SJ-100 airliner

Indian’s HAL has signed a memorandum of understanding with Russia’s UAC for the manufacture of the Sukhoi Superjet 100 (SJ-100) in India. The agreement was signed recently in Moscow, paving the way for the first joint production of civilian aircraft in the history of the two countries, which have cooperated for decades in defense manufacturing. Under the new agreement, HAL will have the right to produce the Sukhoi Superjet for domestic customers in India. Domestic airlines will need to be brought on board to ensure commercial viability. It is hoped – and perhaps expected – that sanctions on Russia and high tariffs on India will gradually ease over time. While international certifications such as US Federal Aviation Administration and EU Aviation Safety Agency approvals may not be critical initially, they will become important for flying on international routes.

Likely focus areas during the Putin visit

During the Russian president’s trip to India, deliveries of the remaining S-400 systems will be discussed, with Putin likely assuring an early delivery. A contract will be signed for additional S-400 missiles that have already been cleared by New Delhi. India will push for five additional S-400 units and the same may be announced. India may also show interest in the S-500 AD system. There may be a statement on further accelerating and expanding the BrahMos missile program. India may also seek R-37M long-range air-to-air missiles to be integrated on the Su-30 MKI.

Discussions on the Make-in-India Russian Su-57 may be the flagship subject on the table. The timing of the offer is significant. IAF head Air Chief Marshal AP Singh has said the Indian Air Force needs to induct 35 to 40 fighter aircraft every year for the next two decades to close squadron gaps. He has linked this requirement to India’s long-term manufacturing goals under Roadmap 2047. While India is progressing with its own AMCA fifth-generation aircraft program, it will take time and an interim option may be needed, and Russia may push for outright purchases of two to four squadrons of the fifth-generation fighter.

Apart from air technology sharing, there are other joint projects that could come up during the visit. One is the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, where only two of the six units are operational, and there have been significant cost and time overruns. Another is Russian support for India’s forthcoming first human space flight, the Gaganyaan Mission. Russia will also push to partner in India’s AIP submarine program and offer to jointly design and develop conventional submarines with advanced technology access, as part of the P-75I project.

Two frigates, the INS Tushil and INS Tamala, were recently built by Russia at the Yantar Shipyard, while the remaining two are being built at the Goa Shipyard Ltd (GSL) in India through technology transfer. Russia is reportedly expanding its shipbuilding cooperation with India, with two Indian shipyards being considered for construction of four non-nuclear icebreakers. Russian shipbuilding officials have offered New Delhi their nuclear-powered design for an Indian Navy aircraft carrier, according to reports.

The GSL will also build 24 river-sea class cargo ships for Russian clients in the Caspian Sea by 2027. Cooperation with India in shipbuilding has benefits for Russia, as the unit cost per vessel is projected to be half of what it would cost Russian shipbuilders.

The Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited (IRRPL) joint venture has been established and it has started production of AK-203 rifles in India under the ‘Make in India’ initiative. The rate of production needs to be increased and the same will be discussed.

India and Russia recently signed the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement to facilitate military cooperation, allowing both nations’ armed forces to use each other’s bases and facilities for logistical support. There could be a mention.

The Indian military’s hardware umbilical cord, including spare parts and repairs, with Russia will continue for decades to come. India will seek simpler procedures and faster deliveries.

India and Russia are trying to push the International North-South Transport Corridor, the Chennai-Vladivostok Maritime Corridor, and the Polar Route. This should form part of the final joint declaration.

As Russian Ambassador to India Nikolay Kudashev said recently, “The sky is the limit for expansion of Russia-India Partnership.”

[TITLE]Bel Announces Expected Impairment Charge Related to Innolectric Investment:
[TEXT]
WEST ORANGE, N.J., Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bel Fuse Inc. (Nasdaq: BELFA and BELFB) (“Bel” or “the Company”), a leading global manufacturer of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits, today announced an anticipated impairment charge related to its noncontrolling minority investment in innolectric AG (“Innolectric”), a Germany-based e-Mobility technology company.

As previously disclosed, Bel acquired a noncontrolling one-third (1/ 3 ) minority stake in Innolectric in February 2023, as a rising leader in the eMobility market driven by its innovative power products, strong intellectual property portfolio, and talented engineering team. Despite these strengths, factors including the exit of certain companies from the market, the softening of government incentives, and persistent weakness in the global electric vehicle (EV) sector have delayed high-volume sales and resulted in continued operating losses for Innolectric over the past two years. With challenges expected to persist heading into 2026 for Innolectric, Bel was informed by Innolectric’s controlling majority owner that it would be unable to provide its pro-rata share of future funding. Bel also lacked interest in acquiring the remaining stake in Innolectric from the controlling majority owner. Subsequently, Bel was advised that on November 26, 2025, insolvency proceedings were initiated pursuant to an application submitted within the German legal system with respect to Innolectric.

As Innolectric’s insolvency process unfolds, Bel expects to record a pre-tax impairment charge of up to approximately $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2025, based on currently available information and estimates and reflecting the full potential loss associated with the investment, including the outstanding balance of notes receivable representing incremental loans previously extended by Bel to Innolectric to fund working capital needs and business development. The final amount of the impairment charge will be determined as Innolectric’s insolvency process progresses and Bel’s analysis is completed. Bel recorded losses related to its noncontrolling minority interest in Innolectric of $0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. Following the anticipated write-down, the Company expects Innolectric’s insolvency process and Bel’s potential exit from this investment may reduce future cash outlays previously used to fund Innolectric’s operations.

While Bel considered the possibility of acquiring the remaining two-thirds (2/ 3 ) stake in Innolectric from the controlling majority owner, Bel ultimately determined not to invest further capital in Innolectric at this time, after careful consideration of pertinent factors and circumstances, including the current softness in the eMobility market, anticipated effort and time to achieve breakeven status, potential risk exposure and Bel’s other capital allocation priorities.

[TITLE]Calystron Capital Announces Strategic Global Expansion Across Europe and Asia:
[TEXT]
DENVER, Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Calystron Capital today announced a new phase of international expansion, marking an important milestone in the firm’s long-term vision to build a global investment presence supported by advanced technology and cross-market expertise. This initiative centers on deepening the firm’s footprint in Europe—particularly in Spain and Germany—while simultaneously accelerating entry into key Asian markets including Singapore and Japan. Together, these regions represent growing financial hubs with increasing investor demand, regulatory openness to innovation, and strong alignment with Calystron Capital’s technology-driven investment philosophy.

Christopher Ellington, Chief Investment Advisor of Calystron Capital, emphasized that globalization is not only a strategic choice but a natural extension of the firm’s core competencies. With more than thirty years of experience across major financial centers, Ellington noted that global markets are becoming increasingly interconnected, making cross-regional diversification a requirement rather than an option. “Our clients need access to opportunities beyond their home markets,” Ellington said. “Global allocation is no longer optional. It is essential for risk management, resilience, and long-term performance. A truly modern investment architecture must operate across borders.”

Calystron Capital’s expansion is anchored by two defining advantages. The first is the firm’s technology-driven investment infrastructure, which integrates the Calystron Quant Framework™ with the Calystron AI Trading System™. Together, these systems generate data-rich strategies, multi-market liquidity intelligence, high-frequency analytics, and adaptive execution models capable of responding to rapidly shifting environments. This technological backbone allows the firm to monitor global capital flows, cross-asset behavior, and macroeconomic transitions with precision, enabling more sophisticated portfolio construction for clients across diverse regions.

The second advantage lies in Calystron Capital’s approach to combining localized expertise with global oversight. By establishing specialized teams in European and Asian markets, the firm aims to directly understand local investor behavior, evolving regulations, and emerging sector opportunities—while still applying the disciplined standards and risk framework developed in the U.S. institutional market. This blend of local insight and international perspective is designed to create a more robust, diversified investment ecosystem that can adapt to global and regional cycles alike.

As part of its global strategy, Calystron Capital also intends to guide U.S. investors toward broader international diversification—especially in fast-growing European and Asian industries—while helping international investors gain access to the depth, liquidity, and stability of U.S. capital markets. According to Ellington, this two-way flow of capital is becoming increasingly important. “We want to build a bridge between markets,” he said. “Our role is to help clients navigate that bridge with clarity, discipline, and intelligent technology. The future of capital management lies in global mobility and intelligent allocation.”

Looking ahead, the firm expects its expansion to accelerate over the coming year as new research hubs, trading nodes, and advisory teams begin operations across Europe and Asia. With technology and financial expertise serving as its dual engines, Calystron Capital aims to position itself as a central connector between intelligent capital and the world’s major financial regions, shaping a future where innovation and global access define long-term wealth creation.

For JFE, it provides operational access to a high growth market. We expect JSW to react positively to this transaction.

CITI on JSW Steel

Sell, TP Rs 915

JSW Steel’s board has approved divestment of a 50% stake in Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL) for an effective EV of Rs531bn and amalgamation of Piombino Steel (entity owning BPSL) into JSW Steel.

Assuming an EBITDA/t of Rs12,000 (close to est JSW Steel’s EBITDA/t assuming safeguard duty is restored) and full utilization of 4.5mtpa capacity, transaction would imply an EV/EBITDA multiple of 10x for BPSL (JSW Steel is currently trading at 9x)

Post transaction, BPSL would be deconsolidated from JSW Steel’s balance sheet with a reduction in JSW Steel’s consol ND/LTM EBITDA from 3.0x currently to 1.7x

BoFA Sec on JSW Steel

Transaction to help deleverage JSTL’s balance sheet meaningfully ahead of next leg of capacity expansion

JPM on JSW Steel

OW, TP Rs 1250

See JSW Steel’s 50:50 strategic JV with JFE for BPSL business as largely neutral-to-slightly positive over medium term

Enterprise value of deal at Rs530bn (Rs315bn equity & Rs210bn debt) implies an attractive EV/EBITDA multiple of 17x/11x on JPMe FY26/27E for BPSL

Deal will enable JSW to

a) deleverage its balance sheet by Rs370bn (effectively reducing ND/EBITDA by ~0.8x on JPMe) and/or provide improved BS strength to pursue accelerated capacity expansions,

b) enable continued collaboration on value added products with JFE (such as automotive steel and grain-oriented electric sheets).

Management expects deal to be completed in 6-9 months with key timelines being

1) slump sale cash consideration of Rs244.83bn by Mar-2026 (includes first tranche of Rs78.75bn by JFE),

2) second tranche of Rs78.75bn by JFE by June-2026, deconsolidation of existing Rs50bn debt into new entity & new debt issuance of Rs160bn taking total debt to Rs210bn,

3) post share swap, promoter stake in JSW Steel will rise by 1.42% to 46.74%.

Jefferies on JSW Steel

[TITLE]The $148 billion failure: Watchdog's final report excoriates America’s attempt to rebuild Afghanistan:
[TEXT]
More than $148 billion was spent by the U.S. government in its failed attempt to build a free Afghanistan, according to the final report by the official watchdog office, whose careful documentation of waste and fraud, and its warnings of Taliban resurgence, went largely unheeded.

For 17 years, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, tracked every dollar allocated to the country for security, development, and humanitarian aid. As early as 2012, the office saw signs that the U.S. government and military’s efforts were falling short.

“A lot of people knew this wasn’t working. This war wasn't working. In our quarterly reports we would report on ‘the number of districts falling to the Taliban is increasing’,” Gene Aloise, SIGAR’s acting inspector general, told reporters at a Defense Writers Group roundtable on Wednesday. “Our quarterly reports laid out what was happening, and you could predict the future based on what we were saying.”

Aloise spoke as SIGAR released its final report, a 125-page “forensic audit” that condenses its thousands of pages of analysis and documentation of the Afghanistan-reconstruction effort, which consumed more money than was sent to Europe under the post-World War II Marshall Plan. Per the 2025 defense authorization act, the office will close Jan. 31.

“The mission promised to bring stability and democracy to Afghanistan, yet ultimately delivered neither,” the report said. “The outcome in Afghanistan should serve as a cautionary tale for policymakers contemplating similar reconstruction efforts in the future.”

“If there is one overarching lesson to be learned from a tragedy that unfolded over 20 years, it is that any U.S. mission similar in context, scale, and ambition must confront the real possibility of failure,” it said.

Aloise said the group’s independent nature and fierce pursuit of information should also inform future watchdogs—but he fears they won’t.

Scrapped aircraft, vacant hotels, and corrupt contracts

Since SIGAR began its investigations in 2008, the watchdog has determined that $26 billion to $29 billion allocated to Afghanistan reconstruction efforts disappeared to waste, fraud, and abuse.

The U.S. government’s counternarcotics missions in Afghanistan accounted for a large chunk of wasted funds. A June 2018 SIGAR report identified that despite spending $7.3 billion on counter-drug efforts, the country was still “the world’s largest opium supplier.” and rampant corruption in the nation’s narcotics industry “made U.S. efforts to stabilize the country challenging, if not impossible.”

In 2015, SIGAR found that a $355 million USAID power plant was operating at “less than one percent of its capacity.” The next year, it found that $85 million in loans meant to build a hotel and apartments across from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul had not been repaid and had produced only “abandoned empty shells.” In 2018, it found that $486 million for 20 G-222 aircraft for the Afghan air force, purchased for $486 million, fell short of operational requirements. Some were collecting dust; others had been scrapped for “six cents per pound.”

Poor quality work by contractors also led to U.S. service member deaths, SIGAR reported. In 2012, two soldiers were killed after an improvised explosive device hidden in a culvert on a frequently used highway route detonated. An Afghan-owned construction company tasked with installing grates over the culverts did not follow contact specifications, which made them “easy to breach,” SIGAR found, adding “the company’s deceit and shoddy work made it possible for insurgents to bypass the grates and plant explosives that killed the two soldiers.”

Through investigations of criminal activity, SIGAR agents helped convict 171 U.S. and Afghan defendants, which resulted in nearly $1.7 billion in fines, restitutions, asset forfeitures, settlements and savings, the report detailed.

Aloise told reporters that the rampant corruption was perhaps the largest factor that undermined the U.S. government’s efforts in Afghanistan.

“The biggest thing throughout the whole 20 years was corruption. Corruption affected everything,” Aloise said. “It turned the population against the government that we were trying to build over there. It weakened the armed forces, it weakened everything we tried to do.”

A farewell to arms and lessons learned

Catherine Lutz, the co-founder of Brown University’s Costs of War project, said SIGAR’s on-the-ground investigations provided insight into areas of Afghanistan that were inaccessible to members of the public.

One of the major revelations from SIGAR, Lutz said, was the overwhelming number of reconstruction funds being spent on security.

“It's not great that not enough attention has been paid by the general public to what was learned there,” Lutz said. “My main concern is that the whole project of reconstruction was misunderstood by the public as basically humanitarian.”

[TITLE]Recycled Aluminum Market Set for $91 Billion Boom by 2032:
[TEXT]
Asia-Pacific currently dominates the market, with China driving significant growth by relying on scrap to meet domestic demand under a primary aluminum production capacity ceiling, reinforcing a long-term bullish outlook for recycled metal.

Major producers like Novelis are investing heavily in expanding recycling capacity, while the automotive industry is solidifying demand through lightweighting mandates for electric vehicles and new regulations like the EU Battery Regulation.

The global aluminum recycling market is forecasted to grow from $57.2 billion to $91.3 billion by 2032 due to industrial demand for low-carbon materials to offset high energy costs and comply with decarbonization goals.

The global aluminum recycling market is set for a substantial expansion, projected to reach $91.3 billion by 2032, as industrial consumers aggressively pursue low-carbon material sources to mitigate skyrocketing energy costs and meet stringent decarbonization targets.

The forecast, detailed in a new market analysis, highlights a fundamental shift in the global metal supply chain. The recycling market, valued at $57.2 billion in 2024, is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2%.

This growth is structurally linked to the energy-saving advantage of secondary aluminum: production requires approximately 95% less energy than primary smelting.

With primary aluminum prices recently topping a three-year high of nearly $2,900 per tonne, in part due to elevated energy costs for smelters globally, the economic incentive for recycling has never been stronger.

Analysts note that persistently high electricity and natural gas prices in Europe have significantly impacted the operating rates of energy-intensive primary smelters, making recycled metal a strategic cost-saver.

Global Producers Commit Massive Capital to Secure Green Supply

In response to this structural trend, major global producers are committing significant capital to expanding recycling capacity. Novelis Inc., one of the world's largest aluminum recyclers, is investing approximately $90 million to double the capacity for used beverage cans (UBCs) at its Latchford facility in the United Kingdom. This project is expected to increase annual UBC processing by 85 kilotonnes, which the company states will reduce annual carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions by more than 350,000 tonnes for its European operations.

This investment is part of Novelis' broader strategy to achieve an average of 75% recycled content across its products by 2030, up from 63% in fiscal year 2024. Novelis is also expanding recycling capabilities in North America and Asia, with CEO Steve Fisher underscoring that the focus on high recycled content directly translates into a low-carbon solution for customers. This move aligns with industry-wide initiatives, including Hydro's recent construction of a 70,000-tonne-per-year aluminum recycling facility in Torija, Spain, designed to support the construction and transportation sectors with low-carbon alloys.

Automakers Drive Demand with Aggressive Lightweighting and EV Targets

The transportation industry, particularly the electric vehicle (EV) segment, has emerged as the most critical application for recycled aluminum. The automotive sector, which already commands the largest share of the recycling market, is projected to maintain its dominance. As automakers strive to improve EV range and performance, the engineering imperative for lightweighting is increasing the average aluminum content in vehicles, which can exceed 400 kilograms per unit for some EVs.

Set OilPrice.com as a preferred source in Google here

This demand is backed by corporate mandates, such as Ford Motor Company's commitment to utilize a minimum of 20% recycled content in the aluminum components of its F-Series truck production. Furthermore, new regulations are beginning to formalize this trend. Notably, the European Union Battery Regulation 2023/1542 will introduce minimum recycled-content thresholds for battery housings starting in 2027, locking in demand for secondary materials. According to the Aluminum Association, aluminum is the fastest-growing automotive material, with usage expected to reach a record 514 pounds per vehicle by 2026.

China's Production Cap Propels Asia-Pacific Recycling Growth

Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region is the dominant force in the recycling market, accounting for over 41% of the global landscape. China, the largest consumer of aluminum scrap in the region, is significantly shaping the global supply-demand dynamic. With the Chinese government adhering to a firm capacity ceiling of 45 million tonnes for primary aluminum smelting, the country is increasingly relying on scrap and secondary production to meet domestic industrial demand. The nation has set a target to recycle over fifteen million tons of aluminum annually by 2027.

The structural supply tightness, compounded by policy and trade issues like the European Union's impending Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) set to take effect in 2026, is pressuring producers globally to decarbonize. The use of recycled aluminum, which avoids 95% of associated greenhouse gas emissions, provides an immediate path to compliance and sustainability. The International Aluminium Institute (IAI) projects that global aluminum demand will double by 2050, with more than half of that demand expected to be met by recycled metal, solidifying the market's long-term bullish outlook.

[TITLE]Off the Rails: A Mega-Merger Between Rail Giants Would Be a Disaster for Workers and Communities:
[TEXT]
Maximillian Alvarez: What’s going on with this merger? Why should people care about it? And from a worker perspective, what is this going to mean for you guys and for all of us? Ron Kaminkow: Having lived through what they call a ​“meltdown,” a massive service failure in 1999 that actually continued into the year 2000. I think they didn’t get this mess cleaned up for probably about 18 months. Our main line looked like a parking lot and the Norfolk Southern takeover of our portion of Conrail was an unmitigated disaster. This is not good for railroad workers. We worked endlessly, largely 12 hours every time we went to work. It’s a complete chaotic environment. This is not a safe environment. Workers are demoralized. It’s a state of confusion, and we are all constantly fatigued. And we’re pretty upset that we’ve seen our railroad turned upside down and largely destroyed by a corporate takeover. So I would postulate that this kind of meltdown is certainly not in our interest, and there’s very good reason to believe that a UP and NS merger would result in this. Mergers take place in industries, and the rail industry is no exception, because they want to gain economies and eliminate what they call redundancies. So these two railroads meet at least five major terminals, and these terminals are already congested and complicated. The fact that we will be paired down to four Class 1s at this rate in North America gives these carriers inordinate power like they’ve never had, and the more powerful they are, the weaker we are. And the more powerful they are, the more likely they will be successful in lobbying for the eradication of longstanding safety rules, of labor legislation that guarantees us the right to collectively bargain and choose a union to represent us and so forth and so on.

[TITLE]India’s defence-tech startups are thriving:
[TEXT]
ANIRUDH SHARMA was a computer-science undergraduate with no training in aerospace when he co-founded Digantara, which gathers intelligence on satellite movements, in 2020. Today it employs 150 people in India, Singapore and America and is valued at more than $65m. That may be a modest sum by Western standards. But it makes Digantara one of the big success stories in India’s flourishing defence-and-aerospace startup scene.

“The Indian defence-tech ecosystem is really buzzing right now," says Suyash Singh, the founder of GalaxEye, which provides radar and other imagery from satellites. In part this is because India’s startup ecosystem is evolving more broadly. Venture-capital firms and freshly minted billionaires are looking beyond consumer apps as places to invest. Defence-tech firms have benefited from the Indian government’s efforts to promote indigenisation. The most immediate reason for the buzz, however, has been the shock of war.

View Full Image Chart: The Economist

Earlier this year India suffered from a terrorist attack for which it blamed Pakistani militants. It conducted air strikes against Pakistan, a campaign it called Operation Sindoor, triggering a four-day air-and-missile war. India’s high-end missiles performed well, but its air defences were “stressed by drone saturation" and the challenge of distinguishing real weapons from decoys, says Sameer Lalwani of the German Marshall Fund, a think-tank in Washington, forcing it to use expensive interceptors against cheap projectiles.

Just days after the guns fell silent, India launched “emergency procurement" worth almost $5bn. That sum is around 25% of its annual capital spending on defence, notes Mr Lalwani. A substantial chunk of the spending is dedicated to replenishing ammunition, missiles and interceptors that the armed forces consumed during the operation. But there is also a renewed focus on innovation. Sindoor revealed that India needs much better drones and counter-drone defences. That is precisely where many startups have an advantage over established Indian defence firms such as Tata, Kalyani and Mahindra. Intelligence, electronic warfare and artificial intelligence are also priorities.

Almost every Indian defence startup has a story of how they helped the war effort, with some raising new cash from investors off the back of their involvement. Digantara “were constantly giving reports to the armed forces", says Mr Sharma. It sent reports, for example, on the areas that Chinese and Pakistani spy satellites could—and could not—observe. Just as the Russian invasion has honed the drone skills of Ukraine and its Western allies, the experience of Sindoor gave Digantara a “clear understanding" of how to make their services more useful in conflict. “We had to change a lot of our features post-Sindoor," says Mr Sharma. The firm’s revenues from defence have surged.

Sindoor was only the latest conflict to deepen the relationship between India’s defence establishment in Delhi, the capital, and the mostly Bangalore-based startup scene. Ankit Mehta, the co-founder of IdeaForge, a big drone-maker, says that after a border clash with China in 2020 there was a push to “robustly expose the Indian [defence-startup] ecosystem to reality". Firms increasingly take their products to front-line commands to test them in real-world conditions, such as the thin air and freezing temperatures of the mountainous northern border, where drone batteries drain quickly and parts seize up.

The origins of the relationship, however, lie further back. In 2018 India’s defence ministry started channelling money to startups and other defence companies under a scheme called Innovations for Defence Excellence, or IDEX. The idea was to connect businesses with military units that wanted specific problems solved. The army, for example, wants a sniper robot that works in sandy and muddy conditions.

For some IDEX projects, the government promises a minimum order, giving startups guaranteed revenue if their prototype works. The steady growth of the IDEX pot has lubricated that of the sector. The largest individual grants have jumped from $178,000 in 2021 to almost $3m in 2024, and the scheme has attracted more than 600 companies. “IDEX has been huge" for the defence-tech ecosystem, says Kaushik Mudda, whose company, Ethereal Machines, makes complicated parts with high-tech machines designed and built in India.

Behind the government’s push is a long-standing desire for more self-sufficiency in weapons. India has for decades been one of the largest arms importers in the world, making it vulnerable to embargoes of ammunition and spare parts, especially by America. The government now demands that a growing proportion of weapons and their components are designed and manufactured in India. Its list swells each year.

Even more than money, perhaps the most telling sign of the government’s seriousness is that “startups are looking very positively towards the army," as one founder puts it. India has a well-deserved reputation for bureaucracy and baroque procurement rules. Yet tech startups find the relationship a surprisingly easy one.

Still, plenty of challenges remain. Dinesh Kanagraj, the co-founder of Fabheads, which 3D-prints carbon-fibre parts, notes that Western companies can be skittish about selling dual-use components. That is especially so if those parts might find a place in India’s nuclear-weapons programme. Indigenisation is a solution to this problem. India’s own export-control laws, too, deprive startups of what a founder calls “rampant opportunities".

The other challenge is access to private capital. Investors are setting up funds dedicated to defence and aerospace. But the sums pale compared to funds that invest in consumer tech. “Early-stage funding has improved a lot," says Mr Sharma. The next level—capital to scale up business to take on the established firms and then crack the foreign market—has yet to materialise. America has more than a dozen “unicorns"—private firms valued at more than $1bn—in defence-related areas; Europe at least three. India is chasing its first.

Capital and statecraft have always been connected. But since the dawn of modern capitalism, the world’s overall wealth and average human welfare have risen dramatically. So too has states’ access to capital and their willingness to deploy it to achieve political ends—a trend that is particularly strong during periods of rapid economic growth, technological change, and great-power rivalry.

Today, policymakers are treating geo-economics as a national security issue, putting investments behind their geopolitical strategies through sovereign wealth funds, national champions, and public-private partnerships.

Call it the rise of instrumental capital: the use of state-directed funds to pursue the dual mandate of generating financial returns and projecting state power. This capital is patient, long-term, and aligned with the domestic and international agendas of particular leaders. How countries invest is, increasingly, how they compete. In this new paradigm, governments are more than regulators of markets; they are now among the most consequential asset owners and allocators of capital in the global economy.

Nowhere is this clearer than in the Middle East. While the development of some countries in the region has been held back by the presence of extremist groups or a lack of resources, wealthy Arab Gulf monarchies are set on a clear path toward prosperity. These countries are stable, well-resourced, and able to pursue economic agendas that are largely siloed from the region’s conflicts. Their rise is one of the most important trends in geopolitics and global finance.

The modern advent of sovereign wealth funds is at the heart of this revolution. Kuwait established the world’s first sovereign wealth fund in 1953. The Kuwaiti model spread around the world, and Middle Eastern sovereigns have since driven global capital flows. According to Global SWF, in the first nine months of 2025, Middle Eastern sovereign investors accounted for as much as 40 percent of state-investor deal value globally, with deals totaling $56.3 billion. Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds have more than $5.6 trillion in assets under management, which would make these pools of capital collectively the third-largest economy in the world. By 2030, that number is projected to climb to $8.8 trillion.

As many as 170 sovereign wealth funds worldwide—from China to Norway and Singapore—hold more than $14 trillion in assets. The mandates for sovereign wealth are changing along with their scale. For much of their history, these funds charted passive investment strategies, largely following macroeconomic trends. Today, a growing number of these sovereign wealth funds have transformed into active capital allocators and the engines behind broad technological and geoeconomic mandates that represent some of the most ambitious and high-stakes bets in the world. The most aggressive shift is taking place among the Middle East’s Gulf monarchies, where it is often a small group of political leaders and their inner circles, not just investment managers, who decide where, when, and why investments are made.

The scale and scope of instrumental capital is creating new domains of competition and cooperation. It is redirecting state capacity toward economic diversification, technological advantage, and geopolitical leverage. If the model endures, it could reshape not only the Middle East but also the architecture of global finance and the practice of statecraft.

A black-and-white engraving illustration shows men gathered around a table. One man seated hands another standing a piece of paper. They wear ornate period clothes from the early 1600s, including doublets, puffy breeches, and large circular ruffled collars.

One of the earliest expressions of instrumental capital came from the Dutch Republic in the 16th and 17th centuries. During their revolt against Habsburg Spain, known as the Eighty Years War, the rebellious provinces established a novel corporation: the Dutch East India Company.

The firm was financed by private investors who were issued shares in one of the world’s first publicly traded companies. But the Dutch government also backed the Dutch East India Company, understanding that it needed revenue to finance its war of independence. At the heart of this operation was the company’s government-granted monopoly over trade in Asia, one of the fastest growing markets in the world.

This precedent resonates today, as governments worldwide employ state-directed funds and influence, often through state-owned enterprises or strategic investments in private companies, to achieve national economic and geopolitical objectives, particularly in critical sectors such as technology and infrastructure.

The Marshall Plan was a later example of instrumental capital at scale. Proposed during the administration of U.S. President Harry Truman in 1947, the Marshall Plan committed $13.3 billion—roughly $150 billion in today’s terms—to rebuild Western Europe’s shattered postwar economies. The money was foreign aid, but it also advanced U.S. interests. At a moment when the United States was the only industrial power whose industries hadn’t been devastated by war, a revived Europe would offer markets for U.S. exports, reinforce the dollar’s global preeminence, and reduce the appeal of communism in the early days of the Cold War.

The Marshall Plan used targeted capital to shape the postwar balance of power. Today’s great-power competition likewise hinges on which states can deploy capital at scale to anchor alliances, build industrial capacity, and set the rules of an emerging order.

Such logic became even more pronounced as the Cold War continued. This was an era of geographically limited economic integration but intense global competition. With the end of the Vietnam War, the United States grew wary of military entanglements across the Pacific. Alarmed at the prospect of abandonment and seeking to reinforce its fraying connection to Washington, Taiwan—then a predominantly agricultural economy—invested in technology.

A man is silhouetted from behind as he stands in front of a colorful wall-sized screen with photos of semiconductor chips and workers displayed on it.

The strategy was straightforward: As author Chris Miller wrote in his book Chip War, “The more semiconductor plants on the island, and the more economic ties with the United States, the safer Taiwan would be.”

As the Cold War moved into the era of detente and the United States phased out economic aid to Taiwan in the 1960s and 1970s, the island courted trade over aid. In 1968, Texas Instruments approved its first plant in Taiwan. Five years later, the Taiwanese government founded the Industrial Technology Research Institute, led by Morris Chang. With $100 million from the country’s National Development Fund, Chang then launched the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).

The fusing of state capital and technological innovation, backing university researchers and private sector investors and entrepreneurs, built the foundation of the United States’ technological ecosystem in the Cold War era of great-power competition. Washington supported the development in the late 1960s of technologies such as ARPANET, the first advanced computer network, and the innovative ecosystem around Silicon Valley that, along with companies such as TSMC, would come to define today’s global technology landscape.

The world’s two largest economies, the United States and China, now wield the greatest capacity to shape global flows of goods and capital, whether through investments or economic tools such as export controls and tariffs. Both are, in markedly different but sometimes converging ways, using economic statecraft not only for growth but also to gain strategic leverage where military or diplomatic tools fall short or would be too costly.

In recent months, Washington has closed critical-minerals and semiconductor deals while expanding investment pacts with places from Japan to the Gulf. Beijing has intensified its industrial policy to secure leadership in strategic sectors and drive toward self-reliance. With its centrally planned, state-party governance model, it has fused subsidies, industrial policy, and state-owned champions to move from being the world’s factory to becoming the world’s rising technology competitor.

Whereas Beijing mobilizes state-led capital to dominate strategic sectors, Washington relies primarily on deep capital markets and entrepreneurial dynamism, reinforced by public investment. This has coincided with a decade-long debate

[TITLE]FedEx expands Bengaluru hub, doubles capacity with new 60,000 sq ft facility:
[TEXT]
Express transportation company Federal Express Corporation (FedEx) has expanded its Bengaluru express hub with a new 60,000 sq ft facility in integrated air hub at the AI-SATS Logistics Park, Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru.

With this, the total operational footprint in the city has touched 100,000 sq ft. The launch comes as the airport advances plans to nearly double its annual cargo capacity to 1 million tonnes , positioning Bengaluru as a critical export gateway and aligning the FedEx investment with India’s next phase of high-growth manufacturing and trade.

The semi- automated hub can process up to 4,000 packages per hour, supporting rising demand from electronics, auto components, and SME-driven e-commerce exports.

Speaking to businessline, Suvendu Choudhury, Vice President – Operations, Planning and Engineering, India, said the company is “positioned comfortably in South India” owing to strong growth momentum.

Choudhury added that the last two to two-and-a-half years have been “good” for FedEx, with the company growing at significantly higher double-digit numbers. “We are making significant investments. We had capacity, and now we are augmenting it,” he said.

Key gateway

Bengaluru has also emerged as a key Asia-Pacific gateway, following FedEx’s addition of a direct Guangzhou–Bengaluru–Europe 777 freighter, which has reduced transit time by a full business day.

With this, the Bengaluru network has 10 weekly flights operating from Bengaluru, and 22 weekly flights from India. Choudhury said FedEx is targeting sustained double-digit growth despite macro-trade volatility, signalling strong confidence in long-term India demand.

SMEs form a major share of FedEx’s customer base in India, accounting for over 60 per cent of its clients, with 30–35 per cent of total business now driven by e-commerce, he added.

The Guangzhou-Bengaluru connection, launched in November last year, has strengthened access to critical imports such as lithium-ion batteries and electronic components and increased export capacity to Europe and the US, enabling faster delivery for sectors including healthcare, engineering, automotive, aerospace and e-commerce.

FedEx currently employs over 5,100 direct employees in India.
