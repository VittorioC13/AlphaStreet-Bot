[TITLE]Diesel Spreads Hit Near Two-Year Peak After India Cuts Russian Crude Purchases:
[TEXT]
Recently, Bloomberg reported that five of India's largest oil refiners have made no purchases of Russian crude for December delivery, instead turning to Saudi Arabia, UAE and Iraq for crude with similar properties to Urals. The move comes after Washington sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil while the EU adopted its 19th package of sanctions. Only Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Nayara Energy, in which Rosneft holds a 49% stake, have purchased crude from Russia for December. Meanwhile, the diplomatic sensitivity of the ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and India has no doubt influenced the decision by Indian refiners to ditch Russian oil. But India is not the only entity feeling pressure by the Trump administration to stop buying Russian energy. Swiss multinational energy trading company, Gunvor, has abandoned its bid for Lukoil’s international assets--including European refineries, oilfield shares in Iraq, Mexico, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, and global retail stations--following Washington’s opposition to the deal.

And now commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have reported the Indian pivot away from Russia has triggered a spike in oil product prices even as crude prices remain largely unchanged. To wit, ICE Brent-Gasoil crack spreads have doubled from the $15-17/bbl range held

In the first half of the year, to a 21-month high above $32/bbl, good for a nearly 70% increase in the year-to-date. The fact that Brent prices are still trading at multi-month lows suggests that overwhelming bearish sentiment has ruled oil markets for much of the year still lingers, even as oil product markets tighten. Gasoil is a middle distillate mainly used in commercial and agricultural sectors for off-road vehicles, machinery, and generators.

Unfortunately for the oil bulls, the mid-term oil price outlook remains bleak, with U.S. oil production growth exceeding expectations. Previously, we reported that Big Oil companies have continued to ramp-up oil production, taking advantage of their improving operating leverage to squeeze more profits from low oil prices. To wit, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has reported that it has increased hydrocarbons production to 4.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day (boe/d), including nearly 1.7 million boe/d from the Permian and more than 700,000 boe/d from Guyana. Meanwhile, Exxon brought the Yellowtail project online in the third quarter, four months ahead of schedule. Yellowtail production is expected to clock in at 250,000 boe/d, increasing total Guyana output to over 900,000 boe/d. The story is pretty much the same at Chevron (NYSE:CVX). The United States’ second largest oil company posted record global production of 4.09 million boe/d, up 21%Y/Y, including a 27% Y/Y increase in U.S. production to a record 2.04 million boe/d.

Well, it appears that this is an industrywide trend: the Energy Information Administration has revealed that U.S. oil output will average 13.59 million barrels per day in the current year and only decline marginally to 13.58 million bpd in 2026, up from its earlier forecasts of a steeper decline to 13.53 mb/d in 2025 and 13.51 mb/d in 2026 with global oil supply outpacing fuel demand. EIA sees global crude oil stocks rising from 2.93 billion barrels in the fourth quarter of the current year to 3.18 billion barrels by the final quarter of 2026.

The EIA is in good company. Last month, StanChart finally joined the bear camp, slashing its 2026 and 2027 oil price outlook by $15 per barrel, triggered by the significant rotation in the forward curve over the past year. StanChart raised the average price of Brent crude in 2025 to $68.50/bbl from $61/bbl; however, the analysts cut the 2026 target to $63.50/bbl from $78/bbl, and 2027 prices to $67/bbl from $83/bbl, noting that the futures curve is now in contango from early-2026 onwards. Contango occurs when the futures price is higher than the spot price, suggesting that people expect the price to rise or that storage costs are high while backwardation occurs when the futures price is lower than the spot price, often indicating high immediate demand or expectations of a future price drop.

StanChart has, however, maintained their earlier prediction that low prices will eventually start to depress U.S. shale output growth.

StanChart’s forecast of looming output cuts by U.S. producers is supported by the fact that U.S. shale production costs have been rising, driven by the depletion of prime resources and the need to drill in more speculative, complex areas and formations. Analysts at Enverus have predicted that the marginal cost to produce oil in the U.S. Shale Patch could increase from ~$70 per barrel to $95 per barrel by the mid-2030s. This shift is happening as the industry moves from easily accessible core inventory to less proven resources, leading to higher costs. Many U.S. oil producers, particularly smaller ones and those in regions like the Permian Basin, need oil prices above $65 a barrel to turn a profit on new drilling, a figure that has been rising due to inflation. Larger producers may have a lower breakeven point, sometimes in the high $50s, while older, existing wells can still be cash-flow positive at lower prices because initial drilling costs have already been covered.

[TITLE]Trump’s Energy Pushback Sends Shockwaves Through Wind Industry:
[TEXT]
The energy transition faces the biggest challenge yet as a global backlash against renewable energy – spearheaded by U.S. President Donald Trump – is gaining momentum, according to two of the European pioneers of wind turbine design.

President Trump’s views on wind energy and climate change are extreme, but they are symptomatic of a global shift in the perception of the need for and benefits from the energy transition, say Henrik Stiesdal and Andrew Garrad, a Dane and a Brit, who are often referred to as the “Godfathers of wind.”

“This sort of change is a very dangerous thing”

Stiesdal and Garrad have won the 2024 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering “for their achievements in advancing the design, manufacture and deployment of high-performance wind turbines, allowing wind energy to make a substantial contribution to the world’s electricity generation.”

Stiesdal was responsible for the turbine design for the world’s first offshore wind farm, while Garrad pioneered the BLADED computational design tool, which allows engineers to model a turbine system and predict its behavior.

After 40 years of helping the world develop wind energy, Stiesdal and Garrad are now concerned that the marked shift in perception of renewables, especially offshore wind energy, could hold back the rollout of clean energy technologies.

“Trump is symptomatic. I mean an extreme symptom of that, but you can see it I think in all Western countries certainly, perhaps not elsewhere,” Garrad told CNBC earlier this month, before being bestowed, together with Stiesdal, with the Queen Elizabeth Prize by King Charles III.

President Trump has slammed wind energy, rolled back or scrapped many Biden-era incentives for renewables, and has criticized other countries’ approach to energy policy, including the UK.

President Trump has repeatedly called for the UK to incentivize oil and gas production and “get rid of” wind farms.

At the UN General Assembly in September, the President went on the offensive and attacked clean energy globally, and called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” He derided renewable energy as ineffective, expensive, and a financial drag, calling it a “joke”.

President Trump also described windmills as “pathetic and so bad, so expensive to operate” before referring to them as “the most expensive energy ever conceived.”

The “Godfather of wind” Garrad noted that the backlash against wind energy is not “just a wind energy problem.”

“To do this sort of change is a very dangerous thing. And I think it has shown that this is a political business,” Garrad told CNBC.

“It’s a personal decision by a politician, who happens to be a rather powerful one — and it has sent shockwaves around the place.”

According to Garrad, the renewable energy industry now faces a general shift in mood, which needs to be addressed.

Costs Add to Headwinds

The unfavorable regulatory and political climate in Washington is one of the main hurdles to renewable energy and the energy transition. But it’s not the only one. Soaring costs, supply chain issues, high interest rates, power curtailments, and mismatches with grid availability and capacity have added to the headwinds in wind and solar energy in recent years.

Ørsted, the world’s largest offshore wind developer, has become this year the poster child of the current regulatory and structural issues facing the wind energy sector.

Ørsted has recently completed a huge rights issue equal to some $9.35 billion, to cover immediate financing needs amid regulatory uncertainties in the U.S., after the Trump Administration tried to have it stop work at a nearly completed project off the East Coast.

Faced with numerous headwinds, Ørsted last month said it would slash its workforce numbers by 2,000 by 2027, eliminating a quarter of its current roles.

Regulatory changes, cost inflation, and high interest rates have impacted project economics in the offshore wind industry in the past three years.

The economics weren’t fantastic even before 2022, but European oil and gas majors decided to invest in renewables when they announced shifts to net zero and targets to leave their oil production decline.

This shift lasted only a couple of years until energy security became more important—to every country—than sustainability. Big Oil abandoned the ambitious renewables targets and returned to what they do best—pump oil and gas to ensure the energy supply the world needs.

In one of the latest withdrawals, Shell this week exited two offshore wind power projects in Scotland as the world’s top oil and gas firms continue to scale back their investment and involvement in renewable energy.

Shell and the other European supermajor, BP, have shifted focus back to their core oil and gas business. The pivot took place after the energy crisis made energy security and affordability more important than sustainability, while high interest rates and supply chain issues further reduced already meager returns from clean energy projects and made many new energy ventures uncompetitive.

The most competitive projects still go forward, especially in jurisdictions with favorable policies, including China and Europe. Enthusiasm in Europe has waned but the need for domestically generated electricity without the reliance on gas imports underpins continued clean energy development.

The renewable energy industry now has to find its Goldilocks place between the overly zealous proponents and the opponents, branding it “pathetic”.

[TITLE]Beijing Lures Private Investors to Reignite Infrastructure Growth:
[TEXT]
After decades of funding major infrastructure projects with state money, the Chinese government has zeroed in on private capital as a source of fresh cash for big projects in everything from transport to energy, to power generation, and drones.

In a new policy presented earlier this week, Beijing signaled private capital is now welcome in hydropower, nuclear power, oil and gas pipelines, and water supply, media reported, citing government officials.

“Private investment serves as a key barometer reflecting economic vitality and plays a crucial role in stabilizing growth, employment and expectations,” the deputy director of China’s National Development and Reform Commission said, as quoted by the South China Morning Post.

The changes introduced this week include a prescription for state entities leading projects in a number of areas to carry out a study of the feasibility of private investment for each of these projects. The areas include railways, hydropower, nuclear power, power transmission, oil and gas pipelines, liquefied natural gas import terminals and storage, and water supply. Related: Argentina’s Vaca Muerta Shale Is Smashing Oil Production Records in 2025

“While encouraging private capital participation in key projects, we also equally support all types of market entities to participate, fostering complementary advantages and common development among diverse forms of ownership,” Guan Peng, deputy director of the Department of Fixed Asset Investment at the NDRC, said as quoted by China Daily.

To take better advantage of this barometer that can stabilize growth—recently uneven in the world’s biggest growth engine—the Chinese government has introduced changes in private company ownership limits in projects that fall within the scope of the new legislation. It has also prohibited the addition of extra conditions for private companies in public tenders on infrastructure projects.

Previously, private companies were not allowed to own a stake higher than 10% in such projects, but with the new rules, they would be able to do just that, after the strict rules led to an outflow of foreign investment over the past few years, Bloomberg noted in its report on the news. This year alone, foreign direct investment is down by 10%, the publication said.

With those limits, Chinese private companies have been reluctant to put their money into such projects, and this appears to have finally drawn the attention of the authorities. In fact, per the People’s Daily, the NDRC has been working to boost private capital participation in infrastructure projects for several years now, allowing private entities to take stakes as high as 20% in some projects, for instance, nuclear power.

These efforts have paid off, according to data for this year, which shows that private investment in infrastructure has gone up by 7%, even if overall it declined amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade offensive that had a special focus on China. However, private companies have been finding it harder to stay profitable, which was one big reason for the latest policy changes that aimed to boost their participation in infrastructure and energy projects.

The NDRC boasted it had recommended a grand total of 105 real estate investment trust infrastructure projects to the China Securities Regulatory Commission so far. The projects had raised a combined $29 billion since their listing and were expected to drive five times that amount in project investment.

“We will further improve regular communication mechanisms between government and enterprises, strengthen coordination, and solidly promote the implementation of the Private Economy Promotion Law to facilitate high-quality development of the private investment,” the deputy director of the NDPC’s Bureau of Private Economy, Ling Zhongguo, said as quoted by the People’s Daily.

Going forward, according to some of the reports on the new policy changes, the government would focus on drawing more private capital into energy projects, including everything from oil and gas to electricity transmission, highlighting yet again the significance of that sector.

[TITLE]Making Sense of the World Energy Outlook:
[TEXT]
The report contains multiple, diverging scenarios, with ambiguity around the assumptions behind each one. As a result, advocates on all sides are predictably declaring the report either a welcome reality check on overconfidence in the clean energy transition or proof that the transition is unstoppable. The truth, as usual, lies somewhere in between. Perpetually rising oil and gas demand should not be seen as the status quo, but neither should a faster transition be seen as inevitable. Much will depend on how countries view the national security implications of clean energy.

World leaders gathered in Belém, Brazil this week for the annual United Nations climate summit to confront a sobering reality: Global emissions from fossil fuels are set to reach a new high in 2025, the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels is out of reach , and the United States did not even bother to show up. Against this backdrop, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released its flagship World Energy Outlook, making headlines for including a scenario in which oil demand continues to climb through 2050.

World leaders gathered in Belém, Brazil this week for the annual United Nations climate summit to confront a sobering reality: Global emissions from fossil fuels are set to reach a new high in 2025, the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels is out of reach, and the United States did not even bother to show up. Against this backdrop, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released its flagship World Energy Outlook, making headlines for including a scenario in which oil demand continues to climb through 2050.

The report contains multiple, diverging scenarios, with ambiguity around the assumptions behind each one. As a result, advocates on all sides are predictably declaring the report either a welcome reality check on overconfidence in the clean energy transition or proof that the transition is unstoppable. The truth, as usual, lies somewhere in between. Perpetually rising oil and gas demand should not be seen as the status quo, but neither should a faster transition be seen as inevitable. Much will depend on how countries view the national security implications of clean energy.

Reporting on the new World Energy Outlook has been understandably muddled because it is difficult to parse the assumptions in the IEA’s two main scenarios—one based on countries’ current policies and another that also incorporates their stated, in other words proposed, policies. As a result, headlines have resorted to saying oil demand “could” rise through 2050—not a particularly helpful insight for anyone assessing probabilities.

Under current policies, oil demand climbs from 100 million barrels per day to 113 million barrels per day by 2050; under stated policies, it peaks near 102 million by 2030 before gradually declining. Another scenario outlines what would be required to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, a goal for which the world remains far off track.

So where is the world most likely headed? The current policies scenario (CPS) offers a static view of policy and technology that assumes no changes to laws already on the books and slower adoption of new technologies—not just relative to the stated policies scenario (STEPS) but to recent experience. STEPS, by contrast, assumes a more dynamic outlook: that governments implement announced intentions but not achieve every aspiration or target.

The differences can be subtle. In the IEA’s 2025 current policy scenario, for example, improvements in fuel economy in Japan stop once a 2030 target in regulation is achieved, while STEPS assumes Japan will gradually strengthen the policy beyond 2030.

Judgment calls are unavoidable. The IEA assumes, for example, that the European Union will implement its 100 million euro ($117 million) plan for industrial decarbonization, but not achieve its implausible goal of producing 10 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2030. It places far greater confidence in China’s ability to carry out its national energy plan—a judgment supported by recent history.

The IEA warns that labeling current policy as “business as usual” is “misleading.” Past CPS projections have repeatedly underestimated the dynamism of both policy and technology. For example, the IEA’s last CPS, produced in 2019, significantly underestimated how fast renewable energy would grow—and coal growth as well.

Which scenario is more plausible depends on which assumptions one finds most credible. Believing the IEA’s projection of rising oil demand through 2050 would require assuming that electric vehicle deployment barely expands outside China and the EU, that alternative technologies stagnate despite plummeting costs and surging investment, or that the world remains complacent

[TITLE]Condor Announces 2025 Third Quarter Results:
[TEXT]
CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Condor Energies Inc. (“Condor” or the “Company”) (TSX:CDR), a Canadian based, internationally focused energy transition company focused on Central Asia is pleased to announce the release of its unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 (the “Financial Statements”), together with the related management’s discussion and analysis. These documents will be made available under Condor’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on the Condor website at www.condorenergies.ca. Readers are invited to review the latest corporate presentation available on the Condor website. All financial amounts in this news release are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.

HIGHLIGHTS

Production in Uzbekistan for the third quarter of 2025 averaged 9,978 boe/d comprised of 9,778 boe/d (58,668 Mcf/d) of natural gas and 200 bopd of condensate.

Uzbekistan natural gas and condensate sales for the third quarter of 2025 was $18.74 million.

Drilling of Uzbekistan’s first horizontal well continues and the planned 1000-meter lateral section is currently underway with numerous mud gas shows being encountered.

A field optimization study and engineering design for the first phase of field compression has been completed, and the procurement process has commenced. Installing compression will increase gas production rates and recoverable volumes by reducing well back pressure.

On August 12, 2025, the Company executed a USD $5.0 million-dollar bridge loan facility (the “Bridge Loan”) for the First LNG Facility which is scheduled to produce Kazakhstan’s first LNG in the third quarter of 2026.

MESSAGE FROM CONDOR’S CEO

Don Streu, President and CEO of Condor commented: “Condor is in an envious position given its diverse portfolio of energy-transition initiatives in Central Asia, a region that is drawing increased focus and foreign direct investment for its energy and critical minerals sectors. Our team has decades of experience operating in remote regions and has successfully introduced modern operating techniques and technologies, while maintaining a deep understanding of value realization in these environments.

The Company is currently drilling Uzbekistan’s longest horizontal well and is using Western tools and techniques never before deployed there. Our multi-well drilling campaign is intended to materially increase both gas production rates and associated cash flows, and Condor’s recently reprocessed 3-D seismic data set has generated an extensive inventory of undrilled structures, with numerous infill and undrained attic closure locations identified. Accordingly, we are actively pursuing a second drilling rig to accelerate our planned 12-well drilling program in 2026.

We continue to make strong progress in our efforts to deliver Central Asia’s first LNG production, and we are on track to commence production in the third quarter of 2026. The three LNG feedgas allocations awarded to Condor to-date total more than 625 million cubic meters of natural gas per year and the allocations are strategically located to supply LNG fuel to multiple consumers in various regions of the country. The Government of Kazakhstan supports Condor’s LNG initiative, since it will provide the country with greater energy security while assisting in achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets.

The Company is also conducting an aeromagnetic survey at one of our critical minerals licenses to help further define mineral deposits and structural trends which will allow us to better understand the potential for both copper and lithium development. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of mining licenses awarded in the areas adjacent to the Company’s license areas and active copper exploration activities are underway by major mining companies. Given the heavily faulted systems we’ve mapped in this geothermally active region, it appears that mineralized brines have migrated into the basin’s reservoirs, as is evident by the lithium concentrations on Condor’s blocks, as previously reported by the Ministry of Geology of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

Condor remains committed to advancing its diverse portfolio of assets for the benefit of our shareholders, stakeholders and host governments while continuing to position the Company as a leading energy transition developer in Central Asia”.

Production in Uzbekistan

The Company operates under a production enhancement services contract with JSC Uzbekneftegaz (“UNG”) in Uzbekistan to increase the production, recovery, and overall system efficiency from an integrated cluster of eight conventional natural gas-condensate fields (the “PEC Project”). Production in the third quarter of 2025 averaged 9,978 boe/d comprised of 9,778 boe/d (58,668 Mcf/d) of natural gas and 200 bopd of condensate.

Total production in Uzbekistan for the third quarter of 2025 decreased 1.7% compared to the second quarter of 2025 due mainly to natural reservoir decline but offset by the increased production from the various workovers performed during the third quarter of 2025 consisting of recompletions, tubing changes, and artificial lift installations. One of the recompletions in the third quarter of 2025 involved perforating a new zone of interest and resulted in an incremental average daily production rate of 2.2 MMscf/d.

On September 8, 2025 the Company commenced drilling its first well in Uzbekistan (the “First Well”). A pilot vertical hole was drilled to a total depth of 2,805 meters that penetrated the currently producing carbonate reservoir sections as well as deeper, under-exploited stacked clastic reservoir sections. After coring and extensive wireline logging operations, petrophysical analysis indicates 37.6 meters of non-contiguous net gas pay was identified consisting of 28.5 meters in carbonate reservoirs and 9.1 meters in deeper clastic reservoirs. Following logging, the pilot hole was open-hole sidetracked to drill a horizontal leg into a known carbonate reservoir. Drilling of the 1000-meter lateral section is ongoing with numerous mud gas shows being recorded. Depending on drilling conditions, the lateral section may be extended. Once reaching total depth, the lateral section will be flow tested and shut in for build up pressure evaluation while the rig moves to the next drill location (the “Second Well”). The First Well is expected to be tied into the Company’s production system in December 2025.

The Second Well will be drilled from the same pad location and target a shallower carbonate reservoir identified in the recently drilled pilot hole of the First Well. The Second Well will utilize a simplified casing design to leverage drilling learnings from the previous two penetrations to reduce drilling time and costs and is planned to be a geo-steered, 1,000-meter open hole horizontal well and aims to further de-risk the stacked carbonate reservoirs present across the Company’s licenses.

The Company is also in the process of contracting a second drilling rig to concurrently drill at a nearby under-developed gas field located in the southern region of the Company’s licenses in Uzbekistan. This field is currently producing from a single downdip gas well where Condor recently perforated an eight-meter thick carbonate interval which increased the well’s average daily production from 1.1 MMscf/day to 7.5 MMscf/day for the first thirty days and has produced an average of 6.0 MMscf/day for the past six months. This recompletion has also de-risked the large undeveloped, up-dip structural closure that was identified on the Company’s recently reprocessed and interpreted 3-D seismic data. With the second drilling rig, Condor plans to drill an initial vertical well through the top of the structure to confirm current mapping, collect modern wireline and core data, and provide test rates. This will be followed by a pad-style horizontal development drilling program targeting three reservoirs with up to six horizontal wells. A second pad location is also envisioned to develop this structure as it represents material undeveloped volumes. Up to twelve wells in total are planned to be drilled in 2026 with the two rigs to accelerate gas production volumes.

Installation of field compression remains a top priority for the Company in 2026. Engineering design for the first phase of field compression (“Phase 1”) has been completed, and the procurement process has commenced. Phase 1 compression will increase gas production by reducing the well’s back pressure and mitigate the negative impact of fluctuating and increasing gas sales line pressure. Simulation work conducted by an independent third-party engineering company indicates compression will yield over 20 MMscf/day of incremental gas production with the reduction of well back pressure and lost production due to increasing gas sales line pressure. The field compression facility is scheduled to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2026. Actual results may differ as described below in the Business Risks and

[TITLE]South Bow Reports Third-quarter 2025 Results, Provides 2026 Outlook, and Declares Dividend:
[TEXT]
CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- South Bow Corp. (TSX & NYSE: SOBO) (South Bow or the Company) reports its third-quarter 2025 financial and operational results and provides its 2026 outlook. Unless otherwise noted, all financial figures in this news release are in U.S. dollars.

Highlights

Safety and operational performance

Recorded average throughput of approximately 584,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) on the Keystone Pipeline in the third quarter of 2025, and approximately 703,000 bbl/d on the U.S. Gulf Coast segment of the Keystone Pipeline System. Throughput on the Keystone Pipeline and the U.S. Gulf Coast segment of the Keystone Pipeline System averaged approximately 580,000 bbl/d and approximately 730,000 bbl/d, respectively, during the first nine months of 2025.

Achieved mechanical completion for the Blackrod Connection Project and placed the 25-km natural gas lateral into commercial service. Final facility activities are currently underway, and the project remains on schedule to be placed into service in early 2026. Associated cash flows are expected to increase throughout the second half of 2026 and into 2027.

Continued to advance remedial actions relating to the incident that occurred at Milepost 171 (MP-171) of the Keystone Pipeline, including completing six in-line inspections and 37 integrity digs to date. See "Milepost 171 incident" of this news release for additional details.

Financial performance

Delivered stable financial results in the third quarter of 2025 due to the Company's strong commercial underpinnings. Generated revenue of $461 million and net income of $93 million ($0.45/share). Recorded normalized earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (normalized EBITDA) 1 of $254 million, representing a 2% increase from the second quarter of 2025 due to higher contributions from maintenance capital expenditures for system integrity projects on the Keystone Pipeline System, offset by expected losses in the Marketing segment. Reported distributable cash flow 1 2 of $236 million, representing an increase of $69 million from the second quarter of 2025, driven primarily by changes in U.S. tax legislation and South Bow's tax optimization efforts.

South Bow's board of directors (the Board) approved a quarterly dividend of $0.50/share, payable on Jan. 15, 2026, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 31, 2025. The dividends will be designated as eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes.

Corporate updates

South Bow expects to complete the transition to its new supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system in the fourth quarter of 2025, the final significant item in exiting the Transition Services Agreement (TSA) with TC Energy Corporation (TC Energy) as it relates to the spinoff transaction (the Spinoff).

In early October, South Bow and associated parties mutually agreed to withdraw all complaints and protests relating to the variable toll disputes filed with the Canada Energy Regulator, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Court of King's Bench of Alberta, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. As part of the Separation Agreement between South Bow and TC Energy, TC Energy indemnified South Bow for matters that existed prior to the Spinoff. Following the withdrawal of the variable toll disputes, South Bow reached its maximum indemnity liability of $22 million.

The Board has approved South Bow's 2026 budget, which is focused on strengthening the Company's financial position, maturing and executing a portfolio of organic and inorganic growth opportunities, and delivering strong and sustainable returns to shareholders. Normalized EBITDA is projected to be approximately $1.03 billion, within a range of 2%, with approximately 90% secured through committed arrangements. See "2026 guidance" of this news release for additional details.

Milepost 171 incident

Following the MP-171 incident, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued a Corrective Action Order (CAO) requiring South Bow to undertake corrective actions, including operating under pressure restrictions for specific segments of the pipeline.

Total costs relating to the incident, estimated at approximately $55 million, are largely expected to be recovered through the Company's insurance policies by early 2026. As of Sept. 30, 2025, South Bow has received approximately $16 million in reimbursements under its insurance policies.

The timing of PHMSA's expected release of the independent third-party root cause analysis (RCA) has been impacted by the U.S. federal government shutdown.

Initial findings

According to the mechanical and metallurgical analysis, both the pipe and welds conformed to industry standards for design, materials, and mechanical properties.

The failure resulted from a fatigue crack that originated along the pipe's manufactured long-seam weld.

Remedial actions

South Bow is actively progressing its remedial actions, with six in-line inspection runs and 37 integrity digs completed to date. Preliminary results indicate no injurious issues.

The in-line inspection process has been modified to address tool limitations by overlaying data from previous tool runs and implementing improvements in data analysis methods. South Bow will continue to work closely with its in-line inspection technology vendors to advance tool performance and validation, address and resolve tool limitations, and develop new technologies.

Additional in-line inspection tool runs and integrity digs are planned for 2025 and 2026 as part of South Bow's comprehensive program to address the findings and recommendations from the RCA investigation.

As part of PHMSA's CAO, South Bow is finalizing its remedial work plan to submit to the regulator for approval. This plan includes the corrective actions already completed. As South Bow conducts this remedial work, any findings will be incorporated into the plan and the Company's programs to enhance system integrity and ensure safe operations. South Bow is committed to maintaining transparency with its regulators, customers, and industry peers throughout this process.

Outlook

Market outlook

Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) crude oil supply is expected to grow modestly throughout 2026 and remain below available pipeline egress capacity, resulting in continued low demand for uncommitted capacity on the Keystone Pipeline.

Pricing differentials impacting the rates South Bow can charge for capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast segment of its Keystone Pipeline System are expected to remain tight throughout 2026.

[TITLE]Beijing Lures Private Investors to Reignite Infrastructure Growth:
[TEXT]
After decades of funding major infrastructure projects with state money, the Chinese government has zeroed in on private capital as a source of fresh cash for big projects in everything from transport to energy, to power generation, and drones.

In a new policy presented earlier this week, Beijing signaled private capital is now welcome in hydropower, nuclear power, oil and gas pipelines, and water supply, media reported, citing government officials.

“Private investment serves as a key barometer reflecting economic vitality and plays a crucial role in stabilizing growth, employment and expectations,” the deputy director of China’s National Development and Reform Commission said, as quoted by the South China Morning Post.

The changes introduced this week include a prescription for state entities leading projects in a number of areas to carry out a study of the feasibility of private investment for each of these projects. The areas include railways, hydropower, nuclear power, power transmission, oil and gas pipelines, liquefied natural gas import terminals and storage, and water supply.

“While encouraging private capital participation in key projects, we also equally support all types of market entities to participate, fostering complementary advantages and common development among diverse forms of ownership,” Guan Peng, deputy director of the Department of Fixed Asset Investment at the NDRC, said as quoted by China Daily.

To take better advantage of this barometer that can stabilize growth—recently uneven in the world’s biggest growth engine—the Chinese government has introduced changes in private company ownership limits in projects that fall within the scope of the new legislation. It has also prohibited the addition of extra conditions for private companies in public tenders on infrastructure projects.

Previously, private companies were not allowed to own a stake higher than 10% in such projects, but with the new rules, they would be able to do just that, after the strict rules led to an outflow of foreign investment over the past few years, Bloomberg noted in its report on the news. This year alone, foreign direct investment is down by 10%, the publication said.

With those limits, Chinese private companies have been reluctant to put their money into such projects, and this appears to have finally drawn the attention of the authorities. In fact, per the People’s Daily, the NDRC has been working to boost private capital participation in infrastructure projects for several years now, allowing private entities to take stakes as high as 20% in some projects, for instance, nuclear power.

These efforts have paid off, according to data for this year, which shows that private investment in infrastructure has gone up by 7%, even if overall it declined amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade offensive that had a special focus on China. However, private companies have been finding it harder to stay profitable, which was one big reason for the latest policy changes that aimed to boost their participation in infrastructure and energy projects.

The NDRC boasted it had recommended a grand total of 105 real estate investment trust infrastructure projects to the China Securities Regulatory Commission so far. The projects had raised a combined $29 billion since their listing and were expected to drive five times that amount in project investment.

“We will further improve regular communication mechanisms between government and enterprises, strengthen coordination, and solidly promote the implementation of the Private Economy Promotion Law to facilitate high-quality development of the private investment,” the deputy director of the NDPC’s Bureau of Private Economy, Ling Zhongguo, said as quoted by the People’s Daily.

Going forward, according to some of the reports on the new policy changes, the government would focus on drawing more private capital into energy projects, including everything from oil and gas to electricity transmission, highlighting yet again the significance of that sector.

[TITLE]Trump’s Energy Pushback Sends Shockwaves Through Wind Industry:
[TEXT]
The energy transition faces the biggest challenge yet as a global backlash against renewable energy – spearheaded by U.S. President Donald Trump – is gaining momentum, according to two of the European pioneers of wind turbine design.

President Trump’s views on wind energy and climate change are extreme, but they are symptomatic of a global shift in the perception of the need for and benefits from the energy transition, say Henrik Stiesdal and Andrew Garrad, a Dane and a Brit, who are often referred to as the “Godfathers of wind.”

“This sort of change is a very dangerous thing”

Stiesdal and Garrad have won the 2024 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering “for their achievements in advancing the design, manufacture and deployment of high-performance wind turbines, allowing wind energy to make a substantial contribution to the world’s electricity generation.”

Stiesdal was responsible for the turbine design for the world’s first offshore wind farm, while Garrad pioneered the BLADED computational design tool, which allows engineers to model a turbine system and predict its behavior.

After 40 years of helping the world develop wind energy, Stiesdal and Garrad are now concerned that the marked shift in perception of renewables, especially offshore wind energy, could hold back the rollout of clean energy technologies.

“Trump is symptomatic. I mean an extreme symptom of that, but you can see it I think in all Western countries certainly, perhaps not elsewhere,” Garrad told CNBC earlier this month, before being bestowed, together with Stiesdal, with the Queen Elizabeth Prize by King Charles III.

President Trump has slammed wind energy, rolled back or scrapped many Biden-era incentives for renewables, and has criticized other countries’ approach to energy policy, including the UK.

President Trump has repeatedly called for the UK to incentivize oil and gas production and “get rid of” wind farms.

At the UN General Assembly in September, the President went on the offensive and attacked clean energy globally, and called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” He derided renewable energy as ineffective, expensive, and a financial drag, calling it a “joke”.

President Trump also described windmills as “pathetic and so bad, so expensive to operate” before referring to them as “the most expensive energy ever conceived.”

The “Godfather of wind” Garrad noted that the backlash against wind energy is not “just a wind energy problem.”

“To do this sort of change is a very dangerous thing. And I think it has shown that this is a political business,” Garrad told CNBC.

“It’s a personal decision by a politician, who happens to be a rather powerful one — and it has sent shockwaves around the place.”

According to Garrad, the renewable energy industry now faces a general shift in mood, which needs to be addressed.

Costs Add to Headwinds

The unfavorable regulatory and political climate in Washington is one of the main hurdles to renewable energy and the energy transition. But it’s not the only one. Soaring costs, supply chain issues, high interest rates, power curtailments, and mismatches with grid availability and capacity have added to the headwinds in wind and solar energy in recent years.

Ørsted, the world’s largest offshore wind developer, has become this year the poster child of the current regulatory and structural issues facing the wind energy sector.

Ørsted has recently completed a huge rights issue equal to some $9.35 billion, to cover immediate financing needs amid regulatory uncertainties in the U.S., after the Trump Administration tried to have it stop work at a nearly completed project off the East Coast.

Faced with numerous headwinds, Ørsted last month said it would slash its workforce numbers by 2,000 by 2027, eliminating a quarter of its current roles.

Regulatory changes, cost inflation, and high interest rates have impacted project economics in the offshore wind industry in the past three years.

The economics weren’t fantastic even before 2022, but European oil and gas majors decided to invest in renewables when they announced shifts to net zero and targets to leave their oil production decline.

This shift lasted only a couple of years until energy security became more important—to every country—than sustainability. Big Oil abandoned the ambitious renewables targets and returned to what they do best—pump oil and gas to ensure the energy supply the world needs.

In one of the latest withdrawals, Shell this week exited two offshore wind power projects in Scotland as the world’s top oil and gas firms continue to scale back their investment and involvement in renewable energy.

Shell and the other European supermajor, BP, have shifted focus back to their core oil and gas business. The pivot took place after the energy crisis made energy security and affordability more important than sustainability, while high interest rates and supply chain issues further reduced already meager returns from clean energy projects and made many new energy ventures uncompetitive.

The most competitive projects still go forward, especially in jurisdictions with favorable policies, including China and Europe. Enthusiasm in Europe has waned but the need for domestically generated electricity without the reliance on gas imports underpins continued clean energy development.

The renewable energy industry now has to find its Goldilocks place between the overly zealous proponents and the opponents, branding it “pathetic”.

[TITLE]Offshore Pumped Hydro Could Solve Clean Energy's Biggest Problem:
[TEXT]
Sizable Energy, an Italian startup, proposes an ocean-based pumped hydro system using inflatable membranes and seawater to create a gravity-based storage solution that avoids land competition, offers flexible deployment, and provides an affordable, grid-stability option for coastal countries.

The world's transition to a net-zero future requires vast amounts of long-duration energy storage, a need that current lithium-ion batteries cannot fully meet because they can only store energy for a few hours.

The global energy storage sector is heating up to be “clean energy’s next trillion-dollar business.” As more nations around the world become increasingly reliant on renewable energies to power their grids and the AI boom pushes clean energy expansion as part of an all-the-above approach to ramping up energy production as fast as possible, energy storage is becoming an increasingly critical component of energy security at local, national, and global scales. Researchers have estimated that a net-zero energy future will require a whopping 6TWh of energy storage.

At present, the energy storage sector is powered by lithium-ion batteries. Lithium supply chains are well established, and the material is affordable while boasting a high energy efficiency rate that performs well in a wide range of temperatures. Major EV companies like Tesla have been increasingly devoting their money and attention to building up energy storage branches as storage has become a more lucrative and stable option. The scale of these lithium-ion battery packs has also been growing rapidly, with mega-batteries gaining serious territory in markets and on the ground.

But while lithium-ion batteries are nearly ubiquitous and have some key advantages, they alone will not be sufficient to maintain energy security and grid stability as the world increasingly electrifies. Even the biggest and baddest lithium-ion battery megapacks can only store energy for up to

[TITLE]Making Sense of the World Energy Outlook:
[TEXT]
The report contains multiple, diverging scenarios, with ambiguity around the assumptions behind each one. As a result, advocates on all sides are predictably declaring the report either a welcome reality check on overconfidence in the clean energy transition or proof that the transition is unstoppable. The truth, as usual, lies somewhere in between. Perpetually rising oil and gas demand should not be seen as the status quo, but neither should a faster transition be seen as inevitable. Much will depend on how countries view the national security implications of clean energy.

World leaders gathered in Belém, Brazil this week for the annual United Nations climate summit to confront a sobering reality: Global emissions from fossil fuels are set to reach a new high in 2025, the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels is out of reach , and the United States did not even bother to show up. Against this backdrop, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released its flagship World Energy Outlook, making headlines for including a scenario in which oil demand continues to climb through 2050.

World leaders gathered in Belém, Brazil this week for the annual United Nations climate summit to confront a sobering reality: Global emissions from fossil fuels are set to reach a new high in 2025, the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels is out of reach, and the United States did not even bother to show up. Against this backdrop, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released its flagship World Energy Outlook, making headlines for including a scenario in which oil demand continues to climb through 2050.

The report contains multiple, diverging scenarios, with ambiguity around the assumptions behind each one. As a result, advocates on all sides are predictably declaring the report either a welcome reality check on overconfidence in the clean energy transition or proof that the transition is unstoppable. The truth, as usual, lies somewhere in between. Perpetually rising oil and gas demand should not be seen as the status quo, but neither should a faster transition be seen as inevitable. Much will depend on how countries view the national security implications of clean energy.

Reporting on the new World Energy Outlook has been understandably muddled because it is difficult to parse the assumptions in the IEA’s two main scenarios—one based on countries’ current policies and another that also incorporates their stated, in other words proposed, policies. As a result, headlines have resorted to saying oil demand “could” rise through 2050—not a particularly helpful insight for anyone assessing probabilities.

Under current policies, oil demand climbs from 100 million barrels per day to 113 million barrels per day by 2050; under stated policies, it peaks near 102 million by 2030 before gradually declining. Another scenario outlines what would be required to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, a goal for which the world remains far off track.

So where is the world most likely headed? The current policies scenario (CPS) offers a static view of policy and technology that assumes no changes to laws already on the books and slower adoption of new technologies—not just relative to the stated policies scenario (STEPS) but to recent experience. STEPS, by contrast, assumes a more dynamic outlook: that governments implement announced intentions but not achieve every aspiration or target.

The differences can be subtle. In the IEA’s 2025 current policy scenario, for example, improvements in fuel economy in Japan stop once a 2030 target in regulation is achieved, while STEPS assumes Japan will gradually strengthen the policy beyond 2030.

Judgment calls are unavoidable. The IEA assumes, for example, that the European Union will implement its 100 million euro ($117 million) plan for industrial decarbonization, but not achieve its implausible goal of producing 10 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2030. It places far greater confidence in China’s ability to carry out its national energy plan—a judgment supported by recent history.

The IEA warns that labeling current policy as “business as usual” is “misleading.” Past CPS projections have repeatedly underestimated the dynamism of both policy and technology. For example, the IEA’s last CPS, produced in 2019, significantly underestimated how fast renewable energy would grow—and coal growth as well.

Which scenario is more plausible depends on which assumptions one finds most credible. Believing the IEA’s projection of rising oil demand through 2050 would require assuming that electric vehicle deployment barely expands outside China and the EU, that alternative technologies stagnate despite plummeting costs and surging investment, or that the world remains complacent

Electricity demand will rise much faster than overall energy growth in the coming decades, underscoring the need for diversified energy sources, according to an analysis released Wednesday.

The report by the International Energy Agency said renewable energy, led by solar power, will grow faster than any other major source in the next few years. One scenario the agency anticipates is coal and oil demand peaking globally by the end of this decade — but the group also said global oil and gas demand could continue growing until 2050. The report noted that many natural gas projects were approved in 2025, due to changes in U.S. policy, indicating worldwide supply will rise even as questions remain

[TITLE]Ireland has blown its first carbon budget target:
[TEXT]
IRELAND HAS FAILED to achieve its emissions reductions target set under the first carbon budget cycle, according to the Climate Change Advisory Council.

In 2022, the Dáil signed off on legally binding carbon budgets that allocate a set volume of emissions Ireland is allowed to produce in five-year cycles.

The amounts decrease over time and were intended to act as a ceiling on the emissions Ireland can afford to produce and still be able to reach important climate targets in 2030 and 2050.

The first carbon budget cycle, which covered the years 2021 to 2025, allowed for a total of 295 million tonnes (Mt) of emissions to be produced.

In its review, the Council said the country will overshoot this by

[TITLE]The EPC Partnership Paradigm: How Smart Collaboration and Digital Tools Are Driving New Delivery Models:
[TEXT]
Traditional owner-EPC relationships relied on sequenced approvals and risk allocation tied to project maturity. Today’s interdependent infrastructure, including for the grid, generation, storage, and transmission, requires simultaneous optimization of design, procurement, and construction decisions. That is fundamentally changing how contracts are structured and teams are organized.

As the U.S. power infrastructure landscape evolves, the relationship between utilities and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firms is also beginning a transformation. Compared to past decades, where project owners finalized design, secured permits, and then solicited fixed-price bids, new models are prioritizing integrated, risk-transparent partnerships driven by real-time data, collaborative planning, and portfolio-level coordination. The transformation appears to be underpinned by a simple but profound insight: Power projects of the 2020s demand simultaneous optimization—of design, procurement, construction, and operations—across multiple assets and stakeholders.

At the core of the shift are fundamental supply chain disruptions, such as transformer and turbine lead times stretching several years, compounded by workforce scarcity, permitting challenges, and utility infrastructure constraints. At the same time, the demand imperative remains acute: U.S. data center electricity demand could double to 409 TWh by 2030, with artificial intelligence (AI) as a prime driver, according to an October 2025 Bain & Company analysis. Bain notes that hyperscalers are under extraordinary time pressure. Meta, for example, is building gigawatt-scale AI campuses like Richland Parish in 24 to 36 months, and phased commissioning could bring some mission-critical zones online in well under three years. Industry-wide, standard timelines for new data centers now range from 18 to 30 months for most greenfield builds, though permitting, power connection, and equipment procurement could extend those durations by a year or more when hurdles arise.

These converging pressures appear to be redefining risk, including who bears it and when. Under traditional lump-sum contracts, EPCs assumed nearly all financial risk, and while owners locked scope, schedule, and price, contractors either delivered or absorbed losses. But in a market where equipment lead times exceed project timelines by years, and where labor scarcity and supply volatility are structural realities, that model is looking less attractive. At the 2025 EPC Show in Houston, EPC leadership publicly acknowledged a growing shift away from fixed-price delivery toward collaborative, transparent cost-sharing models.

Essentially, they explained, when contractors can no longer price risks that have become uninsurable—supply volatility, multi-year equipment lead times, or constrained labor—the burden inevitably shifts upstream. Some are looking at more amenable contracting models, including progressive design-build, reimbursable with pain/gain share, and open-book transparency, which distribute risk. So, for example, instead of locking in a lump-sum price that conceals exposure until change orders pile up, owners are accepting greater scope definition and cost-escalation risk earlier in exchange for realistic cost visibility and speed. What appears to be emerging is a pragmatic partnership model, where owners carry the financial exposure tied to procurement and schedule compression, while EPCs retain performance and execution risk within a clearly defined scope.

Why Early Engagement Works for Utilities: The Demand Certainty Advantage

At least for now, utilities are embracing early EPC engagement because binding customer agreements now shape project economics. American Electric Power (AEP), for example, reports 28 GW of incremental load growth under executed letters of agreement (LOAs) and electric-service agreements (EASs),
