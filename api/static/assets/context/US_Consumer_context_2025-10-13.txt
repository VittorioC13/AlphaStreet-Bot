[TITLE]Billionaire Jon Stryker Buys Three 445 Fifth Avenue Retail Condos for $22M – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Billionaire philanthropist Jon Stryker, an heir to the Stryker Corporation medical tech company fortune, now owns the entire commercial portion of a Fifth Avenue building following a recent deal.

Stryker, through the entity 445 5th Retail, has purchased three retail condominium units at 445 Fifth Avenue from Torchlight Investors, which used the entity DOF VI 445 Fifth, for $21.6 million, according to city records made public Friday.

Mark O’Donnell, who has done nonprofit work with Stryker in the past, signed the deal for the buyer, while Gianluca Montalti, head of asset management at Torchlight, signed for the seller, records show.

It’s unclear who brokered the deal. Spokespeople for the Arcus Foundation — Stryker’s international grantmaking organization — Torchlight, and Ripco Real Estate, which is marketing the building’s retail space, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Torchlight originally acquired the retail units at 445 Fifth Avenue for $40 million in September 2023, property records show. Current tenants of the property’s retail units include design agency Brickworks Design Studio in 16,171 square feet as well as cafe Toastique.

With the latest deal, Stryker now owns all 11 commercial condo units in the 33-story tower overlooking Bryant Park, which also has 174 residential units on the top floors, according to StreetEasy.

The billionaire began buying in the building in 2019 on floors eight and nine for

[TITLE]Bitcoin News: Hargreaves Lansdown Will Be Offering Clients Access to Crypto ETNs in 2026:
[TEXT]
Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the UK’s largest retail investment platforms, has warned that bitcoin should not be treated as a core part of investment portfolios — even as it prepares to offer crypto products to clients for the first time.

In a statement published on its website, the Bristol-based firm said bitcoin, despite its long-term price gains, “is not an asset class” and lacks the intrinsic characteristics that would justify including it in a portfolio for growth or income.

[TITLE]Festive season pricing not a race to the bottom: Libas’ Nisha Khatri:
[TEXT]
Indian wear brand Libas has recast itself as an ultra-fast-fashion brand targeting Gen Z customers. This strategic positioning has fundamentally changed how the brand crafts its marketing strategy, according to Nisha Khatri, head of marketing at Libas.

Khatri notes that, unlike traditional ethnic wear brands, Libas does not produce seasonal collections. Instead, its ultra-fast model involves launching a new campaign every month.

[TITLE]ED offers Flipkart to close FEMA violation case by paying penalty, admitting mistake:
[TEXT]
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is learnt to have offered the option of closing a FEMA violation case against e-commerce major Flipkart if the Walmart group firm admits its mistake and pays a penalty, sources aware of the development said.

The option was given by the Enforcement Directorate to Flipkart last week under the compounding rules of FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act).

"ED has given the option of compounding to Flipkart. ED has asked Flipkart to admit its mistake, pay a penalty and dismantle the seller network associated with it," a source told PTI.

An email query sent to Flipkart elicited no reply.

The ED had also summoned Amazon India to check the status of the company.

When contacted, an Amazon India spokesperson said, "We do not comment on ongoing investigations..

A query sent to ED in this matter also received no response.

An official of one of the e-commerce firms, on condition of anonymity, said that the compounding option given by ED is to strengthen India's negotiating power during the ongoing bilateral trade negotiation with the US.

The compounding rules allow companies to voluntarily admit breach of the provision under the FEMA and settle the case by paying a penalty for the contraventions without undergoing lengthy enforcement actions.

Flipkart and Amazon India have been under ED scrutiny for alleged breach of FEMA provisions.

There have been allegations that these companies are pushing discounts on their platform to garner sales.

The ED had first issued a show cause notice to Flipkart, related firms and individuals in July 2021, seeking its reply as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015.

The notice was related to the period between 2009 and 2015, before the majority stake in Flipkart was acquired by the US major Walmart.

Walmart had acquired a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018.

ED has also served notice to Flipkart even after acquisition by Walmart for investigation in its business after 2016 as well.

The most recent notice was served to the company in April this year.

The Competition Commission of India is also conducting an investigation against Flipkart regarding alleged competition law violations by certain subsidiaries of Flipkart in India and other parties.

In September 2024, a non-confidential version of the CCI DG's Investigation Report was received by one of the Flipkart subsidiaries that alleged certain competition law violations.

[TITLE]This startup wants to make your iPhone 17 and S25 Ultra affordable with a new ‘smart ‘ownership’ model:
[TEXT]
Before buying a new flagship smartphone, one of the first things consumers in India look for is whether the device can be purchased through easy monthly installments (EMIs) spread over 12 months or more. This strategy has worked in favour of phone brands and the ecosystem players contributing to the rise in the adoption of high-end, premium smartphones in the world’s most populous country. In the recent quarters, the share of premium smartphones has registered the highest growth of 96.4 per cent in India, as per the data from International Data Corporation (IDC).

While it is already possible to buy flagship smartphones through accessibility schemes, a startup called BytePe, founded by a former Flipkart executive, aims to reduce the cost of EMIs even further by offering options to upgrade or retain smartphones, drastically cutting the cost of EMIs compared to standard EMIs.

“If you are buying a product today, you typically pay 100 per cent of its value upfront. Now, maybe a year or two down the line, if you stop using it, there’s still a left out value in that product. What we have done is build a proprietary model that predicts the lifecycle value of a product. This model works seamlessly with existing financing instruments, whether it’s a credit card or our own lending ecosystem,” said Jayant Jha, Founder & CEO of BytePe, explaining the rationale behind India’s first subscription-based smartphone service.
