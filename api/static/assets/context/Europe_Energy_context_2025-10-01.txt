[TITLE]Nayara Energy Adapts to EU Sanctions With Rupee Oil Payments:
[TEXT]
Nayara Energy, the Indian refiner that was slapped with EU sanctions because of its partial ownership by Rosneft, has started to recover from the blow, turning to payments in rupees for the oil it sources from the Russian company.

Bloomberg reported that Nayara had sought help from the Indian government and was currently working with local banks, including the State Bank of India, to pay for its crude oil purchases in local currency, according to unnamed sources.

Nayara Energy accounts for some 8% of India’s total refining capacity. It operates a 400,000-bpd refinery in Vadinar, which is the second-largest in the country. The facility is 49% owned by Russia’s Rosneft. Currently, the Vadinar facility is operating at 75% of capacity, and the level is rising, one of the Bloomberg sources told the publication.

The European Union included Nayara Energy in its 18th sanction package against Russia, announced in July. The sanctions disrupted the refinery’s operations, stranding tankers carrying fuels produced at the refinery en route to their destinations and prompting cancellations of purchase orders for the facility. That’s despite the fact that Nayara Energy was not really exporting any fuels to the European Union. Its main market in Europe was the UK, which has not adopted special sanctions against the company.

Meanwhile, Saudi Aramco and Iraq’s state oil marketing company SOMO stopped selling crude oil to the Nayara Energy refinery following the approval of the EU’s 18th sanction package. As a result, the refinery has boosted its intake of Russian Urals.

Also as a result of the sanctions, Nayara Energy has increased its focus on the domestic market. The company supplies more than 6,500 fuel stations in India, per Bloomberg, and has started selling more to a fellow refiner, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Nayara Energy has started loading more crude into floating storage and using tankers under Western sanctions to export its fuels.

[TITLE]US ‘ready to displace’ all Russian gas and oil in EU – energy secretary:
[TEXT]
Moscow has said American LNG would be much more expensive for European consumers

The US stands ready to substitute all Russian gas and oil going to the EU, Energy Secretary Chris Wright has claimed, arguing that market hegemony for America would help end the Ukraine conflict.

In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Wright praised the bloc for its efforts to phase out Russian energy but said it is “not as fast as we’d like.”

“America stands ready today to displace all of the Russian gas that goes into Europe and all of the Russian refined products from oil as well,” Wright said. He added that he had been holding extensive talks with EU leaders to reassure them that this is feasible.

”We’re ready to serve their needs. And President [Donald] Trump’s agenda is peace. And to get peace, we have to starve [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” Wright claimed, referring to revenues from energy exports.

The EU has said it will seek to wean itself off Russian energy following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, and plans to end imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) by the end of 2027. Wright, however, said the US could act “much faster” to replace it.

Bloc members Hungary and Slovakia, however, have pushed back against plans to cut energy ties with Russia, citing their heavy reliance on supplies from the country and the fact that their infrastructure is built around receiving Russian energy.

Wright’s push comes as Trump has pressured the EU, India, and China to stop procuring Russian oil, describing the move as an effort to advance a potential Ukraine peace settlement. Moscow has criticized the effort, saying that sovereign nations have the right to choose their trade partners.

Russia has also argued that the EU’s tilt to pricier LNG is hitting consumers. “This has placed an additional burden on [European] budgets and, in turn, on the pockets of their taxpayers,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

The EU and Indonesia have concluded talks on a free-trade deal that includes zero tariffs on palm oil exports from the South East Asian country.

The draft agreement, described by EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič as “a game-changer for both our economies”, removes Indonesia’s duties on certain EU agri-food products.

EU farming lobby groups Copa and Cogeca welcomed the deal, which will head to the European Council and European Parliament for approval.

However, the zero-tariff rate on Indonesian palm oil has attracted criticism in campaign circles.

Under the agreement, palm oil from Indonesia will face zero tariffs within a defined quota. EU tariffs on all palm oil imports range up to 12.8%. Much of Indonesia’s palm oil shipments to the EU already face a 0% tariff, Just Food understands.

The EU said the so-called Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, announced yesterday (23 September), includes a “protocol” on palm oil, “geared towards maximising the potential of CEPA to support trade in sustainable palm oil”.

[TITLE]Tata Steel gets Dutch backing for €2 billion green transition:
[TEXT]
Tata Steel Netherlands (TSN) has secured up to €2 billion in funding support from the Dutch government, marking a major step in the steelmaker’s plan to transition operations towards low-carbon and sustainable steel production.

The Indian steelmaker signed a non-binding agreement with the government of Netherlands to transition to low-carbon steelmaking and cleaner operations at the IJmuiden plant. Both parties will keep working on the final tailor-made agreement in the coming months, including after the Dutch elections and the formation of the new government.

“There are a lot of issues to resolve and work to be done before us," said T.V. Narendran, chief executive officer of Tata Steel. “We would like to thank Minister Hermans, her colleagues in the Cabinet and the team from the Netherlands Government and from the province of North-Holland who have engaged constructively and painstakingly with us over the last 2 years to complete this first step in our journey towards creating a sustainable long-term future for Tata Steel Nederland," Narendran said in a company statement late Monday.

After grant

The latest support follows the £500 million grant provided by the UK government in 2024 for its £1.25 billion green steel project in the UK's Port Talbot. Tata Steel came to own both Port Talbot in the UK and the IJmuiden plant in the Netherlands as part of its 2007 acquisition of Corus Steel in Europe.

TSN has also applied for

[TITLE]Netherland to commit €2 bn to Tata Steel decarbonisation project:
[TEXT]
The Dutch government has agreed to provide €2 billion in support for Tata SteelNetherlands’ (TSN) decarbonisation project.

Additionally, TSN has made an application to the EU Innovation Fund for €0.3 billion. The remaining amount is expected to be funded by a combination of cash generated and contributed by Tata Steel Nederland, as well as debt and funding procured by Tata Steel.

The deal was part of extensive discussions among the Government of the Netherlands, the province of North Holland, Tata Steel, and Tata Steel Nederland.

Non-binding pact signed for transition

The company and the government have agreed on an intended framework for the integrated project in TSN and signed a non-binding Joint Letter of Intent for the first phase of transitioning to low CO2 steel production and improving the healthy living environment around the IJmuiden site.

TSN has not yet completed the full engineering of the integrated project and therefore has not finalised the total spend.

The capital expenditure spend and phasing will be finalised at the stage of signing the tailor-made agreement, with investment spread over several years, the company said.

CEO Narendran on long-term roadmap

TV Narendran, CEO & Managing Director of Tata Steel and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Tata Steel Nederland, said the outcome was achieved after two years of discussions to complete the first step in the journey towards creating a sustainable, long-term future for Tata Steel Nederland.

There are a lot of issues to resolve and work to be done before the company.

This includes work to do internally, including the completion of the engineering preparedness and addressing statutory and regulatory aspects related to the coke and gas plants, he added.

It also involves external issues including satisfactory resolution of critical policy matters impacting the investment case, obtaining permits and agreeing on detailed terms in the binding agreement, before proceeding to investment decision, said Narendran.

“We are also closely monitoring the policy developments in the EU on CBAM and in the Dutch Parliament regarding the challenges of the 2030 CO2 reduction targets. We are also looking at prioritisation, optimisation and sequencing of the capex spend such that it is affordable for all stakeholders,” he added.

Tata Steel Nederland has been working to ensure it is ready by improving its financial and operating performance and becoming as one of the most competitive steel making sites in Europe, he said.

The company’s Unions have supported the transition project and their continued support is essential to secure a robust sustainable future for TSN, he added.

New DRP and EAF to cut emission

Through the first phase, TSN aims to de-commission the existing Blast Furnace 7 and Coke and Gas Plant 2 and construct a DRP intended to initially be operational on natural gas and an EAF with increased scrap-intake.

This will reduce annual scope 1 CO2 emissions by 5.4 Mta relative to the as-is maximum of 12.6 Mta.

[TITLE]Environmental damage threatens prosperity in Europe – DW – 09:
[TEXT]
Despite progress in climate change action, Europe's environment is being seriously degraded, according to a new report. Researchers say environmental damage threatens competitiveness and quality of life on the continent.

Europe’s environment is struggling, according to a report released Tuesday by the European Environment Agency (EEA).

The report found that nature in Europe is facing levels of degradation, overexploitation and biodiversity loss that pose a direct threat to European stability, security and living standards.

Released every five years by the Copenhagen-based EU agency, the report is the most comprehensive assessment of the environment, climate and sustainability in the region.

Despite progress in areas such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the ramping up of renewable energy, the report found that the overall state of Europe's environment is "not good".

EU officials said the report was a stark reminder of the importance of maintaining and strengthening green policies and ambitions.

"Delaying or postponing our climate targets would only increase costs, deepen inequalities and weaken our resilience," said Teresa Ribera, the European Commission's executive vice president for "a clean, just and competitive transition." She said protecting nature was an investment in competitiveness and the well-being of people in Europe.

Biodiversity and ecosystem decline set to continue

Unsustainable production and consumption patterns driven by the food system are leading to a decline in biodiversity across land and water in Europe. An estimated 80% of protected habitats are in a poor or bad state, and 60-70% of soils are degraded.

This downward trend is on track to continue, with the report stating that the EU's nature restoration targets for 2030 were unlikely to be met.

Water resources in the European Union are also under "severe pressure," with water stress currently affecting

[TITLE]Port Talbot, one year on: steelworks closure shows why public is losing trust in net zero:
[TEXT]
The rolling mills are still working, but the furnaces are long cold. Of the 4,000 people previously employed at the steel mill in Port Talbot, Wales, only half still work there. Despite union protests and local rallies, one year ago on September 30 2024, the plant’s last coal-burning blast furnace was shut down.

This ended more than a century of steelmaking in the UK’s biggest plant – one of the largest in Europe. The owner, Tata Steel, blamed high energy prices and competition from cheaper Chinese steel, claiming ongoing losses of around £1 million a day. It warned the plant would close entirely unless the UK government stepped in to help replace its ageing furnaces with lower-emissions electric arc furnaces.

Steel manufacture contributes around 7% of global climate emissions, and Port Talbot alone accounted for 1.5% of the UK total. Faced with the choice between the closure of the mill and supporting its transition to greener production, the government committed £500 million to this transition.

Tata Steel then announced 2,800 job losses – around one in ten jobs in the town of 35,000. Up to 9,500 more could be lost in the supply chain and broader sector.

This is not how successive governments have sold the transition to a net zero economy. Both Labour and the Conservatives promised net zero would create skilled, well-paid work that would not only make up for losses elsewhere, but generate economic growth and lower bills.

Ben Birchall / PA

Some data suggests they were right: the UK’s net zero sector is growing far faster than the rest of the economy at 10% per year, and already supports close to 700,000 jobs.

However, polling shows only

[TEXT]
EDF announces the success of its green hybrid bond issue for a nominal amount of 1.25 billion euros

EDF (BBB positive S&P / Baa1 stable Moody’s / BBB+ stable Fitch) successfully priced a new issuance of green perpetual subordinated notes (the “New Notes”) of €1.25 billion bond, at an initial 4.375% coupon until 2031 with a 5.5-year first call date at EDF’s discretion.

This transaction enables EDF to finance its strategy and objective to contribute to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. An amount equal to the net proceeds of the New Notes will be used to finance and/or refinance investments as defined in EDF’s Green Financing Framework (1) and aligned with the European taxonomy in relation to the lifetime extension of the existing nuclear reactors in France. As a reminder, the carbon intensity of nuclear power plants in France is 4gCO²/kWh (2).

It is expected that the rating agencies will assign the New Notes a rating of B+/Ba1/ /BBB- (S&P/ Moody’s/Fitch) and an equity content of 50%.

Settlement and delivery will take place on 6 October 2025, the date on which the New Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris.

EDF is an active issuer of debt and other types of securities. EDF regularly assesses its financing requirements and monitors national and international financial markets for opportunities to conduct additional issuances of senior debt, hybrids and/or other types of securities.

Claude Laruelle, Group Senior Executive Vice President in charge of the Performance, Impact, Investment and Finance of EDF, said "this transaction demonstrates the confidence of the market in EDF’s strategy to promote energy sovereignty and energy transition".

[TITLE]BMW Group’s newest, most innovative production site officially opens in Debrecen:
[TEXT]
Debrecen. With an impressive ceremony that artistically combined Hungarian culture and modern automotive production, Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, today officially opened the BMW Group plant in Debrecen. The BMW Group’s newest and most innovative production site marks the beginning of a new era for the company. In late October, the new BMW iX3 will enter series production in the Hungarian university town of Debrecen as the first vehicle of the Neue Klasse. Plant Debrecen was planned virtually and realised in practice fully in line with the principles of the BMW iFACTORY, becoming the first BMW Group car plant to rely entirely on electricity from renewable energy during normal operation.

In addition to Oliver Zipse, high-ranking representatives from Hungarian politics, such as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the Mayor of Debrecen, László Papp, as well as Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management for Production, Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management for Human Resources and Real Estate, and Hans-Peter Kemser, President and CEO BMW Manufacturing Hungary Kft., attended the grand opening.

“In our global production network, our new plant in Debrecen is a pioneer: It is our first fully-electric plant, the first production site to operate entirely without fossil fuels – and the first to build vehicles for the Neue Klasse. This makes our plant in Debrecen a decisive factor in the BMW Group's future success,” said Oliver Zipse. “The opening also sends a strong signal: We are expanding our footprint on our home continent and reaffirming our commitment to Europe as a strong and competitive location for industry.”

Hans-Peter Kemser added at the ceremony: “This is not only a new BMW Group plant – it is a cornerstone of progress. We are a partner to culture, to education and to the University of Debrecen, where together we foster the talents that will shape the future. And above all, it is a community – deeply embedded in the life of Debrecen and Hungary.”

Strengthening the industrial base and expanding training

The official opening ceremony began with a look back at the plant’s construction, following a 2018 decision that launched one of Hungary’s largest greenfield investments. The BMW Group’s first Central European location has firmly placed Debrecen on the region's automotive map, creating more than 2,000 direct jobs – and many more along the supply chain, at regional suppliers and service providers that have recently established themselves in Debrecen, alongside national and international companies. The new plant has also strengthened the industrial park and driven additional investment in transport and infrastructure.

At the same time, through collaborations with institutions such as the local university and the Vocational Training Centre of Debrecen, DSZC, Plant Debrecen has also become one of the largest training hubs for dual education programmes in Hungary.

Only the best of the best for Debrecen

Plant Debrecen is the first BMW Group production site not tied to a specific primary plant. Instead, it serves as a network plant, combining best practices from different locations worldwide. For example, the press shop is modelled on the systems used in Spartanburg (USA) and Swindon (Great Britain), with their know-how and technologies further refined for Debrecen. In the body shop, the positioning of nearly 1,000 industrial robots, along with their processes, was digitally simulated in detail beforehand. The number of joining methods was also significantly reduced, with further streamlining allowing design features for the Neue Klasse to be integrated early in development.

Paint shop key to largest reduction in CO 2 e emissions

At BMW Group Plant Debrecen, the paint shop plays a critical role in significantly reducing the BMW iX3’s CO 2 e footprint. Production of the new BMW iX3 will generate a total of

[TITLE]Effect and mechanism of digital infrastructure impacts the urban synergistic reduction of pollutant and carbon emissions:
[TEXT]
Baseline regression analysis

Table 2 displays the estimation results for model (1). Column (1) shows that when no control variables are added, the regression coefficient of DI on SRPCE is significantly positive. Column (2) adds control variables on the basis of column (1), and the result is still significant. These results suggest that DI has a significant promoting effect on SRPCE by 5.2%. The regression results support Hypothesis 1.

Table 2 Baseline regression results. Full size table

Robustness check

Benchmark regression results indicate that DI significantly contributes to promote the effect of SRPCE. To further test the robustness of this conclusion, this study conducts robustness tests in four areas: using the instrumental variable method, excluding extreme values, replacing the explained variable, and replacing the explanatory variable.

This study investigates the impact of city-level DI on the SRPCE. There may be bias in the results due to omitted variables from unobservable factors. Therefore, to alleviate endogeneity problems arising from omitted variables, this study follows the practice of Peng et al. and sets the instrumental variable as the interactive items between the number of Internet users nationwide and the number of landline telephones per 100 people in each city in 198428. Table 3 shows that the coefficient of the instrumental variable (IV) on DI (DI) in the first stage of least squares estimation is remarkably positive at the 1% level, showing a significant relationship between the number of fixed telephones and DI in 1984. This positive correlation satisfies the correlation condition of instrumental variables.

In the second stage, after addressing the endogeneity problem, the coefficient of DI (DI) on the index of SRPCE (Y) was found to be 0.279 and satisfied the remarkable test at the 1% level. This result indicates that DI has significantly promoted the effect of SRPCE. Additionally, the p-value of the LM statistic in the second stage is 0.000, and the F statistic is significantly higher than the Stock-Yogo critical value at the 10% level, confirming that the test for weak identification of instrumental variables was passed.

Table 3 Instrumental variable method regression results. Full size table

To eradicate the effect of extreme values and outliers in the data, this study removes the top and bottom 1% of the explanatory and explained variables before regression. The regression consequences are shown in column (1) of Table 4. After removing outliers, the coefficient estimates for DI all passed the significance test at the 1% level. This conclusion is consistent with the baseline estimation results, showing that the regression consequences are robust.

Following the approach of Zhang B, sulfur dioxide emissions are used to replace pollutant emissions71. These are then coupled with carbon dioxide emissions, and the newly obtained the index of SRPCE is regressed on DI. The estimation results are displayed in column (2) of Table 4. In the estimation results, the coefficient of DI is 0.032 and passes the significance test at the 10% level, indicating that DI significantly promotes the effect of SRPCE. Therefore, the benchmark analysis results are reliable.

Following the practice of Yang Y, this study selects the number of Internet and mobile phone users per hundred people, the proportion of computer and software employees, per capita Internet broadband access ports and telecommunications business revenue, and long-distance optical cable density as DI measurement indicators, using the entropy method to calculate the index72, the above datas are from China Urban Statistical Yearbook. The results obtained after regression are presented in column (3) of Table 4. The coefficient of DI is significantly positive, indicating that after replacing the explanatory variables, DI has a positive impact on SRPCE. The promoting effect of synergy remains consistent, thus demonstrating that the results of the baseline regression are robust.

Table 4 Robustness test results. Full size table

Mechanism analysis

This study adopts the mediation effect model to further analyze the promoting effect of DI on SRPCE. Table 5 indicates that the regression coefficient between DI and the energy efficiency index in column (2) is highly remarkable at the 1% level, demonstrating that DI has significantly improved energy efficiency. In column (1), the regression coefficients of both DI and energy efficiency on SRPCE are significantly positive. This result indicates that DI can enhance energy efficiency, further promoting the effect of SRPCE, thus verifying Hypothesis 2.

Secondly, we examine the development mechanism through which DI affects the effect of SRPCE via industrial structure. Table 5 demonstrates that the regression coefficient in column (4) is highly significant at the 1% level, indicating that DI has greatly facilitated the upgrading of industrial structure. In column (3), the regression coefficients of both DI and industrial structure upgrading on the index of SRPCE are positive and significant at the 1% level. This result suggests that DI can achieve the effect of SRPCE by promoting industrial structure upgrading, thus verifying Hypothesis 3.

Table 5 Mechanism analysis results. Full size table

Finally, we test the development mechanism of public environmental concern through which DI affects the effect of SRPCE. Table 5 indicates that the regression coefficient between DI and public environmental concern in column (6) is highly significant at the 1% level, demonstrating that DI has increased public environmental attention. In column (5), the regression coefficients of DI, public environmental attention, and the effect of SRPCE are all positive and have passed the significance test at the 1% level. The consequence demonstrates that DI can promote the effect of SRPCE by enhancing public environmental attention, thus verifying Hypothesis 4.

Analysis of Spatial spillover effects

To begin, we will analyze the spatial autocorrelation properties of DI and SRPCE, the study estimates the global Moran’s Index for both, and the calculation formula is:

$$\:\text{I}=\frac{n\sum\:_{i=1}^{n}\sum\:_{j=1}^{n}{w}_{ij}\left({x}_{i}-\overline{x}\right)\left({x}_{j}-\overline{x}\right)}{\sum\:_{i=1}^{n}\sum\:_{j=1}^{n}{w}_{ij}\sum\:_{j=1}^{n}{\left({x}_{i}-\overline{x}\right)}^{2}}$$ (11)

.

In formula (10), n represents 283 prefecture-level cities, \(\:{\text{w}}_{\text{i}\text{j}}\) is the spatial weight matrix, \(\:x\)and \(\:\overline{x}\)are the independent and control variables, as well as their corresponding means, respectively.

Table 6 indicates that, from 2011 to 2020, Moran’s I for both SRPCE and DI, when analyzed using the geographic distance weighting matrix, consistently remained above 0, with p-values of 0, demonstrating a significant spatial positive correlation between SRPCE and DI in China during this period. Next, to identify the most suitable model for this research, a series of related tests were conducted.

Table 6 Moran’s I and significance level of SRPCE and DI. Full size table

Table 7 indicates that, the Hausman test consequences demonstrate that the null hypothesis of random effects was refused, indicating that fixed effects are more appropriate for this model. The LM test outcomes reveal significant spatial error effects and spatial lag effects in the sample data, indicating that the SDM model is appropriate. Furthermore, the LR test and the Wald test rejected the null hypothesis that the SDM model degenerates into the SAR or SEM models. Therefore, the SDM model is the most suitable spatial panel model for this study.

Subsequently, this study compares the regression consequences of the SAR, SEM, and SDM models. Columns (1) to (4) of Table 8 show that the spatial autoregressive coefficients of the three models under two-way fixed effects are all positive and remarkable at the 1% level, demonstrating that China’s SRPCE has significant spatial spillover effects. This further suggests that SRPCE, as a crucial aspect of environmental governance, possesses strong externalities, with the effectiveness of environmental governance in a given city being closely linked to that in neighboring cities. Additionally, as the core explanatory variable, DI has a significantly positive coefficient, suggesting that DI not only promotes SRPCE within the city but also positively influences SRPCE in neighboring cities.

Table 7 Spatial panel model correlation test. Full size table

Table 8 Regression results of Spatial effect model. Full size table

Finally, as observed in column (3) and (4) of Table 8, In the SDM model, the coefficient for the spatial lag term of DI is positive. However, the changes attributed to the spatial effect cannot be fully explained by the interaction between the explanatory variables and the spatial weight matrix. Therefore, the spatial effects should be decomposed into direct effects, spillover effects, and total effects for analysis73. The SDM effect decomposition consequences indicate that the two effects of DI development show a strong positive correlation with SRPCE levels. The spillover effect of DI is estimated at 0.052 at the 1% significance level, demonstrating that for every unit increase in the DI level in surrounding areas, the SRPCE level will rise by 5.2%, thereby confirming Hypothesis 5. This effect may be due to DI’s strong interconnectivity capabilities, which allow it to cross geographical boundaries, facilitate the rapid transmission and sharing of information, promote the dissemination of knowledge and technology, and closely connect economic activities and environmental governance across different regions.

Heterogeneity analysis

City size​​

The size of a city indicates its employment capacity, level of economic development, and quality of infrastructure to some degree. Urban areas of varying sizes exhibit disparities in resource use efficiency, environmental management proficiency, and levels of technological innovation. Variations in the influence of infrastructure on the efficacy of SRPCE can elucidate useful techniques for enhancing resource utilization efficiency and fostering sustainable, low-carbon urban development. Following the “Notice on Adjusting the Criteria for Classification of City Sizes” issued by the State Council of China, the study categorizes 283 cities into two groups: large cities and small-and medium-sized cities. Then chow test was conducted and the F value of chow test was 25.18 with a p-value of 0, indicating that there is a significant difference in the regression coefficients among different regions. The analysis then estimates the impacts for each group separately74. As shown in columns (1) and (2) of Table 9, it denotes that the regression coefficients for the synergy between DI and SRPCE are positive in both sub-samples: large cities and small- and medium-sized cities. The coefficients are significant at the 10% and 1% levels, respectively. Compared to large cities, DI has a stronger synergistic effect on SRPCE in small- and medium-sized cities. Possible reasons include the fact that, compared to large cities, small- and medium-sized cities are generally smaller in size and have relatively lower pollutant emissions. Governments in smaller cities may be more flexible in implementing environmental protection policies and can make decisions more quickly. Additionally, the infrastructure update cycle is typically shorter, which may enhance the effect of SRPCE. In large cities, the scale and complexity can make management and governance more challenging. The planning and implementation of pollution reduction and carbon reduction require cross-sector and cross-regional coordination, adding complexity. Thus, the DI’s potential for enhancing SRPCE in large cities remains significant.

Resource endowment​​

The urban resource endowment, encompassing natural, economic, and technological resources, significantly influences a city’s potential and capacity for sustainable resource management and civic engagement. Cities vary in geographical location, climatic circumstances, industry composition, economic development levels, and other factors, resulting in diverse resource endowments. Therefore, when studying the impact of DI on SRPCE, considering the heterogeneity of urban resource endowments allows for a deeper understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of different cities in SRPCE. This understanding can help formulate more targeted policy measures75. The F-value of the chow test is 15.23 with a p-value of 0, indicating that there is a significant difference in the regression coefficients between cities with different resource endowments. This study conducts regression estimates separately for cities with different resource endowments. In Table 9, columns (3) and (4) inform the results for urban resource endowment heterogeneity. The results demonstrate that DI has significantly promoted the development of both resource-based and non-resource-based cities. DI has a stronger impact on SRPCE in resource-based cities. This is likely because resource-based cities typically have mining and energy development as their main industries. These industries are often accompanied by significant pollutant emissions and energy consumption. DI can more effectively monitor and regulate these emissions, implementing strategies to mitigate them. Non-resource-based cities may primarily focus on services, manufacturing, and other industries. Compared to resource-based cities, their pollutant emissions and energy consumption are generally lower. Consequently, DI assumes a very little function in the collaborative domain of SRPCE within these cities.

Environmental system​

Environmental institutional underpinnings often encompass a collection of policies, laws, and incentives. These foundations directly influence the execution and functioning of DI initiatives. Examining the impact of DI on SRPCE across various environmental institutional frameworks can yield empirical insights for policymakers, aiding in the refinement of current policies or the development of new policy initiatives. This study examines the differences in the effect of DI on SRPCE between key environmental protection cities and non-key environmental protection cities. According to the “Eleventh Five-Year Plan for National Environmental Protection” issued by the State Council of China76, The F-value of the chow test is 21.58 with a p-value of 0, indicating that there is a significant difference in the regression coefficients between cities with different environmental regimes. The research sample is divided into key and non-key environmental protection cities, and a grouped regression is performed. Columns (5) and (6) of Table 9 report the estimation results for environmental institutional heterogeneity.Compared to non-key environmental protection cities, DI can more effectively promote SRPCE in key environmental protection cities. This is likely because, as key monitoring targets for national pollution control, these cities receive significant attention for their environmental protection efforts. They typically allocate more resources and attention to environmental protection, formulating more stringent policies and regulations. Such policy support and regulatory constraints can enhance the promotion and application of DI in these cities, thereby more effectively reducing pollutant and carbon emissions.

[TITLE]Why is the UK introducing digital IDs – and why are they so controversial?:
[TEXT]
Keir Starmer’s digital ID proposal has been criticised by rivals and civil liberties groups over privacy concerns.

The British government announced last week that all employees will be required to hold a digital identity card, amid Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s attempts to curb undocumented immigration and reduce the apparent threat from the populist Reform UK party.

Addressing the Global Progress Action Summit on Friday – alongside leaders from Canada, Australia and Iceland – Starmer said his left-leaning Labour government had been overly “squeamish”
