[TITLE]African nations pledge to boost local manufacturing of medical products:
[TEXT]
MOMBASA, Kenya, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- African nations on Tuesday agreed to strengthen collaboration in medical product research, development, and regulation to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports.

The seventh biennial Scientific Conference on Medical Products Regulation in Africa (SCoMRA VII) was held in Kenya's coastal city of Mombasa, with delegates reflecting on the growing urgency to address vulnerabilities exposed by emergencies like the Ebola outbreak and COVID-19.

John Munyu, chairperson of Kenya's Pharmacy and Poisons Board, said unlocking Africa's potential in health product manufacturing and trade is a continental priority.

"Africa imports over 90 percent of its medicines and produces less than one percent of its vaccines. This is not just a statistic; it reflects our dependence and vulnerability, which the COVID-19 pandemic painfully exposed," he said.

"SCoMRA VII is not merely a conference; it is a strategic platform to make this vision real to catalyze local manufacturing, support intra-African trade under the Africa Continental Free Trade Area, and ensure that quality, safe, and effective medical products reach every African," he added.

African Medicines Agency (AMA)'s Director-General Delese Mimi Darko underscored the institution's commitment to supporting local pharmaceutical manufacturing across Africa.

Darko said increased regional production will improve access to safe, affordable, and high-quality medical products, while reducing dependence on imports.

Symerre Grey-Johnson, director of human capital and institutional development at the African Union Development Agency-New Partnership for Africa's Development, said Africa has made strategic moves to actualize medical product manufacturing through the establishment of the AMA.

Grey-Johnson noted that the establishment provides predictable regulatory functions and authoritative continental leadership, ensuring long-term sustainability for Africa's health future.

[TITLE]Upexi Reports Record Digital Asset Revenue for Fiscal First Quarter 2026:
[TEXT]
Digital Asset Revenue was Approximately $6.1 Million for the Quarter

Gross Profit Totaled $8.3 Million, up 183% Year-Over-Year

Net Income Increased to $66.7 Million, Compared to a Net Loss of $1.6 Million, Year-over-Year

Conference Call Scheduled for today, November 11, 2025, at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time

TAMPA, Fla., Nov. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Upexi, Inc. (NASDAQ: UPXI) (“Upexi” or the “Company”), a leading Solana-focused digital asset treasury company and consumer brands owner, today announced record digital asset revenue for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Financial Highlights for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2025

Total revenue for the quarter was $9.2 million, compared to $4.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Revenue from operations from the consumer brands business totaled $3.2 million. Digital Asset Revenue, which primarily consists of staking income, totaled $6.1 million.

Gross profit totaled $8.3 million, up 183% year-over-year due mainly to the addition of Digital Asset Revenue.

Net Income totaled $66.7 million, or $1.21 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.6 million, or ($1.55) per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. This increase was largely the result of approximately $78.00 million in unrealized gain on our Solana treasury.

Cash and Cash Equivalents were $2.2 million as of September 30, 2025.

As of November 12, 2025 the Company had 59,918,609 shares of common stock outstanding.

“Early in 2025, we enhanced our cash management and treasury strategy to include holding the cryptocurrency Solana directly on our balance sheet. Today, substantially all our Solana is generating a meaningful yield, effectively turning our treasury into a productive, revenue-generating asset,” said Allan Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of Upexi. “We are pleased to report that this strategy delivered first quarter 2026 Digital Asset Revenue of $6.1 million and drove gross profit to $8.3 million, up 183% versus the year-ago quarter and a strong validation of our model. We are extremely proud of our progress as we continue to build the leading Solana treasury company, and we remain laser-focused on creating value for shareholders.”

Operational and Other Highlights During and Subsequent to the Quarter

The Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for this period is available on the SEC’s website and on Upexi’s IR website.

[TITLE]Japanese investors turn to Europe as deep tech boom lures capital abroad:
[TEXT]
Huge swathes of cash are flowing from Japan to European tech startups as risk-averse investors favor a more mature entrepreneurial ecosystem, helping to scale the continent's booming deep tech cluster. While the European startup and venture capital ecosystem has long operated in the shadow of Silicon Valley, it has become fertile ground for Japanese corporates, whose domestic market is younger. Japanese investors or venture capital funds who themselves have Japanese investors, known as limited partners, participated in European financing rounds worth more than 33 billion euros ($38 billion) since 2019 when a trade deal between the European Union and Japan came into force, according to research from venture capital fund NordicNinja and data platform Dealroom. For the five years leading up to the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, investment totaled 5.3 billion euros. In Europe at that time, "there was no Japanese capital other than Softbank," Tomosaku Sohara, co-founder and managing partner of Japan-Europe VC NordicNinja, told CNBC. NordicNinja, which has 250 million euros of assets under management, is a collaboration between the firm's managing partners and Japan's JBIC IG Partners.

"Softbank was pretty active already at that moment, because they had acquired Finnish gaming company Supercell," Sohara said, noting that the acquisition injected life into Finland's startup ecosystem. Now, Mitsubishi , Sanden , Yamato Holdings , and Marunouchi Innovation Partners are among those directly backing European tech, per the report, while Japan-linked venture capital firms such as NordicNinja, Byfounders, and Toyota 's Woven Capital cut checks to startups on the continent. There are over two times more VC-backed startups in Europe than in Japan, per capita, and 4.3 times more unicorns, per the report.

The shadow of Silicon Valley

Japan's appetite for investing was always there, Sohara said. Its multinationals — like many — headed stateside to set up corporate venture capital arms in early 2000, in search of a slice of the action at the time when some of today's largest companies were just being thought up in dorm rooms. "Nobody wanted to look at Europe at that moment, but I think that after a couple of years they realized, 'Hey, maybe the U.S. culture is totally different from the Japanese culture,' and they began thinking, 'Hey, maybe we need to look at another region like Europe,'" Sohara said, adding that the profile of entrepreneurs in Europe, many of whom came from large corporates at the time, was more aligned with Japan. That's in contrast to the young founders coming from Stanford or university research and development departments, he said.

watch now

"They have experience at the corporates and also they have a mindset of entrepreneurship. Japan, unfortunately, is lacking the entrepreneurship mindset," Sohara added, referring to Europe's founders, many of whom came from Nokia and Skype.

The pull for founders

Japanese-linked investors have a penchant for one sector in particular: deep tech, which refers to companies building on top of scientific or engineering innovation. Deep tech and artificial intelligence accounted for 70% of deals made by such investors in Europe in 2024, echoing trends in the broader startup ecosystem as the AI, energy, and defense industries boom. The top-funded companies with Japanese participation include the U.K.'s autonomous vehicle startup Wayve, which raised $1.05 billion in an investment round in May 2024, British quantum computing firm Quantinuum, which secured 273 million euros in January 2024, and Spanish quantum firm Multiverse Computing, which saw investors cut it a check of 189 million euros in June 2025. The rounds were backed by Softbank, Mitsui and Toshiba, respectively. Such companies, however, typically need a lot of growth capital and industrial experience to scale successfully — two elements that Europe famously lacks.

"Investment appetite is way stronger than [in] any strategics I've seen here in Germany or in Europe," Sarah Fleischer co-founder and CEO, Tozero

"Japanese firms — and they're old, most of them that we're talking about, right — they're just sitting on a pile of money. They've been saving money throughout the last century, and now they're starting to spend it, to try to grow as a large corporate and increase their footprint outside of Japan," said Sarah Fleischer, co-founder and CEO of Germany-based battery materials recycling startup Tozero. "You see that investment appetite is way stronger than [in] any strategics I've seen here in Germany or in Europe," she added. Tozero has raised 14.5 million euros to date and counts NordicNinja, Honda and JGC among its investors. It's not just about the check. Japanese corporates and industrials have robust manufacturing and automotive know-how, Fleischer and Sohara noted respectively, meaning they are well positioned to plug Europe's knowledge gaps when it comes to scaling large manufacturing projects. Fleischer added that Japanese firms have long shored up their critical minerals supply chain and long-established trading firms, meaning they know how to secure essential components needed for the energy transition. For Tozero, this is an added plus, Fleischer said, given it's in the business of recovering such materials from spent batteries. In the age of political uncertainty amid choppy U.S.-China relations, Japan also acts as a good bridge to the Asian markets, Fleischer said.

A slower pace and lower risk appetite

Back in Japan, the number of entrepreneurs is "still very limited," Sohara said, as the older generation and "great talents" wanted to work for "a Toyota and Honda or Sony," he added, but the younger generation's mindset is beginning to change. Europe has also become the home to ambitious would-be founders searching for a tech ecosystem to build their companies in, Sohara said. However, as collaboration between Europe and Japan scales, language remains a barrier as fluency in English is not widespread in Japan, he added. For Fleischer, this also poses challenges. "There's so much miscommunication and local translation that could ruin a partnership instantly. And there's also some sort of cultural aspect as well, one needs to probably be aware of," she said, adding that she recently spent weeks in Japan getting to know her investors face-to-face, "because that's still the sentiment" there. Decision-making can therefore be slower, the founder said, due to thorough research and preparation. "They just do their homework," Fleischer said, noting that Japanese partners were hands-on in helping the company understand "how to build our next future commercial plant, potentially starting from Japan and then going worldwide."

watch now

Indeed, "without the support from NN [NordicNinja] it would have been much more difficult to build the right relationships," said Aaike van Vugt, co-founder and CEO of Dutch nanotechnology engineering firm VSParticle. That's in contrast to perhaps the most well-known Japanese player: Softbank. Softbank is "totally different" from traditional Japanese investor cultures, given it is driven by founder Masayoshi Son's decisions rather than operating on a consensus basis, like most Japanese business, Sohara added. The venture firm, known for its lofty bets on WeWork and, more recently, chip company Arm, poured huge sums of cash into tech startups amid the 2021 venture capital tech boom, which saw at least one Japanese-linked investor involved in deals worth 11.2 billion euros, per the report. Softbank stood out during this period; it was involved in 22% of deals with Japanese-linked participation in 2021.

[TITLE]Payments firm Worldline plans 500-million-euro capital injection:
[TEXT]
By Gianluca Lo Nostro

(Reuters) -Worldline on Thursday unveiled plans to raise 500 million euros ($583 million) by tapping some of France's biggest banks to fund a strategy aimed at turning ​around the payments firm following years of setbacks.

The two-stage capital increase will begin with a 110-million-euro ‌reserved share sale to Bpifrance, Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas, followed by a 390-million-euro rights issue open to all shareholders.

The three lenders ‌have committed to subscribe around 135 million euros to the rights issue.

Upon completion of the capital raise, expected in the first quarter of 2026, Bpifrance will hold a 9.6% stake in Worldline, Credit Agricole will own 9.5%, with BNP Paribas at 7.9%.

Swiss stock exchange operator SIX Group, Worldline's biggest investor, said it has accepted dilution as ⁠it will not participate in the capital increase.‌ SIX expects a 550-million-Swiss-franc ($693.48 million) impairment on its Worldline stake and said it will manage it as a financial investment in the future.

NEW PLAN FAILS TO ‍WIN BACK INVESTORS

The move failed to calm investors as shares in Worldline fell over 6%, hitting a new all-time low on Thursday.

Chief executive Pierre-Antoine Vacheron dismissed concerns that the company, valued 581 million euros as of Wednesday, could become a takeover target despite ​the new funding.

"We have very strong support from anchor shareholders, which are very large financial institutions in Europe,‌" Vacheron said in a call with reporters. "When you look at the competition, they are not really in good shape."

J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note the new plan gives the firm credibility but that investors will want to see proof of stabilisation.

Worldline, spun off from IT group Atos in 2014, was a standout in France's technology sector before its market value plummeted by

The opening ceremony was attended by several officials, including John KC Lee, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, and Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.This year's event, under the theme "Curating the New Fintech Era," brought together more than 37,000 participants from over 100 economies, over 800 speakers, and more than 700 exhibiting institutions to explore cutting-edge technological trends. As a partner of the Hong Kong FinTech Week, SY Holdings Group Limited ("SY Holdings", stock code: 6069.HK) was once again invited to attend. The Company participated in the "Digital Finance" forum alongside companies such as HSBC, Porrima, and FundPark, engaging in in-depth discussions and sharing insights on the topic of "How AI is Unlocking Lending for SMEs."SY Holdings is a partner of the Hong Kong FinTech WeekHong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive John KC Lee emphasized in his opening speech that Hong Kong's unique positioning as an international financial center has gained widespread international recognition. Currently, Hong Kong is home to over 1,200 financial technology enterprises, representing a 10% increase compared to last year. It is projected that by 2032, the revenue of Hong Kong's financial technology industry will exceed $600 billion. Additionally, John KC Lee stated that Hong Kong will assist Chinese Mainland enterprises in using the city as a springboard to expand their overseas operations. Through collaboration among various government departments of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, pathways will be paved for Chinese Mainland companies to access foreign markets and global capital, which signifies substantial opportunities for all parties involved.During the sharing session of the "Digital Finance" forum, Darrell Lua, Director of International Business at SY Holdings, addressed the topic of "AI and Data Empowering the Development of SMEs." He pointed out that enterprises naturally generate supply chain data—such as order processing, logistics and transportation, payment settlements, and performance evaluations—in their daily operations. Therefore, the key to addressing the financing challenges faced by SMEs lies not in the absence of data, but in the ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies to transform this data into credible evidence for the financial sector. By applying AI technology to deeply correlate, cross-verify, and dynamically analyze fragmented data, SY Holdings accurately maps the operational trajectories and transaction profiles of SMEs. This differentiated "transaction-focused, entity-light" model, which prioritizes transactions over corporate entities, effectively overcomes the reliance of traditional financial services on corporate creditworthiness and collateral. Through the deep integration of AI and data, SY Holdings enables finance to "understand" the actual operational needs of SMEs and provides them with more precise and suitable working capital solutions.Regarding the working capital needs of emerging scenarios such as live-streaming e-commerce, Darrell Lua further shared SY Holdings' practical applications of AI. He emphasized that the integration of AI and finance should go beyond mere "speed" and achieve a synergy between "velocity" and "understanding"—specifically, a deep comprehension of industrial ecosystems and data. Rather than simply developing new AI agents and risk control models, SY Holdings empowers AI with the ability to "understand" multidimensional real-world information, covering logistics trajectories, tax and invoice records, and even external variables like weather forecasts. This extends the risk assessment model to "dynamic scenarios," as risks may lurk not only in static reports but also in delayed port shipments, supply chains disrupted by heavy rain, or suddenly adjusted policies. By focusing on "the transaction itself" as the core assessment criterion and leveraging cross-verified data from multiple supply chain nodes for dynamic control, SY Holdings ultimately provides "end-to-end, minute-level" working capital services for live-streaming e-commerce merchants. To date, the company has helped over 21,000 SMEs secure over RMB 300 billion in order acquisition and working capital turnover. The value of integrating AI with finance lies not in replacing humans but in enabling trust to transcend boundaries and continuously amplify.When discussing linkages and collaboration with financial institutions, Darrell Lua emphasized that SY Holdings consistently adheres to a platform-based strategy, committed to building a bridge for the intelligent matching of high-quality assets and diverse funding sources. Currently, the platform has connected with over 190 funding partners. He expressed SY Holdings' expectation to strengthen collaboration with financial institutions in two key areas: First, enhancing the supply of scalable, low-cost inclusive funding by leveraging the SY Cloud Platform's ability to accurately identify genuine corporate financing needs, thereby helping more SMEs efficiently access working capital services. Second, promoting the deep integration of risk control models and ecosystem resources by combining the mature credit assessment systems of financial institutions with SY Holdings' "transaction-focused, entity-light" risk control logic to jointly serve SMEs segments that are traditionally underserved by conventional finance. Additionally, SY Holdings aims to leverage financial institutions' extensive service networks, cross-border business experience, and diverse customer resources to further expand into domestic underserved markets and international markets such as Southeast Asia, extending the platform's technology services to broader domains.It is worth noting that SY Holdings has initiated its global layout this year, increasing R&D investments in innovative technologies such as AI agents to build a new "AI + International Supply Chain Technology Platform." This platform will focus on serving SMEs across global supply chain ecosystems, providing one-stop solutions encompassing supply chain services, financing, FX management, and digital operation empowerment, with the goal of becoming an integral component of the global supply chain.SY Holdings' reappearance at the Hong Kong FinTech Week attracted attention from financial institutions and technology enterprises worldwide. It not only demonstrated the company's comprehensive capabilities in digital finance and technology output but also reflected its strategic determination to use Hong Kong as a bridgehead to connect global innovation resources and expand into international markets. This further advances its mission to "empowering Chinese SMEs to reshape the global supply chain."SY Holdings Group Limited ("SY Holdings" or the "Group", stock code: 6069.HK) is the first "AI+Industrial Supply Chain" digital intelligence technology company listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The major institutional shareholders of SY Holdings include Temasek Holdings of Singapore, Wuxi Communications Group, XtalPi and Be Friends. The Group has been included in the MSCI series indices, Hang Seng Composite Index, FTSE Index, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect programs. It was recognized in 2023 as one of "CNBC's Top 200 Global Fintech Companies" and in 2024 as a "Forbes China Top 50 Fintech Influential Enterprise," demonstrating international market recognition of its development.While deepening its presence in national pillar industries such as infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, and commodities, SY Holdings is actively expanding into strategic emerging sectors including e-commerce, robotics. SY Holdings adopts the differentiated "transaction-focused, entity-light" model, uses AI Agent to link industrial ecosystem and conduct data analysis, and helps the growth of small and medium enterprises ("SMEs") through Platform technology science. Up to now, SY Holdings has helped over 21,000 SMEs secure over RMB 300 billion in order acquisition and working capital turnover.In August 2025, while intensifying its global expansion, SY Holdings positioned its Singapore international headquarters as the strategic bridgehead and formally launched its global strategy. The Group will build a new "International Supply Chain Technology Platform" powered by AI, which focuses on serving SMEs in the upstream and downstream of the global supply chain and provides one-stop solutions encompassing flexible supply chain services, cross-border working capital, exchange rate management and digital empowerment. The Group is committed to supporting SMEs in efficiently expanding into global markets, while fulfilling its mission of "Empowering Chinese SMEs to reshape the global supply chain" and jointly opening a new era of growth in resonance with global development.Source: SY Holdings

Corporates across industries reinforced work-from-home policies in the National Capital Region and urged sales teams to limit market visits and intra-city travel as New Delhi enforced GRAP-3 from Tuesday with average air quality index (AQI) breaching 400 — the season’s worst so far. Stage 3 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) recommends work from home (WFH), and bans construction and polluting vehicles. Nestle India has sent a communication to all employees in this connection, a company spokesperson said, adding that “the working from home option is always available to all colleagues.”The India unit of the Swiss packaged foods maker is headquartered in Gurgaon. Corporates have also deferred multiple large events even as the capital’s deteriorating air quality has gone viral on social platforms.Companies such as Mondelez, Diageo, Deloitte, ITC , AB InBev and RPG noted their hybrid work models allow employees to opt for WFH when required. “Our existing hybrid work model gives employees the flexibility to make choices that work best for them,” said Nagina Singh, senior director, people lead, at chocolate maker Mondelez India. “This approach is consistent across all our locations in India, including Delhi and NCR.” On Tuesday, the average AQI in Delhi shot up to 425 — in ‘severe’ category — for the first time this season.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) enforced the GRAP-3 curbs, where “private companies are requested to implement work-fromhome or hybrid modes.”The developments may hit footfalls in restaurants and malls. “Various large outdoor events have been deferred, which is unfortunate because this is the time the weather in Delhi-NCR is otherwise very pleasant,” said Anjan Chatterjee, chairman of Speciality Restaurants , which operates Mainland China and Oh Calcutta restaurant chains.Footfalls in dine-ins have been hit over the past week as people stayed indoors amid worsening air quality, he added. Besides Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad are also impacted. The region houses thousands of corporate houses. “We’ve advised our sales teams across Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad to go slow on market visits,” said an executive at a consumer durables firm. He requested not to be identified, since he is not an authorised spokesperson. Spirits company Diageo India’s CHRO Shilpa Vaid said its hybrid model “allows teams to balance business priorities with personal safety and wellbeing.” GRAP-3 restrictions include curbs on inter-state diesel buses entering or operating in Delhi, and closure of schools up to Class 5, with classes switching to online mode. Essential services such as railways, metro construction, airports, defence, sanitation, and healthcare facilities are exempted from the restrictions under defined “dust and waste management norms.”

[TITLE]Huntington to Acquire Key Units From KKR-Owned Janney Scott:
[TEXT]
Huntington Bancshares HBAN has agreed to acquire several business units of Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, a financial services firm majority-owned by KKR & Co. Inc. KKR, as part of a push to expand its capital markets operations, according to a Bloomberg News report published on MSN.

Under the terms of the deal, Huntington will purchase Janney’s merger and acquisition advisory, public finance, and fixed-income sales and trading units. These businesses will be integrated into Huntington’s subsidiaries, including Capstone Partners, its investment banking advisory arm, and Huntington Securities, which focuses on capital markets and trading services.

Financial details of the transaction were kept under wraps.

Rationale Behind HBAN Acquisition Deal

The planned acquisition will enhance HBAN’s advisory and capital markets capabilities, while expanding its reach with institutional and public-sector clients. The move marks a significant step in its long-term strategy to diversify revenue sources beyond traditional lending and deposit services.

By integrating Janney’s advisory and trading teams, Huntington aims to strengthen its relationships with corporate and public-sector clients, while generating more fee-based income, a key priority amid margin pressures facing U.S. regional banks.

The deal underscores a broader trend among regional lenders seeking to reduce their dependence on interest income, especially as fluctuating interest rates and rising funding costs weigh on profitability. Capital markets and advisory businesses, while cyclical, offer opportunities for higher returns and long-term client relationships.

HBAN’s Prior Inorganic Expansion Efforts

Earlier this month, HBAN has entered a definitive agreement to acquire Cadence Bank, a regional financial institution with $53 billion in assets headquartered in Houston, TX, and Tupelo, MS. The deal expands Huntington’s footprint across several high-growth markets, including Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin, Atlanta, Nashville, Orlando and Tampa, providing a strong foundation for organic investment and long-term growth. Following completion, Huntington will have a footprint in 12 of the 25 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, including six of the 10 fastest-growing regions.

The company also completed the acquisition of Veritex Holdings, Inc. in October 2025, strengthening its presence in Texas by expanding across Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston. In March 2024, HBAN announced plans to expand its commercial banking business in Texas, following its footprint extension in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in early 2024.
