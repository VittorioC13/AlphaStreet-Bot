[TITLE]Amazon shares soar as AI demand boosts cloud revenue — and results fire up CEO Andy Jassy:
[TEXT]
Amazon’s cloud revenue rose at the fastest clip in nearly three years, helping the company forecast quarterly sales above estimates and driving its shares up 14% in after-market trading.

The company projected increased capital spending next year.

The online retailer benefited as businesses continue to spend relentlessly on artificial intelligence software development. Massive cloud demand is helping the tech company ease the pressure from softer growth at its e-commerce business, which is gearing up for the critical holiday season amid weakness in consumer confidence stemming from global trade uncertainty.

Target's merchants and designers have drawn inspiration from traveling to rodeos, ski lodges and college campuses. Some of the retailer's fall accessories have western accents, such as purses with fringe and cowgirl-inspired hats. Melissa Repko | CNBC

MINNEAPOLIS — When shoppers browse Target 's aisles this fall, they will see purses with fringe accents, dresses made of suede-inspired fabrics and hats with a cowgirl flair. As winter comes, they'll find cozy sweaters with a ski lodge spin. Target's creative team has traveled the world to find inspiration for its brands, from a rodeo in Colorado to ski lodges in the French Alps and restaurants in New York's Hudson Valley. With global trips, an artificial intelligence-powered tool and sharper critiques of its own merchandise, the big-box retailer wants to get back to its roots: designing attention-grabbing, fashion-forward clothing and home decor at an affordable price. Target's merchandise was once a competitive advantage, but even the company admits it has lost that edge. The big-box retailer's sales have declined in some categories that it's best known for, such as home goods, as competitors lure away customers. As consumers' enthusiasm for Target's offerings has faded, annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and the company expects sales to decline this year. Shares of Target have tumbled

[TITLE]The rise and fall of globalisation: why the world’s next financial meltdown could be much worse with the US on the sidelines:
[TEXT]
This is the second in a two-part series. Read part one here.

Globalisation has always had its critics – but until recently, they have come mainly from the left rather than the right.

In the wake of the second world war, as the world economy grew rapidly under US dominance, many on the left argued that the gains of globalisation were unequally distributed, increasing inequality in rich countries while forcing poorer countries to implement free-market policies such as opening up their financial markets, privatising their state industries and rejecting expansionary fiscal policies in favour of debt repayment – all of which mainly benefited US corporations and banks.

This was not a new concern. Back in 1841, German economist Friedrich List had argued that free trade was designed to keep Britain’s global dominance from being challenged, suggesting:

When anyone has obtained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he climbs up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him.

By the 1990s, critics of the US vision of a global world order such as the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz argued that globalisation in its current form benefited the US at the expense of developing countries and workers – while author and activist Naomi Klein focused on the negative environmental and cultural consequences of the global expansion of multinational companies.

Mass left-led demonstrations broke out, disrupting global economic meetings including, most famously, the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999. During this “battle of Seattle”, violent exchanges between protesters and police prevented the launch of a new world trade round that had been backed by then US president, Bill Clinton. For a while, the mass mobilisation of a coalition of trade unionists, environmentalists and anti-capitalist protesters seemed set to challenge the path towards further globalisation – with anti-capitalism “Occupy” protests spreading around the world in the wake of the 2008 financial crash.

In the US, a further critique of globalisation centred on its domestic consequences for American workers – namely, job losses and lower pay – and led to calls for greater protectionism. Although initially led by trade unions and some Democratic politicians, this critique gradually gained purchase in radical right circles who opposed giving any role to international organisations like the WTO, on the grounds that they impinged on American sovereignty. According to this view, only by stopping foreign competition whose low wages undercut American workers could prosperity be restored. Immigration was another target.

Under Donald Trump’s second term as US president, these criticisms have been transformed into radical, deeply disruptive economic and social policies – with tariffs and protectionism at their heart. In so doing, Trump – despite all his grandstanding on the world stage – has confirmed what has long been clear to close observers of US politics and business: that the American century of global dominance, with the dollar as unrivalled no.1 currency, is drawing rapidly to a close.

Even before Trump first took office in 2017, the US had begun to withdraw from its leadership role in international economic institutions such as the WTO. Now, the strongest part of its economy, the hi-tech sector, is under intense pressure from China, whose economy is already bigger than the US’s by one key measure of GDP. Meanwhile, the majority of US citizens are facing stagnant incomes, higher prices and more insecure jobs.

In previous centuries, when first France and then Great Britain reached the end of their eras of world domination, these transitions had painful impacts beyond their borders. This time, with the global economy more closely integrated than ever before and no single dominant power waiting in the wings to take over, the impacts could be felt even more widely – with very damaging, if not catastrophic, results.

Why no one is ready to take the US’s place

When it comes to taking over from the US as the world’s leading hegemonic power, the only viable candidates with big enough economies are the European Union and China. But there are strong reasons to doubt that either could take on this role – notwithstanding the fact that in 2022, then US president Joe Biden’s National Security Strategy called China: “The only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do so.”

At times Biden’s successor, President Trump, has sounded almost jealous of the control China’s leaders exert over their national economy, and the fact they do not face elections and limits on their terms in office. But a one-party, authoritarian political system which lacks legal checks and balances is a key reason China will find it hard to gain the cultural and political dominance among democratic nations that is part of achieving world no.1 status – despite the influence it already wields in large parts of Asia and Africa.

China still faces big economic challenges too. While it is already the global leader in manufactured goods (rapidly moving into hi-tech products) and the world’s largest exporter, its economy is still very unbalanced – with a much smaller consumer sector, a weak property market, many inefficient state industries that are highly indebted, and a relatively small financial sector restricted by state ownership. Nor does China possess a global currency, despite its (limited) attempts to make the renminbi a truly international currency.

As I found on a reporting trip to Shanghai in 2007 to investigate the effects of globalisation, there are also enormous differences between China’s prosperous coastal megacities – whose main thoroughfares rival New York and Paris – and the relative poverty in the interior, especially in rural areas. But nearly two decades on from that visit, with the country’s growth rate slowing, many university-educated young people are also finding it hard to find well-paid jobs now.

Meanwhile Europe – the only other contender to take the US’s place as global no.1 – is deeply politically divided, with smaller, weaker economies to the east and south far more sceptical

Environmental Protection: Proper plastic waste management helps reduce pollution by preventing plastic from entering landfills, oceans, and other ecosystems. This prevents harm to wildlife, marine life, and plant species that can ingest or become entangled in plastic. Conservation of Resources: Recycling plastic waste reduces the need for new raw materials, saving energy, water, and other natural resources. This helps conserve resources for future generations and supports a circular economy. Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions: By recycling plastics, less energy is used compared to manufacturing new plastic products, which helps lower carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Improved Public Health: Proper disposal and recycling of plastic waste can reduce exposure to toxic substances that are released when plastics degrade in uncontrolled environments, thus improving public health outcomes. Job Creation and Economic Growth: The recycling and plastic waste management industries create jobs in collection, sorting, recycling, and manufacturing. This supports local economies and can lead to sustainable economic growth. Reduction of Landfill Space: By recycling plastic, we can divert waste away from landfills, which helps conserve space and extend the lifespan of existing landfills.

[TITLE]How Will Capitalism End? Essays on a Failing System:
[TEXT]
Upon reading this collection of essays (the title of this post) from Wolfgang Streeck and then contemplating our current world, The Second Coming of William Butler Yeats comes to mind:

Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity…

Streeck has been a sensible critic of modern political economy for a long time, and his recent summing up is very useful today. Here he seeks to “inspire more concrete thinking on how the modern-capitalist global system might in the not-to-distant future come to an end, even without a successor regime in sight, as a consequence of its internal contradictions unfolding.” The eleven essays include “The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism,” “Citizens as Consumers: Considerations on the New Politics of Consumption,” “Why the Euro Divides Europe,” and “The Public Mission of Sociology.” All of them repay reading.

In his description of capitalism lie the seeds of its instability and ultimate decline and dissolution:

Capitalism promises infinite growth of commodified wealth in a finite world, by conjoining itself with modern science and technology, making capitalist society the first industrial society, and through unending expansion of free, in the sense of contestable, risky markets, on the coat-tails of a hegemonic carrier state and its market-opening policies both domestically and internationally…Capitalist society is distinguished by the fact that its collective productive capital is accumulated in the hands of a minority of its members who enjoy the legal privilege, in the form of rights of private property, to dispose of such capital in any way they see fit, including letting it sit idle or transferring it abroad…(thus)…the vast majority of the members of a capitalist society must work under the direction, however mediated, of the private owners of the tools they need to provide for themselves, and on the terms of those owners in line with their desire to maximize the rate of increase of their capital.

This, of course, has led to precarity for the masses (including the Professional Managerial Class/PMC, much to their coming surprise) who are becoming less and less comfortable with their position as contingent beings at the mercy of “The Economy.” But more fundamentally, infinite growth is not possible in a closed material system. It may seem strange that this simple accounting error, described by Alyssa Battistoni in Free Gifts: Capitalism and the Politics of Nature (2025), may lead to the end of the world. But this is a possibility. And the commodification of all life – food, family, work, community, recreation, business, entertainment, education, health, science, art – has led to alienation and anomie that consumerism cannot relieve in either the short term or the long term:

The vast majority of…members [1] of a capitalist society must…convert their ever-present fear of being cut out of the productive process, because of economic or technological restructuring, into acceptance of the highly unequal distribution of wealth and power generated by the capitalist economy. For this, highly complicated and inevitably fragile institutional and ideological provisions are necessary…(including)…the conversion of insecure workers – kept insecure to make them obedient workers – into confident consumers happily discharging their consumerist social obligations even in the face of the fundamental uncertainty of labor markets and employment.

“Consumer” is Neoliberal-speak for “citizen.” The systematic disorders of capitalism covered by Streeck include stagnation, oligarchic wealth redistribution, plundering of the public domain, corruption, and global anarchy. Secular stagnation is inevitable as the previously empty world fills up with our products and our waste. For example, more carbon has been emitted since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 that in all previous human history. And then there is plastic. The transnational fossil fuel corporations knew long ago what would happen to the ecosphere of planet Earth as a result of their output. As a friend who worked for one of the largest oil companies put it to me once, they did not hire stupid engineers and chemists. However, they did hide their research. Is it any wonder that the predicted effects of anthropogenic global warming are arriving now to some surprise? Or denial?

Wealth redistribution upward and corruption have gone hand in hand for much of the history of capitalism. Corruption leads to the plundering of the public domain. None of these failures can be attributed to only the notional left or the notional right. Both are implicated, especially in our current Neoliberal Dispensation [2], in which there is only one party, the Property Party, in the US and the UK and most of the rest of the world.

Unlike in Bernard Mandeville’s Fable of the Bees, which is a favorite of the traditional right going back to Russell Kirk:

Under financialized capitalism the private vice of greed is no longer magically converted into a public virtue – depriving capitalism even of its last consequentialist moral justification. Stylizing owners and managers of capital as trustees of society has lost any remaining credibility, their much publicized exercises in philanthropy notwithstanding. A pervasive cynicism has become deeply engrained in the collective common sense, which has become as a matter of course to regard capitalism as nothing but an institutionalized opportunity for the well-connected super-rich to become even richer. Corruption…is considered a fact of life, and so is steadily growing inequality and the monopolization of political influence by a small self-serving oligarchy and its army of wealth defense specialists…Elite calls for trust and appeals to shared values can no longer be expected to resonate with a populace nursed on materialistic-utilitarian self-descriptions of a society in which everything is and out to be for sale.

While capitalism might be coming to an end because of internal contradictions rather than external forces, the problem is that no logical or practical successor is approaching. The manifest successes of capitalism recognized by Karl Marx himself (e.g., high relative standards of living in the Global North) have nevertheless led inevitably to an increase in social entropy – a state of public, social, and governmental disorder that increases with every passing political season, including on this, the twenty-seventy day of a US government shutdown. When I first began reading this collection, Gramsci came to mind, and he appeared in due course:

The social order of capitalism would then issue, not in another order, but in disorder, or entropy – in a historical epoch of uncertain duration when in the words of Antonio Gramsci, ‘the old is dying but the new cannot yet be born,’ ushering in ‘an interregnum in which pathological phenomena of the most diverse sort come into existence’ – in a society devoid of reasonably coherent and minimally stable institutions capable of normalizing the lives of its members and protecting them from accidents and monstrosities of all sorts. [3]

Increasing entropy is indeed the order of the day, which translates into a life in the “shadow of uncertainty, always at the risk of being upset by surprise events…and dependent on individuals’ resourcefulness, skillful improvisation, and good luck.” Yes, people are responsible for themselves and their families. But this can be glorified as a life of freedom and liberty unconstrained by society, culture, or their institutions. But:

The problem with this (fundamental) neoliberal narrative is that it neglects the very unequal distribution of risks, opportunities that comes with de-socialized capitalism, including the ‘Matthew effect’ of cumulative advantage. [4] The behavioral program of the post-social society during the post-capitalist interregnum is governed by a neoliberal ethos of competitive self-improvement, an untiring cultivation of one’s marketable human capital, enthusiastic dedication to work, and cheerfully optimistic, playful acceptance of the risks in a world that has outgrown government.

So, what is likely to “keep an entropic, disorderly, stalemated post-capitalist interregnum going in the absence of collective regulation containing economic crises, limiting inequality, securing confidence in security and credit, protecting labor, land and money from overuse, and procuring legitimacy for free markets and private property through democratic control of greed and prevention of oligarchy?”

Streeck lists the following responses to the coming interregnum, or “inconvenient apocalypse,” in another formulation.

Coping : Individual responding with new improvisations and stopgaps to the successive emergencies in the entropic interregnum.

: Individual responding with new improvisations and stopgaps to the successive emergencies in the entropic interregnum. Hoping : Individual mental effort to imagine and believe in a better life in coming possible future. Dreaming might be an adjunct of hoping and a way of coping better.

: Individual mental effort to imagine and believe in a better life in coming possible future. Dreaming might be an adjunct of hoping and a way of coping better. Doping : This helps with coping and hoping and can involve substance abuse, both performance-enhancing and performance-replacing. [5]

: This helps with coping and hoping and can involve substance abuse, both performance-enhancing and performance-replacing. [5] Shopping: Rich capitalist countries with saturated markets for consumer goods must “get individuals whose needs are covered to develop desires that give rise to new desires the moment they are fulfilled. This is old news, though, covered exceedingly well by William Leach in Land of Desire: Merchants, Power, and the Rise of a New American Culture (1993)

What we can expect during the interregnum is “individuals-as-consumers adhering to a culture of competitive hedonism, one that makes a virtue out of the necessity of having to struggle with adversity on one’s own.” This, of course, is the libertarian’s view of a big, beautiful world. By definition, this libertarian (and classical Liberal) has the Matthew Effect on his side but does not understand this simple fact.

So, what is to come after the interregnum if we survive climate catastrophe with a modicum of civil society left in our new world? In Streeck’s analysis, increasing social and political entropy will continue to lessen the power of institutions to mediate between conflicting goals and to ameliorate the disruptions that will follow. We have been on this course for nearly fifty years and a continuing slide seems likely.

But this is not a foregone conclusion. Our human world will get smaller as the room for expansion of the economy ends – we exceeded the carrying capacity of planet Earth some time ago. Capitalist democracy has always been a problematic concept, but for a short time through the Great Compression following World War II, it functioned as an engine of economic and social progress, even if this progress was uneven and certainly not universal. On the other hand, Neoliberal capitalist democracy is the perfect oxymoron. But as our world shrinks there will be opportunities to improve life at the local, regional, and national levels, while letting “global” take care of itself in the coming multipolar world. Yes, our presuppositions are huge here, but they underpin hope.

Although neither the notional Left nor Right do so, we must always remember that markets and business civilization are not the same thing as capitalism. Business makes life as we know it possible, and has since the Middle Ages. Business, small and large, lives in the real world of people and places, just as education, medicine, science, art, and virtually every other thing that makes a humane life possible. As our world becomes more local and regional, business and industry will of necessity become less extractive and more functional, fair, and legitimate (which they approached, with the normal caveats, during the Great Compression). This more humane, more social environment that is local and regional makes ecological, cultural, political, and economic sense. Democracy exists only from the ground up, and to the extent we have ever had democracy it has been local. [6] This so-called democracy could also be inward looking and less than fair. But that was not a requirement then and we know better now, despite our current, hopefully fleeting, distemper.

We can start with food and then go further with other necessary goods, durable and otherwise. Genuinely free and transparent markets and small business civilization are essential to a fair and just world. Will this necessary project work? Or was Mark Fisher correct when he wrote “It is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism” (with credit to Fredric Jameson and Slavoj Žižek)? Unless one wants to join the misanthropic darlings of Big Tech and AI, this project must work. One person, one subject, one problem at a time worked on by one billion people at a time.

Oh, and also with a little of Bakunin thrown into the mix: “Freedom without socialism is privilege and injustice; socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality.” With a bit of anarchism from Proudhon, through the late, great James C. Scott, and, contra Yeats, anarchism is “mutuality, or cooperation without hierarchy or state rule,” instead of a stupid vandalism on offer from nihilistic thugs with no political sensibilities whatsoever.

Returning to the great Irish poet, unless the best of us, from wherever we come and whatever we do and whatever we believe, regain real conviction and real intensity informed by good will and seriousness of mind, Mark Fisher’s lament will come to pass and there will be no one to pick up that which has fallen apart. Alas.

Notes

[1] Membership of all in society is essential for human flourishing, no matter what TINA says. Robert Putnam was correct in Bowling Alone. Long before the book was published, in the 1950s the CEO of General Motors was proud that his company was the largest employer in the United States and provided a “middle class” life to hundreds of thousands of union workers and their families. True membership in society and politics was unevenly distributed, but its reach was increasing up through the early days of the neoliberal transformation during the second half of Jimmy Carter’s one term as president. Contrast with the current largest employer, which surpassed GM long ago without a thought for its workers, many of whom need SNAP and Medicaid, or the people. Not that any CEO has a great love for unions, but the ethos of post-war capitalism did not admit of a return to the rapacity of the previous iteration of capitalism characterized by Jay Gould, who said that he could always hire one half of the working class to kill the other half. Whether Gould actually said this is uncertain, but the malignant extent of his and his fellow robber barons’ antipathy to the working class writ large is certain, even if working people made them wealthy beyond imagining, from the 1870s into the twenty-first century of Bezos, Zuckerberg, Gates, and Musk.

[2] Neoliberalism is a protean concept. Wendy Brown and Quinn Slobodian (here, here, and here) offer outstanding, accessible expositions. A short description of neoliberalism might be: The market is the measure of all things, even those that cannot be measured, in a political economy in which people are for the economy rather than having an economy for the people in which human flourishing is the objective. Being able to buy a 6-pack of tube socks made by mistreated people somewhere on the far side of the world for $18.99 at retail is not living better by saving money.

[3] I defer to Streeck and the original Italian that I am not competent to translate, but my preferred version of this quote from the Prison Notebooks is “The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.”

[4] The Matthew Effect was coined by Robert K. Merton and Harriet Zuckerman when they showed that eminent scientists get more credit than they deserve. I first read their work during my long laboratory apprentice in a lab that was connected to the Science Library. They were correct about the distribution of rewards in science. The simple statement of the Matthew Effect is, “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.” This is an apt description of our neoliberal world. Cumulative advantage in the real world comes to those who had the good sense to pick their parents wisely. The signal blindness of conventional liberals and libertarians in the PMC of both the notional Right and Left is they fail to see their head start in life as unearned but very real secular grace.

[5] Streeck describes our society very well here: “Doping is closely connected to corruption. Most of the substances used to enhance performance one way or other are highly profitable legal products of (Big Pharma). Performance-replacing drugs, on the other hand, as consumed mostly by losers are mostly illegal…(and they are)…sent to prison or die in comparatively large numbers from overdose.” Richer users of performance-replacing drugs are sent to rehab, with the sympathy of the court.

[6] For a view of how regionalism makes for a more humane society and democratic economy within the larger world, the essays and fiction of Wendell Berry point the way while showing what membership in a community means, without eliding the difficulties of community.

The federal government is still shut down. Here's what that means across the country

The federal government shutdown has dragged into another week, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to ending it.

Many federal workers have missed paychecks, including air traffic controllers, who are working unpaid.

Meanwhile, uncertainty remains for tens of millions of people who rely on federal food and nutrition benefits like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. The benefits had been set to expire on Saturday due to the government shutdown. Two federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide the benefits. But it was unclear after the rulings how much assistance may be provided or when it might come.

[TITLE]Judge questions the Trump administration’s plan to suspend SNAP benefits for millions:
[TEXT]
Talwani said she expects to issue a ruling later Thursday and seemed to be leaning toward requiring the government to put billions of dollars in emergency funds toward SNAP. That, she said, is her interpretation of what Congress intended when an agency’s funding runs out.

During a hearing over a request by 25 Democratic-led states to keep the funding flowing, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani told lawyers that if the government can’t afford to cover the cost, there’s a process to follow rather than simply suspending all benefits. “The steps involve finding an equitable way of reducing benefits,” said Talwani, who was nominated to the court by then-President Barack Obama.

BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge in Boston on Thursday seemed skeptical of the Trump’s administration’s argument that SNAP benefits could be suspended for the first time in the food aid program’s history because of the government shutdown.

“If you don’t have money, you tighten your belt,” she said in court. “You are not going to make everyone drop dead because it’s a political game someplace.”

Talwani acknowledged that even ordering emergency funds to pay for SNAP might still be painful for some SNAP recipients because it could mean they get less money and that the money they do get could be delayed. “We are dealing with a reality that absent a 100% win for you, the benefits aren’t going to be there on Nov. 1,” she told the plaintiffs.

The hearing came two days before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it can’t continue funding it due to the shutdown.

Other lawsuits have been filed over the program’s suspension, including one filed Thursday in Rhode Island by a coalition of eight cities and community, business and union organizations.

[TITLE]Fashion’s $7B Club: Morgan Stanley Examines Who Has Scale and Who Doesn’t:
[TEXT]
The big leagues in fashion? Call it a cool $7 billion.

That’s the dividing line between a “scaled” business and something less, according to a new analysis by Morgan Stanley analyst Alex Straton.

“The global apparel and footwear market is highly fragmented, with even the largest players only occupying [a low-single-digit] market share,” Straton said in a research report. “In fact, the majority of apparel and footwear companies — nearly 70 percent — sit at less than $1 billion in retail selling value. This is a function of low barriers to entry, and makes for high competitive intensity in the space.

“Looking at the top apparel and footwear companies globally by revenue, less than a third have crossed the $7 billion-plus mark. Indeed, many businesses are ‘stuck’ in the [low- to midsingle-digit] billion dollar top line range — but face either market or management expectations of breaching the rare $7 billion threshold,” she said.

Even the giants have only a sliver of the pie.

Nike logged the largest market share in the study, but still had only 3.5 percent of the global market, looking at retail selling value, which gives the brand full credit for sales through other retailers. The active giant was followed by Zara-parent Inditex (2 percent market share), Adidas (1.8 percent), Uniqlo-parent Fast Retailing (1.2 percent), H&M (1.2 percent), Shein (1.2 percent), Gap (0.9 percent), Anta (0.8 percent), LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (0.7 percent) and VF Corp. (0.6 percent).

As part of the exercise, Straton took 10 key attributes of fashion companies and looked at what the biggest of the big had in common.

The $7 billion-plus club tends to skew toward Western markets, but have good traction across borders, sell more than apparel, lean into their direct-to-consumer business, focus on either mass or luxury with a big lifestyle assortment, more than one brand and heritage. Most companies, small and large, are chasing consumers who are younger and women.

While much of this goes to figure — big brands tend to sell lots of categories and have a long history — Straton also looked to see which companies are ready to move up, or down, to another tier.

Straton said Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and On Holding had scale potential that “may not be fully appreciated by the market” while market revenue expectations for Amer Sports, Gap Inc. and Under Armour Inc. “may be overly optimistic.”

Abercrombie, for instance, has $5.1 billion in revenues, but has most of the traits of companies that have breached $7 billion — lacking only consumer traction away from its home market and a stronger offering beyond apparel.

On the other hand, Morgan Stanley said Under Armour Inc. (which has $5.1 billion in revenues, but more in retail sales value) is punching under its weight. Specifically, the report pointed to its focus on apparel, its reliance on wholesale and its traction with women shoppers and consumers under 35 — areas that are all seen as important to growing very big businesses.

Scale is a topic that is clearly getting a fresh look in fashion.

In Paris, Kering’s new chief executive officer Luca de Meo is going the other way and sharpening the focus, cutting a 4-billion-euro deal to sell its beauty business to L’Oréal while putting a longer timeline on any deal to buy the rest of Valentino.

But many more are looking to go bigger.

Jamie Salter’s brand management giant Authentic Brands Group has built a portfolio with retail sales of over $32 billion and the founder is gunning for $100 billion in sales in short order by continuing to acquire larger companies.

Another big believer in scale is Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat, who’s looking to build the $5.6 billion Coach into a $10 billion business and turn around Kate Spade.

And to get there, one of the big changes the company is making is mental.

Instead of chasing after consumers who bought handbags last year and trying to sell them another one, Tapestry is starting to target everybody who could buy a bag — an addressable market that currently stands at 1.9 billion people for the company.

By that way of seeing things, Coach and Kate Spade have a collective market share of 0.6 percent and plenty of room to grow.

“We’re winning with a new generation of consumers, particularly with the momentum we’re seeing in the Coach brand,” Crevoiserat told WWD last month. “And we’re doing that because we’re not thinking about the market in maybe traditional terms.”

The location, which officially opened Thursday, lays out a global design concept to redefine its retail stores as upscaled and immersive. The opening also sets the groundwork for a renewed push into Europe, a region chief executive officer Dani Reiss frames as both its historic base and a key growth territory.

Despite the Canadian name, “Europe is where it started for us,” Reiss told WWD, with Italy and Scandinavia early territories for its parkas.

Target's merchants and designers have drawn inspiration from traveling to rodeos, ski lodges and college campuses. Some of the retailer's fall accessories have western accents, such as purses with fringe and cowgirl-inspired hats. Melissa Repko | CNBC

MINNEAPOLIS — When shoppers browse Target 's aisles this fall, they will see purses with fringe accents, dresses made of suede-inspired fabrics and hats with a cowgirl flair. As winter comes, they'll find cozy sweaters with a ski lodge spin. Target's creative team has traveled the world to find inspiration for its brands, from a rodeo in Colorado to ski lodges in the French Alps and restaurants in New York's Hudson Valley. With global trips, an artificial intelligence-powered tool and sharper critiques of its own merchandise, the big-box retailer wants to get back to its roots: designing attention-grabbing, fashion-forward clothing and home decor at an affordable price. Target's merchandise was once a competitive advantage, but even the company admits it has lost that edge. The big-box retailer's sales have declined in some categories that it's best known for, such as home goods, as competitors lure away customers. As consumers' enthusiasm for Target's offerings has faded, annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and the company expects sales to decline this year. Shares of Target have tumbled

[TITLE]Amazon shares soar as AI demand boosts cloud revenue — and results fire up CEO Andy Jassy:
[TEXT]
Amazon’s cloud revenue rose at the fastest clip in nearly three years, helping the company forecast quarterly sales above estimates and driving its shares up 14% in after-market trading.

The company projected increased capital spending next year.

The online retailer benefited as businesses continue to spend relentlessly on artificial intelligence software development. Massive cloud demand is helping the tech company ease the pressure from softer growth at its e-commerce business, which is gearing up for the critical holiday season amid weakness in consumer confidence stemming from global trade uncertainty.

The round valued Whatnot at $11.5 billion, the company said in a Tuesday (Oct. 28) post on LinkedIn.

“We started with a simple idea: shopping should be more personal, more connected and more human,” Whatnot said in its post. “That vision has now powered more than $6 billion in live sales this year alone, and we’re just getting started.”

The company added: “We’re building Whatnot to help small business owners and entrepreneurs grow what they love into something bigger.”

Whatnot’s livestream shopping platform offers auctions, flash sales and live show giveaways, according to the company’s website. Its sellers offer products in more than 250 categories, including fashion, coins, sports and Pokémon cards, and sneakers.

The company’s latest funding round was co-led by DST Global and CapitalG, according to its post. CapitalG is Alphabet’s independent growth fund.

CapitalG said in a Tuesday post on LinkedIn that this is the third Whatnot funding round that it has co-led, with the others being a Series C in 2021 and a Series D in 2022.

The company said in the post that it has “more conviction than ever in Whatnot’s trajectory towards building one of the world’s iconic marketplaces.”

Whatnot’s focus on enthusiast communities has created a great marketplace for collectors and hobbyists as well as a livelihood for “hundreds of thousands” of small business owners, CapitalG said in its post.

“The transition to e-commerce made shopping efficient but less personal and significantly less fun,” the company said. “Whatnot has brought the joy of the hunt online, blending storefront, show and community hangout into one platform.”

PYMNTS reported in January that a convergence of physical stores and digital innovations like live shopping a reshaping the future of retail.

Whatnot raised $265 million in a Series E funding round in January. That round valued the live shopping marketplace at $4.97 billion.

The company’s co-founder and CEO, Grant LaFontaine, said at the time that Whatnot was working to promote the mainstreaming of livestream selling.

“We believe there’s a better way to shop online, and it starts with creating a platform where sellers can grow thriving businesses around the things they care about most,” LaFontaine said. “We’ve proven this leads to the happiest experience for consumers and sellers alike.”
