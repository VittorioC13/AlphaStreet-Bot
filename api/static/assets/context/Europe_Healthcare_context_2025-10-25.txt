German pharmaceutical giant Bayer plans to adopt a strong tiered pricing approach worldwide to make its drugs and therapies affordable. However, Stefan Oelrich , head of Bayer's pharmaceuticals division, in an interview with Vikas Dandekar and Teena Thacker underlined the need for returns on its investments for the risks it takes for research . Edited excerpts:I am in favour of rule-based trade around the world. Free trade has been the basis for an incredible creation of wealth for the entire world, independent of regions. On pharmaceuticals, an (US) investigation is ongoing when it comes to trade, and we'll have to see what the outcome is. There have been some trade deals between the EU and the US, given that we have a lot of reciprocal trade. That at least gives us some planning certainty, but the rest must be seen. It's a little bit in flux.Traditionally, we have been strong in cardiovascular and metabolic areas, so all of these are connected. We don't have a specific obesity pipeline project today, but that doesn't mean we're not interested in the overall connection of what's happening in terms of your immune system. In fact, obesity is ultimately an inflammatory process. We target other inflammatory processes, for example protecting the kidney, the heart, and all of this come together. So, reducing weight is one important factor, but not the only one. We are happy where we are. And in R&D, it's like a good sports game: you don't want all the kids on one ball; but you want them distributed along the field to score the most goals.Take our presence in India: more than 120 years, making us probably one of the oldest brands in the country. This holds true in many regions of the world. Investment into innovation goes where there's a good reception for it, and also some level of acceptance of returns on those innovations. Europe was traditionally the "pharmacy of the world." Then it shifted more to the US. Today we have more balance across regions, which now includes China.I would like to characterise it with three As: We need to accelerate, attract, and access. These words essentially sum up my agenda in this presidency. Europe needs to be attractive for investment, both in capital and in terms of people. Europe needs to be faster in approvals, faster in reducing bureaucracy and faster in creating better regulation. We need to accelerate and ultimately, it must ensure strong access to all citizens. One of the most important tasks that we have as innovators is that innovation translates into demand. These three together should make Europe competitive with any region in the world.I think time has never been better for breakthroughs than today in our industry. The increase in knowledge around biology, combined with digital advancements and chemistry, has never been better. Knowledge growth in our sector is almost second to none. In IT, we always talk

What is Hidradenitis Suppurativa?

Hidradenitis suppurativa, also known as acne inversus, is a long-lasting inflammatory skin disorder characterized by deep nodules, abscesses, draining tunnels, and fibrotic scars. These lesions typically develop in intertriginous regions and areas with a high concentration of apocrine glands, with the axillae, groin, perianal, perineal, and inframammary areas being most commonly affected. This activity explores the causes, clinical features, and complications of HS, emphasizing the importance of an interprofessional approach to management. The disease process starts when a defective hair follicle becomes blocked and ruptures, releasing keratin, bacteria, and other contents into the surrounding dermis. This triggers a chemotactic inflammatory response from neutrophils and lymphocytes, which can lead to abscess formation and damage to the pilosebaceous unit and surrounding tissues. The prognosis varies among patients, and no definitive cure has been found. Outcomes are poorer when diagnosis and treatment are delayed, particularly in the early stages, and when comorbidities such as smoking and obesity are not addressed.

Ipsen is set to purchase all issued and outstanding shares of the French biotechnology company ImCheck Therapeutics, which specialises in immuno-oncology therapies.

Ipsen SAS’ fully owned subsidiary will pay ImCheck shareholders €350m ($406.6m) upon completion of the deal without any adjustments for cash or debt.

The agreement also includes provisions for subsequent payments, dependent on the attainment of regulatory milestones and sales targets.

These payments could bring the total value of the transaction to as much as €1bn ($1.16bn).

The transaction, anticipated to be finalised by the end of the first quarter of 2026, hinges on the satisfaction of standard closing conditions and the receipt of necessary regulatory and governmental consents as per US and French laws.

Legal counsel for Ipsen is provided by Allen & Overy Shearman in Paris, while ImCheck has engaged Centerview Partners as its exclusive financial advisor.

For ImCheck, legal advice is being handled by Goodwin in London and Dentons in Paris.

The primary focus of the acquisition is ImCheck’s ICT01, a Phase I/II programme for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia in patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy.

In July 2025, the humanised monoclonal antibody targeting butyrophilin3A (BTN3A), ICT01, received orphan drug status from both the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration.

Ipsen CEO David Loew stated: “At completion, the acquisition of ImCheck Therapeutics presents an opportunity for us to expand our pipeline in oncology and reinforces our commitment to deliver transformative therapies to the people who need them most.

“We feel confident that with the ICT01 promising data combined with Ipsen’s global development and commercialisation expertise, we are well positioned to start a Phase IIb/III trial in 2026.”
