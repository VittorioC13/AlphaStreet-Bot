[TITLE]Welspun taps EY for next big clean-energy stake sale of $100 million:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: Close to a decade after selling its renewables portfolio to Tata Power, billionaire B.K.Goenka’s Welspun World has charted out its next big deal. This time, it has hired EY to sell a majority stake in Welspun New Energy, its clean-energy platform, for an equity value of around $100 million, according to two people aware of the development.

“The sale process has been launched," one of the two people cited above said, requesting anonymity. “The next step involves signing of non-disclosure agreements, post which the financial model and the information memorandum will be shared. After meeting the management for discussions, prospective investors will give their indicative proposals."

Welspun New Energy has 1.2GW of contracted capacity. Of this, 866 mega watt (MW) is contracted with state-run NTPC Ltd, Solar Energy Corporation of India (Seci) and Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. The company also has 3.1GW of projects under development that have transmission connectivity.

Welspun World is an infrastructure development company with a focus on transportation, water and wastewater, oil and gas exploration, and tunnelling segments. In 2016, it had sold its entire 1.1 gigawatt (GW) renewable energy portfolio of Welspun Energy Ltd to Tata Power for $1.4 billion.

An EY spokesperson declined to comment. Queries emailed to a Welspun World spokesperson on late Sunday night remained unanswered till press time.

The proposed sale of Welspun New Energy comes in the backdrop of a major cleanup of India’s green energy contracts.

As reported by Mint earlier, the Union power ministry has directed state-run procurers—Seci, NTPC, NHPC, and SJVN—to cancel contracts by the end of this month where it is not feasible to sign power purchase agreements (PPAs) and power supply agreements (PSAs).

[TITLE]From Oil Giant to Mining Superpower—Saudi Arabia’s Next Big Move:
[TEXT]
In the coming days, the media will push themes related to the upcoming meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and US President Trump in Washington. While most will be looking at the possibilities of Saudi investments in US LNG via Aramco or defense deals, Saudi Arabia’s mineral strategy and opportunities will also be on the table. Geopolitically, Washington will also be interested in Saudi Arabia’s international mining investment strategy, through its national champion, Ma’aden, or its sovereign wealth fund, PIF. In the last few years, under Vision 2030, mining has changed from being the poor cousin of hydrocarbons to the “third pillar” of the economy. Results are impressive, especially given that Riyadh now claims $2.5 trillion in untapped mineral wealth beneath its soil, up from an earlier estimate of $1.3 trillion. MBS wants mining to become a serious contributor to non-oil GDP. Reality at present shows that this means two parallel projects: turning the kingdom itself into a mining province and turning the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Ma’aden into global players in critical minerals supply chains. Both of interest not only to Washington, but also to China, India, and maybe Europe.

The domestic changes have been remarkable, as the Saudi state has done something rare in the mining industry. Riyadh has built a regulatory regime from scratch with capital already lined up. A new mining law, streamlined licensing, and state-funded geoscience have been packaged with generous fiscal terms and a signal that PIF will co-invest where needed. Based on Riyadh's upgraded estimate of mineral resources at $2.5 trillion, talks are ongoing to unlock at least $75 billion in new mining investments over the coming decade.

The message from Saudi Arabia has fallen on fertile ground; international companies have heard it and are acting. Alcoa has long been embedded in the Ma’aden aluminum complex at Ras al-Khair, holding 25.1% stakes in the bauxite, alumina, and smelter JVs. Mosaic partnered with Ma’aden in phosphate, while the international mining giant Barrick set up a 50-50 JV to operate the Jabal Sayid underground copper mine.

Western powers have increased their attention, especially after Asian interest has been materializing. New exploration licenses were awarded to Ajlan & Bros with China’s Zijin Mining and to India’s Vedanta. These licenses cover nearly 4,800 square kilometers of copper, zinc, gold, and silver prospects. At the International Mining Forum 2024 in Riyadh, nine metals and mining deals worth more than $9bn were signed, such as a copper project by Vedanta at Ras al-Khair and a phased zinc–lithium–copper complex by Zijin. Chinese involvement and possible high interest in other projects are worrying the USA and Europe, as they could mean another power play within the Kingdom. Metals and minerals are geopolitical-geo-economic power-play instruments, in which Washington and Beijing are on a collision course.

Saudi mining giant Ma’aden holds the pivotal position in this domestic build-out. While it is majority-owned by PIF (around 65%), the company has behaved like both a national champion and a private company. In recent years, it has ramped up production in gold, phosphates, and aluminum, while now targeting copper and, increasingly, lithium. Signs are clear: based on a non-binding term sheet with Aramco and KAUST to explore a minerals venture focused on energy-transition metals, including lithium extraction from unconventional sources, Saudi Arabia wants to produce, not just import, battery metals by the late 2020s.

The most interesting part of the ongoing strategy is outside of the Kingdom. Since 2023, when Manara Minerals, a JV between PIF and Ma’aden, was established as its dedicated outbound mining arm, significant investments have been made. Manara’s mandate is unequivocal; the company will need to buy into copper, nickel, lithium, and rare-earth assets abroad and use those stakes to secure long-term offtake for the kingdom’s future industries. Main clients inside the Kingdom will be electric vehicles, batteries, data centers, and defence.

The results are impressive, as shown by Manara's $2.5 billion acquisition of a 10% stake in Vale Base Metals, the energy transition division of Brazilian giant Vale. In the next 10 years, Brazil’s Vale expects to spend $25–30bn in copper and nickel projects in Brazil, Canada, and Indonesia. Ambitions are very high; Vale wants to triple copper output and almost double nickel production. By investing in Vale via Manara, the Kingdom is now plugged into the growth. Not only will Riyadh have financial exposure, but it can also negotiate leverage in future supply contracts.

At the same time, Manara’s portfolio is expanding and will continue to grow. At present, the company is in advanced talks to acquire a minority stake in First Quantum’s Zambian copper and nickel assets. At the same time, it is expected to buy 10–20% of Pakistan’s $9bn Reko Diq copper–gold project, which is already seen as a future giant in the global copper industry. The deal, slated to be between $500 million and $1bn, will be done via an equity stake purchased from the Pakistani state. In Africa’s mining hotspot, the Democratic Republic of Congo, PIF and Ma’aden are exploring a $3bn joint venture, combined with other African jurisdictions. Riyadh seems not to be buying control, but adjacency. The strategy is to have enough equity to negotiate supply, technology transfer, and political goodwill, without taking on full operator risk.

In January 2026, the Future Minerals Forum (FMF) 2026 will be held again, the diplomatic theatre for Riyadh’s strategy. Already termed as the “UN of Minerals”, almost like Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative (Davos in the Desert), the forum will be drawing more than 18,000 attendees, 70 ministers, and hundreds of CEOs to discuss mineral security, critical supply chains, and the energy transition. During FMF 2025, 126 agreements and MoUs worth roughly SAR107bn ($28.5bn) were signed across exploration, financing, R&D, and processing. The 2026 version is expected to be even harder hitting, as it is labeled the “Dawn of a Global Cause” in mineral supply chains. In another move, Riyadh has signed or is negotiating mining and critical minerals partnerships with the UK and the United States, explicitly framed around copper, lithium, and nickel for EVs and AI-hungry data centers. MBS’s Washington visit could also address these deals. While the world is talking to Riyadh, it still feels strange to see the lack of movement from Brussels and from companies in its member countries.

Saudi’s approach is not charity, but precise hedging. Europe’s dependence on Russian gas and the US's dependence on Chinese processing have shown Riyadh to act. Saudi experts and officials have concluded that minerals will be the next arena where reliability is priced at a premium. The hedging position is powerful, as for Washington, a Saudi partner in copper, nickel, and rare earths is preferable to a Chinese one. For the UK, especially London, a Gulf hub for critical minerals trade (Riyadh) looks like a hedge against insecure supply from Congo or Indonesia. When looking at the reasons for Saudi Arabia, it is clear that these partnerships convert its cash and its geography into political leverage in capitals that still shape security guarantees and technology flows.

Geo-economics is also clearly at play. Saudi PIF’s own strategy calls for at least $40bn a year in domestic investment and for international assets to make up roughly a quarter of its $1.07trn target balance sheet by 2025. For the Kingdom, mining is the bridge between both, as it is an option to diversify away from oil and to build downstream manufacturing in EVs and defence, while it also inserts itself into value chains that will outlive the Internal Combustion Engine.

The road is clear, successes are there, but it is also full of tensions and constraints. PIF’s governor has said the fund plans to reduce the share of foreign investment by at least 20% to focus more on domestic ventures, even as Manara is told to scale up overseas mining bets. Some analysts are warning that the more capital the kingdom ties up in copper pits in Pakistan and Zambia, the less it has for Vision 2030 white elephants at home. Saudi reality shows that mining is capital-intensive and slow, taking almost a decade from a MoU signed in a Riyadh conference hall to the first ton of copper cathode. MBS and its proponents now need to adjust to a new reality. The MBS political system, which has grown accustomed to immediate, visible mega-projects, now needs to get used to the grind of permitting, community relations, and ESG scrutiny in Congo or Pakistan, which may prove frustrating. Speeding up the process may require the involvement of others, maybe Washington-based players?

At the same time, Riyadh is slowly understanding that its game is not one-sided; there are more players in it. Already inside the Gulf, Saudi Arabia is not the only player, as shown by Abu Dhabi’s ADQ and Mubadala, both exploring critical minerals. Abu Dhabi’s new giant IHC is also targeting mining. At the same time, the Kingdom will need to deal with Qatar’s sovereign vehicles, as they are slowly probing metals supply chains. Within Africa, Saudis will need to confront China’s Zijin, a formidable competitor across Africa and Latin America. At the same time, Saudi Arabia is finding that its pivot to the East (Asia) and its cooperation with China don’t remove the primary market constraint: China’s processing dominance and its grip on many upstream projects.

Mining has also become a primary political tool for Riyadh. Manara’s planned entry into Reko Diq is not just a copper investment, but also a reinforcement of the growing geopolitical and military link with Pakistan. Riyadh is no longer only a critical creditor but also a partner in Islamabad’s foreign-policy balancing. Inside Africa, the situation is very tricky. A serious investment move into Congo will thrust Saudi Arabia into the messy politics of resource nationalism, artisanal mining, and human rights scrutiny that it has so far watched mainly from afar. The capabilities of Saudi officials and diplomats will be challenged.

Still, mining will be on the table in Washington, as a tool for MBS to recalibrate his relations with the Trump Administration and the financial and mining backers available. At present, a US-Saudi mining cooperation agreement is being prepared, with critical minerals explicitly on the agenda alongside more traditional energy and defence issues. MBS’s message will be challenging but also attractive to some. The Crown Prince will tell the White House that the Kingdom is no longer just a swing producer of oil; it wants recognition as a future swing investor in the metals that underpin clean energy, AI, and defence industrial bases. For Washington, the latter is of immense interest, as access to Saudi capital and Saudi-backed offtake will support American and allied mining projects to clear financing hurdles. MBS will want, in return, that Washington shows political recognition of its new role.

The MBS bet is challenging for all sides. It will only be positive if Saudi Arabia can show it can take minority stakes in complex jurisdictions and still secure reliable, ESG-compliant supply without getting sucked into local governance crises. At the same time, the rush for critical assets has already driven up project valuations; the Kingdom could risk overpaying for middling assets. Western countries will need to decide whether they are comfortable swapping some dependence on Chinese processing for a new degree of reliance on a highly centralized Gulf monarchy.

MBS’s theory at present is based on the assessment that in a world where everyone is anxious about securing copper, nickel, and lithium, partners will forgive a lot. Even though MBS’s Vision 2030 started as a blueprint to diversify away from oil, the Kingdom’s mining strategy is its most explicit acknowledgement that Riyadh’s influence in a post-oil world will still be built on the ground beneath other people’s feet.

[TITLE]Strikes And Sanctions On Russian Refineries Drive Up Gasoline and Diesel Prices:
[TEXT]
The ongoing strikes on Russian oil refineries are driving up the cost of gasoline and diesel worldwide. The prices are really noticeable in the United States, Europe, and Asia.

Ukraine has targeted oil depots, processing plants, and metering stations with drones and missiles, calling them legitimate facilities that support Russia’s “war machine.” Russia, in turn, has struck elements of Ukraine’s power grid, saying the infrastructure supports the Ukrainian military, accoridng to a report by RT.

Back in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the West should be on the hook for repairing the damage done to its oil infrastructure by Ukraine during the war.

Putin: The West Should Repair The Damage Done By Ukraine To Oil Infrastructure

“Since they [the Western companies] are… interested in restoring the facility’s operational capacity, then let them arrange for the necessary equipment delivery despite all the sanctions,” Putin said. He added that the CPC shareholders would be doing this “for their own benefit” anyway. Moscow will provide the necessary assistance, he noted. –SHTFPlan

Bloomberg reported on Saturday that these attacks, combined with outages at key plants in Asia and Africa, have removed millions of barrels of diesel and gasoline from the global market, the outlet said. United States sanctions on Russian energy giants Lukoil and Rosneft in October, along with restrictions imposed by the EU, have also helped drive prices higher.

Refining margins in the US, Europe, and Asia are now at their highest levels for this time of year since at least 2018, Bloomberg said, citing its own calculations. Additional pressure has come from shutdowns and outages at refineries in Kuwait and Nigeria.

In August, Hungary imposed sanctions on Ukraine’s top drone commander, Robert Brovdi, after repeated strikes disrupted the flow of crude through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline.

Ukraine’s New Attack on A Key Pipeline

Continued attacks on refineries coupled with sanctions will continue to raise the cost of oil globally, and the most affected humans will be those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.

[TITLE]FireFly Metals announces Mineral Resource increased by 51% at Green Bay Copper Gold Project, Canada:
[TEXT]
Exceptional result includes a spectacular high-grade Mineral Resource of 8.8Mt @ 3.9% CuEq (346kt CuEq) in M&I and 10.9Mt @ 3.8% CuEq (414kt CuEq) in Inferred categories; This recently established high-grade core zone stands to deliver huge benefits to the Project’s development potential, particularly in the early years

KEY POINTS

Substantial Mineral Resource Increase and Upgrade:

Green Bay Mineral Resource increases to 50.4Mt @ 2.0% copper equivalent (CuEq) 1 in the Measured and Indicated (M&I) categories and 29.3Mt @ 2.5% CuEq in the Inferred Mineral Resource category (Inferred)

The total contained metal and total tonnes have increased significantly Contained copper increases to 863kt M&I (+113%) plus 566kt Inferred Contained gold increases to 546koz M&I (+174%) plus 563koz Inferred (+62%)

A newly established high-grade core zone of the Mineral Resource includes 8.8Mt @ 3.9% CuEq in the M&I and 10.9Mt @ 3.8% CuEq in the Inferred Resource categories

Importantly, the highly valuable M&I categories of Mineral Resource at the Ming Deposit have grown by 121% (from 21.5Mt to 47.5Mt) and now make up 67% of the Ming Deposit Mineral Resource. This is significant as the M&I Resources will underpin economic studies

The Outlook – Mineral Resource growth and upgrades, eight rigs, economic studies, offtake discussions, regional discoveries:

The mineralisation remains completely open, including in the high-grade core zone, where the furthest step-out hole ever drilled on the edge of this Mineral Resource graded 49m @ 6.1% CuEq (including 14.3m @ 13.7% CuEq) (see ASX announcement dated 16 October 2025)

(see ASX announcement dated 16 October 2025) Scope for further growth is also shown by the large high-tenor Down Hole Electro-Magnetic (DHEM) conductor extending well beyond the boundary of the Mineral Resource

Drilling is underway to convert more Inferred Mineral Resources (29.3Mt @ 2.5% CuEq) to M&I for the economic studies; A large portion of the high-grade core comprises Inferred Mineral Resources, including drill hole MUG25-202 which returned 49.0m @ 6.1% CuEq, highlighting the strong scope for M&I growth

Given the potentially significant impact on the economic studies of the large amount of recently discovered high-grade mineralisation, particularly in the early years, FireFly intends to release the study results in the first half of 2026

Six rigs will continue drilling underground into 2026 while surface drill rigs will test the abundant targets generated by recent geophysics and field activities

Discussions with potential offtake customers, export credit agencies and other commercial entities regarding funding options are underway; Initial talks reveal a strong appetite for the Company’s Green Bay concentrate, with several confidentiality agreements already signed

FireFly had A$129.7M in cash, receivables and liquid investments at 30 September 2025

FireFly Managing Director Steve Parsons said: “This outstanding result cements Green Bay’s status as one of the most compelling copper development projects in the world.

“In just 12 months, we have grown the total Mineral Resource significantly. At the same time, we have established a high-grade core which stands to deliver huge benefits to the Project’s development potential, particularly in the initial years of production.

“We will maintain our relentless push to create shareholder value, with eight rigs on the job, to upgrade more of Inferred Mineral Resources to Measured and Indicated and to make new regional discoveries.

“And the appetite for our product is clearly very strong, with several parties signing confidentiality agreements and talks on offtake and funding progressing well.”

PERTH, Australia, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FireFly Metals Ltd (ASX, TSX: FFM) (Company or FireFly) is pleased to announce a substantial Mineral Resource increase comprising strong growth in tonnes, grade and contained metal at its Green Bay Copper-Gold Project in Newfoundland, Canada.

The Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) as updated in this announcement (November 2025 MRE) now stands at 50.4Mt @ 2.0% for 1Mt CuEq in the higher confidence Measured and Indicated (M&I) classifications plus an additional 29.3Mt @ 2.5% for 722kt CuEq in the Inferred category (Table 1). This represents a 35% increase in tonnes and a 51% increase in CuEq metal from the Mineral Resource Estimate announced by the Company on 29 October 2024 (October 2024 MRE).

Importantly, the MRE contains a zone of higher-grade material comprised of volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) mineralisation plus the recently discovered ‘core zone’ which totals 8.8Mt @ 3.9% CuEq in M&I and a further 10.9Mt @ 3.8% CuEq in the Inferred category.

Copper remains the dominant metal in the MRE (863kt M&I plus 566kt Inferred Resources) with gold forming an important by-product (546koz M&I plus 563koz Inferred Resources). Silver is also present in significant quantities in the latest MRE (5.0Moz M&I plus 4.8Moz Inferred Resources).

The total discovery cost per estimated tonne of CuEq metal added in this MRE is exceptionally low at C$25.122 (US$17.83) per tonne.

The Ming Deposit has been sampled exclusively by diamond drilling. A total of 1,334 diamond holes for a total drilled meterage of 319,534m was used to estimate the November 2025 MRE.

The Mineral Resource consists of two components, namely the Ming Deposit (47.5Mt @ 2.0% CuEq M&I plus 23.1Mt @ 2.6% CuEq Inferred) and the Little Deer deposit (2.9Mt @ 2.3% CuEq M&I plus 6.2Mt @ 1.8% CuEq Inferred). All growth has come from the Ming Deposit with the Little Deer MRE remaining unchanged since the October 2024 MRE.

TONNES COPPER GOLD SILVER CuEq (Mt) Grade Metal Grade Metal Grade Metal Grade (%) (‘000 t) (g/t) (‘000 oz) (g/t) (‘000 oz) (%) Measured 6.3 1.5 94 0.3 50 1.9 388 1.7 Indicated 44.1 1.7 769 0.4 496 3.3 4,638 2.1 TOTAL M&I 50.4 1.7 863 0.3 546 3.1 5,026 2.0 Inferred 29.3 1.9 566 0.6 563 5.1 4,810 2.5

Table 1: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Green Bay Copper-Gold Project as at 10 November 2025. The Mineral Resource is reported at a 1% copper cut-off. Gold-rich 1806 and 1807 VMS domains have been reported at a 1% CuEq cut-off. The same cut-off grade and metal equivalent parameters have been applied to the November 2025 MRE as the superseded October 2024 MRE to allow like-for-like comparisons. Refer to following sections of this announcement and Appendix B ‘JORC Table 1’ for further details on the MRE.

Both the Ming Deposit and Little Deer estimates have been prepared in accordance with the 2012 Edition of the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code 2012) and Canadian National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101). The MRE was completed by external independent consulting groups.

The November 2025 MRE saw significant increases across key categories (Figures 1 and 2). The increase in the Mineral Resource has been driven primarily by the successful growth strategy implemented by FireFly since it acquired Green Bay in October 2023. Over 2,300m of underground development has been mined at Green Bay’s Ming Deposit to position the drill rigs to effectively test down-plunge extensions of the high-grade VMS mineralisation and broad footwall copper stringer zone (FWZ).

Up to six underground rigs have been operating since the October 2024 MRE was completed and an additional 78,165m of drilling has been used to prepare this latest MRE (Figure 3).

The Company’s focus on upgrading areas of lesser drill spacing into higher confidence Mineral Resources is reflected by the 107% increase in the tonnes of M&I material. The M&I portion of the MRE increased from 24.4Mt in the October 2024 MRE to 50.4Mt in this MRE. Importantly, the M&I grade also increased despite the substantial increase in tonnes and now sits at 2.02% CuEq (+7%). M&I Mineral Resources now constitute 63% of the total MRE, which is significant because only the higher confidence M&I Mineral Resources can be used in future feasibility studies.

Overall, Inferred Mineral Resources decreased by 15%. This was primarily due to the successful conversion of 26Mt of Inferred material into the M&I category by infill drilling. The conversion was partially offset by the discovery of extensive down-plunge extensions of the Ming mineralisation up to 700m beyond the extent of the October 2024 MRE. The furthest step out hole into the mineralisation returned 49.0m @ 6.1% CuEq and remains open (see ASX announcement dated 16 October 2025). This intersection forms the limit of the November 2025 MRE.

The grade of copper and precious metals has significantly increased in the Inferred MRE due primarily to increasing grade at depth from the recent drilling. Drilling from the higher-grade core zone (see ASX announcement dated 27 October 2025) where the VMS and FWZ converge has been incorporated into this estimate in the Inferred category. Significant intersections from this zone include 86.3m @ 3.7% CuEq, 43.6m @ 7.6% CuEq and 44.5m @ 3.7% CuEq (see ASX announcement dated 27 October 2025). The Inferred MRE grade stands at 2.5% CuEq up from 2.0% CuEq in the October 2024 MRE. The grade of gold has almost doubled and now stands at 0.6g/t due to the addition of the higher-grade VMS material.

Furthermore, the addition of more VMS material in the latest MRE has seen contained gold in the MRE increase by 103% to now exceed 1.1Moz (546koz in M&I plus 563koz in Inferred). Silver has also increased significantly by 84% to total 9.8Moz (5.0Moz in M&I plus 4.8Moz in Inferred).

Figure 2: Year on Year changes between the October 2024 MRE and November 2025 MRE for Tonnes, Grade and Contained Metal. This latest estimate has seen significant year-on-year increases in tonnes, grades and metal content.

With latest gold metallurgical testwork indicating recoveries of 85% (see ASX announcement dated 5 August 2025), gold will provide substantial by-product revenue in any potential future mining operation.

This November 2025 MRE is reported using a 1% copper cut-off grade, the same as the previous October 2024 MRE. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the potential scale of the Project increases significantly as the cut-off grade is lowered (Table 2). At a 0.6% copper cut-off, the estimate increases to 79.1Mt @ 1.7% for 1.2Mt CuEq in M&I plus 38.7Mt @ 2.1% for 804kt CuEq in Inferred. Both bulk and selective mining options will be contemplated as part of future economic evaluations.

Forward Work Plans

Near-term drilling activities at the Green Bay Copper-Gold Project will continue to focus on three key areas: Upgrading the Mineral Resource (with infill drilling results), Mineral Resource Growth, and New Discoveries from both underground and surface. Six underground rigs will continue to advance the underground Mineral Resource growth for the foreseeable future and into 2026.

Green Bay - Ming Deposit Mineral Resource

The MRE update in this announcement is the result of the low-cost Mineral Resource growth strategy underpinned by drilling from the 805L exploration drive at the Ming Mine. Further mining of additional drill platforms is underway with the aim of delivering additional Mineral Resources in 2026.

Drilling from underground will prioritise conversion of the higher grade 29Mt of Inferred Mineral Resources into the higher confidence M&I category in preparation for the Feasibility Study expected to be completed in the second half of 2026 (Figure 5). In a Feasibility Study, only the higher confidence Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources can be used in developing the mine economics and therefore maximising M&I is critical to demonstrate the true scale and economic potential of the deposit.

Figure 5: 2025-2026 drilling plan showing continued conversion of Inferred Mineral Resources (green) into the higher confidence Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources (yellow) ready for economic studies in 2026.

Green Bay (Ming Mine) Upscaled Project Development

Work on the development of the upscaled resumption of mining at the Ming Mine is well underway. The MRE in this announcement will underpin the first Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) study planned for completion in the first half of 2026.

Detailed mine design, scheduling and economic analysis based on the updated MRE in this announcement by both external consultants and the FireFly engineering team will now commence.

Ausenco continue to complete detailed engineering design work on the potential future processing facility. Further metallurgical testwork is underway to assess options to further optimise recovery of by-product precious metals from the Ming Deposit. This work has the potential to add significantly to the economics of the future mine, with the latest MRE containing 1.1Moz of gold and 9.8Moz of silver.

Design work has commenced in conjunction with local company Shoreline Aggregates Inc. to jointly develop an additional berth suitable for the export of copper concentrate from the nearby Pine Cove port (only 5km away). This work will continue into the new year, and the costings will be included in the PEA.

Company representatives and Directors have met with numerous offtake groups, sovereign credit export agencies and other commercial entities to discuss potential future funding pathways as the Project rapidly progresses towards feasibility. The appetite for the concentrate from the Ming Mine appears strong with numerous confidentiality agreements being signed with these counterparties. The financing strategy will be ongoing as the various scenarios for an upscaled restart to operations are being evaluated. With the significant increase in this latest MRE, the Company wishes to avoid unnecessarily limiting the size of any future potential upscaled mining operation until it has completed further economic assessment.

Following the recent conditional release from further Environmental Assessment by the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador for a start-up mining and processing operation (see ASX announcement dated 5 August 2025), the Company continues to apply for permits to commence early works and construction. The Company intends to commence selective low-cost seasonal early works in the coming months to prepare the Project for future development and construction.

Green Bay (Ming Mine) Regional Discovery

Regional exploration is underway with two surface drill rigs testing high-priority targets across the Company’s 346km2 surface exploration claims.

One of the drill rigs will continue to test high-priority targets close to the Ming Mine. The second drill rig will systematically test early-stage greenfields targets generated by airborne VTEM and magnetic surveys completed in 2024 and 2025.

FireFly has continued to invest in regional-scale geophysics as a key exploration tool. The Company is completing a detailed VTEM survey over the 115km2 Tilt Cove Project. A detailed helicopter magnetic survey is also being completed over the central Green Bay leases.

Figure 6: Key 2024-2025 milestones for the Green Bay Copper-Gold Project.

Timelines are indicative and may be subject to change.

Funding and Corporate Activities

The Company remains well funded to complete its accelerated exploration growth strategy and economic studies as the Project further advances toward rapid low-cost development. Cash, receivables and liquid investments total A$129.7M at 30 September 2025 (see ASX announcement dated 30 October 2025).

[TITLE]Spirit Blockchain Capital Inc. Provides Corporate Update on Business Strategy and Clarifies Operating Model:
[TEXT]
Vancouver, British Columbia, Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spirit Blockchain Capital Inc. (CSE: SPIR) (“Spirit” or the “Company”) is providing this corporate update to describe the Company’s current operating business and its execution of the business model and disclosures set out in the Company’s non-offering long form prospectus dated August 8, 2022 (the “Prospectus”). The Prospectus was filed to qualify Spirit as a reporting issuer in British Columbia and Ontario and in connection with the Company’s listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”).

Current Business of the Company

Spirit is a Canadian public company that develops, operates, and commercializes blockchain-based financial and technology infrastructure. The Company’s activities focus on enabling regulated digital-asset participation, tokenization, and payments for institutions and other compliant market participants. Spirit’s operating pillars are:

Licensing and Technology - Digital Asset / Tokenization Platform (SpiritLinQ)

Spirit is working on advancing the development and licensing of SpiritLinQ, a platform for the creation, issuance, lifecycle administration, and reporting of tokenized assets. Targeted capabilities include issuer/investor onboarding (KYC/KYB), primary issuance and settlement, corporate actions and distributions, role-based permissions with audit trails, connectivity to qualified custodians/market infrastructure, and investor/issuer reporting.

Support of European Digital-Asset ETPs

Spirit provides strategic and infrastructure support to a European partner in Switzerland for digital-asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) that are listed in Europe (e.g., SIX Swiss Exchange and Deutsche Börse). Current products supported include Ethereum Yield+ and Solana Yield+. These are European-listed products; Spirit does not distribute these products in Canada, and they are not offered by Spirit to Canadian or U.S. investors. Spirit’s role relates to underlying digital-asset and infrastructure support consistent with its broader blockchain-infrastructure strategy.

Strategic Operating Subsidiaries

Spirit holds and operates Canadian and international subsidiaries and business lines that complement and extend the Company’s infrastructure strategy (software/infrastructure operations, validator/transaction services, and treasury operations aligned to the platform). These are operating components of Spirit’s commercial strategy and are not held for passive investment purposes. Spirit is not operating as an “investment company” or an “investment fund” under Canadian securities laws.

Payments and Transaction Enablement

Spirit is building infrastructure for secure, compliant blockchain-related payments and settlement, including fiat on/off-ramps, stablecoin rails, and cross-border workflows with integrated AML screening and monitoring.

Spirit’s revenue model (current and intended) spans platform licensing and administration fees (SpiritLinQ), processing/spread/FX fees (payments enablement), infrastructure/service retainers (European ETP support), and enterprise software/infrastructure and validator services. The model is providing nominal revenue but is not yet profitable.

Spirit’s principal business is the operation and commercialization of technology and financial-infrastructure solutions in the blockchain and digital-asset sector. The Company is actively involved in the business as described above. While Spirit may from time to time hold interests in subsidiaries or structured products which are incidental to its infrastructure strategy, such holdings are strategic and operational, intended to support revenue-generating platforms and services, and do not constitute the operation of a fund manager, portfolio manager, or pooled investment vehicle.

The Company’s infrastructure-first operating model today builds on and extends the business lines described in Spirit’s August 8, 2022 Prospectus. The Prospectus described Spirit’s then-current operating pillars as: Streaming & Royalties, Treasury Management & Proof-of-Staking, Advisory & Research Services, and Licensing & Franchising IT Solutions. The Prospectus also outlined Spirit’s treasury and staking activities, including holdings primarily in Bitcoin and Ethereum and the use of third-party staking to generate crypto-denominated income, along with exploration of streaming/royalty arrangements to support miners/validators. These treasury and staking activities are incidental to the primary technology business. Consistent with that disclosure, Spirit’s evolution into platform licensing (SpiritLinQ), compliant payments enablement, validator/infrastructure services, and European ETP infrastructure support represents a natural progression of the Company’s infrastructure strategy from 2022 towards recurring technology and infrastructure revenues while remaining within the technology and blockchain-infrastructure mandate disclosed in the Prospectus.

[TITLE]Welspun taps EY for next big clean-energy stake sale of $100 million:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: Close to a decade after selling its renewables portfolio to Tata Power, billionaire B.K.Goenka’s Welspun World has charted out its next big deal. This time, it has hired EY to sell a majority stake in Welspun New Energy, its clean-energy platform, for an equity value of around $100 million, according to two people aware of the development.

“The sale process has been launched," one of the two people cited above said, requesting anonymity. “The next step involves signing of non-disclosure agreements, post which the financial model and the information memorandum will be shared. After meeting the management for discussions, prospective investors will give their indicative proposals."

Welspun New Energy has 1.2GW of contracted capacity. Of this, 866 mega watt (MW) is contracted with state-run NTPC Ltd, Solar Energy Corporation of India (Seci) and Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. The company also has 3.1GW of projects under development that have transmission connectivity.

Welspun World is an infrastructure development company with a focus on transportation, water and wastewater, oil and gas exploration, and tunnelling segments. In 2016, it had sold its entire 1.1 gigawatt (GW) renewable energy portfolio of Welspun Energy Ltd to Tata Power for $1.4 billion.

An EY spokesperson declined to comment. Queries emailed to a Welspun World spokesperson on late Sunday night remained unanswered till press time.

The proposed sale of Welspun New Energy comes in the backdrop of a major cleanup of India’s green energy contracts.

As reported by Mint earlier, the Union power ministry has directed state-run procurers—Seci, NTPC, NHPC, and SJVN—to cancel contracts by the end of this month where it is not feasible to sign power purchase agreements (PPAs) and power supply agreements (PSAs).

[TITLE]China And India Lead The Green Charge As Renewables Generate More Energy Than Coal For The First Time:
[TEXT]
The threat to our planet and its ecosystems is no secret, and we’re all doing what we can to combat the climate crisis – except for the fossil fuel giants, that is.

And after the first tipping point was passed, everything felt a bit bleak – there was a sense that there was little hope when some of the most beautiful parts of our world are being destroyed.

But thanks to a new report from global energy think-tank Ember, there is at least a little reason to be hopeful: in the first half of 2025, global green energy growth outpaced demand for the first time ever.

If nothing else, on the ‘saving the planet’ front, that’s at least something to smile about.

This is all thanks to a steady growth in solar and wind power, with continuous investment in and development of renewables starting to redress the balance with dirty fossil-fuel based energy.

This is exciting for the future of the planet, as Ember’s Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka explained in a statement:

“We are seeing the first signs of a crucial turning point. Solar and wind are now growing fast enough to meet the world’s growing appetite for electricity. This marks the beginning of a shift where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth.”

While electricity demand increased by 2.6% in the first half of 2025, so did renewable output, with Ember explaining that solar power met 83% of that rise in demand.

Even more excitingly, renewables generated more energy worldwide than coal in the first half of 2025, which is a great step forward in limiting the exploitation of the Earth’s resources.

But the shameful truth is that powers in the global West aren’t leading the charge, as one might hope. In fact, the generation of fossil fuels by the US and EU the generation of power from fossil fuels increased, a huge backwards step.

At the same time, China led the growth in renewables, with more solar and wind power contributed to the world’s energy generation than anywhere else in the world. In India, meanwhile, renewables growth was three times the increase in demand.

While this is positive news, it’s clear that it’s time the Western governments and energy sectors step up and contribute to renewable energy generations, and in turn work on saving the planet we all hold so dear.

[TITLE]Future data centers are driving up forecasts for energy demand. States want proof they’ll get built:
[TEXT]
By MARC LEVY

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they’ll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.

But the challenges — some say the impossibility — of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.

One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built — eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.

The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that’s ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.

Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas — such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.

“There’s speculation in there,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. “Nobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what’s speculative, what’s double-counting, what’s real, what’s not.”

[TITLE]Decoding the Fine Print: An Investor’s Guide to Energy Contracts:
[TEXT]
For traditional energy, investors must focus on the Net Revenue Interest and post-production deductions to calculate true cash flow, while for renewables, the quality of the PPA (fixed vs. indexed) and the creditworthiness of the off-taker are the most critical factors.

The primary dilemma for investors is choosing between companies exposed to volatile spot prices, known as merchant risk, and those that have engineered revenue certainty through fixed-price agreements, which command premium valuations.

A company's contract portfolio, including Power Purchase Agreements for renewables and leases/PSAs for traditional energy, is a more accurate indicator of financial stability and valuation than its headline production or resource capacity.

[TITLE]EIB provides EUR 100 million loan to Orkuveitan for green infrastructure development:
[TEXT]
The European Investment Bank (EIB) – the EU’s climate bank – and Orkuveitan have signed a EUR 100 million loan agreement, with disbursements available over the next two years. The financing will support the development of sustainable energy and utility infrastructure operated by Orkuveitan’s subsidiary, Veitur Utilities, serving the capital area of Iceland.

The investment forms part of a long-term programme to strengthen critical infrastructure and meet the growing demand for renewable heating, electricity and hot water in the Reykjavík region. Rapid population growth has increased the need for new housing and, consequently, for expanded utility networks and the renewal of existing systems.

The funds will be used to enhance geothermal heat production and reinforce the electricity distribution network, ensuring that the region’s energy systems can meet increasing needs driven by electrification, economic growth and Iceland’s transition toward carbon neutrality by 2040.

Sævar Freyr Þráinsson, CEO of Orkuveitan:

“This financing marks an important step towards ensuring secure, sustainable and affordable energy for the capital area in the years ahead. By strengthening the electricity distribution network, we are enhancing supply security, and by expanding geothermal heat production, we are preparing our community for continued growth, energy transition and Iceland’s carbon neutrality target by 2040. This is a vital investment in infrastructure that will benefit households, businesses and future generations.”

Karl Nehammer, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank:

“Long-term investment in sustainable energy systems is essential for resilient and affordable infrastructure. By financing Orkuveitan’s green infrastructure programme, the EIB is supporting Iceland’s energy transition and helping the capital region prepare for continued growth with clean, reliable and secure energy.”

The EIB loan will help address market challenges that can limit optimal investment levels, such as environmental externalities and the need to ensure secure access to heat and electricity — services with significant public value.
