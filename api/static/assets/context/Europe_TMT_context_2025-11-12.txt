[TITLE]Nexperia: Battle over Chinese chip maker rocks global car industry:

Battle over Chinese chip maker rocks global car industry

1 day ago Share Save Suranjana Tewari Asia Business Correspondent Share Save

Reuters

In late September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era emergency law to take control of a Chinese-owned chip company that has operations in the country. The extraordinary move set off a chain of events that sent shock waves through the global motor industry – already battered by US tariffs and China's curbs on rare earth exports. In a statement to the Netherlands parliament, the minister of economic affairs cited "serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia" that "posed a threat". "This measure is highly exceptional and intended solely to ensure that the continuity of supply and safeguarding of critical technologies for the Dutch and European economy are not put at risk," the statement said. Beijing reacted furiously, accusing the Netherlands of political interference. It imposed export controls and halted deliveries of Nexperia chips from its Chinese facilities to Europe, while shipments of key supplies needed to make chips in China were frozen. The disruption caused to the motor industry highlighted a major weakness in the global supply chain of chips vital to car production and opened yet another front in the rivalry between the US and China. The Chinese government has now granted exemptions to export controls on the chips for civilian applications but has not clarified what it considers those to be. But Chinese authorities still want the Dutch to revoke the takeover of Nexperia. "China welcomes the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible," the commerce ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Nexperia's parent company Wingtech Technology did not respond to a BBC request for comment.

Weaponising supply chains

At the centre of the dispute is a critical part of the world's chip ecosystem. Nexperia makes so called "legacy" or "building block" semiconductors that are vital for everything from power-steering and airbags to central locking systems. These are not cutting-edge chips, but they are still indispensable. Some vehicles contain hundreds of them, and Nexperia supplies chips to major carmakers around the world. Around 70%-80% of its output is sent to China for processing, testing and packaging – a dependence that has left car makers exposed to Beijing's control over supply chains. "Car markers blindsided by the Nexperia mess should be hiring new supply chain management executives, as they clearly learned nothing from Covid... and excessive reliance on [Chinese] supply chains," China watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter. It underscores China's ability to choke off global supply chains - just as it did with rare earth exports. Similar to critical minerals, China can hold the West hostage with control of a company as inconspicuously important as Nexperia, according to Bill Echikson, Senior Fellow for the Tech Policy Program at Center for European Policy Analysis.

[TITLE]Lovable says it’s nearing 8 million users as the year-old AI coding startup eyes more corporate employees:
[TEXT]
Lovable, the Stockholm-based AI coding platform, is closing in on 8 million users, CEO Anton Osika told this editor during a sit-down on Monday, a major jump from the 2.3 million active users number the company shared in July. Osika said the company — which was founded almost exactly one year ago — is also seeing “100,000 new products built on Lovable every single day.”

The metrics suggest rapid growth of the startup, which has raised $228 million in total funding to date, including a $200 million round this summer that valued the company at $1.8 billion. Rumors have swirled in recent weeks — potentially sparked by its own investors — that new backers want to invest at a $5 billion valuation, though Osika said the company isn’t capital constrained and declined to discuss fundraising plans.

Speaking to me onstage at the Web Summit event in Lisbon, Osika notably didn’t mention another number: Lovable’s current annual recurring revenue. The company, which uses a mix of free and paid tiers, hit $100 million in ARR this June, a milestone it shared publicly. But questions have emerged since

The Senate Agriculture Committee published its draft crypto market structure legislation on Monday, bringing the body a necessary step closer to advancing its answer to the House of Representatives' Clarity Act legislation to define how exactly the Commodity Futures Trading Commission can oversee spot market trading.

The draft bill, which still includes brackets indicating sections where lawmakers have yet to fully agree on details, marks a major step toward the government delineating where the CFTC's jurisdiction ends and the Securities and Exchange Commission's jurisdiction begins — a key question that only Congress can answer as these federal agencies ramp up their own efforts to publish guidance for crypto companies and other firms hoping to offer crypto-related services in the U.S.

Canton of Zug, Switzerland and Singapore, November 10, 2025 -- Ad-Hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 of SIX Listing Rules – WISeKey International Holding AG (“WISeKey”) (Nasdaq: WKEY; SIX: WIHN), a global leader in cybersecurity, digital identity, and IoT solutions platform, and Columbus Acquisition Corp. (“Columbus”) (Nasdaq: COLA), a Cayman Islands publicly traded special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), today announced that they have entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2025 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), for a business combination of Columbus and WISeKey’s wholly owned subsidiary, WISeSat.Space Corp. (“WISeSat”), a British Virgin Islands holding company that wholly-owns WISeKey’s operating subsidiary WISeSat.Space AG, resulting in a public company listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange to be named WISeSat.Space Holdings Corp. (“Pubco”). Upon closing, pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, WISeKey will receive 25.0 million shares in Pubco at $10 per share and retain majority ownership. The transaction is currently expected to close in the first half of 2026.

WISESAT OVERVIEW

WISeSat, through its subsidiary WISeSat.Space AG, provides a next-generation satellite platform, developed by WISeKey and WISeSat, designed to deliver secure, cost-effective, and globally accessible IoT connectivity. Leveraging post-quantum cryptographic chips of SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES) ("SEALSQ"), a company that focuses on developing and selling Semiconductors, PKI, and Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products and also subsidiary of WISeKey, WISeSat satellites are equipped with advanced encryption, authentication, and identity management systems, including WISeKey’s Root of Trust and WISeID. These satellites enable real-time, quantum-resilient communication for industries such as logistics, agriculture, energy, and defense. With support for Hedera distributed ledger technology, WISeSat technology is designed to ensure data integrity and transparency across its decentralized network. The constellation is part of a broader initiative to safeguard digital communications against emerging quantum threats while enabling scalable, autonomous IoT infrastructure from space. WISeSat and its partners have launched 22 satellites in orbit with 14 of these currently operational as part of its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation. WISeSat is actively expanding this network and is aiming to deploy a total of 100 satellites by 2030. These satellites are designed to provide secure, post-quantum IoT connectivity for industries such as agriculture, logistics, defense, and environmental monitoring.

In November 2025, WISeSat is set to launch its next-generation post-quantum-secure satellite, which is equipped with SEALSQ’s Quantum Shield technology, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. This satellite will serve as a testbed for post-quantum communication protocols from space, a pivotal step in developing quantum-resilient satellite-based IoT connectivity via satellite infrastructure.

Vaishnavi Srinivasagopalan, a skilled Indian IT professional who has worked in both India and the US, has been looking for work in China. Beijing's new K-visa programme targeting science and technology workers could turn that dream into a reality.

The K-visa rolled out by Beijing last month is part of China's widening effort to catch up with the US in the race for global talent and cutting edge technology.

It coincides with uncertainties over the US' H-1B programme under tightened immigrations policies implemented by US President Donald Trump.

“(The) K-visa for China (is) an equivalent to the H-1B for the US,” said Srinivasagopalan, who is intrigued by China's working environment and culture after her father worked at a Chinese university a few years back. “It is a good option for people like me to work abroad.”

The K-visa supplements China's existing visa schemes including the R-visa for foreign professionals, but with loosened requirements, such as not requiring an applicant to have a job offer before applying.

Stricter US policies toward foreign students and scholars under Trump, including the raising of fees for the H-1B visa for foreign skilled workers to $100,000 for new applicants, are leading some non-American professionals and students to consider going elsewhere.

“Students studying in the US hoped for an (H-1B) visa, but currently this is an issue,” said Bikash Kali Das, an Indian masters student of international relations at Sichuan University in China.

China wants more foreign tech professionals

China is striking while the iron is hot.

The ruling Communist Party has made global leadership in advanced technologies a top priority, paying massive government subsidies to support research and development of areas such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors and robotics.

“Beijing perceives the tightening of immigration policies in the US as an opportunity to position itself globally as welcoming foreign talent and investment more broadly,” said Barbara Kelemen, associate director and head of Asia at security intelligence firm Dragonfly.

Unemployment among Chinese graduates remains high, and competition is intense for jobs in scientific and technical fields. But there is a skills gap China's leadership is eager to fill. For decades, China has been losing top talent to developed countries as many stayed and worked in the US and Europe after they finished studies there.

The brain drain has not fully reversed.

Many Chinese parents still see Western education as advanced and are eager to send their children abroad, said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.

Still, in recent years, a growing number of professionals, including AI experts, scientists and engineers have moved to China from the US, including Chinese-Americans.

Fei Su, a chip architect at Intel, and Ming Zhou, a leading engineer at US-based software firm Altair, were among those who have taken teaching jobs in China this year.

HONG KONG -- Vaishnavi Srinivasagopalan, a skilled Indian IT professional who has worked in both India and the U.S., has been looking for work in China. Beijing's new K-visa program targeting science and technology workers could turn that dream into a reality.

The K-visa rolled out by Beijing last month is part of China’s widening effort to catch up with the U.S. in the race for global talent and cutting edge technology. It coincides with uncertainties over the U.S.'s H-1B program under tightened immigrations policies implemented by President Donald Trump.

[TITLE]Before spectrum goes under the hammer, telcos make an urgent plea:
[TEXT]
Bharti Airtel Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have called for sharply lowering the base price for the next spectrum auctions and extending the spectrum usage period to as long as 40 years. In submissions made to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the telecom operators said this is needed to ensure robust network expansion and accelerate 5G deployment.

The request, which comes ahead of the next spectrum auction likely early next year, reflects persistent concerns among operators that steep reserve prices are stifling investment, leaving valuable airwaves unsold, and ultimately undermining the government’s Digital India vision. Having cheaper airwaves is necessary to free up capital for network infrastructure, the telecom companies said.

“Excessively high reserve prices keep valuable spectrum idle and result in operators facing capacity and capital constraints," Rahul Vatts, chief regulatory officer of Bharti Airtel, stated in a submission to Trai. He said spectrum that remains unsold or underutilized due to inflated pricing is a "direct loss to the country," delaying network expansion and degrading service quality. By reducing costs, operators could redirect capital toward “network densification, faster 5G rollout, and wider rural coverage."

Spectrum represents a critical revenue stream for the government, which sets a base price and expects companies to bid higher. A premium over the reserve price translates into higher government revenue. However, aggressive bidding has eased since 2021, with most of the airwaves sold near reserve prices—a shift driven by industry consolidation, high base prices, and the financial burden of recent 5G rollouts.

Reliance Jio, India's largest telco by market share, urged Trai to recommend a reserve price set at 50% of the spectrum valuation, arguing that the current valuation of 70% is "too steep and not conducive of wider participation." Jio contended that this aggressive pricing prevents genuine price discovery and competition, leading instead to sales at or near the reserve floor.

Validity

Beyond pricing, operators have also called for extending the duration of using spectrum to 30 or 40 years from the current 20 years. They argue that a longer term provides greater policy stability, enhances business viability, and enables the sustained investments required for next-generation network technologies. The Union cabinet had previously approved increasing the tenure to 30 years in 2021 to infuse liquidity, but this was never implemented, with Jio noting that Trai's valuation had simply multiplied the 20-year price by 1.5, negating the intended financial benefit.

The industry's request runs contrary to the public stance of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal recently pushed back on the necessity of lower prices.

“I have not seen any TSP come to me saying that they are not using a respective spectrum because its pricing is high," Mittal told reporters last month, questioning how data prices remain low if spectrum acquisition costs are supposedly prohibitive. Mittal maintained that the timing of the next auction would be determined by the "appetite and the demand" among stakeholders. If the reserve prices are so high, how could data prices be so low, Mittal questioned.

Bharti Airtel also said that in future auctions, telcos should be allowed a payment moratorium of six years, followed by 14 equal annual installments. This is because any new network takes a time period of at least 4-5 years to monetize and huge upfront payments combined with short moratorium periods could cause significant financial strain on operators, according to Airtel.

Currently, operators can make full or part upfront payment for the spectrum within 10 days from issuing spectrum. They can also make an upfront payment equal to the installments of at least two years, with the balance payable in equal installments with applicable interest, within the 20-year spectrum holding period. Operators are also allowed to make payment for spectrum in 20 equal annual instalments.

Unsold spectrum

Trai is also looking into concerns raised by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), which flagged a lack of effective competition in previous auctions due to industry consolidation and the oversupply of unsold airwaves. The DoT data shows over 12,000 MHz of traditional band spectrum remains unsold. In an effort to mitigate this issue, Trai has sought comments on potentially allowing other entities—such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or large connected device network operators—to bid for spectrum alongside wireless carriers.

The telecom carriers uniformly opposed this proposal. Vodafone Idea stated that allowing non-traditional bidders would "impact the robustness of the licensing framework" and create "huge complications related to valuation," arguing it runs counter to the structure of the new Telecommunications Act 2023.

Operators also said that referring to the currently available spectrum inventory as an “over-supply" may not accurately reflect market realities. “Rather, this spectrum should be viewed as strategic reserve capacity intended to address future growth requirements and regional variations in demand," Bharti Airtel said.

A recent analysis by V.J. Christopher, wireless advisor at DoT, flagged that nearly 36% of the spectrum on auction since 2010 was cleared at the base price, and only 15.5% was sold at a premium.

Another grouse relates to the duration of using the spectrum.

Currently, spectrum is issued for a period of 20 years. The Union cabinet in 2021 recommended increasing it to 30 to ensure long-term policy stability, improve business viability, and facilitate sustained investment in advanced technologies. However, the move did not take off. Jio said this should have been implemented in 2022 itself but wasn't, due to what it called Trai’s "aggressive valuation".

While the three carriers agree on the need for cheaper spectrum, they are divided on auctioning some new bands.

Reliance Jio is advocating for a comprehensive release strategy, urging that all nationally and globally identified International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) bands be auctioned immediately to ensure policy predictability and accelerate 6G readiness. Specifically, Jio wants the entire 6 GHz band to be auctioned now, with payment obligations kicking in only when the full band becomes available in 2030.

Bharti Airtel, is opposed to the plan. The company wants the auction of new bands like 600 MHz and parts of 6 GHz to be deferred for approximately two years. Airtel cited unresolved technical conflicts and the current "early stage" of the device and network ecosystem for both bands, suggesting that a premature auction would lead to underutilization.

The operators also requested the government to relax minimum rollout obligations, designed to ensure the swift deployment of purchased spectrum. Airtel highlighted the difficulty in meeting these commitments for the 26 GHz band, citing limited device compatibility and chipset constraints, and requested an extension to avoid financial penalties. The debate underscores a critical tension between the government’s desire for revenue maximization and the industry’s need for capital efficiency to fund the massive investment required for a true, nationwide 5G transformation.

[TITLE]Underwater cables are a vital piece of the AI buildout and internet — investment is booming:
[TEXT]
Over 95% of international data and voice call traffic travels through nearly a million miles of underwater communication cables. These cables carry government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming around the world. The first commercial telecommunication subsea cable was used for telegraphs and was laid across the English Channel between Dover, England and Calais, France in 1850. The technology then evolved to coaxial cables that carried telephone conversations, and most recently, fiber optics that ferry data and the internet as we know it. "

[TITLE]CNBC Daily Open: AI is back — it never really went away:
[TEXT]
Investors piled back into artificial intelligence names on Monday stateside. Shares of Nvidia jumped 5.8%, Broadcom advanced 2.6% and Microsoft climbed 1.9% to end its eight-day losing streak, its longest consecutive decline since 2011.

Market watchers are hoping that another historically long streak — the U.S. government shutdown — could soon be snapped as well. As of this newsletter's publication time, lawmakers in the U.S. Senate are voting on a deal to reopen the government, though it still has to pass through the House and then signed into law by President Donald Trump (who has already given it his approval).

That's not to say worries about AI's high valuations have gone away completely.

CoreWeave on Monday reported its third-quarter earnings. It rents out Nvidia cards to AI-related firms, such as Google and Microsoft, a business model that ties it intimately to the AI trade. The company's revenue swelled 134% year on year, but it still reported a net loss and gave lower-than-expected guidance for this year.

The general shape of those figures — high revenue and high losses — broadly reminds one of OpenAI, the industry-leading, money-bleeding startup that kickstarted the AI frenzy. Though it would of course be a stretch to equate the two companies and the factors driving their finances.

Still, Mark Haefele, CIO of UBS's global wealth management, thinks "AI-related stocks should drive equity markets." With the U.S. government shutdown in sight to end (hopefully this doesn't jinx it), that's another obstacle surpassed for markets.
