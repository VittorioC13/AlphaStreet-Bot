EPA The Tech Prosperity Deal inked by this week tacitly aligns the UK with the US administration's pro-tech approach

In the old Camden Town Hall opposite London's St Pancras station, away from the white tie and tails of the pageantry at Windsor Castle, was perhaps the most substantive display of the consequences of US President Donald Trump's state visit. In front of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, many members of the British and US cabinets and the cream of the European tech industry, a highly-crafted video played, featuring the long history of UK science. It included George Stephenson, Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing and Sir Demis Hassabis, with dozens of UK start-up companies from every corner of the country listed. It was a cross between a UK government investment promotion video and the Danny Boyle 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony, except for one crucial detail - it was voiced by Jensen Huang, the American Nvidia artificial intelligence (AI) and microchip magnate. This week, Trump said the tech tycoon "was taking over the world" and the boss of the company, which hit a market value of $4tn (£2.9tn) this summer, appears to have gone all-in on the UK in quite an extraordinary way.

Huang shouted out the long list of British entrepreneurs Nvidia has taken stakes in and had expanded after a further £2bn of investment. He invited Business Secretary Peter Kyle and his US counterpart Howard Lutnick onto the stage to address the assembled British entrepreneurs. Lutnick, the face of the global trade war, said: "We are America first, but we are not America only... We want to win, we want you to win." This was one vignette from the striking array of the world's biggest Silicon Valley tech companies turning on the transatlantic investment tap. The "tech bromance" embraced the UK this week with a hat-trick of multi-billion investments from Nvidia, Microsoft and Google. It was an early win for the government's strategy in attracting this sort of investment to help transform Britain and the UK economy long term. But it is not necessarily proof that this strategy will win in transforming the economy, living standards, and turning the tide on more general negative vibes from the economy and politics.

Indeed, the infectious enthusiasm of the US tech giants

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has moved to block a Massachusetts offshore wind farm, its latest effort to hobble an industry and technology that President Donald Trump has attacked as “ugly” and unreliable compared to fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, filed a motion in federal court Thursday seeking to take back its approval of the SouthCoast Wind project’s “construction and operations plan.'' The plan is the last major federal permit the project needs before it can start putting turbines in the water.

SouthCoast Wind, to be built in federal waters about 23 miles south of Nantucket, is expected to construct as many as 141 turbines to power about 840,000 homes in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

The Interior Department action is the latest by the Trump administration in what critics call an "all-out assault” on the wind energy industry.

Trump's administration has stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.

The moves are a complete reversal from the Biden administration, which approved construction of 11 large offshore wind projects to generate enough clean energy to power more than 6 million homes. The projects now face uncertain futures under Trump.

Last week, the Interior Department asked a federal judge in Baltimore to cancel a previous approval by BOEM to build an offshore wind project in Maryland. The ocean agency has concluded that its prior weighing of the project's impacts was “deficient” and intends to reconsider that analysis to make a new decision, the department said.

Developer U.S. Wind has not yet begun construction, but plans for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project call for up to 114 turbines to power more than 718,000 homes.

BOEM had approved SouthCoast’s operations plan on Jan. 17, 2025, three days before Trump’s second term began.

“Based on its review to date, BOEM has determined that the COP approval may not have fully complied with the law" and "may have failed to account for all the impacts that the SouthCoast Wind Project may cause," Interior said in its legal filing. The agency asked a federal judge to allow reconsideration of the project.

In a statement, developer Ocean Winds said the company “intends to vigorously defend our permits in federal court.”

"Stable permitting for American infrastructure projects should be of top concern for anyone who wants to see continued investment in the United States,'' the statement said.

Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups, said Trump “is threatening good jobs while he pursues his senseless vendetta against offshore wind."

Pulling energy project permits and canceling lease sales isn't new. Biden revoked the permit to build the long-disputed Keystone XL oil pipeline on his first day in office, halting construction. He canceled scheduled oil and gas lease sales.

But Trump's efforts to dismantle the offshore wind industry are much more extensive than the way Biden targeted fossil fuels, said Kristoffer Svendsen, assistant dean for energy law at the George Washington University Law School. He thinks offshore wind developers will now see the U.S. as too risky.

“They have plenty of options. They can invest in Europe and Asia. There are good markets to invest in offshore wind. It's just the U.S. is not a good market to invest in,” he said.

The Trump administration has stopped construction on two major offshore wind farms, so far. One of them, the Empire Wind project for New York, was allowed to resume construction. The Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut is paused, and both the developer and the two states sued in federal courts.

The Danish energy company Orsted is building Revolution Wind. The Danish government owns a majority stake in the company.

Besides SouthCoast, the Trump administration has said it is reconsidering approvals for another wind farm off the Massachusetts coast, New England Wind. It previously revoked a permit for the Atlantic Shores project in New Jersey.

[TITLE]Buying a pair of AirPods Pro 3? Stop and read this first!:
[TEXT]
During its iPhone 17 launch event, Apple introduced the highly anticipated AirPods Pro 3, which are available to purchase today. Prior to the keynote, some leaks suggested we might see bigger changes, including a design with much shorter stems. That didn’t materialize.

Instead, Apple delivered the rumored Live Translation feature, along with stronger ANC, longer battery life, and heart rate sensors. On paper, these all sound like welcome upgrades that could entice many users to opt for the new model. However, a closer look at the spec sheet reveals 7 reasons you may want to stick with the AirPods Pro 2.

Common tongues

Live Translation is one of the neat additions that certain rival brands have offered for a while. As its name suggests, the tool lets you convert someone’s speech from one language to another in real time. The AirPods Pro 3 will pick up the foreign phrases using the embedded mics, translate them to your preferred language, activate ANC to muffle the original speaker, and play the translated audio directly in your ears.

The Live Translation feature is available in English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish, with Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) to follow later this year. If the other party isn’t wearing AirPods, your iPhone can display translations of your speech for them to read and optionally read them out loud.

Foundry

We’re not downplaying how powerful and handy this utility can be for tourists and digital nomads, but it’s not exclusive to the AirPods Pro 3. Any AirPods 4 (with ANC) or AirPods Pro 2 user can take advantage of it. So, if you’re getting the latest earbuds for this particular feature, you don’t have to.

So 20H2

The availability of Apple’s new software features is generally tied to the device’s processor. For example, the Apple Watch Series 9, 10, and 11 all offer the same main watchOS perks, as they pack similar chipsets. Likewise, the H-branded chip embedded in Apple’s AirPods line typically dictates what new additions a certain model receives.

Apple first introduced the H2 chip when it launched the AirPods Pro 2 in late 2022. Naturally, some customers may assume the AirPods Pro 3 pack an upgraded, more powerful H3 variant. In reality, the AirPods Pro 3 reuse the H2 chip, which suggests that the Pro 2 and Pro 3 models will continue to receive similar feature updates. And when Apple eventually drops software support for the H2 chip, both models will likely stop receiving updates at the same time—despite the Pro 3 being three years newer. You shouldn’t pay a premium price in 2025 for 2022’s technology.

The case of missing hours

Apple boasted that the AirPods Pro 3 offer up to 8 hours of continuous playback on a single charge. Given these earbuds’ compact size, it’s honestly a significant improvement over the AirPods Pro 2’s 6-hour limit. What the company conveniently forgot to mention during the keynote, however, is the charging case’s reduced capacity.

When taking the charging case into account, the AirPods Pro 2 offer up to 30 hours of listening away from a power source. The AirPods Pro 3 downgrades said value to just 24 hours. My AirPods listening sessions rarely exceed 6 hours in a row. And, arguably, charging the AirPods case is less convenient than placing the AirPods themselves in their case for a quick charge. So, looking at the whole picture, I would say the AirPods Pro 3 downgrade the overall battery life coming from the Pro 2 model.

Foundry

A redundant beat

Another key AirPods Pro 3 hardware upgrade is the implementation of a heart rate monitor in each earbud. Like the Powerbeats Pro 2, users can now measure their heartbeats when recording workouts in compatible apps.

If you’re reading this, however, chances are you are an Apple enthusiast and already have the company’s smartwatch on your wrist. In this case, the AirPods Pro 3’s heart rate sensor is pointless, as your Apple Watch can collect the same data and more—and not just during exercise.

Foundry

Truly wireless

Ever since Apple completed its transition from Lightning to USB-C, I started placing multiple charging cables in different parts of the house. Whether I’m using my iPhone, iPad, or something, I can quickly top up its battery no matter what room I’m sitting in. Thus, I always appreciated the bundled cable in AirPods and other devices’ boxes, as it spared me from needing to pay for one out of pocket whenever a cord decayed.

Unfortunately, this generous tradition is coming to an end, as the AirPods Pro 3 no longer includes a charging cable in the box. You’ll need to buy one separately if needed.

Foundry

Sound value

Taking the above into consideration, if you’ve already got a pair of AirPods Pro 2, you may want to stick with them for the time being. Otherwise, if you’re an OG Pro user or buying your first pair, I’d advise you to check out Amazon, which is still selling the AirPods Pro 2 for $199, arguably a better deal than the full-priced AirPods Pro 3.

A new wave of control

The final reason to avoid the current AirPods Pro 3 is the upcoming iteration rumored to launch next year. If the reports materialize, Apple could release a higher-end AirPods Pro 3 edition in fall 2026, featuring IR cameras for gesture controls. Instead of clicking the stems to adjust music playback, you’d potentially be waving in the air.

To accommodate the new controls, the company could possibly introduce a more powerful H3 chip, which would future-proof the accessory for years to come. Logically, the rumored model could cost more than $249, but it would at least include a fresh batch of features to justify the price markup. Our advice? Especially if you have an Apple Watch, just wait for the rumored earbuds or settle for the AirPods Pro 2.

[TITLE]Europe's underappreciated superpower:
[TEXT]
While Europe’s policymakers and opinion leaders obsess over semiconductors and clean tech, another economic engine is humming along with far less fanfare – and far greater local impact. In its forecast for the five-year period from 2024 to 2029, Oxford Economics named travel and tourism the world’s fastest-growing established industry – outpacing financial services, manufacturing, and even information and communication. It’s time Europe treated it as a serious pillar of economic strength – not a sideshow.

And yet, the travel industry remains strikingly underappreciated by Europe’s top decision-makers.

Europe: Top earners from international tourism, 2024— Source: UN Tourism

If we add up international tourism receipts for the EU’s top ten markets in 2024, the figure comes to roughly €400 billion - comparable to the gross domestic product of a mid-sized EU member state. Unlike other revenue streams, tourism receipts count as service exports – real money flowing in from outside into the local economies of Member States, supporting jobs that cannot be offshored.

[TITLE]EU’s new strategy document shows: New Delhi is a valued partner:
[TEXT]
The EU’s latest strategy document on India, issued this week, marks a definitive moment in the evolution of Delhi’s relations with Brussels, long defined by mutual neglect. This had begun to change in the 21st century, but the two sides had struggled to boost the partnership quickly. In the last few years, there has been a determined effort by Brussels and Delhi to plug the gap between the promise of the partnership and its performance. Troubled by the assertion of Russia, the muscular economic policies of China, and the disruption of historic US alliances by President Donald Trump, Europe is in the middle of rebooting relationships with other powers. Its latest outreach to India is part of that effort. Framed as a “comprehensive strategic agenda” to deepen, broaden, and better coordinate cooperation, the EU strategy is a blend of ambition and pragmatism. In stating that “India’s success benefits the EU, just as the EU’s success benefits India,” Brussels has moved from treating New Delhi as a useful interlocutor to recognising it as an indispensable partner in shaping the international order.

The EU is the second most important commercial partner of India, after the US. Bilateral goods trade has climbed to €120 billion and services to €60 billion. Yet, India still accounts for less than 2.5 per cent of the EU’s total trade. The EU, therefore, focuses on securing a far-reaching Free Trade Agreement with India that reduces tariff and non-tariff barriers and unlocks the enormous possibility of trade and investment flows between Europe and India. After years of drift, India is now equally committed to an early conclusion of the FTA. Buffeted by a massive and persistent trade deficit with China, and shocked by Trump’s exorbitant tariffs, India sees free trade with the EU as a major strategic objective now. The EU also frames India as a rapidly expanding manufacturing and technology hub hosting nearly half of global capability centres; India appreciates Europe’s edge in research, regulation and green and digital technologies. Together, they could gain from EU-India Innovation Hubs, a Startup Partnership, and joint work in AI, semiconductors, and outer space.

[TITLE]Stocks rise on Nvidia-Intel deal, Fed rate cut:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK: Stock markets advanced on Thursday (Sep 18), as tech shares jumped following AI chips giant Nvidia's announcement of a US$5 billion investment in struggling US rival Intel, and as investors digested the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of 2025.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq led gains on Wall Street, with Intel shares soaring nearly 23 per cent and Nvidia gaining more than three per cent.

All three major US indices finished at fresh records.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.27 per cent to 46,142.42, the S&P 500 climbed 0.48 per cent to 6,631.96 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.94 per cent to 22,470.72.

The dollar gained against other major currencies.

"Even if Intel needs handouts from its peers in Silicon Valley, investors like it," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB.

Under the Nvidia-Intel deal, the companies will jointly develop chips for PCs and data centers.

The deal comes on the heels of the United States taking a 10-per cent stake in Intel, which has fallen behind in recent years after missing key technology shifts.

The move propelled shares of other tech firms.

In Europe, shares in ASML, a Dutch company that makes the machines used to produce semiconductors, surged more than seven per cent.

Other US semiconductor names were mixed. Micron jumped 5.6 per cent while Advanced Micro Devices dropped 0.8 per cent.

Investors were also reacting to Wednesday's US central bank decision to lower rates by 25 basis points.

US stocks had finished mixed on Wednesday over uncertainty about the path forward following the Fed's announcement.

But the mood changed Thursday, with investors confident that more cuts are coming this year, analysts said.

"Markets are betting policymakers will continue to prioritise jobs over inflation, even with headline prices still running hot," said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com.

The decision to cut came even as US inflation runs well above policymakers' two-per cent target, but analysts said the main focus was on the jobs market.

Fed policymakers are split between those who expect at least two interest rate cuts later this year and those who anticipate one or fewer.

Fed boss Jerome Powell remained cagey, telling reporters decision-makers were approaching it "meeting bay meeting".

Paris and Frankfurt stocks were up around 1 per cent in afternoon deals, with German sentiment buoyed by a central bank statement saying Germany should dodge a technical recession in the immediate future.

London rose less enthusiastically as the Bank of England kept its main interest rate at 4 per cent in the face of the UK's stubbornly high inflation, which stands at 3.8 per cent.

While Britain's interest rate was kept unchanged, Norway's central bank cut borrowing costs on Thursday, after a similar move by Canada on Wednesday.

In Asia, investors were in a cautious mood on Thursday.

Shanghai stocks retreated overall, and Hong Kong's session also ended in the red.

Tokyo closed in the green as the Fed decision boosted the dollar against the yen, helping Japanese exporters.

Newsroom September 19 09:30

Hello, today I won’t start with the government, just for a change, but with what’s happening in the opposition. So, somewhere it was reported (I’m not saying it’s bad, journalists are supposed to write…) that Tsipras is having second thoughts and may not dare to go ahead, which, as you can imagine, gave us quite a scare. Well, no, categorically not—the information that Tsipras will back down is not true, and my source is first-class. The next two polls from reliable firms measure him at 8%–10% in the “yes, I will vote for him” category, and up to 20% in the potential (I could, etc.) category, the same source tells me. So our leader will indeed move forward, but without changing his plan, which means around the beginning of the new year.

[TITLE]Fifty Years of Open Source Software Supply-Chain Security – Communications of the ACM:
[TEXT]
In March 1972, the U.S. Air Force started a review of a Honeywell Multics system to understand whether it could be used in secure environments. The report was issued in mid-1974 and concluded that Multics, while not secure, was better than its peers and might be a reasonable starting point for a secure system.24 The report raised the potential of adding a back door (it was called a “trap door”) to an innocent system call. When passed a specific, very unlikely input, the system call allowed reading or writing an arbitrary word of kernel memory. That tiny change would completely undermine the security of the system, and the report investigated the mechanics of how such a change might be made and hidden. In March 2024, Andres Freund, a Postgres developer working at Microsoft, noticed that his Debian Linux system’s ssh daemon was taking more CPU than normal to handle the Internet’s usual background attack traffic that was trying to brute-force log-in into his machine. Upon closer investigation, Freund discovered that the latest version of liblzma, a compression library linked into ssh on Debian systems, contained a back door that targeted ssh specifically.20 Now, when passed a specific, very unlikely input, the ssh daemon would allow an attacker on the Internet to execute an arbitrary shell command. This tiny change completely undermined the security of bleeding-edge Debian systems, and for the next few weeks, security researchers all over the world investigated the mechanics of how the change was made and hidden. Because liblzma was distributed as part of the XZ project, this attack is now widely known as the XZ attack. The contours of the problems in software supply-chain security have not changed in half a century because they are fundamental. There are no easy answers in computer security; software supply-chain security is no exception. The best we can aim to do is keep improving our defenses, and many promising reinforcements are not yet universally deployed. This article aims to highlight promising approaches that should be more widely used as well as point out areas where more work is needed. I led the development of the Go programming language and environment16 for more than a decade, and software supply-chain security is one of the specific focuses of that effort. This article is informed by that work and draws some examples from my personal experience, in addition to examples drawn from across the software industry.

Exploring the Problem Open source software supply-chain security is a hot topic, especially after the XZ attack, but what exactly does it mean? In the absence of an agreed-upon definition, I suggest this one, in three parts: An open source software supply-chain attack is the insertion of nefarious open source code into trusted software before delivery. (This definition adapts one by Kim Zetter.36) An open source software supply-chain vulnerability is an exploitable weakness in trusted software caused by a third-party, open source component of that software. Open source software supply-chain security is the engineering of defenses against open source software supply-chain attacks and vulnerabilities. There are a few important nuances to this definition. The first is that the hardware supply chain is not of concern here. For example, Der Spiegel reported in 2013 that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) can intercept a new computer ordered by a target and install back-doored software or hardware components into it.2 That kind of physical attack is beyond the scope of this discussion of the software supply chain, although it may still be important to consider and defend against in certain contexts. A second nuance is that closed source software components are not of concern. For example, in 2012, attackers broke into Juniper Networks and changed the virtual private network (VPN) source code, replacing some critical constants in a random number generator. The effect was to create a back door that made it possible for the attackers to decrypt all VPN traffic Juniper’s customers sent through those devices.9 This is a software supply-chain attack because it changed the software before its delivery to Juniper’s customers. But it is not an open source software supply-chain attack because the nefarious change was not made in one of the open source components used in Juniper’s VPN. (The random-number generator was easily back-doored in the first place thanks to the NSA mounting what might be considered an algorithmic supply-chain attack.7) As another example, developers in China often look for copies of Xcode on file-sharing sites hosted in China, which are faster to download. In 2015, security researchers discovered that attackers had posted a modified copy of Xcode and worked to make it the top Chinese-language search result for “Xcode download.” This version, which researchers named XcodeGhost, had been nefariously altered to add malicious code to every iOS app it built. It was downloaded and used by many app developers, and the injected malware made it into at least two widely used apps.35 This is a software supply-chain attack on the distribution mechanism rather than the original software, but, once again, it is not targeting open source software. A third nuance is that the affected software does not itself need to be open source. For example, in 2021, security researchers discovered that the open source Java logging library Log4j would download and execute Java code from arbitrary URLs when logging text with a certain format.34 Log4j is widely used in the Java ecosystem. As one example among millions of affected programs, in the popular game Minecraft, simply sending a chat message was sufficient to achieve remote code execution on the game server. Minecraft is, therefore, an example of a closed source program affected by an open source software supply-chain vulnerability. Since almost all closed source programs use open source components,3 they all depend on good open source software supply-chain security. A final nuance is that attacks involving code written with nefarious intent are distinguished from vulnerabilities involving innocent bugs. For example, in 2021, Apple fixed a bug that allowed so-called zero-click takeovers of an iPhone device by sending an iMessage with a specially crafted image attachment. The attachment identified itself as a GIF but was actually a PDF containing a JBIG2 image. Apple’s software used the open source Xpdf JBIG2 decoder, written in C, which did not properly validate the encoded Huffman trees in the image. This made it possible to trigger bitwise operations on memory at attacker-controlled offsets beyond an allocated region. The attackers implemented an entire virtual CPU out of these bitwise operations and then implemented code in that virtual instruction set to scan process memory, break out of the iMessage sandbox, and take over the phone.5 The JBIG2 bug was only accidentally (not nefariously) introduced, so it is an open source software supply-chain vulnerability, not an attack. Vulnerabilities and attacks are distinct problems with distinct potential solutions. As another example, in 2018, researchers discovered that the NPM package event-stream contained obfuscated code that harvested bitcoin wallets when linked into the Copay mobile app.22 The nefarious code explicitly targeted Copay, making that app an example of a closed source program affected by an open source software supply-chain attack. Although the last two examples ultimately impacted closed source applications, attacks on purely open source software stacks are also possible. The XZ attack did exactly this, attacking OpenSSH through a component of its software supply chain—liblzma—instead of a direct attack on the OpenSSH source code or project itself. Even a purely open source attack can be devastating: If a few more months had passed before its discovery, the back-doored secure shell daemon (sshd) would have been deployed in sensitive contexts worldwide. Although there is no silver bullet, the remainder of this article highlights the general themes for engineering better defenses as well as practical steps being taken today.

Understand the Software Supply Chain To secure your software supply chain, you first must understand what it is. Let’s start with the definition: The software supply chain is all the places where a software supply-chain attack might happen or vulnerability might be introduced. The more important meaning of understand, however, is knowing what your specific software supply chain looks like, and that turns out to be quite difficult. The word chain sounds simple, but a supply chain is like a fractal: complex no matter how closely you look at it. At the lowest level, you can look at the commands executed to build a single program and the dependencies between those commands. These build graphs align with the package dependency structure of the program itself. Even for simple programs, these graphs are so complex as to be unprintable. The Go project makes it a priority to avoid unnecessary dependencies and keep software simple,16 and yet, as I write this article, building the go command executes 714 commands to build 297 packages, with 3,132 dependency edges in its package graph. The go command is unusual in that it has no external dependencies: All the packages it uses are part of the Go project itself. Looking at a slightly more complex command, Kubernetes’ kubelet executes 3,289 commands in its build and depends on 1,581 packages from 137 Go modules, including many from outside the Kubernetes project. Both these examples are fairly small, low-level utilities. Higher-level programs have even more complex builds. In fact, most programs have many possible build graphs, depending on the exact context in which they are built.1 It is tempting to think these kinds of dependency graphs are the entire software supply chain, but they are only the most visible part. Each package or module in the dependency graph may be written by a different person or organization, with different security practices, code review standards, and so on. It would be helpful to know more

Faisal Islam: Will the US tech bromance turn around the UK economy?

1 day ago Share Save Faisal Islam Economics editor Share Save

EPA The Tech Prosperity Deal inked by this week tacitly aligns the UK with the US administration's pro-tech approach

In the old Camden Town Hall opposite London's St Pancras station, away from the white tie and tails of the pageantry at Windsor Castle, was perhaps the most substantive display of the consequences of US President Donald Trump's state visit. In front of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, many members of the British and US cabinets and the cream of the European tech industry, a highly-crafted video played, featuring the long history of UK science. It included George Stephenson, Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing and Sir Demis Hassabis, with dozens of UK start-up companies from every corner of the country listed. It was a cross between a UK government investment promotion video and the Danny Boyle 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony, except for one crucial detail - it was voiced by Jensen Huang, the American Nvidia artificial intelligence (AI) and microchip magnate. This week, Trump said the tech tycoon "was taking over the world" and the boss of the company, which hit a market value of $4tn (£2.9tn) this summer, appears to have gone all-in on the UK in quite an extraordinary way.

Huang shouted out the long list of British entrepreneurs Nvidia has taken stakes in and had expanded after a further £2bn of investment. He invited Business Secretary Peter Kyle and his US counterpart Howard Lutnick onto the stage to address the assembled British entrepreneurs. Lutnick, the face of the global trade war, said: "We are America first, but we are not America only... We want to win, we want you to win." This was one vignette from the striking array of the world's biggest Silicon Valley tech companies turning on the transatlantic investment tap. The "tech bromance" embraced the UK this week with a hat-trick of multi-billion investments from Nvidia, Microsoft and Google. It was an early win for the government's strategy in attracting this sort of investment to help transform Britain and the UK economy long term. But it is not necessarily proof that this strategy will win in transforming the economy, living standards, and turning the tide on more general negative vibes from the economy and politics.

Indeed, the infectious enthusiasm of the US tech giants

[TITLE]Nexstar, Tegna $6.2 Billion Merger to File Antitrust, FCC Paperwork by End of September:
[TEXT]
Nexstar and its rival Tegna will file paperwork for their pending $6.2 billion merger by Sept. 30.

Under the terms of the agreement, the former will acquire the latter’s outstanding shares for $22 per share — a 31% premium to the company’s 30-day average stock price as of Aug. 8, the last closing stock price prior to media reports of a potential transaction.

The deal is expected to close by the second half of 2026, subject to Tegna shareholder and regulatory approvals.

Per a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, those regulatory approvals include clearance from the Federal Communications Commission, as well as the expiration or termination of a 30-day waiting period after they file documents associated with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. If the Federal Trade Commission or antitrust division of the Department of Justice issues a request for additional information, the merger would be subject to a second 30-day waiting period, unless it’s terminated early or extended by the parties.

The pending merger comes as Nexstar has pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off of its airwaves indefinitely following comments the late night host made during his Monday monologue
