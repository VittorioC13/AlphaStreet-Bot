[TITLE]Chiesi Global Rare Diseases and Protalix BioTherapeutics Seek Re-examination from the EMA for the Negative Opinion for Elfabrio (pegunigalsidase alfa) Alternative Dosing Regimen of Every Four Weeks in:
[TEXT]
PARMA, Italy and CARMIEL, Israel, Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chiesi Global Rare Diseases, a business unit of the Chiesi Group, and Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE American: PLX), have requested a re-examination of the recent negative opinion issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding the proposed dosing regimen of 2 mg/kg body weight infused every 4 weeks (E4W) for Elfabrio® (pegunigalsidase alfa).

The opinion concerns the request to add the E4W dosing regimen to the currently approved 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (E2W) regimen. The existing marketing authorization for Elfabrio remains in effect pending the outcome of the re-examination procedure and subsequent decision by the European Commission (EC).

Both Chiesi and Protalix remain fully committed to working closely with the EMA through the re-examination process and to addressing the high unmet medical needs of the Fabry community.

Important Safety Information

Indication

Elfabrio® (pegunigalsidase alfa-iwxj) is indicated for the treatment of adults with confirmed Fabry disease.

Important Safety Information

WARNING: HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS INCLUDING ANAPHYLAXIS

Patients treated with Elfabrio have experienced hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Appropriate medical support measures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment, should be readily available during Elfabrio administration. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) occurs, discontinue Elfabrio immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment. In patients with severe hypersensitivity reaction, a desensitization procedure to Elfabrio may be considered.

Prior to Elfabrio administration, consider pretreating with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids. Inform patients and caregivers of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and infusion-associated reactions (IARs), and instruct them to seek medical care immediately if such symptoms occur.

If a severe hypersensitivity reaction (including anaphylaxis) or severe IAR occurs, immediately discontinue Elfabrio administration and initiate appropriate medical treatment.

If a mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction or IAR occurs, consider slowing the infusion rate or temporarily withholding the dose.

In clinical trials, 20 (14%) Elfabrio-treated patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions. Four Elfabrio-treated patients (3%) experienced anaphylaxis reactions that occurred within 5 to 40 minutes of the start of the initial infusion. The signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis included headache, nausea, vomiting, throat tightness, facial and oral edema, truncal rash, tachycardia, hypotension, rigors, urticaria, intense pruritus, moderate upper airway obstructions, macroglossia, and mild lip edema.

In clinical trials, 41 (29%) Elfabrio-treated patients experienced one or more infusion-associated reactions, including hypersensitivity, nausea, chills, pruritus, rash, chest pain, dizziness, vomiting, asthenia, pain, sneezing, dyspnea, nasal congestion, throat irritation, abdominal pain, erythema, diarrhea, burning sensation, neuralgia, headache, paresthesia, tremor, agitation, increased body temperature, flushing, bradycardia, myalgia, hypertension, and hypotension.

A case of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with immune depositions in the kidney was reported during clinical trials. Monitor serum creatinine and urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, discontinue treatment until a diagnostic evaluation can be conducted.

When switching to Elfabrio from a prior enzyme replacement therapy, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and infusion-associated reactions may be increased in certain patients with pre-existing anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Consider monitoring IgG and IgE ADAs and clinical or pharmacodynamic response (eg, plasma lyso-Gb3 levels). The most common adverse reactions (≥15%) were infusion-associated reactions, nasopharyngitis, headache, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, back pain, pain in extremity, and sinusitis.

[TEXT]
WARREN, N.J., Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tevogen (“Tevogen Bio Holdings Inc.” or “Company”) (Nasdaq: TVGN), today issued a statement to provide clarity regarding its accumulated deficit reported under U.S. GAAP accounting standards in recent SEC filings.

GAAP rules are designed for consistency and comparability across industries, but they can understate the value of high-growth biotechnology assets still under development. To offer investors a more comprehensive understanding of Tevogen’s financial position and commercial opportunity, the Company plans to share a clearly labeled, fully reconciled set of non-GAAP metrics following the filing of its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2025, while maintaining full compliance with SEC requirements.

“The company has raised total cash of under $42 million since inception to June 30, 2025,” said Kirti Desai, Chief Financial Officer of Tevogen Bio. “However, the financial statements presented under GAAP for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, show an accumulated deficit of $129 million. If you back out the cash balance, the total cash loss to date is a little over $41 million, and the remaining balance represents non-cash expenses of approximately $88 million. This is further offset by a credit of $110 million in Additional Paid-in Capital. When you factor in the capital raise amount of over $8.8 million, the total stockholders’ deficit as of June 30, 2025, is under $9.5 million.”

This commentary is intended to provide investors and the broader financial community with context on the widely publicized accumulated deficit figure of $129 million and highlight the distinction between cash and non-cash components within Tevogen’s reported results. The Company is committed to providing investors with additional explanatory information to evaluate business results.

SAN DIEGO, Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPRY), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and their caregivers to better protect patients from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis, announced today that one late-breaking oral and six poster presentations will be featured at the 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI), taking place November 6-10, 2025, in Orlando, FL. The presentations highlight real-world experience associated with intranasal epinephrine. In addition, ARS Pharma will host a variety of onsite activities during the meeting.

“These real-world data provide strong support for intranasal epinephrine and mark a turning point in the treatment of severe allergies,” said Dr. Jonathan Spergel, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Pediatrics and Chief of the Allergy Program at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “The consistency of outcomes across diverse patient populations and clinical settings gives us confidence that intranasal epinephrine delivers the same reliable effectiveness as an injection. With this evidence, we believe clinicians, as well as patients and their families, can feel assured that needle-free administration is not only convenient, but equally powerful in treating anaphylaxis.”

“ARS Pharma continues to expand upon its body of scientific research for our intranasal epinephrine spray, neffy®,” said Sarina Tanimoto, MD, MBA, Co-founder and Chief Medical Officer of ARS Pharma. “The breadth of presentations - one late-breaking oral and six poster presentations - reinforce the value of our treatment for allergic emergencies. It’s also rewarding to hear from the healthcare professionals who prescribe and particularly encouraging to see five case reports that showcase how neffy performs in a clinical setting.”

[TITLE]Effectiveness of a digital game based study guide on head trauma assessment on knowledge and practical skills of nursing students: a quasi-experimental study - BMC Medical Education:
[TEXT]
This quasi-experimental study, which included a control group, was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital game-based study guide for head trauma assessment on the knowledge and practical skills of nursing students. The statistical population for this research comprised all nursing students at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in 2024.

Sampling

In this study, the participants were nursing students from Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in 2024. Sampling was conducted using nonrandom (convenience) methods.

The number of required samples per group was calculated using the following formula:

$$n\geq2\frac{\left(Z_{a/2}+Z_\beta\right)^2\sigma^2}{\left(\mu_1-\mu_2\right)^2}$$

The effect size was derived from the study by Khaledi and colleagues [17]. Taking into account a 10% potential dropout rate, a minimum of 49 participants was considered for each group.

$$n=2\left(1.96+0.85\right)^2\left(\frac1{0.50}\right)^2\left(1-0.3\right)=44$$

The inclusion criteria required participants to be willing to install the app on their mobile phones and to have completed at least eight semesters in the nursing program. The exclusion criteria included non-participation in the training session (participants must attend the entire session) and a lack of prior training on how to evaluate head trauma patients.

Out of the 103 students in the eighth semester, 98 met the inclusion criteria and were eligible for the study. They were randomly assigned to two groups: an intervention group with 49 participants and a control group with 49 participants. The allocation was done using the Study Randomizer software (2017), accessible at: https://www.studyrandomizer.com. After registering in the software, the study details, including the number of groups and participants, were entered. In the next step, each participant was assigned a code based on their order of entry into the study, followed by a random assignment to either the intervention or control group using the software.

Research tools

In the research, the ABCDE trauma patient evaluation approach was utilized, a universally accepted method for assessing trauma and critically ill patients [31]. This approach encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of five key areas: airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure [31, 32]. An expert panel, consisting of 12 professors from nursing and emergency medicine, developed a key features questionnaire tailored for assessing head trauma using the ABCDE framework. The questionnaire was divided into two distinct sections: knowledge and practical skills. The knowledge segment featured a clinical scenario accompanied by five multiple-choice items, with each correct answer earning 2 points, leading to a total potential score ranging from 0 to 10 (Additional file 1).

The practical skills assessment consisted of a checklist with 10 items. Based on the scenario presented, students were required to perform specific evaluations. If they completed the tasks independently and without assistance, they received 2 points; if they required reminders or help, they were awarded 1 point; and if they failed to execute the evaluation, they received no points. The scoring for this section ranged from 0 to 20 (Additional file 2).

Ten emergency nurses developed 50 realistic head trauma scenarios based on their clinical experience. An expert panel of six emergency physicians, five experienced emergency nurses, and five nursing faculty reviewed the scenarios for clinical accuracy, clarity, and educational relevance, making revisions as needed. The panel rated the difficulty of embedded questions within each scenario on a 10-point scale and selected the four most difficult questions for formal evaluation. The remaining scenarios, deemed educationally valuable, were incorporated into the gamified situational modules of a mobile application designed to enhance clinical decision-making through scenario-based training.

Reliability and validity of tools

The validity of the questionnaire was evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Quantitatively, the content validity ratio (CVR) and the content validity index (CVI) calculated from feedback provided by 10 experts (nursing professors, emergency physicians, and experienced emergency nurses). The resulting content validity coefficient was 0.91, exceeding the acceptable Lawshe table value of 0.69 for 10 experts [33]. The content validity index was greater than 0.9 for the instrument, which is accepted [34, 35] (see the result of CVR and CVI in additional file 3).

The test-retest reliability of the knowledge questionnaire showed no significant difference after a two-week interval (n = 25, r = 0.69, p = 0.00). Participants were sixth-semester nursing students who had completed the trauma nursing course and were willing to participate; incomplete questionnaires were excluded. Inter-rater reliability of practical skills, assessed via intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = 0.59, p < 0.001), showed no significant difference between researcher and emergency department nurse evaluations (n = 14; t = 0.52, df = 26, p = 0.60). Inter-rater reliability samples included hemodynamically stable head trauma patients (Glasgow Coma Scale > 14, age 18–65) without cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or diabetes, hospitalized in the emergency department.

Data collection

After securing approval from the ethics committee and receiving a letter of introduction from the esteemed Vice President of Research, we reached out to our participants with a heartfelt assurance of the study’s significance and a promise of confidentiality for their personal information. To gather relevant background, we administered a demographic questionnaire that captured details such as age, gender, grade point average (GPA), and prior completion of trauma patient assessment courses.

We then engaged both the intervention and control groups in an interactive face-to-face lecture format, which unfolded over two enriching sessions, each lasting two hours, across one week. Following these enlightening lectures, the intervention group was introduced to an innovative digital game-based study guide designed specifically for head trauma assessment.

A week later, from June 28 to 30, 2024, we conducted a thorough assessment of the knowledge and practical skills of participants in both groups. This evaluation was carried out through an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) within a meticulously crafted simulated environment. The OSCE, evaluating head trauma management, was conducted in two days, with all participants completing two stations. Each station simulated a head injury scenario, assessing clinical reasoning, communication, and decision-making skills within a six-minute time constraint. This format ensured consistent assessment and streamlined logistics. Examiners used practical skills assessment checklists for objective and uniform evaluation. The focused trauma scenarios effectively assessed critical skills relevant to emergency and acute care settings.

We ensured rigorous objectivity by maintaining blinding during both the data collection and analysis phases. The entire research process is elegantly depicted in Fig. 1. Once data collection was complete, we excitedly presented the developed application to the control group, further enhancing their learning experience.

Digital study guide design

To implement the intervention, the Digital Game-Based Study Guide for head trauma assessment was developed using the cascade model [36], which includes the following stages: initial analysis, system analysis, design, programming, testing (both alpha and beta), implementation, and modification. In the alpha test, 12 experts participated, including emergency and neurology specialists as well as faculty member nurses, with an average age of 38.43 years (standard deviation = 8.84). They evaluated the application on its content, ease of use, and practicality. Additionally, 5 information technology specialists, with an average age of 33.80 years (standard deviation = 7.22), assessed the application’s structure and ease of execution. The results of the alpha test were shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Results of the alpha test (opinions of healthcare professionals and IT specialists regarding the application) Full size table

In the beta test, the completed mobile application was provided to 17 nursing students in their 5th semester and above, with an average age (standard deviation) of 20.71 (1.16) years. They examined the app in terms of usability, convenience, and simplicity. As a result, the program was deemed suitable by both professionals and learners in the alpha and beta tests. The results of the beta test are shown in Table 2.

Table 2 Results of the beta test (nursing students’ opinions as end-users of the application) Full size table

The application was designed in two parts: a guide for head trauma assessment and game situations. In the training section, the study guide for head trauma assessment is prepared based on the head trauma assessment algorithm, and at each stage (assessment of consciousness level, vital signs, disability, and blood sugar), the person is guided on what action to take based on the patient’s response.

In the game-based situations section, the clinical scenarios of head injury victims are designed and embedded in the application as a game so that the learner first observes the cause of the injury and performs their examinations based on that. Anticipates nursing diagnoses and necessary measures. At each stage, in case of mistakes, feedback is given to him on what things he did not consider and what would have been a better path for the examination. If they choose correctly, they will get a green card, and if they make a mistake, they will receive a red card.

Data analysis

Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and Psychometrica (Lenhard, W. & Lenhard, A., 2022). Computation of effect sizes. Retrieved from https://www.psychometrica.de/effect_size.html. Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Group homogeneity was evaluated with independent t-tests and chi-squared tests. Independent samples t-tests compared outcomes between intervention and control groups, while paired samples t-tests compared pre- and post-intervention results within each group. A significance level of p < 0.05 was used for all tests.

(NYSE American: PLX), have requested a re-examination of the recent negative opinion issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding the proposed dosing regimen of 2 mg/kg body weight infused every 4 weeks (E4W) for Elfabrio® (pegunigalsidase alfa).

The opinion concerns the request to add the E4W dosing regimen to the currently approved 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (E2W) regimen. The existing marketing authorization for Elfabrio remains in effect pending the outcome of the re-examination procedure and subsequent decision by the European Commission (EC).

Both Chiesi and Protalix remain fully committed to working closely with the EMA through the re-examination process and to addressing the high unmet medical needs of the Fabry community.

Important Safety Information

Indication

Elfabrio® (pegunigalsidase alfa-iwxj) is indicated for the treatment of adults with confirmed Fabry disease.

Important Safety Information

WARNING: HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS INCLUDING ANAPHYLAXIS

Patients treated with Elfabrio have experienced hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Appropriate medical support measures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment, should be readily available during Elfabrio administration. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) occurs, discontinue Elfabrio immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment. In patients with severe hypersensitivity reaction, a desensitization procedure to Elfabrio may be considered.

Prior to Elfabrio administration, consider pretreating with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids. Inform patients and caregivers of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and infusion-associated reactions (IARs), and instruct them to seek medical care immediately if such symptoms occur.

If a severe hypersensitivity reaction (including anaphylaxis) or severe IAR occurs, immediately discontinue Elfabrio administration and initiate appropriate medical treatment.

If a mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction or IAR occurs, consider slowing the infusion rate or temporarily withholding the dose.

In clinical trials, 20 (14%) Elfabrio-treated patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions. Four Elfabrio-treated patients (3%) experienced anaphylaxis reactions that occurred within 5 to 40 minutes of the start of the initial infusion. The signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis included headache, nausea, vomiting, throat tightness, facial and oral edema, truncal rash, tachycardia, hypotension, rigors, urticaria, intense pruritus, moderate upper airway obstructions, macroglossia, and mild lip edema.

In clinical trials, 41 (29%) Elfabrio-treated patients experienced one or more infusion-associated reactions, including hypersensitivity, nausea, chills, pruritus, rash, chest pain, dizziness, vomiting, asthenia, pain, sneezing, dyspnea, nasal congestion, throat irritation, abdominal pain, erythema, diarrhea, burning sensation, neuralgia, headache, paresthesia, tremor, agitation, increased body temperature, flushing, bradycardia, myalgia, hypertension, and hypotension.

A case of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with immune depositions in the kidney was reported during clinical trials. Monitor serum creatinine and urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, discontinue treatment until a diagnostic evaluation can be conducted.

When switching to Elfabrio from a prior enzyme replacement therapy, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and infusion-associated reactions may be increased in certain patients with pre-existing anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Consider monitoring IgG and IgE ADAs and clinical or pharmacodynamic response (eg, plasma lyso-Gb3 levels). The most common adverse reactions (≥15%) were infusion-associated reactions, nasopharyngitis, headache, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, back pain, pain in extremity, and sinusitis.
