[TITLE]Full ban on Russian gas imports on the table at EU Energy Ministers’ meeting:
[TEXT]
Newsroom October 20 08:26

The European Union’s initiative to fully ban the import of gas and oil from Russia, as part of its sanctions over the war in Ukraine, is expected to move to the next stage today, as the bloc’s 27 Energy Ministers are set to adopt the measure.

Meeting in Luxembourg, the ministers aim to forge a common position on the total ban before the decision is finalized in negotiations with the European Parliament.

Members of the European Parliament already voted in favor of the proposal last week, paving the way for talks with the member state capitals.

According to the plan, imports of oil, pipeline natural gas, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be entirely and permanently prohibited by 2028 at the latest.

The ban, once agreed upon in talks with the European Parliament, will be adopted by simple majority vote — meaning countries such as Hungary and Slovakia, which still import Russian gas through pipelines, will not be able to veto it.

It is not ruled out that the measure could be implemented sooner, as efforts are underway to impose a ban on Russian gas imports under the upcoming package of sanctions against Moscow.

As of 2024, Russia still accounted for roughly one-fifth of all gas imports into the EU, with an even higher share in natural gas specifically. In the first half of 2025, EU member states imported Russian gas worth nearly €4.5 billion.

The sanctions can be formally adopted once all 27 member states agree — without the involvement of the European Parliament — allowing the process to move faster.

The punitive measures are described as temporary and can be lifted once the war in Ukraine ends and Brussels no longer sees any justification for maintaining them.

At the same time, the EU’s Foreign Ministers, also meeting today in Luxembourg, will discuss developments in the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha is expected to join part of their session.

The Council will also discuss a proposal to use frozen Russian assets to finance a loan aimed at providing war reparations to Ukraine, as well as the EU’s 19th package of sanctions against Russia.

The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip will also be on the agenda. Although the EU has so far been sidelined in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, European officials emphasize that the Union intends to play an active role in efforts to restore stability in the Middle East.

[TEXT]
The new US sanctions are no slap on the wrist - they're a punch to the gut of Moscow's war economy.

Oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil are the twin engines pumping money through Russia's military veins.

Washington framed the bold move as a bid to "degrade the Kremlin's ability to raise revenue for its war machine".

Oil is Russia's bloodstream, and the Trump Treasury just cut off the blood flow.

But every blow struck in the ring comes with the risk of self-inflicted pain, and there's potential for collateral damage.

By squeezing Russia's oil sector, the president is tightening the global market's chest - and America's own pump could feel the pressure.

The White House is gambling that the geopolitical payoff will ultimately outweigh the domestic sting.

"These are tremendous sanctions and I hope they don't last long," Mr Trump said.

That mix of swagger and caveat summed up his approach - maximum pressure, but with an eye on prices back home.

Europe rushed to mirror Washington's stance, adding restrictions on imports and tightening loopholes in shipping.

The EU was clearly signalling that it's in Trump's corner, that the Western alliance holds.

'Wasted journey'

On both sides of the Atlantic, they know that Moscow will seize on any disunity and slip through the cracks.

An Oval Office meeting with the NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte provided the diplomatic stagecraft.

Mr Trump repeated that he'd cancelled a planned summit with Vladimir Putin because he "didn't want to have a wasted journey".

Mr Rutte played the part of loyal ally, twice labelling the US president "the only one who can get this done".

Putin 'has sent signal to Trump that he's ready for deal'

Trump responds to idea of tunnel connecting Russia and US

Earlier, Mr Rutte played down my suggestion that his visit indicated Trump's meeting with Zelensky last Friday had been a disaster.

It wouldn't be the first time Mr Rutte, who famously referred to Mr Trump as "Daddy", has poured oil on troubled waters.

But it's Moscow's apparent refusal to accept Trump's terms that has put plans for another summit with Putin on hold.

Could there be a wider impact?

China's diplomatic influence with Russia could give it some leverage when Mr Trump meets Xi Jinping for trade talks next week.

The US president's sanctions are more than punishment - they're a strategic gamble to corner Putin - but the margin of error is razor thin.

If energy prices surge or allied unity splinters, Mr Trump could find himself on the ropes.

[TITLE]U.S. sanctions Russia's two largest oil companies:
[TEXT]
The Treasury Department announced new sanctions targeting Russia’s oil sector Wednesday, the day after President Donald Trump confirmed that a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss Russia's war with Ukraine was off.

“Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.”

The two companies being sanctioned are Rosneft and Lukoil, along with some of their subsidiaries, the statement said.

Despite the war and the battered Russian economy, Rosneft and Lukoil are worth more than $50 billion each and are two of the biggest companies listed on the Moscow Stock Exchange.

Trump told reporters Wednesday that it was the appropriate time to use sanctions to try to end the war.

"I just felt it was time. Waited a long time," Trump said.

He added: "These are tremendous sanctions. These are very big; these are against their two big oil companies. And we hope that they won’t be on for long. We hope that the war will be settled."

Trump also said he hoped both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be "reasonable" and put aside their hatred for each other to resolve the conflict.

Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Olga Stefanishyna, signaled her strong support for the new sanctions Wednesday. "The decision is fully aligned with Ukraine’s consistent position: peace is possible only through strength and pressure on the aggressor using all available international tools," she posted on X.

Last week, it appeared that relations between Washington and Moscow were warming after Trump held a call with Putin on Thursday and after Trump did not approve Zelenskyy's request for long-range Tomahawk missiles in a meeting Friday.

Trump’s latest peace push hit a roadblock during a call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, according to senior figures on both sides.

Lavrov became “exercised” during the call, a Trump administration official told NBC News. He reiterated Russia’s refusal to agree to an immediate ceasefire before talks begin, a key demand of Kyiv and Europe that the United States has backed.

"We canceled the meeting with President Putin. It just, it didn’t feel right to meet. It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it, but we’ll do it in the future," Trump said Wednesday.

He added: "Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere. They just don’t go anywhere."

Trump has been under pressure from Zelenskyy, European nations and members of Congress from both parties for months to intensify U.S. sanctions on Russia.

[TITLE]US sanctions Rosneft, Lukoil as Trump’s Ukraine peace bid falters:
[TEXT]
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced new sanctions Wednesday against Russia’s two biggest oil companies and blasted Moscow’s refusal to end its “senseless war” as U.S.-led efforts to end the war floundered and the Ukrainian president sought more foreign military help.

The sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as dozens of subsidiaries, followed months of bipartisan pressure on President Donald Trump to hit Russia with harder sanctions on its oil industry.

“Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” Bessent said in a statement. Given Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine.”

Bessent said the Treasury Department was prepared to take further action if necessary to support Trump’s effort to end the war. “We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.”

NATO, Trump and a faltering peace

Bessent made the comments as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was in Washington for talks with Trump. The military alliance has been coordinating deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, many of them purchased from the United States by Canada and European countries.

The announcement came after Russian drones and missiles blasted sites across Ukraine, killing at least six people, including a woman and her two young daughters.

The attack came in waves from Tuesday night into Wednesday and targeted at least eight Ukrainian cities, as well as a village in the region of the capital, Kyiv, where a strike set fire to a house in which the mother and her 6-month-old and 12-year-old daughters were staying, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said.

At least 29 people, including five children, were wounded in Kyiv, which appeared to be the main target, authorities said.

Russian drones also hit a kindergarten in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, later Wednesday when children were in the building, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. One person was killed and six were hurt, but no children were physically harmed, he said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said many of the children were in shock. He said the attack targeted 10 separate regions: Kyiv, Odesa, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Cherkasy and Sumy.

Russia fired 405 strike and decoy drones and 28 missiles, mainly targeting Kyiv, Ukraine’s air force said.

Peace efforts stall

Trump’s efforts to end the war that started with Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago have failed to gain traction. Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s refusal to budge from his conditions for a settlement after Ukraine offered a ceasefire and direct peace talks.

Trump said Tuesday that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn’t want it to be a “waste of time.” European leaders accused Putin of stalling.

Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Trump’s proposal to freeze the conflict where it stands on the front line “was a good compromise” — a step that could pave the way for negotiations.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the planned summit requires careful preparation, suggesting that laying the groundwork could be protracted. “No one wants to waste time: neither President Trump nor President Putin,” he said.

In what appeared to be a public reminder of Russian atomic arsenals, Putin on Wednesday directed drills of the country’s strategic nuclear forces.

Zelenskyy urged the European Union, the United States and the Group of Seven industrialized nations to force Russia to the negotiating table. Pressure can be applied on Moscow “only through sanctions, long-range (missile) capabilities and coordinated diplomacy among all our partners,” he said.

More international economic sanctions on Russia are likely to be discussed Thursday at an EU summit in Brussels. On Friday, a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing — a group of 35 countries that support Ukraine — is to take place in London.

Zelenskyy credited Trump’s remarks that he was considering supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for Putin’s willingness to meet. The American president later said he was wary of tapping into the U.S. supply of Tomahawks over concerns

[TITLE]India can lead the global shift to green shipping:
[TEXT]
A quiet revolution is gathering momentum across the world’s oceans. The shipping industry once dismissed as a laggard in the energy transition, is now confronting a point of inflexion. Heeding to the call for climate action, global momentum to tighten emissions standards have gathered speed, while financiers are also redirecting capital towards zero-carbon vessels and fuels, and technology is advancing faster. In this swirl of change, India stands at a rare confluence of opportunity and capability.

The Modi government has worked towards building a solid base for renewable energy which has in turn positioned India with one of lowest renewable energy costs globally. A growing and resilient industrial base with ‘Make in India’ impetus, and efforts to modernise, mechanise and digitise ports along the busy east-west trade route have provided the country with unique advantage — moving from a position of whether our maritime sector can join the global green maritime transition meaningfully, to whether we can lead it decisively.

The government’s recent approval of ₹69,725 crore ($8 billion) package to reimagine, revive and rejuvenate India’s shipbuilding and maritime ecosystem is not a routine budget line, but a signal of ambition. By investing at scale, the Modi government has sent a message that India shall take meaningful role in the global shift to low-carbon shipping.

This historic decision sets the stage for a maritime renaissance a return to the spirit of seafaring enterprise that once defined Bharat’s trading heritage.

The global tide is turning

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a clear course towards net-zero emissions by 2050. Europe has already moved from words to enforcement, its carbon market now charges ships for emissions, and FuelEU Maritime progressively tightens fuel standards each year.

Alternative fuels such as green ammonia and methanol are shifting from pilot projects to purchase orders. This is the moment when policy becomes market, and market becomes momentum. India’s structural advantages, low renewable energy costs, engineering expertise, and skilled seafarers, can convert that momentum into meaningful market share.

India’s renewable power tariffs, discovered by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), are among the lowest globally around ₹2 per kiloWatt hour. That translates into competitively priced green fuels. Recent bids for green ammonia have settled near ₹52 per kg, placing Indian production costs below $650/tonne, cheaper than many established export hubs.

This price advantage is not theoretical. Asian shipping lines and European buyers are already negotiating long-term contracts in the $550-1,000 per tonne range. India is ready to deliver at scale.

Equally critical is our industrial ecosystem. Our country’s heavy-engineering backbone that served the oil and petrochemical sectors is now retooling for the green transition fabricating bunkering skids, dual-fuel engines, and storage systems for clean fuels. Our geography amplifies these strengths: ports on both coasts sit astride major global trade lanes, and our seafarers can be rapidly up-skilled to handle cryogenic and digital systems for new fuels. Simply put, India can produce, handle, and export the next generation of marine fuels faster and more affordably than most.

But ambition alone doesn’t unlock capital; bankable projects do.

A joint study by the Indian Ports Association (IPA) and RMI, Gateway to Green, identifies Deendayal, VO Chidambaranar (VOC), and Paradip ports as early candidates for green-fuel hubs. They already have the land, draft, and pipeline potential. With targeted investments in storage, grid upgrades, and multi-fuel terminals, these ports can become “green ready.”

Bankable demand

The next step is to ensure demand. Domestic green shipping corridors, such as Kandla to VOC and international routes linking India with Singapore and Rotterdam, can aggregate fuel needs and create predictable throughput. When supply meets structured demand, finance follows.

Shipowners can plan fleet conversions, cargo owners can lock in long-term charters, and lenders can assess risk with confidence. This is how India intends to position as an indispensable node in the global low-carbon maritime economy.

Our ministry’s immediate priority is credibility. Early milestones pilot corridors, port retrofits, and operational benchmarks will prove that green shipping is not an experiment but an economic upgrade. Visible success will build investor confidence, inform future regulation, and serve as templates for replication across lighthouse ports.

The macroeconomic case is equally strong. Aligning with emerging IMO and EU standards preserves export market access and shields Indian industries from future carbon penalties. Domestic manufacturing of engines, storage tanks, and digital systems will generate skilled employment and retain value onshore. A full-fledged green maritime ecosystem will create recurring service revenue for ports, while cutting freight emissions a strategic advantage in a carbon-constrained global economy.

Every global transition presents a narrow window where leadership is won or lost. As carbon prices rise and compliance rules tighten, vessels will choose ports that offer clean fuels and efficient services. Those who delay will pay higher costs to catch up.

India’s $8-billion commitment signals that we intend not just to adapt to a changing world but to shape it.

The writer is Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW)

Indonesia accelerates green investment with new biomethane policies

Jakarta (ANTARA) - The Indonesian government continues to strengthen its commitment to promoting green investment through the issuance of various strategic regulations.The initiative, led by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM), is part of efforts to accelerate the transition toward a clean and equitable energy system in Indonesia.Acting Director of Bioenergy at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Harris, explained that several new regulations have been prepared to reinforce the policy direction for national biomethane development.Some of these regulations were formulated in collaboration with Germany through the ExploRE project.“This collaboration has resulted in several key instruments, including the establishment of the Indonesian Standard Industrial Classification (KBLI) 35203 for biogas business activities, which has been integrated into the OSS BKPM system,” Harris said here on Wednesday.He added that it also includes the drafting of the Biomethane Investment Guideline to promote green investment and an academic paper outlining regulatory needs for converting biogas into biomethane.He stated these initiatives reflect strong synergy among the government, research institutions, industry players, and international development partners.The collaboration forms the foundation for strengthening policies, investments, and governance that support the establishment of a national biomethane ecosystem.According to Harris, the outcomes of this collaboration are not only technical achievements but also a sustainable foundation for improving Indonesia’s energy governance.This step, he said, is part of the nation’s broader economic transformation toward a cleaner and more equitable energy system.He also emphasized that the development of green energy aligns with the Indonesia-European Union Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IEU-CEPA), concluded in September.The agreement opens opportunities for cooperation between Indonesia and the European Union in the green economy sector, including technology transfer, clean energy development, sustainability standards enhancement, and trade in renewable energy products based on local potential.“This policy alignment strengthens Indonesia’s position as a strategic partner in accelerating green growth and expanding a sustainable global investment network,” Harris said.He stressed that the energy transition is not merely a technical agenda but an economic transformation that requires the participation of all stakeholders.“Through progressive policies, investment support, and international collaboration, Indonesia is moving toward a clean, self-reliant, and prosperous energy future for all,” he stated.Meanwhile, Director of the GIZ Indonesia/ASEAN Energy Program, Lisa Tinschert, said that the ExploRE project, which has been running for eight years, has achieved several key milestones.“One of ExploRE’s main contributions is promoting the development of a biomethane ecosystem based on industrial waste through comprehensive support, from policy formulation and capacity building to developing a biomethane potential database, public outreach, and technical assistance for potential projects,” Tinschert said.Through cross-sectoral synergy and international support, the government reaffirms its concrete steps toward sustainable energy transformation while strengthening Indonesia’s position as a key player in green investment in the region.

[TITLE]First SMR in Alberta Could Power the Oil Sands:
[TEXT]
A study by X-energy Canada has confirmed the feasibility and benefits of repurposing an existing thermal generation site in Alberta with X-energy's small modular reactors, World Nuclear News reports.

Funded by Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA), the study found that the Xe-100 high-temperature gas-cooled reactor is uniquely suited to Alberta's energy needs. As well as producing electricity, it is specifically designed to provide 565°C heat and steam for industrial applications, unlocking a broad range of use cases for Alberta's industrial and oil and gas sectors, the company said. The province's established supply chain capabilities are well-positioned to support the manufacturing and construction of the technology, while the Xe-100's design means it can use air-cooling systems, significantly reducing overall water usage, and offering greater siting flexibility over conventional light-water reactors.

In 2023, ERA committed $7 million for Cenovus, a Calgary-based energy company, to study the use of small modular reactors in the oil sands.

In August, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said the government sees “tremendous potential” for nuclear in the province.

While Alberta does not currently have any nuclear generating capacity, in 2021 it signed a memorandum of understanding with Ontario, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan to collaborate on SMR development, and has signed MOUs with several SMR developers. According to World Nuclear News, Energy Alberta has proposed building a nuclear power plant based on large-scale Candu Monark reactors at a site in the Peace River region of northern Alberta.

[TITLE]Huge AI data centers are turning local elections into fights over the future of energy:
[TEXT]
For the past two decades, data centers were considered some of the most boring infrastructure in tech—big, boxy buildings that quietly stored and processed information for websites, email, and cloud computing. They rarely drew public attention, much less became a campaign issue.

But the explosion of generative AI, and its massive computing needs, has turned what were once modest server farms into sprawling mega-complexes that can take up many millions of square feet, draw enough electricity to power a medium-sized city, and consume millions of gallons of water. Now AI data centers have suddenly become one of the most potent political flashpoints of 2025, igniting fierce debates over power, water, land, and jobs. Critics blame them for rising electricity bills and strained water supplies, while supporters tout their potential to spur economic growth and deliver tax windfalls to long-stagnant communities.

Those debates are coming to a head this fall in Virginia and New Jersey—the only states holding gubernatorial elections this year. The two races offer early test cases for how the politics of AI infrastructure could shape campaigns nationwide in 2026 and beyond. At issue are tax incentives and infrastructure costs states are offering to attract hyperscale AI data centers; mounting concerns
