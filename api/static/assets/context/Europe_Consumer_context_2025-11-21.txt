[TITLE]French Retail Groups Take Legal Action Against Shein Over Product Safety, Unfair Competition:
[TEXT]
PARIS — After the hotly contested opening of Shein‘s first physical retail store earlier this month, French fashion and retail groups are turning up the heat on the Chinese ultra-fast-fashion giant.

In a landmark move, 12 French retail federations, alongside several big brands, have launched legal proceedings against Shein’s Ireland-based European subsidiary, Infinite Styles Service Co. Ltd.

The federations’ legal action against Shein seeks to stop unfair competition and ensure compliance with European product safety standards, leveling the playing field for French retailers. It also aims to put a price on the economic harm to the sector as well as potentially recover damages, as well as set a legal precedent for regulating global e-commerce platforms operating in Europe.

The groups say that Shein’s aggressive pricing, rapid product turnover, decentralized production model and labor practices, coupled with its noncompliance with European safety standards, has created an unlevel playing field for French fashion brands.

According to coalition estimates, these practices may have cost French companies as much as 3 billion euros. Sources clarified that this figure is a gauge calculated from financial modeling including revenue projections and market share estimates, rather than an official audit.

The number is used to illustrate the scale of what the federations describe as a “systemic issue” that has crushed the domestic retail industry, resulting in several high street brands going into bankruptcy.

Alliance du Commerce president Bernardi Cherqui said that 2 million parcels arrive in France a day from Chinese platforms including Shein, Temu and Aliexpress. The number “has quadrupled over the past three years,” he said, adding that number has accelerated since the U.S. scrapped its de minimis rule in May and Chinese companies have sought out new markets for their goods.

“This unfair competition from China and other platforms represents a systemic threat to commerce in France in the coming years. The consequences are clear — the weakening of companies, the disappearance of tens of thousands of jobs, and the erosion of local economies. Commerce is

[TITLE]AI Revives Autonomous Microstores as Inventory Agents Cut Costs:
[TEXT]
Autonomous microstores are returning to the retail market as artificial intelligence (AI) solves the accuracy and cost issues that stalled the first generation. New systems use stronger computer vision, lightweight agentic inventory models and simpler robotics to track items, forecast demand and run without dense sensor grids or continuous human oversight.

Retailers are moving from small pilots to practical deployments as evidence grows that the model can operate reliably at lower cost.

The first wave of microstores depended on pressure shelves and large sensor arrays that required constant calibration and often produced inconsistent reads. AI is changing that. Today’s vision models handle low light, tight aisles and cluttered shelves with much greater stability.

A study from University of Michigan shows how modern vision architectures reduce occlusion errors and cut reliance on expensive multi-sensor hardware. These improvements eliminate much of the fragility that made early autonomous stores difficult to scale.

AI Makes Microstores Operationally Viable

An example of the new model is VenHub’s rollout in Los Angeles. The company opened a 24/7 smart store at Los Angeles Union Station as part of its transit-hub deployment. The autonomous store runs on vision-driven checkout, robotic picking and real-time inventory agents. The store manages SKU counts, customer interactions and demand forecasting using a compact AI stack designed for unattended operation.

Underlying technologies are also maturing. Modern vision systems track items and customer movement without pressure shelves or heavy sensor grids. The move toward software-driven perception lowers installation costs and increases reliability.

Inventory automation is strengthening the model further, and this layer is becoming one of the most important differentiators between legacy autonomous retail formats and the second-generation systems now entering the market.

For example, Brain Corp’s robotic shelf-intelligence platform, ShelfOptix, captures shelf data, detects misplaced goods and updates inventory in real time. It also detects shelf gaps, tracks planogram deviations, and records count discrepancies as they happen rather than after the fact. Continuous monitoring is critical for unattended formats, which depend on clean data to avoid stock errors and unexpected downtime.

PYMNTS Intelligence has tracked the same shift across unattended retail. The latest analysis shows that AI and connected devices are giving operators real-time visibility into transactions, shelf conditions and store performance.

The research also finds that consumers are moving toward frictionless formats as cashless payments become standard in self-service environments. Retailers are using these systems to reduce manual oversight, identify issues earlier and stabilize small-footprint locations that operate without staff. The findings point to a broader acceleration of autonomous retail as technology replaces labor-intensive monitoring.

A Second Wave Driven by Costs, Reliability and Proof of Deployment

Labor cost pressure and changing consumer behavior are major drivers in this second wave. Retailers want small, high-availability formats that do not expand headcount. Microstores meet that need with compact footprints and predictable operating costs. AI agents manage replenishment, forecast demand and enforce planograms, which reduces manual workload.

Reliability is also improving. Earlier microstores often failed when sensors misread items or checkout systems broke down. A PYMNTS Tracker shows how modern AI-IoT systems detect anomalies early and support remote fixes. Field deployments such as VenHub’s demonstrate extended periods of unattended operation, something the first-generation formats could not achieve.

Costs have shifted in favor of adoption. Modern microstores use fewer sensors, rely on smaller models running on compact hardware and use robotics with fewer moving parts. These improvements shorten installation cycles and reduce maintenance demands.

Retailers are also widening their use of smart-commerce orchestration tools that coordinate sensors, cameras and store-management systems in real time. Recent PYMNTS coverage shows that self-serve retail is benefiting from platforms that integrate item tracking, temperature sensors, motion alerts and automated merchandising rules into a single command layer.

Financial Results – Fourth Quarter 2025

Consolidated Overview

The net sales increase of 51% included revenue from the Glatfelter merger of $328 million and favorable foreign currency changes of $10 million that were partially offset by a $35 million decrease in selling prices primarily due to the pass-through of lower raw material costs and a 3% organic volume decline which was attributed to general market softness in Europe and competitive pressures from imports in South America.

Americas

The net sales increase in the Americas segment included revenue from the Glatfelter merger of $122 million partially offset by decreased selling prices of $28 million due to the pass-through of lower raw material cost and product mix and a 3% organic volume decline, which was primarily attributed to competitive pressures from imports in South America.

The adjusted EBITDA increase included a contribution from the Glatfelter merger of $14 million partially offset by unfavorable impacts from price cost spread of $6 million and volume decline of $2 million.

[TITLE]Fashion prepares for challenging year ahead: BoF, McKinsey:
[TEXT]
Research

Despite the challenges, one in four leaders anticipate improvement, up from last year’s 20 percent. Image courtesy of Business of Fashion

The global fashion industry is bracing for a difficult 2026.

Delivered on Nov. 17, new research from consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and The Business of Fashion (BoF) confirms that trade disruptions, geopolitical tensions and sliding consumer sentiment are the biggest challenges for the industry, according to the State of Fashion 2026, the tenth annual report from the duo. Nearly half of industry leaders expect conditions to deteriorate next year, a sharp rise from a year ago, and 78 percent view declining consumer confidence as the sector’s most significant challenge.

“Fashion’s old playbook no longer applies,” said Imran Amed, founder and chief executive officer of The Business of Fashion, in a statement.

“Tariffs, technology and new consumer priorities are forcing a fundamental reset,” Mr. Amed said. “The State of Fashion 2026 challenges leaders to act with urgency — to rewire their organisations for agility, embed AI at the core of how they operate and reconnect with customers who are redefining what value really means.”

Global overview

With a decade marked by constant change, fashion executives have accepted the volatility and have come to replace the usage of the word “uncertainty” with “challenging.”

With global fashion markets expected to grow only in the low single digits, competition for market share will intensify. Europe is forecasted to expand by 1 to 2 percent, while the United States and China are projected to grow between 1 to 3 percent.

The slew of recent creative director appointments (see story) may bolster luxury brands, though mid-market brands have overtaken luxury as the industry’s “main value creator in 2024.”

However, brands across all price points are feeling the pressure from consumers who are scaling back their spending. Yet, 31 percent of shoppers admit to a willingness to “splurge on fashion if it is the right product.”

Despite the challenges, one in four leaders anticipate improvement, up from last year’s 20 percent. Areas generating optimism include jewelry, wearable tech in the form of eyewear and the resale market.

“In this context, jewelry becomes a medium for everyday expression, even when the economy is troubled,” said Alexis Nasard, CEO of Swarovski, in a statement.

“Jewelry is ultimate discretionary spending, but in markets like the U.S., as long as consumers have some money to spare and the value proposition resonates, they will spend.”

With the implementation of the U.S. tariffs in 2025, 76 percent of executives expect increased trade friction and rising duties to heavily influence the industry next year. Price increases are planned across markets, especially in North America, where nearly half of all leaders expect to raise prices by more than 5 percent.

“We are taking some surgical and targeted pricing [increases], as probably most apparel or retailers are,” said Michelle Gass, CEO of Levi’s, in a statement.

“There’s only so much you can absorb from the tariffs, because they’re just very high.”

Harnessing tech

Technology, particularly generative artificial intelligence, is emerging as the industry’s most significant opportunity, as consumers develop trust for the tools, with 23 percent admitting to utilizing AI to discover new products.

With the increase in consumer search, companies are implementing software such as geneartive engine optimization (GEO).

GEO optimizes online content for AI, making products and content easier for AI to read and will work alongside SEO. The acceleration of AI-discovery is enhanced by consumers' reported trust of generative AI search results, with 41 percent saying they prefer AI search to traditional advertising.

Smart glasses are poised for breakout growth, with analysts expecting sales to quadruple in 2026 and for the category to exceed $30 billion by 2030.

Most recently, French luxury conglomerate Kering announced a partnership with Google for the development of smart frames (see story). Meanwhile, Italian eyewear conglomerate EssilorLuxottica acquired Belgium-based Automation & Robotics to aid in its production capabilities this summer (see story) after extending its smart frame development deal with Meta last year (see story).

The broader wearable market is expected to grow
