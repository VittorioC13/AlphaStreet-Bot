[TITLE]39 firms honoured in 1st Asia ESG Positive Impact Awards:
[TEXT]
PETALING JAYA: The role of the public and private sectors in ­driving sustainability took centre stage at the Asia ESG Positive Impact Awards (PIA) 2025 as 39 winners from across Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia took home a total of 52 awards in recognition of their environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts.

The awards mark the first regional accolades for the Asia ESG Positive Impact Consortium (A-EPIC), which was launched in 2024 by Star Media Group (SMG) from Malaysia, KG Media from Indonesia and the Inquirer Group of Companies from the Philippines.

The winners were awarded based on 12 different categories, which included biodiversity conservation, waste management, renewable energy, energy efficiency, supply chain management, innovative partnership and transformation, by an international panel of judges.

Social achievements and contributions were also acknowledged through the categories of diversity, equity and inclusion; relations with local communities; human rights and labour standards; ­talent management; and good health and well-being.

They had all previously won in the consortium’s local awards – ESG PIA by SMG, Lestari Awards by KG Media and ESG Edge Impact Awards by the Inquirer Group of Companies.

These companies consisted of small and medium enterprises to mid-tier, as well as large corporations and were honoured for their exceptional dedication to sustainability, championing climate ­resilience, and ethical business practices.

Guest of honour Energy Transition and Water Transfor­mation Deputy Minister Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir praised the winning companies for leading ESG efforts across the region.

“Climate change, resource scarcity and social inequality know no borders and therefore, neither can our solutions.

“Under the National Energy Transition Roadmap, we are working towards achieving 70% renewable capacity by 2050.”

“Government action alone is not enough, as we need the ­commitment of the private sector, civil society and media organisations to raise awareness, mobilise communities and drive lasting behavioural change.

“We firmly believe that regional collaboration is key to accelerating a just, equitable and ­inclusive energy transition,” he said in his speech at the awards ceremony yesterday at Sunway Resort Hotel.

He said the awards served as an important platform to elevate corporate efforts in ESG leadership while shaping public values around sustainability.

“Through these awards, we see how collaboration between Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines can foster a shared sustainability mindset across South-East Asia.

“This partnership sends a strong message that Asia is not only ready to adopt global sustainability standards, but we are ready to lead, with solutions rooted in our cultural strengths, economic priorities and community values.

“Your efforts remind us that sustainability is not a final destination, but an ongoing commitment grounded in integrity and continuous improvement,” he added.

SMG group chief executive officer Chan Seng Fatt said the awards marked a historic milestone towards making sustainability a defining force in business, society and the economy going forward.

“This is not just another award but a movement – a collective step forward for regional collaboration among media giants in our evolution beyond just reporting and becoming connectors.

“Through linking businesses, policymakers, investors and ­communities through these awards, we media giants now help to exchange knowledge and accelerate the ESG transformation.

“By celebrating these winners, we accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices across our countries and inspire more businesses to embed ESG into their strategies,” he said in his speech at the event.

Chan added that the awards also showcased the increased importance of inclusiveness ­during the ESG transition through the recognition of every organisation, whether they are large or small.

He called on all stakeholders to use the awards as a catalyst to deepen partnerships, share best practices, and scale solutions that deliver measurable impact for the good of all.

“Together, let us build a region that is responsible, resilient, and ready for the future – a region that turns purpose into progress and ambition into action,” he added.

Philippine Daily Inquirer chief operating officer Rudyard Arbolado said the awards were not just a recognition of ESG efforts but a platform for change.

“Celebrating achievement is important, but the greater value lies in showcasing what’s possible and in sharing successful models that can inspire and educate others.

“We want to show that ESG is not just a compliance exercise or a CSR checkbox. It is a core driver of value, growth, and resilience in today’s business environment,” he said at the event.

KG Media sustainability vice president Wisnu Nugroho hoped that the awards would become a rallying point for a shared ESG transformation throughout the region.

“By celebrating authentic, measurable impact, we want to inspire companies to embed ESG in their DNA, not as compliance, but as culture. Over time, this recognition should shape a generation of enterprises that drive inclusive growth, protect natural capital, and define the region’s future economy through responsibility and resilience,” he said at the event.

“Together, we can amplify the stories of progress and collaboration that make sustainability not just a Western benchmark, but an Asian movement that is rooted in empathy, inclusivity and a collective vision for the future, he added.

Sime Darby Property chief marketing and sales officer Datuk Lai Shu Wei said the awards accelerate practical ESG adoption across industries in the region through the showcase of proven frameworks.

“It reinforces that nature and development can be integrated meaningfully when supported by clear frameworks, encouraging others to translate similar ambitions into practice.

“This shifts sustainability from an intention to proven evidence, positioning long-term value creation as the future norm rather than an exception,” he said.

Also present at the event were the Philippine Ambassador to Malaysia Maria Angela A. Ponce, Indonesia Deputy Chief of Mission to Malaysia Danang Waskito, DBKL valuation and property management department deputy director Siti Maizun Arshad, SMG chairman Tan Sri Wong Foon Meng, SMG chief operating officer Lydia Wang and SMG chief content officer Datin Paduka Esther Ng.

The Asia ESG PIA was the culmination of the consortium’s year-long efforts, including the Asia ESG Summit 2025, which began on Nov 5 and ends today. It is a platform for companies to engage with thought leaders and decision-makers in shaping the region’s sustainable future.

Besides Indonesia and the Philippines, the A-EPIC’s inaugural summit also saw participation of delegates from Cambodia, India, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Germany, Singapore, Brunei and South Africa.

Both the awards and the ­summit are organised by SMG with Sime Darby Property as the Urban Biodiversity Partner.

[TITLE]Unlocking new pathways:
[TEXT]
Time for Asia to balance economic growth with green ambition

PETALING JAYA: Asia must strike a balance between economic development and green ambition, moving towards growth that is inclusive and enduring, whereby sustainability isn’t just a destination but a sign of progress.

Science, Technology and Inno­vation Minister (Mosti) Chang Lih Kang said the global sustainabi­lity agenda is accelerating, as environmental standards are becoming more stringent.

“Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting is becoming mandatory, and investors are demanding greater transparency and accountability.

“While these trends raise the bar for all organisations, they also present Asia with a significant opportunity,” he said.

“By embedding sustainability at the very heart of business strategy, we can unlock new pathways into the green economy. To navigate the path to net-zero while sustaining economic vibrancy, we must be strategic, inclusive and grounded in local realities.”

Chang said this in his keynote address at the Asia ESG Summit 2025 titled “Navigating the Path to Net-Zero: Overcoming Resource Limitations and Rising Environ­mental Standards in Asia to Balance Global Sustainability Targets with Local Economic Realities.”

To achieve this, Chang said that global targets must be contextua­lised locally, followed by empowering science, technology and innovation (STI) to unlock opportunities in renewable energy, green materials and digital innovation.

Additionally, he said public-­private partnerships must be strengthened through policies and direction set by the governments, and the agility and creati­vity of the private sector.

He added that the ministry continues to collaborate with investors, research institutions and enterprises across Asean to implement solutions.

Chang said the transition must be just and inclusive to ensure sustainability uplifts both rural entrepreneurs and skilled professionals.

“No Malaysian should be left behind as we build a knowledge-­based green economy. Malaysia also remains fully aligned with Asean’s shared agenda to advance sustainability and innovation across the region.

“Through platforms such as the Asia ESG Summit, we exchange experiences, accelerate regional initiatives and strengthen cooperation in clean energy, climate resilience and circular economy systems,” he said.

Meanwhile, Star Media Group (SMG) group chief executive officer Chan Seng Fatt said hosting the first Asia ESG Summit reflects the trust placed in the company to spearhead this regional initiative and set the tone for meaningful dialogue and collaboration on sustainability.

“For us, it’s not just

[TITLE]Asian shares sink after losses for Big Tech pull US stocks lower:
[TEXT]
Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index dipped more than 4 per cent on Wednesday, and other shares in Asia also were mostly lower after a retreat on Wall Street spurred by selling of Big Tech shares.

US futures were mixed, and oil prices also fell. The Nikkei fell nearly 5 per cent early in the session but was down 2.8 per cent by mid-afternoon, at 50,090.33.

Shares in energy and tech giant SoftBank Group sank 9.8 per cent on jitters over its investments in artificial intelligence. Computer chip maker Tokyo Electron dropped 4.1 per cent, while stock in Advantest Corp., a maker of semiconductor testing equipment, lost 7.2 per cent.

South Korea's Kospi declined 3 per cent to 3,997.71 as Samsung Electronics shed 4.9 per cent. SK Hynix, which had logged major gains thanks to plans to develop artificial intelligence with chip maker Nvidia, lost 2.9 per cent.

Chinese markets were less affected. The Shanghai Composite index recovered from modest earlier losses to edge 0.2 per cent higher, to 3,967.53. Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.3 per cent to 25,888.16.

Investors took fright from the heavy selling of high-tech related shares overnight on Wall Street. The technology sector has been driving gains this year, and huge values for companies including Nvidia and Microsoft give them outsized influence over the broader market's direction.

“The rally that began in April is finally feeling its age. What we are seeing today wasn't just a dip; it was a full-scale reality check,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

“This wasn't the usual intraday shake-out. It felt more like the oxygen suddenly thinning at the top of a mountain that everyone assumed had no summit,” he said.

Palantir Technologies, which had more than doubled so far this year, fell 7.9 per cent despite reporting results that beat analysts' forecasts. Nvidia also reversed course from a day earlier, falling 4 per cent, while Microsoft fell 0.5 per cent.

Other sectors also declined, leading the S&P 500 to fall 1.2 per cent to 6,771.55. The index set its most recent all-time high last week, and is still up more than 15 per cent for the year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent to 47,085.24. The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 2 per cent to 23,348.64.

Wall Street remains focused on corporate earnings. Roughly three out of every four companies within the S&P 500 have reported their latest results, and most have been better than analysts expected.

Uber slumped 5.1 per cent despite reporting financial results that beat analysts' expectations.

Several big companies will report their latest financial results later this week, including McDonald's, Expedia Group and Qualcomm.

The latest round of corporate profit reports and forecasts has taken on more significance for Wall Street due to the US government shutdown. Investors and economists are trying to gauge the health and direction of the US economy without the latest economic updates on inflation and employment.

The lack of timely economic data has also left the Federal Reserve without many of the resources it needs to make decisions on interest rate policy.

The latest data showed consumer prices rose 3 per cent in September, the highest increase since January. At the same time, hiring has stalled. That mix of conditions puts the US Federal Reserve in a tough position. Cutting rates to help the economy endure a weakening job market could also result in hotter inflation.

Outside of earnings, Tesla fell 5.1 per cent after Norway's sovereign wealth fund, one of the electric car maker's biggest investors, said Tuesday that it will vote against a proposed compensation package that could pay CEO Elon Musk as much as $1 trillion over a decade.

Yum Brands jumped 7.3 per cent after the company said it is considering selling its Pizza Hut unit, which has struggled to compete in a crowded pizza market.

Novo Nordisk slipped 1.8 per cent after it raised its offer to buy drugmaker Metsera, which jumped 20.5 per cent. Novo Nordisk is trying to outbid rival Pfizer, which fell 1.5 per cent.

In other dealings early Wednesday, US benchmark crude oil lost 31 cents to $60.25 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 28 cents to $64.16 per barrel.

The dollar fell to 153.33 Japanese yen from 153.63 yen. The euro rose to $1.1493 from USD 1.1488.

[TITLE]Wall Street gains ground amid steady flow of earnings reports, upbeat economic updates:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK — Stocks gained ground on Wall Street Wednesday following several upbeat economic updates and a steady flow of quarterly reports from U.S. companies.

The gains were broad and marked a reversal from the prior day's dip. Much of the market's push and pull came from the technology sector, where several companies with huge values have an outsized influence over the market.

Google’s parent, Alphabet, jumped 2.4%, Broadcom rose 2%, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 1.4%. They helped lead the way higher for the broader market. Their gains also helped counter losses from a few technology behemoths, including Nvidia and Microsoft.

Overall The S&P 500 rose 24.74 points, or 0.4% to 6,796.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 225.76 points, or 0.5%, to 47,311. The Nasdaq composite rose 151.16 points, or 0.6%, to 23,499.80.

Company earnings and forecasts were once again a big focus for Wall Street, with results coming from a broad spectrum of industries.

McDonald's rose 2.2% after reporting that its sales benefited from the return of its popular Snack Wraps in the third quarter. International Flavors & Fragrances jumped 4.1% after beating Wall Street's latest quarterly profit forecasts.

On the losing side, Taser maker Axon Enterprise slumped 9.4% after forecasting weaker profits than analysts were expecting. Live Nation Entertainment fell 10.6% after its latest results fell short of analysts' forecasts.

The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy.

There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review.

A monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth.

The services sector, which is the largest part of the U.S. economy, expanded in October more than Wall Street expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The report shows that while overall business activity grew, employment was still contracting.

“The survey provides a reassuring sign that economic growth persisted in October despite the government shutdown,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, wrote in a note to investors.

A weaker job market remains a big concern for the Fed. The central bank cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year at its most recent meeting, in part to help bolster the economy amid a weakening job market. Lower interest rates can make a wide range of loans and credit less expensive, potentially promoting economic growth. But, lower rates can also add fuel to inflation, which could stunt economic growth.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell and several other Fed officials have expressed concerns about more rate cuts, as inflation remains stubbornly above the central bank's target of 2%. Consumer prices rose 3% in September.

The mix of a weaker job market and hot inflation leaves the Fed in a tough position.

“For Fed watchers, this ADP report should make it clear that a December rate cut is now in play,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in a note to investors. “We are nearing stall speed in the labor market, and that will get the Fed’s attention.”

Wall Street has tempered its expectations for another interest rate cut in December. Investors are now forecasting a 63% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates, according to CME FedWatch. That's down from a 90% chance just prior to the previous rate cut.

The threat of tariffs also continues to hang over consumers and businesses. President Donald Trump's trade war with China, Canada and many other nations has been unpredictable. The full impact of higher prices is difficult to forecast because of constant shifts in policy. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday about the legality of the sweeping tariffs.

Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.16% from 4.09% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 3.63% from 3.58% late Tuesday.

European markets gained ground and Asian markets closed mostly lower.

Sime Darby Property chief marketing and sales officer Datuk Lai Shu Wei said the awards accelerate practical ESG adoption across industries in the region through the showcase of proven frameworks.

“It reinforces that nature and development can be integrated meaningfully when supported by clear frameworks, encouraging others to translate similar ambitions into practice.

“This shifts sustainability from an intention to proven evidence, positioning long-term value creation as the future norm rather than an exception,” he said.

Also present at the event were the Philippine Ambassador to Malaysia Maria Angela A. Ponce, Indonesia Deputy Chief of Mission to Malaysia Danang Waskito, DBKL valuation and property management department deputy director Siti Maizun Arshad, SMG chairman Tan Sri Wong Foon Meng, SMG chief operating officer Lydia Wang and SMG chief content officer Datin Paduka Esther Ng.

The Asia ESG PIA was the culmination of the consortium’s year-long efforts, including the Asia ESG Summit 2025, which began on Nov 5 and ends today. It is a platform for companies to engage with thought leaders and decision-makers in shaping the region’s sustainable future.

Besides Indonesia and the Philippines, the A-EPIC’s inaugural summit also saw participation of delegates from Cambodia, India, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Germany, Singapore, Brunei and South Africa.

Both the awards and the ­summit are organised by SMG with Sime Darby Property as the Urban Biodiversity Partner.

[TITLE]Unlocking new pathways:
[TEXT]
Time for Asia to balance economic growth with green ambition

PETALING JAYA: Asia must strike a balance between economic development and green ambition, moving towards growth that is inclusive and enduring, whereby sustainability isn’t just a destination but a sign of progress.

Science, Technology and Inno­vation Minister (Mosti) Chang Lih Kang said the global sustainabi­lity agenda is accelerating, as environmental standards are becoming more stringent.

“Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting is becoming mandatory, and investors are demanding greater transparency and accountability.

“While these trends raise the bar for all organisations, they also present Asia with a significant opportunity,” he said.

“By embedding sustainability at the very heart of business strategy, we can unlock new pathways into the green economy. To navigate the path to net-zero while sustaining economic vibrancy, we must be strategic, inclusive and grounded in local realities.”

Chang said this in his keynote address at the Asia ESG Summit 2025 titled “Navigating the Path to Net-Zero: Overcoming Resource Limitations and Rising Environ­mental Standards in Asia to Balance Global Sustainability Targets with Local Economic Realities.”

To achieve this, Chang said that global targets must be contextua­lised locally, followed by empowering science, technology and innovation (STI) to unlock opportunities in renewable energy, green materials and digital innovation.

Additionally, he said public-­private partnerships must be strengthened through policies and direction set by the governments, and the agility and creati­vity of the private sector.

He added that the ministry continues to collaborate with investors, research institutions and enterprises across Asean to implement solutions.

Chang said the transition must be just and inclusive to ensure sustainability uplifts both rural entrepreneurs and skilled professionals.

“No Malaysian should be left behind as we build a knowledge-­based green economy. Malaysia also remains fully aligned with Asean’s shared agenda to advance sustainability and innovation across the region.

“Through platforms such as the Asia ESG Summit, we exchange experiences, accelerate regional initiatives and strengthen cooperation in clean energy, climate resilience and circular economy systems,” he said.

Meanwhile, Star Media Group (SMG) group chief executive officer Chan Seng Fatt said hosting the first Asia ESG Summit reflects the trust placed in the company to spearhead this regional initiative and set the tone for meaningful dialogue and collaboration on sustainability.

“For us, it’s not just
