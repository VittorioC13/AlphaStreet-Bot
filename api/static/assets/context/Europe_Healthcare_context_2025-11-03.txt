Key Terms of the Royalty Financing Agreement

At the closing of the agreement, Nanobiotix will receive an upfront payment of $50 million and expects to receive an additional $21 million one year post closing subject to reaching certain conditions

Assuming $71 million is funded, success-based 1 remuneration to HCRx includes: Repayment from a defined portion of royalties on the first $1 billion of net sales and a portion of certain regulatory and commercial milestone payments, subject to a cap of approximately $124 million (1.75x Multiple on Invested Capital (“MOIC”)) if repayment is completed by end of 2030, increasing to approximately $178 million (2.50x MOIC) if repayment occurs thereafter (the Return Cap figures assume $71 million is funded) Following achievement of the Return Cap, a royalty-only tail period will commence, which entitles HCRx to a predefined, reduced share of royalties not to exceed $14.9 million per year; the tail period will expire 10 years following the first commercial sale of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in the US

remuneration to HCRx includes: Payment and repayment obligations under both this royalty financing agreement with HCRx and the existing royalty agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) will be furnished through the transfer of receivables from the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) license agreement to a French law trust

“We are excited to partner with Nanobiotix at this pivotal stage of its growth” said Clarke Futch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at HCRx. “The differentiated nature of their physics-based approach and the compelling clinical profile of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) align with our mission of supporting innovative therapies that address areas of significant unmet need. This investment underscores our confidence in this first-of-its-kind approach to cancer treatment, which has the potential to redefine standards of care and establish an entirely new class of therapy.”

TD Cowen acted as sole financial advisor to Nanobiotix.

Assuming the drawdown of the second tranche one year post closing, this financing extends Nanobiotix cash runway into early 2028 subject to closing of the agreement. This extension of cash runway does not include potential milestone payments from the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) licensing agreement. The Company continues to expect to receive the first potential milestone payments related to clinical development in head and neck cancer (NANORAY-312) and lung cancer (CONVERGE) within this timeframe, and has thereby established the financial foundation for self-sustaining long-term growth.

What is CAR T-Cell Therapy?

The CAR T-cell therapy market refers to the production, distribution, and use of CAR T-cell therapy, which is a cancer treatment that takes cells from the body and genetically changes them so they can fight cancer. It is most commonly used to treat cancers that affect blood cells, like specific types of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. CAR T-cell therapy is available for some children and adults with leukemia. The CARs help the cells to latch on to specific proteins, known as antigens, that are present on cancer cells.

CAR T-cells can cure specific types of blood cancer. The benefit of CAR T-cell therapy is the short treatment time required for completion. It scores over the other traditional cancer treatments in long-term remission with a better quality of life for the patient. CAR T-cell therapy modifies a patient's T-cells to target and destroy cancer cells.

Major Government Initiatives in CAR T-Cell Therapies:

France 2030 – Universal CAR-T Grant to Allogenica : Under the French government’s Innovations in Biotherapies and Bioproduction component of the France 2030 program, Allogenica was awarded a €2.5 million grant to industrialize a universal (allogeneic) CAR-T platform. This aims to boost scalability, reduce costs, and strengthen France’s domestic biomanufacturing ecosystem for CAR-T therapies.

Case Study: Gilead Sciences & Arcellx – Redefining CAR T-Cell Therapy Through Next-Generation BCMA Innovation

CAR T-cell therapy, once an experimental treatment for rare blood cancers, has rapidly evolved into one of the most promising frontiers in oncology. Among the therapeutic targets, B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) has emerged as a crucial focus for addressing relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). This market segment is witnessing exceptional growth, projected to register a CAGR of over 46% from 2025 to 2034, driven by novel therapies demonstrating improved efficacy, scalability, and patient outcomes.

In this context, Gilead Sciences (via its Kite Pharma subsidiary) and Arcellx Inc. have formed one of the most strategically impactful alliances in the CAR-T ecosystem. Their lead investigational product, anito-cel (formerly known as CART-ddBCMA), represents a new generation of CAR T-cell therapy targeting BCMA with enhanced safety and durability of response.

Challenge:

Despite remarkable success in hematologic malignancies, CAR T-cell therapies have faced three key limitations:

Safety risks such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity.

such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Manufacturing delays associated with autologous CAR T production, leading to treatment bottlenecks.

associated with autologous CAR T production, leading to treatment bottlenecks. Short duration of remission, especially in patients with advanced or refractory myeloma.

Patients who relapse after prior CAR-T treatments often have limited options, creating a clinical and commercial need for safer, longer-lasting, and more scalable CAR T-cell products.

Solution:

Arcellx’s proprietary ARC-SparX platform introduced a modular CAR design that allows precise activation of engineered T cells only in the presence of a matching antigen-binding “SparX” protein. This innovation provides:

Improved safety control (reduces off-tumor toxicity and cytokine storms).

(reduces off-tumor toxicity and cytokine storms). Flexible reactivation (enables re-dosing for sustained therapeutic effects).
