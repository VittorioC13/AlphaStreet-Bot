[TITLE]Ruminant Biotech raises $17m at $132m valuation for its cow pill that will slash methane emissions:
[TEXT]
Where the money’s going

Chief executive Tom Breen says the funds will be used to get his company’s product to market in New Zealand (where he says final Ministry for Primary Industries regulatory approval is close) and Australia (where he says no approval is required).

He’s hoping it will go on sale next year and be treating “thousands of animals” by year’s end.

Ruminant has commissioned a manufacturing facility capable of producing one million doses per year to back the Australia-New Zealand launch, Breen said.

Brazil, Canada and other markets will follow, he said.

Ruminant’s product is aimed at pasture-grazing or “ruminant” cows, putting the US – where grain feedlots dominate – off the table for now.

Some of the funds will also be used to develop future products and an emissions trading market to incentivise farmers to adopt its product - with some help from new investor Marex.

Methane reduction targets lowered

Breen’s goal is to have 100 million cows popping his company’s pills by 2035 as farmers move to meet methane emissions targets.

In New Zealand, those targets are now less stringent. Earlier this year, the Climate Change Commission pushed for a strengthened methane target.

In the event, on October 12 the Government instead said it would legislate to lower the methane target, from 24%-47% emissions reduction (from 2017 levels) by 2050 to a 14%-24% emissions reduction.

Federated Farmers is pushing for a further reduction.

Ministers Todd McClay (trade), Simon Watts (climate change) and Andrew Hoggard (associate agriculture) said the decision was science-based and was part of a revised pathway that “protects jobs and production and upholds our climate commitments”.

Ruminant Biotech chief executive Tom Breen (left) with Climate Change Minister Simon Watts at Cop30 in Brazil last week.

Breen said farmers still needed to reduce methane – and that the Government’s long-term goal of net-zero emissions remained.

Earlier this month, the CEO attended the UN’s Cop30 conference in Brazil. The event took place against the backdrop of something of a backlash against the UN push to lower emissions.

Leaders from the world’s three largest polluters – the US, China and India – did not attend. Key resolutions were voluntary.

But Breen said there are notable examples of private players picking up the slack.

Cop30 saw Brazilian company Marfrig, the world’s second-largest beef producer, pledge to reduce its emissions by 33% by 2035.

It was on a tangent to the UN’s official goal – a 30% reduction from 2020 levels by 2030. But it was a concrete, public pledge.

Not all corporates are on the same page. Breen concedes that in the same week New Zealand lowered its targets, Nestlé - one of the largest customers for the NZ dairy industry - withdrew from the Dairy Methane Action Alliance.

But he said: “While some government and industry targets may have changed, climate change has not.”

Farmers need practical tools and investable markets, Breen said.

What does it cost?

Breen would not give an estimate of how much it would cost, per cow, to administer Ruminant’s treatment – which sees a slow-release daily dose of an active ingredient (Tribromomethane) interrupt microbes called methanogens, reducing methane while not impacting the efficiency or health of the animal.

“Farmers’ number one job is to look after their family. That means they invest in things that make them more productive and profitable. We believe farmers need to be putting 10 to 20 bucks in their back pocket every time they treat a cow with a product like ours,” Breen said.

New investor will help with carbon credit business model

Through what mechanism will that $10 to $20 materialise? Breen says in Australia, Ruminant has applied for accreditation with Verra’s VM0041 voluntary carbon credit scheme. He anticipates a similar arrangement in New Zealand.

One of the key investors in Ruminant’s $17m Series A round, Nasdaq-listed Marex, also brings key skills to the party.

The British-based commodities dealer and carbon-trading platform operator recently set up shop in New Zealand, opening an office in Auckland.

As part of its investment, Marex will act as exclusive broker and market maker for Ruminant Biotech’s carbon credits generated by the project.

“This investment positions us to commercialise our world-leading technology with a scaleable business model that rewards on-farm emissions reductions through carbon markets,” Breen said.

“We’re excited to unlock new ways to reward farmers for reducing emissions, while helping industry and Governments meet their climate goals. We’re confident that if we can get this right, adoption will follow.”

Govt grants on both sides of the Tasman

At the October 12 announcement, McClay, Watts and Hoggard said in a statement: “The Government is already investing more than $400m with industry to speed up the development and rollout of methane-cutting tools. The first is expected on farm in 2026, with up to 11 available by 2030.”

Ruminant has received $11m in public research grants from New Zealand Government agencies, plus A$3.5m ($4m) from the Australian Government’s Methane Emissions Reduction in Livestock R&D assistance programme (the University of Sydney is a Ruminant research partner).

The start-up also received a $2.5m equity investment from New Zealand Green Investment Finance (NZGIF) – the Crown “green investment bank” that imploded after its SolarZero bet went south and is currently been wound down. With its NZGIF money banked in May 2023, Breen’s firm is not affected by the NZGIF meltdown.

“They were an important early stage investor and remain on the register today,” Breen said.

The Companies Office lists NZGIF’s stake at 5.8%.

The Series A backers

The US$9.5m ($17m) Series A raise announced this morning was co-led by existing investors Rosrain Investments (backed by Stewart Brothers Bloodstock in Queensland) and Christchurch-based Cultivate Ventures (owned by investment banker Greg Anderson), “with significant investment from global financial services platform Marex, alongside follow-on funding from AgriZeroNZ”.

AgriZeroNZ is a public-private partnership half-owned by the Government, via the Ministry for Primary Industries, and half by agribusinesses and banks including Fonterra, Silver Fern Farms, Ravensdown, Synlait, A2, Rabobank, BNZ and ASB.

Ruminant (founded in 2021) earlier raised $4.5m in a 2022 seed funding round (backed by Sir Stephen Tindall’s K1W1 and others) and $12m in a 2023 pre-Series A.

Total funding from all sources has been $33m. All going well, 2026 will be the year that backers start to see some returns.

What is Chronic Heart Failure?

Chronic heart failure is a significant public health concern in developed countries, with its incidence reaching nearly 10 cases per 1,000 people over the age of 65. The prevalence of CHF is strongly age-related, affecting less than 1% of individuals between 45 and 55 years, 2–5% in those aged 65–75 years, and approximately 10% in people aged 80 years or older. Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome marked by the heart’s inability to pump sufficient blood to meet the body’s needs at normal filling pressures. This ventricular dysfunction reduces exercise capacity and often diminishes quality of life. From a clinical perspective, forward failure of the heart manifests as low blood pressure and fatigue, whereas backward failure results in shortness of breath and fluid accumulation, leading to pulmonary congestion, pleural effusions, peripheral edema, and dysfunction of organs such as the liver, stomach, and kidneys. Common complications include arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, and ultimately death.

Why Do Farmers Use Fungicide?

Farmers apply fungicides to protect crops from diseases that reduce plant health, yield and quality potential. Proactively applying fungicides can keep plants strong and healthy through harvest, making the harvest process more efficient by reducing lodged crops.

Benefits of a fungicide application include:

Increased photosynthesis: With more healthy leaf area, plants can more effectively use nutrients to achieve maximum yield.

With more healthy leaf area, plants can more effectively use nutrients to achieve maximum yield. Greater stress tolerance: Vigorous plants are better at withstanding stressors like drought or extreme temperature variation.

Vigorous plants are better at withstanding stressors like drought or extreme temperature variation. Increased water use efficiency: Healthy stalks and leaves are more efficient at using water, leading to an extended grain fill period, thus more opportunity to develop yield.

Healthy stalks and leaves are more efficient at using water, leading to an extended grain fill period, thus more opportunity to develop yield. Increased standability: With fewer stalk diseases, you’ll have fewer stalk issues and less lodging, leading to increased yield (because you're reducing ear loss at harvest).

Are Fungicide Applications Profitable?

Fungicide profitability will vary year-to-year depending on the disease pressure, cost of inputs and crop value. Generally, even in years when disease pressure is low, fungicides can provide plant health benefits that keep leaves greener longer to maximize grain and fruit production.

Fungicides can provide a positive return on investment when:

You choose the right product. By selecting a fungicide that provides control of the most common diseases in your geography, you can increase the likelihood of effectiveness. That increases the ROI potential of your fungicide application.

By selecting a fungicide that provides control of the most common diseases in your geography, you can increase the likelihood of effectiveness. That increases the ROI potential of your fungicide application. You make a timely application. When a fungal disease is present at application, a fungicide can halt the growth of the current pathogens and protect against another disease incidence. If no disease is evident at the time of application, a fungicide can also help to protect from any potential fungal infections.

Smart Sprays: How AI is Revolutionizing the Fungicides Industry

Artificial intelligence is transforming the fungicides industry by enabling precision agriculture, where AI-powered sensors and drones detect fungal infections early and guide targeted fungicide applications. Predictive analytics allow farmers to forecast disease outbreaks and optimize treatment schedules, reducing chemical usage and costs. AI-driven formulation research is accelerating the development of more effective and environmentally friendly fungicides. Overall, these innovations are improving crop yields, sustainability, and operational efficiency across the sector.

[TITLE]Data Centers, AI, and Energy: Everything You Need to Know:
[TEXT]
The primary bottleneck for AI expansion has shifted from power generation to physical infrastructure, with long lead times for grid upgrades, a global transformer shortage, and geopolitical vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chain (copper, lithium, rare earth elements) creating acute risks.

Despite major tech companies' net-zero pledges, the sheer velocity of the AI buildout forces a reliance on reliable baseload power from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas through 2030, with nuclear power viewed as the long-term, carbon-free solution.

The exponential energy demand of AI-driven data centers, particularly from high-performance accelerated servers (GPUs and ASICs), is rapidly outpacing global energy efficiency trends, leading to a projected doubling of data center electricity consumption by 2030.

For the past decade, the defining narrative of the global energy sector has been the transition of supply. Governments, utilities, and investors have focused almost exclusively on shifting generation assets from fossil fuels to renewables, retiring coal plants in favor of wind farms and solar arrays....

The narrative for the next decade, however, is currently being rewritten by a structural shift in demand that few predicted would happen this quickly: the exponential rise of the data center.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) transitions from theoretical models in research labs to wide-scale commercial deployment, data centers have evolved. They are no longer passive warehouses for email storage and website hosting; they are now active, energy-intensive industrial engines. These facilities have become the "refineries" of the digital age, processing raw data into economic value, and in doing so, they are exerting unprecedented pressure on electricity grids, water resources, and critical mineral supply chains.

The implications for the energy market are profound. We are witnessing a collision between the digital economy's exponential growth curve and the physical economy's linear constraints. This guide provides a comprehensive analysis of how data centers utilize resources, the specific energy mixes powering them across different geopolitical regions, and the systemic risks posed by the integration of hyperscale compute infrastructure with legacy power grids.

Part I: The Anatomy of Consumption

To understand the macro-level impact of the sector on global energy markets, it is necessary to first understand the micro-level physics of the data center itself. These facilities are complex aggregations of IT equipment, environmental controls, and power management systems, each with distinct energy profiles that contribute to the total load.

From CPU to GPU and Custom Silicon

The fundamental driver of increasing energy density is the changing nature of the silicon chip. For decades, the industry relied on Central Processing Units (CPUs) for general-purpose computing. While powerful, CPUs operate within a relatively predictable energy envelope. The rise of Generative AI has necessitated a wholesale shift toward "accelerated servers."

The GPU Explosion

The initial phase of the AI infrastructure buildout has been defined by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). To understand the energy implications, one must understand the architecture. A traditional CPU is designed to do a few complex tasks very quickly in sequence. A GPU, conversely, is designed to do thousands of simple mathematical tasks simultaneously. Since AI training is effectively one giant matrix multiplication problem, the GPU is exponentially more efficient at the task than a CPU.

However, this computational density comes at a severe thermodynamic cost. As the industry packs more transistors onto silicon wafers to process larger models, the power draw per chip has skyrocketed. We have moved from an era of "general purpose" computing to "high-performance" computing, where energy consumption is the primary constraint on performance.

The market for these high-performance chips is currently dominated by a few key players driving the energy intensity of the sector:

Nvidia H100 "Hopper": Currently the industry standard for AI training. A single H100 chip can consume up to 700 watts at peak utilization. When installed in a server rack of 8 to 16 GPUs, the power density exceeds anything legacy data centers were built to handle.

Nvidia B200 "Blackwell": The next-generation architecture. It promises massive performance gains but raises the thermal stakes significantly, with a single chip capable of drawing up to 1,200 watts.

AMD Instinct MI300X: The primary competitor to Nvidia, offering high-density memory configurations that also require significant power and cooling infrastructure.

The deployment of these chips is fundamentally altering the physical requirements of the data center building. A legacy server rack typically draws 5 to 10 kilowatts (kW) of power. A modern rack packed with Blackwell or H100 GPUs can draw between 50 and 100 kW.

This tenfold increase in power density forces a transition from air cooling (fans blowing over metal heatsinks) to liquid cooling. Air is simply not a dense enough medium to carry away the waste heat generated by a 100kW rack. Consequently, the next generation of data centers is being plumbed like industrial chemical plants, with coolant loops running directly to the silicon die to prevent thermal throttling.

The Hyperscaler Rebellion

As energy constraints tighten and power costs rise, the major technology giants—the "Hyperscalers"—are seeking to reduce their dependence on general-purpose GPUs. While GPUs are excellent for AI, they still include legacy graphics logic that AI models do not need. This "silicon bloat" equates to wasted watts.

To solve this, companies are evolving toward Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These are custom chips designed from the ground up to do exactly one thing: run neural networks. By stripping away general-purpose features, these chips achieve significantly higher performance per watt, allowing data center operators to get more compute out of the same grid connection.

The major players have all launched proprietary silicon strategies:

Google (TPU): Google’s Tensor Processing Units are the veterans of this space. The latest 6th-generation "Trillium" TPU is explicitly engineered for energy efficiency, offering a 67% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the previous generation.

AWS (Trainium & Inferentia): Amazon Web Services has bifurcated its silicon. Trainium is built for the heavy lift of training models, while Inferentia is designed for the low-cost, low-energy task of "inference" (running the model for end-users).

Microsoft (Maia): Microsoft has introduced the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator, custom-designed to run large language models on the Azure cloud. It features a unique "sidekick" liquid cooling setup that fits into existing data center footprints.

Meta (MTIA): The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator is designed specifically for Meta's recommendation algorithms, optimizing for the specific math heavily used in social media ranking rather than generative text.

This shift toward ASICs represents the industrialization of AI. Just as the automotive industry moved from general workshops to specialized assembly lines, the data center industry is moving from general-purpose servers to specialized AI pods.

These custom chips allow Hyperscalers to decouple their growth from the broader supply chain constraints of the merchant GPU market. More importantly, they allow for a holistic system design. Because Google designs the TPU, the server rack, the cooling loop, and the data center shell, they can optimize the cooling flow to match the exact thermal profile of the chip, squeezing out efficiency gains that are impossible with off-the-shelf hardware.

Beyond the Silicon Limit

Looking further ahead, the industry recognizes that even custom silicon has a physical limit. As transistors shrink to the size of atoms, electrical resistance creates heat that cannot be easily mitigated. To break this energy curve, R&D labs are exploring exotic architectures that abandon traditional electronics entirely.

Two specific technologies are currently moving from theory to prototype:

Silicon Photonics: Current chips use copper wires to move data. Copper has resistance, which generates heat. Companies like Lightmatter and Ayar Labs are replacing copper with light (photons). Light generates virtually no heat compared to electricity and travels faster, potentially solving the data movement energy bottleneck that currently plagues large clusters.

Neuromorphic Computing: Traditional computers separate memory and processing, wasting energy moving data back and forth (the Von Neumann bottleneck). Neuromorphic chips are designed to mimic the human brain’s architecture, using "spiking neural networks" where processing and memory happen in the same location. These promise orders-of-magnitude reductions in power for specific sensory processing tasks.

This architectural pivot from CPU to accelerated silicon—and eventually to photonics—is not merely a technical detail; it is creating a two-speed energy market. The "old" internet of email and web hosting will continue to run on efficient, low-growth CPU servers. The "new" economy of AI will run on power-hungry accelerated infrastructure.

According to 2024 data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), this split is already visible in the data. Conventional servers are projected to see electricity consumption grow at a modest rate of 9 percent annually. In stark contrast, electricity consumption for accelerated servers (GPUs, TPUs, and ASICs) is projected to grow by 30 percent annually. By 2030, these accelerated servers will account for almost half of the net increase in global data center electricity consumption.

The Breakdown of Power Usage

A data center’s electricity consumption is distributed across five primary categories. Understanding this breakdown is critical for investors and analysts trying to identify where efficiency gains—and energy wastes—are located.

Source: IEA

Servers: Servers account for approximately 60 percent of total demand in a modern facility. This is the electricity actually doing the "work" of computation. As chip density increases, this percentage is rising relative to auxiliary systems, meaning the grid is becoming more directly coupled to the computational workload. When an AI model is training, the load is constant and high; when it is idle, it drops. This variability introduces new challenges for grid operators accustomed to steady industrial loads.

Cooling and Environmental Control: Cooling represents the single largest variable in data center efficiency, accounting for anywhere between 7 percent and 30 percent of total electricity intake. This massive variance highlights a divided market.

"Hyperscale" data centers—those massive campuses owned by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft—utilize advanced techniques to keep cooling demands near that 7 percent floor. They employ hot-aisle containment, free-air cooling, and increasingly, direct-to-chip liquid cooling. The shift to TPUs and high-end GPUs has made water cooling a necessity rather than a luxury, as air alone can no longer dissipate the heat generated by modern silicon.

In contrast, smaller enterprise data centers and legacy facilities are far less efficient. Many of these older facilities burn up to 30 percent of their total electricity intake just fighting the laws of thermodynamics, using energy-intensive air conditioners to keep servers from overheating. This sector is also the primary driver of water usage in data centers.

Storage, Network, and Infrastructure: The remainder of the power wedge is split between storage systems (5 percent), network equipment like switches and routers (5 percent), and general infrastructure like lighting and physical security. While individually small, the sheer volume of data being retained for AI training datasets means that storage energy demands are growing in absolute terms.

This internal distribution of energy—heavily weighted toward the silicon itself—explains why the industry is so focused on chip efficiency. Every watt saved at the server level cascades through the system, reducing the need for cooling, power distribution, and backup infrastructure. However, as the breakdown illustrates, the "low hanging fruit" of cooling efficiency has largely been harvested by the hyperscalers. The next frontier of efficiency gains must come from the compute load itself.

Ultimately, understanding the micro-level physics of the server rack is only the first step. While an individual GPU or TPU is a marvel of engineering, the aggregation of millions of these chips into global fleets creates a macro-economic force. The efficiency gains at the chip level are currently being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of deployment, leading us from the physics of the rack to the physics of the grid.

To grasp the full impact on global energy markets, we must move beyond the walls of the facility and look at the aggregate demand these components are placing on national power systems. The internal struggle between heat and compute is now spilling over into a global struggle for capacity.

Part II: The Scale of Demand

Data centers currently occupy a relatively small niche in global energy usage compared to heavy industry or transportation, but their growth velocity is outpacing almost every other sector in the global economy.

Current Baseline and Future Trajectories

In 2024, global data centers consumed an estimated 415 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. To put that in perspective, 415 TWh is roughly equivalent to the total annual electricity consumption of France. This represents approximately 1.5% of global electricity consumption. While this figure may appear marginal to the casual observer, the rate of change indicates a looming crunch.

Over the last five years, consumption has grown at 12 percent annually. Looking forward to 2030, the IEA projects this demand to accelerate, outlining three distinct scenarios that market watchers should monitor.

The Base Case: In the most likely scenario, global electricity consumption for data centers is projected to double, reaching roughly 945 TWh by 2030. In this future, the sector would consume just under 3 percent of the world’s total electricity. This doubling in just six years would require the addition of power generation capacity roughly equivalent to the entire current grid of Germany.

The "Lift-Off" Case: This scenario assumes that current supply chain constraints are resolved rapidly and that AI adoption accelerates unchecked by regulation or economics. Under these conditions, demand could surge to 1,700 TWh by 2035—consuming nearly 4.5 percent of the world's electricity. This would place data centers on par with the energy footprint of the entire country of India.

The Headwinds Case: Conversely, if technical bottlenecks, geopolitical fracturing, or slow AI adoption prevail, demand may plateau around 700 TWh. Even in this conservative view, the sector remains a massive industrial consumer, but one that stays below 2 percent of global demand.

Source: IEA

The Carbon Footprint

Beyond raw electricity usage, the carbon implications are significant. Today, data centers account for roughly 180 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 emissions annually, which is roughly 0.5% of global energy-related emissions. While this is currently lower than aviation or shipping, the trajectory is steeper.

If the "Lift-Off" scenario comes to pass, these emissions could rise to 1.4% of the global total. While hyperscalers are offsetting this with renewable purchases, the "location-based" emissions (the actual carbon emitted by the local grid powering the facility) often remain higher than the "market-based" emissions (the net figure after offsets). This discrepancy is key for ESG investors: a data center in a coal-heavy region like Inner Mongolia or West Virginia has a physical carbon footprint that no amount of paper credits can fully erase.

The End of the Efficiency Era

Regardless of which scenario plays out, the trajectory is undeniable: the digital economy is decoupling from the energy efficiency trends of the past decade. For years, global data center energy use remained relatively flat even as internet traffic exploded, thanks to massive improvements in server efficiency and cloud consolidation. That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends. Unlike electric vehicles, which distribute load across millions of endpoints and can charge during off-peak hours, data centers are concentrated, baseload consumers. A single hyperscale campus can consume as much power as a mid-sized city, demanding that power 24/7 with zero tolerance for intermittency. This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Contextualizing the Surge

Regardless of which scenario plays out—Base, Lift-Off, or Headwinds—the trajectory is undeniable: the digital economy is decoupling from the energy efficiency trends of the past decade. For years, global data center energy use remained relatively flat even as internet traffic exploded, thanks to massive improvements in server efficiency and cloud consolidation. That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition, creating a wedge of new demand that the grid was not built to accommodate.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends. Unlike electric vehicles, which distribute load across millions of endpoints and can charge during off-peak hours, data centers are concentrated, baseload consumers. A single hyperscale campus can consume as much power as a mid-sized city, demanding that power 24/7 with zero tolerance for intermittency. This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Part III: The Energy Mix and Carbon Reality

There is a significant divergence between the stated decarbonization goals of major technology companies and the physical reality of the grids powering their facilities. Most hyperscalers have aggressive "Net Zero" targets, often aiming to run on 100% carbon-free energy by 2030. However, the physical electrons flowing into their servers largely come from fossil fuels and will likely continue to do so through the medium term due to the mechanics of baseload power.

Source: IEA

1. Coal

Despite global efforts to phase out coal, it remains the silent workhorse of the digital economy. Coal is currently the largest single source of electricity for data centers globally, accounting for approximately 30 percent of the sector's power.

This reliance is heavily skewed by geography, specifically China. As the world's second-largest market for data infrastructure, China derives nearly 70 percent of its data center power from coal. However, even in Western markets, the baseload requirements of data centers often necessitate reliance on grid mixes that still contain coal generation, particularly during periods of low renewable output. The IEA projects that while coal's share will eventually decline, it will remain a critical pillar of supply until at least 2035, challenging the "green" narrative of the AI revolution.

2. Natural Gas

Natural gas currently meets 26 percent of global data center demand, but its role is arguably more critical than the raw percentage suggests. Gas is expected to be a primary beneficiary of the AI boom in the short term, particularly in North America.

Data centers operate on a standard of "five nines" (99.999%) of reliability. A power outage is not an inconvenience; it is a catastrophic financial event. Intermittent renewables like wind and solar cannot yet provide this level of uptime without massive battery storage, which is not yet deployed at sufficient scale. Consequently, natural gas serves as the dispatchable generation source of choice.

In the United States, natural gas is already the largest fuel source for data centers, accounting for over 40 percent of demand. Between 2024 and 2030, natural gas and coal combined are expected to meet over 40 percent of the additional electricity demand generated by data centers. For natural gas investors, the data center boom represents a new, durable source of industrial demand that is largely price-insensitive.

[TITLE]Historic Iron Dome Funding Boost Creates New Opportunities for Rimon Technologies, Reinforcing Strategic Value of Nukkleus’ Pending Acquisition:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nukkleus Inc . (NASDAQ: NUKK), a strategic acquirer and developer of high-potential businesses in the aerospace and defense (A&D) industry, today announced today that Rimon , the Israeli supplier of critical power and subsystem components for the Iron Dome missile defense system, is expected to benefit substantially from the historic multi-billion-dollar Iron Dome expansion recently approved by Israel’s Ministry of Defense.

On November 20, 2025, Israel’s Ministry of Defense announced the signing of a landmark procurement agreement with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. (“Rafael’) to accelerate serial production of Iron Dome interceptors and supporting systems. The contract is funded primarily through the $8.7 billion U.S. defense assistance package, which includes $5.2 billion earmarked specifically for Israel’s air-defense systems, making it one of the largest Iron Dome production investments in the system’s history.

Through Nukkleus’ controlling stake in Star 26 Capital Inc., Nukkleus is in the process of acquiring Rimon, which has established strong partnerships with Rafael, Elbit Systems, and other leading defense integrators. As the new production surge ramps up, Nukkleus anticipates a significant increase in demand for Rimon’s manufacturing capabilities.

In anticipation of the expanding production requirements, Rimon is preparing to scale its operations beginning in 2026. Nukkleus expects that Israel’s sustained investment in its multi-layered air-defense architecture, driven by heightened regional threat levels and the need to replenish interceptor stockpiles, positions RIMON for strong long-term growth.

Given rising tensions across the region and the increasing likelihood of a future confrontation with Iran involving potential large-scale missile salvos targeting Israel, national defense planners have emphasized the urgency of expanding air-defense capacity. Rimon’s planned growth and Nukkleus’ strategic support are aligned with this national requirement.

The initiative also coincides with expanded U.S.-Israel industrial cooperation, including production in Israel and at the new R2S (Raytheon-Rafael) facility in Camden, Arkansas, which recently received a $1.25 billion contract for Tamir interceptor manufacturing.

“This historic Iron Dome expansion contract validates our strategic decision to pursue the acquisition of Rimon, and position Nukkleus at the heart of Israel’s defense industrial base,” said Menny Shalom, CEO of Nukkleus Inc. “Rimon is already preparing to expand operations as early as 2026, and we expect the new production plan will have a significant impact on both Nukkleus and Rimon. The next major confrontation with Iran is a matter of time, and defense experts are already anticipating scenarios involving hundreds of missiles launched toward Israel. The country must rapidly expand its air-defense capacity, and Nukkleus is playing a key role in those preparations. We are committed to supporting Israel’s security with scalable, mission-critical technologies.”

Regional performance — North America leads; Asia-Pacific is the growth engine: North America retains leadership driven by large legacy fleets and strong MRO ecosystems, while Asia-Pacific exhibits the fastest fleet growth and retrofit demand, creating regional strategies for product-market fit.

How will the global shortage of new aircraft deliveries and the aging commercial fleet impact AHMS uptake and monetization strategies over the next 3–7 years?

The backlog in deliveries and elevated average aircraft age materially increases the addressable retrofit market for AHMS. Airlines facing constrained capacity will delay full fleet renewal and instead invest in condition-based maintenance to extract availability from existing assets. This dynamic accelerates near-term demand for retrofit kits, modular sensor packs, and non-intrusive data buses that minimize aircraft downtime during installation. From a monetization perspective, vendors should pivot to hybrid commercial models: lower upfront hardware fees coupled with multi-year analytics subscriptions and outcome-based pricing (e.g., per-hour reliability uplift or AOG-day reductions). Bundling spare-parts forecasting and consumables procurement into analytics contracts increases customer stickiness and creates cross-sell opportunities with MRO partners. Vendors that can demonstrate measurable MTBUR/MTBF improvements and reduced ARO (AOG recovery time) through pilots will win enterprise deals and justify higher ARR multiples.

Which technical or regulatory constraints are most likely to limit AHMS scaling, and what mitigation strategies should product and regulatory affairs teams pursue?

Principal restraints are (a) certification complexity for software affecting safety-critical functions, (b) heterogeneous fleet architectures and legacy data buses, and (c) airline concerns over data governance and IP. Mitigation requires a three-pronged approach: first, invest in certifiable architectures and safety cases early — produce evidence packages aligned with airworthiness authorities to shorten STC/PMA timelines; second, design adapter-first retrofit strategies (non-intrusive sensors, universal gateways, or aircraft-specific harnesses) and provide integration engineering services to reduce install risk; third, adopt privacy-preserving analytics (federated learning, anonymization), transparent data contracts, and strong role-based access control to address operator and regulator trust. Regulatory affairs teams should proactively engage national aviation authorities to co-design compliance pathways and publish operational evidence that regulators can reuse across type certificates, accelerating adoption. These measures materially lower the adoption friction and convert pilots into fleet-level rollouts.

Aircraft Health Monitoring Systems Market Geographic dominance

Market scale and regional posture: industry estimates for the AHMS market show a continuum rather than a single consensual figure — market size estimates for 2024 vary in the range of approximately USD 5–7 billion with forecasted compounded growth in the mid-single digits to low-double digits depending on modeling assumptions (fleet retirement, retrofit penetration, and service pricing).

Regional dynamics and authoritative aviation indicators:

North America — incumbent dominance: North America continues to command a leading share in AHMS revenue due to a dense MRO ecosystem, large installed base of legacy aircraft, and concentration of avionics and software OEMs; several market reports indicate North American shares near the high-30s to low-40s percent band in recent years. This creates high-value early adopter customers and reference accounts for suppliers targeting global expansion.
