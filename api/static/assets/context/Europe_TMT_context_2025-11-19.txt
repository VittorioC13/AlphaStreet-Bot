Since 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications. But the rules weren't always so strict. In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity. "Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'" he remembers. "I was astonished!" In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership. US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned. Wright USA wasn't an isolated case. The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.

York Space Systems prepares for public offering as satellite deployments and contract wins drive growth

by Clarence Oxford

Los Angeles CA (SPX) Nov 18, 2025

York Space Systems has taken a significant step toward becoming a publicly traded company, formally filing a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This move follows years of expansion driven by successful satellite launches, delivery of key government projects, and marked financial gains.

Headquartered in Denver, York Space Systems has established itself as a manufacturer specializing in modular, flight-ready spacecraft platforms used in defense, commercial, and scientific constellations. In 2025, the company completed assembly, launch, and commissioning of 21 satellites for the Space Development Agency's first-generation Transport Layer. This backbone constellation delivers high-speed, secure communications and Link 16 connectivity for military operations, providing the infrastructure for resilient data exchange in contested environments. Another group of 21 satellites is expected to join the constellation before year's end, further strengthening the network's capabilities.

Each satellite was brought online and validated within hours of deployment, with operational health and key subsystems confirmed by ground teams. In addition to these constellation deployments, York supplied experimental platforms for the Defense Department, supporting technology demonstration and rapid mission cycles. Notably, the company launched and commissioned the BARD satellite for NASA, which demonstrated new wideband and laser communications between spacecraft and validated orbit maneuvering capabilities. These achievements highlight York's capacity to build and deliver flight-proven platforms that address complex mission requirements - from defense and government to commercial data delivery.

As demand for resilient, flexible space infrastructure surges, York has expanded its production and engineering footprint. Its spacecraft have executed advanced maneuvers in orbit, including collision avoidance, autonomous orbit adjustment, de-orbit, and payload deployment processes. The company's ground operations provide continuous monitoring and support, helping users maximize spacecraft lifespans and mission results. York's backlog reached $642 million as of September 2025, reflecting its position as a primary supplier for the U.S. government and security agencies.

Financial performance has tracked with its operational growth. Revenue for the first nine months of 2025 climbed to $280.9 million, showing a 59 percent year-over-year increase. Net losses were reduced to $56 million, down from $73.9 million during the same period last year. According to company filings, much of this improvement comes from contract deliveries to the Space Development Agency, ongoing manufacturing of platforms for government and commercial users, and cost management as production scales.

The public offering will be managed by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and Wells Fargo Securities, with shares to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol YSS. Specific terms and the number of shares available have not yet been finalized, with the offering subject to regulatory approval and market conditions.

Private equity investors backing York see the IPO as a logical outcome of the company's trajectory, with valuation estimates exceeding $2 billion. The listing is expected to release new capital for engineering innovation, production expansion, and further contract pursuit. While the company cautions that completion and terms of the offering remain uncertain, strong demand from U.S. defense and government markets positions York as a major player in the next generation of orbital missions Related Links

[TITLE]Tesla Wants to Build a Robot Army:
[TEXT]
Elon Musk, already the world’s richest man, is now on the path to becoming its first trillionaire. Tesla’s shareholders recently approved a massive pay package for the CEO, including some $1 trillion in stock options. But the payout will happen only if certain targets are met—including Musk’s successful deployment of 1 million Optimus robots.

Named after a Transformers character, because of course it is, Optimus is a humanoid machine that’s supposed to be able to complete boring and dangerous work in place of humans. The robot was unveiled in 2021, when Tesla held an “AI Day” event detailing its future plans. Musk declared then that Tesla needs to be “much more than an electric-car company,” and to that end, it would combine its advancements in chips, autonomous driving, and batteries into this robot.

Optimus would be able to do factory work, sure, but that’s just the starting point. Over time, Musk has said, Optimus could unleash unprecedented economic and societal change as a source of tireless, unpaid labor that can be trained to do anything. “Working will be optional, like growing your own vegetables, instead of buying them from the store,” Musk posted on X last month. Maybe Optimus will provide better medical care than a human surgeon can, he’s suggested, or eliminate the need for prisons by following criminal offenders around to prevent them “from doing crime” again. He has even said that the robots could power an eventual Mars colony.

This is the kind of hyperbole the world has come to expect from the guy who’s said for a decade that millions of fully driverless Tesla EVs are coming “next year.” Optimus was actually just a person in a bodysuit when it was first unveiled. And although Tesla has developed it into an actual robot since then, it has still relied on human assistance to fulfill basic tasks, such as serving drinks. We’re a long way off from the dream.

Yet there is something real buried underneath Musk’s bluster. It’s not just Tesla: Many automakers are trying to pivot to robotics. Rivian, the electric-vehicle start-up, just announced a spin-off company called Mind Robotics. Hyundai is so bullish that it bought the robotics giant Boston Dynamics a few years ago, and it already has robot dogs spot-checking cars at a U.S. plant. Xpeng, a fast-growing EV company in China, recently debuted humanoid robots.

There is, in fact, a lot of overlap between modern cars and robots. Robots need batteries similar to the ones inside EVs—you wouldn’t want Optimus stinking up a room with a gas engine. The auto industry has already invested billions of dollars in advanced sensors, chips, and AI for driverless technology. Just add arms and legs, and you basically have a robot. “The auto industry is adjacent to so many of the areas of expertise that are required for robotics,” Sterling Anderson, General Motors’ chief product officer, told me. “Robotics and autonomous vehicles, they both operate in the same worlds.” Automakers also have access to factory data that can be used to train robots, much as all of the writing on the internet has fed large language models. “Nobody else has access to that,” Jiten Behl, a former Rivian executive turned venture capitalist who helped bring about the carmaker’s robotics spin-off, told me.

Today’s car factories are already full of industrial robots; the auto industry buys more of them than any other sector. Articulated robotic arms assemble, weld, and paint various parts, and automated platforms transport them to different workstations. Some carmakers have even dabbled before; Honda began developing bipedal robots in the 1980s and unveiled a childlike walking-and-hopping prototype, Asimo, in 2000. That program was retired a few years ago, but amid the wider AI boom, humanoid robots may now unlock even more automation. “All those tasks today that those robots cannot automate, you have thousands of factory workers doing,” Behl said.

Read: The AI boom has an expiration date

Profit margins are thin on every car sold, and cutting down on labor costs—or eliminating them outright—would be a big help to carmakers’ bottom lines, especially when it comes to competition from China: U.S. and European manufacturers already pay thousands more in labor costs per vehicle than their Chinese competitors do. Companies such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz say they are developing robots with humanlike reasoning that are entirely focused on making cars more efficiently—that innovate the act of manufacturing while also working around the clock, with no paycheck.

Of course, much of the auto industry has consistently struggled to make battery-powered cars. Replacing humans with battery-powered robot workers may be even further outside its area of expertise. One big issue is something Musk calls “the hands problem”: It’s shockingly hard to get a machine to replicate the dexterity of human digits. (There’s a reason the robot that Chipotle unveiled in 2023 could make only a burrito bowl or a salad, not a burrito.)

Read: The American car industry can’t go on like this

Still, for Anderson, Behl, Tesla, and the others, the convergence between robotics and cars is already well under way. A car is “not often described as a robot, but that’s what it is,” Anderson said at a recent event in New York City where GM previewed an electric Cadillac that lets you stream Love Island while it drives you down the highway. Take that to its logical conclusion as cars become more and more automated, and you simply have a robot that rides on tires instead of walking on legs. The ultimate goal for that isn’t far off from what Optimus is supposedly trying to do: guard your life, and save you time. Maybe then you can finally give that vegetable garden the attention it deserves.

[TITLE]LifeMD Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
Total revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $60.2 million, and adjusted EBITDA rose 20% to $5.1 million.

Telehealth revenue grew 18% to $47.3 million, while telehealth adjusted EBITDA increased 30% to $2.9 million.

Paid off all outstanding debt during the quarter.

Subsequent to quarter end, fully divested our majority stake in WorkSimpli, positioning LifeMD as a pure-play telehealth and pharmacy platform.

Continued to diversify clinical platform with new launches in women’s health, men’s health and psychiatry.

Conference call begins at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time today

NEW YORK, Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LifeMD, Inc. (Nasdaq: LFMD), a leading provider of virtual primary care services, today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.

Management Commentary

“The third quarter of 2025 marked an important step forward for LifeMD,” said Justin Schreiber, Chairman and CEO of LifeMD. “While the weight management market remained challenging, driven largely by fierce competition from low-price compounded GLP-1 providers, our business continued to demonstrate real strength. We continued to on-board a significant volume of new weight management patients per day supported by the power of our brand, our best-in-class care platform and our strategic partnerships. We expect the GLP-1 market to evolve rapidly in the year to come as product innovation and improved pricing expand access, and we believe LifeMD is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends and accelerate growth in 2026.”

At the same time, we are gaining significant traction in diversifying our platform. We are seeing strong early traction in behavioral health, women’s health, men’s hormone therapy, and personalized compounded ED therapies. Our RexMD business returned to growth and added nearly 10,000 net new subscribers in the quarter. We also achieved a major milestone with the regulatory approval of our Pennsylvania-based 503-A compounding pharmacy. We are currently licensed in 14 states and are aggressively pursuing licensure in all 50 states. This pharmacy meaningfully strengthens our competitive positioning by expanding our ability to deliver personalized therapies, improving cost structure, and enhancing the patient experience.

Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the divestiture of our majority ownership in WorkSimpli, which transformed LifeMD into a pure-play virtual care and pharmacy platform and significantly strengthened our balance sheet. As we look to 2026, we believe LifeMD remains very well positioned with a strong balance sheet, an increasingly diversified virtual care and pharmacy platform and a full suite of industry-leading capabilities to accelerate our growth,” concluded Mr. Schreiber.

“Third quarter results for our telehealth business on a stand-alone basis were solid with revenue increasing 18% and adjusted EBITDA increasing 30% versus the prior year period. Importantly, our RexMD business returned to sequential growth in both revenue and patient subscriber count. Additionally, we took major steps to significantly strengthen the company’s balance sheet and liquidity including paying off all outstanding debt and the divestiture of our majority interest in WorkSimpli subsequent to quarter end. We have also continued to make significant strides in the company’s ongoing telehealth business profitability with year-to-date telehealth Adjusted EBITDA profitability up 294% versus year,” said Marc Benathen, LifeMD’s Chief Financial Officer.

[TITLE]Landmark Nature Health Study Demonstrates the Effectiveness of DeepHealth’s Novel AI-Powered Breast Cancer Detection Workflow:
[TEXT]
Largest real-world analysis of AI-driven breast cancer screening in U.S. history1 demonstrates increased cancer detection rate with consistent benefits across patient populations

LOS ANGELES and SOMERVILLE, Mass., Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RadNet, Inc. (NASDAQ: RDNT), the nation's largest provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services, and its wholly owned subsidiary, DeepHealth, a global leader in AI-powered health informatics, today announced results from the largest real-world analysis of AI-driven breast cancer screening ever conducted in the United States.1 Published in Nature Health, the findings support the clinical effectiveness and benefit of DeepHealth’s AI technology to deliver equitable results across several racial, ethnic and breast density patient groups.

The AI-Supported Safeguard Review Evaluation (ASSURE) study examined the AI-powered workflow that is at the heart of RadNet’s Enhanced Breast Cancer Detection™ (EBCD™) program. This study included mammograms from over 579,000 women across 109 community-based imaging sites in California, Delaware, Maryland and New York. The research compared state-of-the-art 3D mammography screening to a novel AI-driven protocol that combines DeepHealth’s FDA-cleared computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CADe/x) software with an AI-supported Safeguard Review workflow, which can trigger a second breast imaging expert review of high-suspicion cases—a workflow that RadNet now offers as EBCD™.

“Beyond the remarkable results, what sets this research apart is its scale, diversity and real-world applicability,” said Dr. Howard Berger, President and Chief Executive Officer of RadNet. “There has never been a similar study of this size in the United States, much less one with such a diverse patient population, that examines the patient impact and efficacy of AI-assisted breast cancer screening.”

The ASSURE study demonstrated that the AI-powered workflow led to a 21.6% increase in cancer detection rate compared to state-of-the-art 3D mammography screening, while maintaining recall rates within American College of Radiology guidelines2 and increasing positive predictive value by 15%. This workflow is enabled by the applications that make up DeepHealth’s Breast Suite offering. Together, they deliver these benefits across patient populations, including the more than 150,000 Black women enrolled. Black women face 40% higher breast cancer mortality in the United States.3 Furthermore, the ASSURE study showed that the workflow underlying RadNet’s EBCD™ program delivered a 22.7% boost in cancer detection rate compared to 3D mammography screening for women with dense breasts, who experience both increased cancer risk and diagnostic challenges.4

“Unlike many academically focused studies, these screenings took place at community imaging centers, where most women get their mammograms,” said Dr. Gregory Sorensen, co-author of the ASSURE study and Chief Science Officer at RadNet. “To avoid potential selection bias, the AI-enabled workflow was provided to all patients at no additional charge during the study period. These real-world findings demonstrate how AI can improve access to specialist-level care for women, no matter where they live. When breast cancer is found early, women have far more options for care.”

Launched nationwide at RadNet-affiliated centers in 2023, EBCD™ runs on the AI that powers the applications within DeepHealth’s Breast Suite, helping detect lesions that are suspicious of being cancer, including those that are considered more difficult to find.6 Learn more

[TITLE]US-China tech war: Nexperia saga exposes Europe's loosening grip on chip supply chain:
[TEXT]
"Chinese wafer fabs possess the technical capability to fulfil Nexperia's orders," said Arisa Liu, chief director and research fellow at Taiwan Industry Economics Services, a databank of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.

Experts, however, suggested that Chinese fabs might be ready to supply the wafers needed by Nexperia's local facility.

Nexperia's Chinese management refused to comply with directives from its head office and planned to switch to local wafer suppliers, a transition that could take at least six months. Meanwhile, the Dutch headquarters warned clients that products from the Chinese facility may be substandard.

Nexperia's Chinese facility had relied on wafers from its fabrication plants in the United Kingdom and Germany, but those shipments were abruptly halted as the Dutch-based company grappled with an internal conflict.

Wafers, which are cut into dies, are the core materials in assembling integrated circuits used in computing, communications and power switch applications.

For nearly a month, parts of Nexperia's Dongguan production lines have sat idle. Two factory workers said this week that some machinery had been turned off due to a wafer shortage since late last month, with one estimating that a third of the machines were idled - echoing earlier reports by the Post.

The Nexperia saga, which has created a global car chip shortage, reveals a new reality: Europe's once-vaunted neutrality and industrial sovereignty are eroding, while China's foundational role in manufacturing has become too large to fail and too complex to legally unwind.

[TITLE]Softer words, harder policy: EU recalibrates on China as it seeks rare earths breakthrough:
[TEXT]
Under pressure from Beijing's chokehold on rare earths and the simmering feud over chipmaker Nexperia, EU officials have been asked to tone down their public rhetoric on Beijing, even as the bloc moves forward aggressively with its de-risking plans.

Brussels is in "de-escalation mode", several official sources confirmed, as it looks to convince China to issue more licences for the export of the critical minerals vital to hi-tech manufacturing and ensure the supply of chips from beleaguered Nexperia's Chinese operation.

The European Union and China are close to agreeing on a general licensing procedure for rare earths, whereby a company could obtain a one-year licence to export the minerals, provided the end user and materials are the same and they do not have a military end-use, the Post has learned. Currently, only three-month licences are available.

[TITLE]Growth in China's tech stocks just getting started, JPMorgan banker says:
[TEXT]
The recovery of China's tech stocks from their trough is still at an early stage, as the country's emergence as an artificial intelligence superpower reshapes global platforms and lures Western capital back, according to a senior investment banker at JPMorgan.

As Chinese entrepreneurs expanded their businesses globally and deepened their involvement in AI, their companies and fundraising plans were once again drawing the attention of international investors after years of stagnation, said Mark Fiteny, the US bank's head of Asia-Pacific technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) and new economy.

"Investors hold a lean-forward sentiment because they are underexposed in their portfolios to these AI trends in China," Fiteny said in an interview ahead of the firm's annual TMT conference in Asia, which concludes in Hong Kong on Tuesday.

[TITLE]CNBC Daily Open: AI still under pressure — but some analysts see a year-end rally:
[TEXT]
People pose for pictures at the Wall Street Bull in New York's Financial District on June 24, 2024 in New York City.

The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.84% Monday stateside as technology stocks were under pressure, with Apple , Meta and Oracle retreating more than 1% each.

Artificial intelligence lynchpin Nvidia performed worse, losing almost 2%. CEO Jensen Huang in October said the chipmaker had "half a trillion dollars" of business on the books for 2025 and 2026. When Nvidia reports its third-quarter earnings Wednesday stateside, investors will be combing through Huang's comments for signs of strong 2026 growth, as suggested by that data point.

The problem with promises or expectations, especially for a company that is one of the two around which the artificial intelligence universe orbits (OpenAI being the other), is that any disappointment will be disproportionately painful.

"If they offer any even slightly muted guidance or forecast for demand for their chips, the market would take that poorly," Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield said.

Despite the recent sell-off in tech over concerns about high valuations and capital expenditure, some analysts think we could still end the year with a rally.

"We continue to see a balance of bullish and bearish signals heading into year-end, but our stance remains that a year-end rally is likely," Michael Graham, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, wrote in a Monday note.

Likewise, HSBC's chief multi-asset strategist Max Kettner on Monday said the bank thinks "the probability of a melt-up into year-end – particularly in equities – is much greater" than a potential AI bubble popping.

If their predictions prove true, investors will have much to celebrate during the festive season — and we can worry about AI in the new year.

[TITLE]Future data centers are driving up forecasts for energy demand. States want proof they’ll get built:
[TEXT]
By MARC LEVY

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they’ll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.

But the challenges — some say the impossibility — of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.

One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built — eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.

The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that’s ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.

Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas — such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.

“There’s speculation in there,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. “Nobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what’s speculative, what’s double-counting, what’s real, what’s not.”

[TITLE]Which are Europe’s most AI-ready countries?:
[TEXT]

Europe is investing €200 billion in Artificial Intelligence, with over 74% of businesses already initiating related projects, signalling a continent-wide digital transformation. But where exactly are these AI hot-spots? The likely places are apparent from a new study by the firm Eskimoz. This is based on an analysis of four key technological factors.

The research looked at how much money each country is investing in AI and how prepared they are to implement these new technologies, including digital infrastructure, economic and legal legislation, and tech innovations.

The study also examined AI use trends, both by businesses and by the population, considering the share of companies using at least one AI tool in daily operations and the online visits to AI tools per person. These factors were combined into an AI readiness score, ranking countries by their progress towards its implementation.

The outcome is that Sweden is the most AI-ready country in Europe, earning a perfect score of 100. The country invests over €3.2B in AI technologies and has a readiness index of 75% (0.75), which reflects its digital infrastructure, workforce skills, innovation capacity, and government policies. Swedish businesses are the second most reliant on AI, with 25% reporting that at least one AI tool is a part of their daily operations.

Germany comes in second, with a score of 82. Its readiness index matches Sweden’s index at 0.75, but Germany invests more in AI, nearly €4B, the highest in the ranking, and €500M more than any other country. Around 20% of German companies report using at least one AI tool in their daily operations.

The Netherlands ranks third, with a score of 79. It scores 0.77 on the readiness index, the second highest on the list. AI tools are widely used by both individuals and businesses, with 23% of companies using AI tools, and each person uses AI 50 times a year on average, the highest in the ranking. The country also invests approximately €1B in AI.

France takes fourth place, standing out for the second-highest investment in artificial intelligence technologies. The country has poured €3.4B worth of investments into AI tech, achieving a readiness index of 0.70. This level of preparedness, combined with investment, gives France a composite score of 69.

Denmark rounds out the top five most AI-ready countries in Europe, with a final score of 64. Danish businesses are the most dependent on AI, with over 27% reporting using AI regularly. The country also has the highest AI readiness, scoring 0.78 on the index, three percent higher than Sweden, which ranks first overall.

Finland secures sixth place with a score of 61, supported by one of the highest AI readiness indexes in this group of 0.76, reflecting its strong digital infrastructure and economic integration of AI. Around 24% of Finnish businesses use AI, and the country invests over €1.3B in AI technologies, keeping it among Europe’s leaders.

Belgium takes seventh place among Europe’s most AI-ready countries, earning a final score of 57, and stands out with 24.7% of companies relying on AI. Its AI readiness index of 0.67 demonstrates Belgium’s AI policies and innovation, while investment reaches nearly €396M.

Norway comes in eighth, with a score of 56. Its AI readiness index of 0.71 and an investment of just over €199M place it firmly ahead in Europe. Backed also by a 20.8% business adoption of AI, ten percent higher than in France.

Austria lands in ninth place, scoring 55. A readiness index of 0.72, slightly higher than Norway’s, combined with 20.3% of businesses using AI, highlights strong artificial intelligence adoption. An AI investment of €239M also outperforms Norway by over €40M.

Ireland rounds out the top ten, finishing off with a final score of 49. Its AI readiness index of 0.69 and 14.9% business usage show that Irish companies are well-positioned in AI, supported by €223M in investment.

The UK, surprisingly, does not feature on the rankings at all. Most other surveys place the UK at the top or close to the top for European AI advanced nations. This may signal a concern with the survey’s accuracy.
