Advanced Liver Cancer Overview

Advanced liver cancer represents a progressed stage of hepatic malignancy in which the cancer has extended beyond the liver to nearby lymph nodes (stage 4A) or distant organs like the lungs or bones (stage 4B), making surgical removal no longer a viable option. Patients commonly experience symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, fatigue, unintended weight loss, and other systemic manifestations.

Management at this stage focuses on slowing the progression of the tumor, reducing symptoms, and maintaining quality of life through the use of immunotherapy, targeted treatments, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. Supportive care is fundamental for controlling complications like ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and pain, which have a substantial impact on patient comfort. Despite ongoing advancements in systemic therapy, the prognosis remains poor, with median survival in metastatic disease often limited to just a few months.

Diagnosis of advanced liver cancer involves a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach that combines imaging, laboratory tests, and, in select cases, biopsy to confirm the disease, determine stage, and assess spread. High-resolution imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are critical for identifying primary tumors and evaluating their spread to lymph nodes or distant organs. PET or bone scans may be used to detect metastases outside the liver. While ultrasound remains helpful for early-stage detection, it has limited sensitivity in advanced stages.

Blood tests, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and the AFP-L3 isoform, support diagnosis, especially when aligned with imaging findings. Liver function tests help assess hepatic reserve and the tumor’s impact on organ function. Biopsies are generally reserved for cases where imaging is inconclusive or when histological confirmation is needed for atypical lesions or distant metastases. Staging of advanced disease often includes chest imaging, bone scans, and occasionally brain imaging to guide therapeutic decisions. Although imaging plays a central role, diagnostic accuracy is enhanced when combined with serological markers and the clinical picture, allowing for individualized treatment planning.

Treatment strategies for advanced liver cancer focus on slowing disease progression, relieving symptoms, and prolonging life. Immunotherapy has become a primary option, with regimens such as atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab offering meaningful survival advantages by stimulating the immune system to target cancer cells.

Targeted therapies, which interfere with key molecular pathways in tumor growth, are used either when immunotherapy is unsuitable or after disease progression. Radiation therapy, particularly stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), helps control localized tumor burden and manage symptoms such as pain from bone metastases. In patients whose disease is still confined to the liver and who retain good liver function, procedures like TACE can still provide clinical benefit. Chemotherapy is used less frequently but may be employed in resistant or refractory cases. Throughout the course of the illness, supportive care remains crucial, addressing pain management, nutritional support, fluid control, and psychosocial needs.

[TITLE]Interview with Milano Finanza:
[TEXT]
Interview with Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, conducted by Francesco Ninfole on 24 September 2025

The ECB launched an innovation platform with 70 partners to collaborate on the digital euro. What results has it produced and what will the next steps be?

Our innovation platform brought together universities, fintechs, start-ups, banks and retailers. The results have been very encouraging. Collaboration has shown that the digital euro can improve people’s daily lives and offer them new services. For example, we could make on-delivery payments online, or issue digital receipts that can make consumers’ lives easier when returning a product or activating the guarantee on a purchase. We will present the fruits of this research at Bocconi University tomorrow. We're just getting started. There are still myriad ideas to explore, and numerous companies, banks and research institutes have asked us to explore the innovation potential of the digital euro. We want to continue this dialogue with the market to promote the development of novel solutions. To that end, over the coming months we will organise a second round of collaboration with the private sector.

Many people are still unclear

Advanced Liver Cancer Overview

Advanced liver cancer represents a progressed stage of hepatic malignancy in which the cancer has extended beyond the liver to nearby lymph nodes (stage 4A) or distant organs like the lungs or bones (stage 4B), making surgical removal no longer a viable option. Patients commonly experience symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, fatigue, unintended weight loss, and other systemic manifestations.

Management at this stage focuses on slowing the progression of the tumor, reducing symptoms, and maintaining quality of life through the use of immunotherapy, targeted treatments, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. Supportive care is fundamental for controlling complications like ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and pain, which have a substantial impact on patient comfort. Despite ongoing advancements in systemic therapy, the prognosis remains poor, with median survival in metastatic disease often limited to just a few months.

Diagnosis of advanced liver cancer involves a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach that combines imaging, laboratory tests, and, in select cases, biopsy to confirm the disease, determine stage, and assess spread. High-resolution imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are critical for identifying primary tumors and evaluating their spread to lymph nodes or distant organs. PET or bone scans may be used to detect metastases outside the liver. While ultrasound remains helpful for early-stage detection, it has limited sensitivity in advanced stages.

Blood tests, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and the AFP-L3 isoform, support diagnosis, especially when aligned with imaging findings. Liver function tests help assess hepatic reserve and the tumor’s impact on organ function. Biopsies are generally reserved for cases where imaging is inconclusive or when histological confirmation is needed for atypical lesions or distant metastases. Staging of advanced disease often includes chest imaging, bone scans, and occasionally brain imaging to guide therapeutic decisions. Although imaging plays a central role, diagnostic accuracy is enhanced when combined with serological markers and the clinical picture, allowing for individualized treatment planning.

Treatment strategies for advanced liver cancer focus on slowing disease progression, relieving symptoms, and prolonging life. Immunotherapy has become a primary option, with regimens such as atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab offering meaningful survival advantages by stimulating the immune system to target cancer cells.

Targeted therapies, which interfere with key molecular pathways in tumor growth, are used either when immunotherapy is unsuitable or after disease progression. Radiation therapy, particularly stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), helps control localized tumor burden and manage symptoms such as pain from bone metastases. In patients whose disease is still confined to the liver and who retain good liver function, procedures like TACE can still provide clinical benefit. Chemotherapy is used less frequently but may be employed in resistant or refractory cases. Throughout the course of the illness, supportive care remains crucial, addressing pain management, nutritional support, fluid control, and psychosocial needs.
