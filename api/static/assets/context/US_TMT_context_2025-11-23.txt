[TITLE]GoTu Technology Secures $45 Million Growth Investment to Modernize Dental Staffing:
[TEXT]
MIAMI, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GoTu Technology, the nation's leading dental talent marketplace, today announced a $45 million growth investment led by Long Ridge Equity Partners ("Long Ridge"), with participation from institutional investors advised by J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The capital will support GoTu's nationwide expansion, accelerate development of its marketplace platform, and fuel the launch of new, innovative services that meet the evolving needs of dental practices across the country.

The dental industry faces an acute shortage of hygienists and assistants, making flexible staffing solutions critical to maintaining access to care. Since launching in 2019, GoTu has become the largest technology-enabled platform in the dental staffing market. Its on-demand marketplace connects hygienists, assistants, and associate dentists with dental practices to fill temporary shifts in real time – improving flexibility, reliability, and efficiency for both professionals and practices.

“In the fragmented landscape of dental workforce solutions, GoTu stands out for its nationwide reach, its enterprise-grade platform, and its high satisfaction among both dental offices and professionals,” said Kevin Bhatt, Long Ridge Managing Partner. “We are excited to support the GoTu team as they scale their market-leading platform through geographic expansion, product innovation, and strategic partnerships.”

Since its founding, GoTu has filled more than 500,000 dental shifts across 44 states and Washington D.C. The platform gives dental practices seamless access to verified professionals through a technology-driven experience, while giving clinicians the flexibility and control to work on their own terms.

“With dental offices nationwide struggling to recruit and retain qualified staff, this investment allows us to scale our impact,” said Edward Thomas, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of GoTu. “We’re proud of how far we’ve come, but this is only the beginning. Partnering with Long Ridge enables us to expand access to our platform, invest further in product innovation, and continue building the go-to resource for the dental industry.”

GoTu's growth has earned national recognition, from consecutive Inc. 5000 honors (2024 and 2025) to inclusion in Deloitte's Technology Fast 500 and Becker's Dental Fastest-Growing Companies.

Cary Gahm, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of GoTu, added, “This new milestone validates the vision we’ve pursued since day one: creating flexible, empowering opportunities for dental professionals while providing practices with the talent they need to thrive. Long Ridge shares our belief that the future of staffing lies at the intersection of technology and human connection – and together we're creating the workforce infrastructure that will redefine how dentistry works.”

[TITLE]Malaysia's Palm Oil Estates Are Turning Into Data Centers:
[TEXT]
An anonymous reader quotes a report from Bloomberg:The $8.9 billion palm oil producer, SD Guthrie, is the world's largest palm oil planter by acreage, with more than 340,000 hectares in Malaysia. "SD Guthrie is pivoting to solar farms and industrial parks, betting that tech giants hungry for server space will prefer sites with ready access to renewable energy," reports Bloomberg. "The company has reserved 10,000 hectares for such projects over the next decade, starting with clearing old rubber estates and low-yielding palm plots in areas near data center and semiconductor investment hubs.""The company's calculation is based on this: one megawatt of solar requires about 1.5 hectares. Helmy said SD Guthrie wants one gigawatt in operation within three years, enough to power up to 10 hyperscale data centers used for AI computing. The new business is expected to make up about a third of its profits by the end of the decade."

[TITLE]FCC rolls back cybersecurity rules for telcos, despite state-hacking risks:
[TEXT]
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has rolled back a previous ruling that required U.S. telecom carriers to implement stricter cybersecurity measures following the massive hack from the Chinese threat group known as Salt Typhoon.

The ruling came in January 2025 and took effect immediately under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), in response to Salt Typhoon's breaching multiple carriers to spy on private communications.

Along with Section 105 of the CALEA, the declaratory ruling included a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for telecom companies to:

Create and implement cybersecurity risk-management plans

Submit annual FCC certifications proving they were doing so

Treat general network cybersecurity as a legal obligation

Following lobbying from telecommunication firms - according to a letter from Senator Maria Cantwell, that found the new framework too cumbersome and taxing for their operations, the FCC has now deemed the prior rule inflexible, retracting it.

“The Federal Communications Commission today took action to correct course and rescind an unlawful and ineffective prior Declaratory Ruling misconstruing the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA),” reads the FCC announcement.

“The Order also withdraws an NPRM that accompanied that Declaratory Ruling, which was based in part on the Declaratory Ruling’s flawed legal analysis and proposed ineffective cybersecurity requirements.”

The FCC, which is now under new leadership, noted that communications service providers have taken important steps to strengthen their cybersecurity posture following the Salt Typhoon incidents, and have agreed to continue along this path in a coordinated manner, reducing risks to national security.

Disclosed in October 2024, the Salt Typhoon attacks were linked to a Chinese espionage campaign that impacted several companies, including Verizon, AT&T, Lumen Technologies [1], T-Mobile [2], Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications [3], and Windstream [4].

The hackers accessed core systems that U.S. federal government used for court-authorized network wiretapping requests, and potentially intercepted extremely sensitive information, up to the level of government officials.

FCC's plan met with criticism

Given that the risk for similar hacker operations remains unchanged, the FCC’s latest decision was met with criticism.

Commissioner Anna M. Gomez, the only one voting against the current decision, expressed frustration about the reliance on telecom providers for self-evaluating their cybersecurity stance and the effectiveness of the protective measures.

“Its [FCCs] proposed rollback is not a cybersecurity strategy,” stated Gomez. “It is a hope and a dream that will leave Americans less protected than they were the day the Salt Typhoon breach was discovered.”

“Salt Typhoon was not a one-off event but part of a broader campaign by state-sponsored actors to infiltrate telecommunications networks over long periods of time,” Gomez warned in her statement.

“Federal officials have stated publicly that similar reconnaissance and exploitation attempts are ongoing today, and that telecommunications networks remain high-value targets for foreign adversaries,” the official said.

Senators Maria Cantwell and Gary Peters have also sent letters to the FCC before the vote to urge the agency to maintain the cybersecurity safeguards.

BleepingComputer has emailed the FCC for a statement and will update the article when we get a reply.
