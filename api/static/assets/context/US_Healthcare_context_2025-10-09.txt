[TITLE]U.S. FDA approves SIMPONI® (golimumab) for the treatment of pediatric ulcerative colitis:
[TEXT]
HORSHAM, Pa. (October 7, 2025) – Johnson & Johnson today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved SIMPONI® (golimumab) for the treatment of children living with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), weighing at least 15 kg. This approval builds on the SIMPONI® indication for adults living with moderately to severely active UC, which together represents more than one million Americans living with this condition.1

“Ulcerative colitis is a complex, lifelong condition that is often challenging to manage effectively, particularly for pediatric patients, where relatively few approved options are available,” said Chris Gasink, M.D., Vice President, Medical Affairs, Gastroenterology & Autoantibody, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. “The approval of SIMPONI represents a meaningful milestone, offering a therapy with well-established efficacy and safety along with subcutaneous dosing, for younger patients where treatment options have historically been limited.”

The approval is supported by data from the PURSUIT program, which included two multi-center, open-label studies to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered SIMPONI® for the treatment of pediatric UC. In the Phase 3 PURSUIT 2 study, the primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 6 was achieved by 32% of patients. The secondary endpoints of clinical response at Week 6 was achieved by 58% and endoscopic improvement at Week 6 was achieved by 40% of patients receiving SIMPONI®.a,b,c Among patients treated with SIMPONI® who were in clinical remission at Week 6, 57% maintained clinical remission of symptoms at Week 54. Safety results for this population are consistent with clinical trials of SIMPONI® in adults with UC.

SIMPONI® is administered as a pre-filled syringe and can be self-administered for patients aged 12 years and older after proper training by a healthcare provider. The recommended dosage for pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg is 200 mg at Week 0, followed by 100 mg at Weeks 2, 6, and every 4 weeks thereafter; for pediatric patients weighing at least 15 kg to less than 40 kg, SIMPONI® is administered at 100 mg at Week 0, followed by 50 mg at Weeks 2, 6, and every 4 weeks thereafter.

This is the first pediatric approval for SIMPONI®, which is already approved for four indications, including adults living with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and moderately to severely active UC. This approval is another important milestone for patients and is emblematic of Johnson & Johnson’s continuous commitment to innovating to improve the lives of people living with chronic immune-mediated diseases.

[TITLE]Conservative-led US Supreme Court seems wary of ‘conversion therapy’ ban:
[TEXT]
The high court’s conservative justices express concern the ban might infringe upon therapists’ freedom of speech.

The United States Supreme Court appears poised to side with a challenge against a Colorado law that bans psychotherapists from conducting “conversion therapy” on minors in an attempt to influence their gender identification or sexuality.

On Tuesday, the high court, which has a six-to-three conservative majority, heard arguments in the case, which weighs whether the ban violates the protections for free speech under the First Amendment of the US Constitution.

The complaint was brought by licensed counsellor Kaley Chiles, a Christian who claims Colorado’s law infringes on her free speech rights.

But the state has defended its law. Colorado Solicitor General Shannon Stevenson argued that the ban regulates harmful conduct, not speech.

The 2019 Colorado law prohibits licensed mental healthcare providers from seeking to change a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity with a predetermined outcome in mind. That practice, known as conversion therapy, has been often associated with religious prohibitions against gay or transgender identities.

Detractors have warned that such “therapy” is pseudoscience and can be harmful, not to mention discriminatory, for LGBTQ youth.

Justices weigh arguments

Colorado maintains that Chiles’s allegations of free-speech violations are hypothetical because the state has not actually disciplined her.

But the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative organisation representing Chiles, has argued that the danger is that professionals might censor themselves for fear of punishment.

James Campbell, a lawyer for Chiles, told the justices that Colorado’s law “forbids counsellors like Kaley Chiles from helping minors pursue state-disfavoured goals on issues of gender and sexuality”.

Conservative Justice Samuel Alito seemed to embrace that claim that Colorado’s law marginalises certain points of view.

At one point in Tuesday’s hearing, Alito told Stevenson that her state’s measure allows therapists to help a patient feel comfortable

[TITLE]MapLight uses workaround to tee up IPO during government shutdown:
[TEXT]
MapLight Therapeutics on Monday advanced plans to go public with the help of a little-used regulatory workaround that would allow it to price a new stock offering during a federal government shutdown.

The biotechnology company, which is developing drugs for neurological diseases, said in a statement that it plans to sell 14,750,000 shares at $17 apiece in a coming IPO. A current investor has agreed to buy $40 million worth of shares, and MapLight also intends to raise another $8 million via a private deal with Goldman Sachs.

Notably, MapLight is setting terms at a time when the Securities and Exchange Commission is operating at a significantly reduced capacity. The agency isn’t currently declaring IPO registration statements effective, creating an unusual obstacle for companies seeking access to the public markets.

MapLight is relying on a provision in the Securities Act that automatically makes effective a registration statement 20 days after it files an amended statement. In a federal filing, the biotech warned it could receive a so-called stop order from the SEC, which would block the company from the public sale of shares.

If the government shutdown ends and the SEC resumes full operations before Oct. 26, when MapLight is scheduled to price, the company said it might change its decision to use this legal provision.

MapLight has a schizophrenia drug in a mid-stage testing that it’s positioning as a competitor to Bristol Myers Squibb’s Cobenfy. The drug goes after the same targets: a pair of “muscarinic receptors,” proteins which control the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

MapLight suspects its drug can be dosed more conveniently, at once or twice per day, compared to twice-daily Cobenfy, which also requires a multiday titration period. The biotech previously said its medicine could also mitigate some of the side effects associated with schizophrenia therapies, and not require patients to fast for a short period before dosing. Like Bristol Myers, MapLight is also evaluating its drug in Alzheimer’s psychosis.

The schizophrenia trial is expected to read out in 2026, while results from the Alzheimer's psychosis study are expected in 2027.

MapLight could pull in an estimated $251 million in its IPO. That would make it the third-largest public market debut of a biotech this year, and the second major offering in a row for a CNS drug developer. Last month, LB Pharmaceuticals priced a $285 million offering to fund its experimental schizophrenia drug.

[TITLE]Lilly and Leading Alzheimer's Disease Experts Call for Urgent Action to Close Diagnostic Gaps at Alzheimer Europe Conference:
[TEXT]
Real-world evidence from clinicians offers new insights into societal and systemic barriers to diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) across Europe [ 1]

Survey shows that while over 70% of specialists agree on the importance of biomarker testing for AD, fewer than one in five patients receive these tests [ 1]

Experts at Alzheimer Europe conference call for urgent health system investment to improve diagnostic access, including broader use of biomarker testing

BRUSSELS, Oct. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company, in partnership with leading Alzheimer's disease (AD) experts at this year's Alzheimer Europe Conference, have called for urgent improvements to diagnostic pathways to ensure people in Europe can benefit from new therapeutic innovation.

Based on the findings drawn from the Adelphi Real World Dementia Disease Specific Programme™ (Adelphi DSP) - a multinational and cross-sectional survey of clinicians treating patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States - experts warn that AD and dementia remain critically underdiagnosed, denying patients the opportunity to access treatment and care options.[1] A study published in The Lancet further highlights that while new therapies in AD are emerging with levels of clinical meaningfulness, efficacy, and safety comparable to treatments for cancer, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, further consideration must be given to care models and funding to improve equitable access for people with AD to innovative therapeutic options. This reflects a broader disparity in how innovation is made available across diseases within the context of modern personalized medicine.[2]

"We find ourselves at a critical moment, where the decisions made now will shape the future of AD care in Europe," reflected Professor Lutz Frölich, Head of the Department of Geriatric Psychiatry, Central Institute of Mental Health and Full Professor, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Germany. "Science has equipped us with the solutions to manage AD more effectively in its early stages, potentially reducing the disease burden. But this will only be possible if we can streamline diagnosis and make access to care timely and equitable for everyone affected by this progressive disease."

Alzheimer's disease currently affects approximately 6.9 million people in Europe, with this figure expected to almost double by 2050 as aging populations continue to increase.[3-4]

Key Barriers to Timely Diagnosis Identified from the Adelphi DSP Survey

Limited Access to Biomarker Testing

Biomarker tests, which detect abnormal changes in the brain, play a vital role in enabling rapid and accurate AD diagnosis in its earliest stages.[5] Despite over 70% of clinicians rating these biomarker tests important or extremely important, they remain underutilized in practice.[1] Across the countries studied, fewer than one in five patients (15.2%) received biomarker testing to confirm the specific pathology.[1] At a country level, Germany and the UK were the least likely to receive these tests.[1]

Delayed Specialist Referrals

When patients are referred from primary care physicians (PCPs) to specialists, the median reported time to diagnosis doubles to five months.[1] Notably, Spain and France reported the longest referral times, where patients waited a median of six to seven months to be diagnosed with AD.[1] The shorter reported time to diagnosis when patients were initially consulted and diagnosed by a PCP, demonstrates the importance of PCPs for both detection, assessment, and management of patients with MCI and AD dementia.

Stigma and Lack of Awareness Prevent Early Help-Seeking

61% of specialists surveyed cited that the biggest barrier to identifying patients in the early stages of AD is that they delay seeking help due to the stigma of their condition. Further to this, 43% of specialists said that patients delayed seeking help as they did not understand the differences between normal ageing and cognitive impairment caused by AD. The most common symptoms prompting a consultation for diagnosis are loss of short-term memory, difficulties in concentration/attention, and difficulty recalling names/words, and although these are mainly first recognized by a family member, stigma, and lack of awareness contribute to delays in patients seeking help. [1]

"These findings paint a deeply concerning picture of AD diagnosis across Europe and are sadly reflective of the experiences of many patients and families we support, who are often left too long without answers," said Jean Georges, Executive Director, Alzheimer Europe. "A carers' survey conducted in 2018 by our organization in the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK, found that the time to diagnosis from first symptoms took on average 2.1 years and 53% of carers felt that the diagnosis was made too late. If we want to ensure that people receive a timely diagnosis and support when it matters most, we need to implement the lessons from this research urgently and recognize AD as a policy priority, raise public awareness and combat stigma, increase medical training and the number of needed specialists, and improve access to innovative testing."

"Emerging therapies that target the pathology of Alzheimer's disease offer hope to slow progression and delay the need for care services. But this possibility hinges on early detection, as approximately one-third of individuals in early symptomatic stages of the disease will progress to more advanced clinical stages within one year,"5 adds Dr. Stéphane Epelbaum, Associate Vice President, International Medical Affairs at Eli Lilly. "Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential to ensure patients can access the next generation of Alzheimer's disease care."

At Lilly, we have been pioneering Alzheimer's disease research for over 35 years and continue to reimagine what's possible. We are committed to collaborating with partners to build the infrastructure needed to transform and strengthen pathways, empowering people to live better lives, on their own terms.
