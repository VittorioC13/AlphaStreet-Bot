[TITLE]Microsoft New Zealand sees strong revenue growth – turnover now double its 2021 level:
[TEXT]
Net profit rose 13% from $47.4m to $53.4m.

Income tax expense was $17.9m from the year-ago $15.4m.

The cost of sales was reported as $1.36b.

A $45.0m dividend was paid to its parent company.

The past year has seen Microsoft NZ back down on two controversies.

One was the end of security upgrades for Windows 10 unless a customer paid $50.40 per computer to join an “extended upgrade programme” – a development that drew criticism from Consumer NZ and others. In the end, Microsoft provided most customers with an avenue to keep getting Windows 10 updates for free until October 2026.

Another was Microsoft 365 price increases of up to 38% as the company’s Copilot artificial intelligence (AI) assistant was added to the software suite – with an option to remain on the old pricing, minus Copilot, hidden unless a customer went to cancel their subscription. After court action from Australia’s market regulator (which is ongoing) and a warning letter from New Zealand’s Commerce Commission, Microsoft offered refunds.

The local operation’s success reflects Microsoft’s global fortunes. On October 30, Microsoft Corp reported an 18% revenue jump to US$77.7b ($134b) for its September quarter as demand for AI services boosted its cloud computing business as net profit rose 12% to $27.7b.

While its partnership with OpenAI (in which Microsoft holds a 27% stake) helped fuel revenue growth, related losses of US$3.1b from the investment in the ChatGPT maker impacted net income for the quarter.

Threat of tax on revenue melts away

In May, Revenue Minister Simon Watts discharged the Digital Services Tax Bill (introduced to the house under the Labour Government), which would have levied a flat 3% tax on Big Tech firms’ New Zealand revenue.

“We have been monitoring international developments and have decided not to progress the Digital Services Tax Bill at this time,” Watts said.

“A global solution has always been our preferred option, and we have been encouraged by the recent commitment of countries to the OECD work in this area.”

Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump said he did not support the OECD’s push to implement a global minimum corporate tax.

Former Finance Minister Grant Robertson first floated the idea of a 3% or 6% DST in 2019 but then put it on the backburner for most of the next four years.

The Digital Services Tax Bill (for a 3% tax) was introduced in the final days of Parliament before the 2023 election. It didn’t have time to get to a select committee, let alone pass.

Ahead of the 2023 election, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade warned that a digital services tax would raise less than $100m, with that amount likely to be lost to retaliatory tariffs and measures against cloud software firms like Xero who sell into the US market.

[TITLE]U.S. Banks Just Got the Green Light to Pay Crypto Gas Fees—Here's What That Means for Institutional Adoption:
[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

The regulatory fog around banks and digital assets cleared slightly after the nation's top banking regulator confirmed that national banks may pay blockchain transaction fees and hold crypto assets for operational purposes—a technical clarification that could speed institutional adoption of on-chain finance.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in an interpretive letter last week that it is explicitly outlining which crypto-asset activities are permissible for the national banks it oversees. For investors watching institutional-adoption trends, the move adds another brick to the regulatory foundation major financial institutions need before venturing further into digital assets.

What Banks Can Actually Do Now

The OCC’s letter confirms two specific activities that national banks are authorized to undertake in the crypto space, both centered on the practical realities of operating on blockchain networks.

First, national banks can pay network fees—commonly known as gas fees—on blockchain networks to facilitate otherwise permissible banking activities, according to the interpretive letter. These are the transaction costs required to process operations on networks like Ethereum or other blockchain platforms.

Second, banks may hold crypto assets as principal on their balance sheets, but with narrow limitations. The holdings must be necessary to pay network fees for which the bank anticipates a reasonably foreseeable need, or necessary for testing crypto-asset-related platforms, whether developed internally or acquired from third parties.

This isn’t a blanket authorization for banks to become crypto trading shops. The permissions are tightly scoped around operational necessity rather than speculative investment.

The Safe and Sound Requirement

The OCC made clear these activities must meet traditional banking standards. National banks must conduct crypto operations in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable law, the letter specified.

Banks engaging in these activities will need robust risk management frameworks and compliance programs—the same regulatory expectations that apply to their traditional banking activities.

[TITLE]Global airlines race to fix jets as Airbus apologises following A320 recall:
[TEXT]
By Tim Kelly, Abhijith Ganapavaram and Tim Hepher

TOKYO/NEW DELHI/PARIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Global airlines scrambled to fix a software glitch on Airbus A320 jets on Saturday as a partial recall by the European planemaker halted hundreds of flights in Asia and Europe and threatened U.S. travel over the busiest weekend of the year.

Airlines worked through the night after global regulators told them to remedy the problem before resuming flights. Several carriers on Saturday said they had finished or nearly completed the fix to their fleets, including American Airlines, Air India, Delta Air Lines and Hungary’s Wizz Air. Many reported no impact on operations.

The overnight effort by airlines appeared to help head off the worst-case scenario and capped the number of flight delays in Asia and Europe. In the U.S., which will face high demand after the Thanksgiving holiday period, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that impacted U.S. carriers "have reported great progress, and are on track to meet the deadline of this Sunday at midnight to complete the work."

He said on X that travellers "SHOULD NOT expect any major disruptions."

Asia-based aviation analyst Brendan Sobie said the update was "not as chaotic as some people might think," although "it does create some short-term headaches for operations."

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised to airlines and passengers after the surprise recall of 6,000 planes or more than half of the global A320-family fleet, which recently overtook the Boeing 737 as the industry's most-delivered model.

"I want to sincerely apologise to our airline customers and passengers who are impacted now," Faury posted on LinkedIn.

Friday's alert followed an unintended loss of altitude on an October 30 JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, which injured 10 passengers, according to France's BEA accident agency, which is probing the incident.

AIRBUS RECALL LUCKY TIMING FOR SOME AIRLINES

The alert landed at a time of day when many European airlines and Asian airlines are winding down their schedules, which mostly do not require the short- to medium-haul jets like the A320 to be flying at night, leaving time for repairs.

In the United States, however, it came during the day ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel weekend.

Steven Greenway, CEO of Saudi carrier Flyadeal, said that the recall had hit late in the evening, which had avoided more serious disruption. The airline said it had fixed all 13 affected jets and would resume normal operations by midnight.

"It was a great team effort but our luck also held up in the timing," Greenway told Reuters.

Airlines must revert to a previous version of software in a computer that helps determine the nose angle of the affected jets and in some cases must also change the hardware itself, mainly on older planes in service.

By Saturday, Airbus was telling airlines that repairs to some of the A320 jets affected may be less burdensome than first thought, industry sources said, with fewer than the original estimate of 1,000 needing the time-consuming hardware changes.

Even so, industry executives said the abrupt action was a rare and potentially costly headache at a time when maintenance is under pressure worldwide from labour and parts shortages.

There were also unresolved questions

In today’s industry news roundup: After three years of R&D, the DT-led 6G-TakeOff project unveils its outcomes; the enterprise services arm of Proximus teams up with France’s Mistral AI for European sovereign digital service development; Bouygues Telecom deploys a sovereign agentic AI platform; Veon’s software unit teams up with a specialist partner to develop local language LLMs for its various operating markets; and more!

The Deutsche Telekom (DT)-led 6G-TakeOff project, which was first announced in October 2022, has presented the results of three years of R&D efforts that have been focused on “3D networks and their key components”. These three-dimensional networks comprise base stations located on the ground, on high-altitude platform systems (HAPS) and aboard satellites. “The project focused on the holistic view of a 3D network and the question of how the various network elements can be connected to each other in a unified 6G architecture. By combining and intelligently coordinating the various access technologies, optimal access to connectivity is thus enabled for every application. The results of the project are an important part of basic research for so-called non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and will be incorporated into the standardisation of the future generation of mobile communications,” noted DT in this

[TITLE]FDI insurge: Robust inflows into future-focused fields could help India stare down global economic uncertainty:
[TEXT]
Foreign direct investment (FDI) has a long history of transforming industries—from steel to semiconductors. This has been true in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and India.

But there’s an FDI shake-up underway, according to a new study from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).

As investment decisions increasingly follow geopolitical lines, India stands as the world’s top emerging-market destination for announced ‘greenfield’ FDI—that is, cross-border investment projects that create net new production capacity.

From 2022 through the first five months of 2025, India’s greenfield FDI inflow announcements have averaged $83 billion a year—24% higher than in the 2015 to 2019 period.

Of those billions pledged to India since 2022, nearly 80% were destined for advanced manufacturing, communications and software, and resource-related sectors—industries poised to shape tomorrow’s global economy.

These are neither the conventional textile nor basic product investments that played large roles in years past. While India’s large and growing domestic market continues to pull in foreign investors, it is far from the only factor in play in the post-pandemic years.

[TITLE]Europe backs secure satellite communications with multibillion euro package:
[TEXT]
Europe backs secure satellite communications with multibillion euro package

by Erica Marchand

Paris, France (SPX) Nov 28, 2025

European governments have backed a 2.1 billion euro funding package to expand secure satellite communications services, confirming support for space-based connectivity at the European Space Agency Council meeting at Ministerial Level in Bremen, Germany. The subscription will finance new and extended programmes intended to strengthen resilience, security and capacity in the satellite telecommunications sector for Europe and Canada.

ESA will direct the funding through its connectivity and secure communications portfolio, including the ARTES 4.0 (Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems) programme. ARTES is designed to move technologies and services from concept to operational use, giving companies a framework to test and mature satellite communications hardware, software and applications before they enter the commercial market.

Activities under ARTES cover geostationary satellites, non-geostationary constellations and ground segment infrastructure, and have supported developments ranging from optical and quantum links to satellite-enabled 5G systems. The latest subscription will continue support for projects such as HummingSat and Novacom, which aim to keep European industry active in the geostationary communications satellite segment.

The funding will also advance optical and quantum communications capabilities intended to reduce dependence on non-European providers and improve protection against interception or disruption. The HydRON initiative focuses on an optical communications network in space, including an expanding set of optical ground stations, to enable high-capacity data transfer described as an internet in space.

Quantum key distribution will receive dedicated support through missions including SAGA, which contributes to the European Union's EuroQCI infrastructure, as well as Eagle-1, Eagle neXt and QKDSat. These missions are planned to test and demonstrate secure distribution of cryptographic keys via satellites, which can then connect into governmental and commercial networks on the ground.

ESA's connectivity programmes will also work toward closer integration of terrestrial and satellite 5G and future networks to provide continuous coverage across urban, rural and remote regions. The agency expects this work to support emerging direct-to-device services, in which standard user handsets connect directly to satellites for messaging, voice or data when out of reach of ground networks.

Aviation, maritime and cybersecurity applications form another pillar of the investment plan, with a focus on safety-related and operational communications. ESA highlighted the Iris Global system for air traffic management, which uses satellite links to support more efficient and lower-emission flight routes, and announced further work to safeguard radio-frequency spectrum against interference.

Part of the new subscription is linked to Europe's Secure Connectivity initiative IRIS2, for which ESA will qualify and validate a multi-orbit satellite constellation led by the SpaceRISE industrial consortium. IRIS2 is intended to provide government and commercial users with secure communications capacity and to serve as a basis for future space-based connectivity services.

The evolution of IRIS2 is set to underpin ESA's European Resilience from Space concept, which combines communications, Earth observation and navigation data to support emergency response and other time-critical operations. By linking these capabilities, authorities could receive near-real-time situational information along with robust links for coordination and decision-making.

ESA's Moonlight programme is another beneficiary of the decisions taken in Bremen, with ministers agreeing to continue development of lunar communications and navigation infrastructure. Moonlight aims to deploy dedicated satellites and surface equipment to provide communications and positioning services for the many missions expected to operate around and on the Moon in the coming decade.

ESA's Director of Connectivity and Secure Communications, Laurent Jaffart, said decisions at the ministerial conference will shape how ESA responds to Europe's growing demand for reliable, resilient and secure connectivity. He noted that with a subscription exceeding 2 billion euros, ESA plans to work with Member States, the European Commission and partners to reinforce Europe's leadership, autonomy and competitiveness in satellite communications.

[TITLE]Altice International Shifts Assets From Lenders, Raises Debt:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg) -- Altice International has moved two of its units out of the reach of creditors, and raised new debt from one of them, in an aggressive move aimed at stabilizing its finances.

The telecommunications provider has designated Altice Portugal SA, which holds all of the company’s operations in Portugal, and Altice Caribbean Sarl, housing its activities in the Dominican Republic, as so-called unrestricted subsidiaries, according to a statement on Friday.

As such, the units aren’t governed by the rules of existing financing agreements. Instead, they are free to incur debt, sell assets, or pay dividends without needing approval from lenders.

At the same time, one of the Altice Portugal divisions has raised €750 million ($870 million) of new debt to pay upcoming Altice International liabilities, as well as for general working capital purposes, the statement said.

The company also flagged the possibility of raising €2 billion of additional debt at the level of Altice Portugal, according to the note, which would allow it to further bolster its liquidity position.

Altice International’s move — a so-called drop-down — is one of several aggressive tools borrowers and owners can deploy to raise money when struggling with a growing debt pile.

The company has been looking at various options to deal with its €8.7 billion stack of net liabilities.

“Altice founder Patrick Drahi’s latest game of asset Jenga leaves Altice International creditors in a perilous position and facing a restructuring scenario,” wrote Aidan Cheslin, the head of European credit research at Bloomberg Intelligence. The decision to designate its core Portugal and Caribbean assets as unrestricted leaves “the remaining restricted group (principally Israel) with an annualized net debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 26x.”

Altice International’s 5.75% dollar-denominated bonds due in August 2029 were down over 7 cents to below 67 cents on the dollar following the announcement, according to Trace pricing data.

Negotiations Ahead

Creditors have organized ahead of potential debt talks with the company.

Three independent members have been added to the board of Altice International, the statement said, adding that Altice Caribbean is now held by a direct subsidiary of Altice Group Lux Sarl.

The telecommunications firm also announced a strategic review of its portfolio of assets on Friday and will assess some potential disposals over the coming years.

The company posted third quarter results indicating a year-on-year drop in earnings of 12.1%, as well as a 4.2% growth in revenues. Profits were impacted as the streams of revenue currently growing have lower margins, the company said. On top of that, Altice International grappled with higher operating costs.

(Adds analyst comment in eighth graph, bond pricing in ninth, details on earnings in thirteenth.)

[TITLE]Huawei, ZTE seal 5G deals in Vietnam after US tariffs, as ties with China warm​:
[TEXT]
China's leading telecommunication firms Huawei and ZTE have won a string of contracts this year to supply 5G equipment in Vietnam, in another sign of Hanoi's strengthening bonds with Beijing, stirring concern among Western officials, seven people with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.For years, Vietnam was seen as reluctant to use Chinese technology in sensitive infrastructure, but in recent months it has embraced Chinese tech companies as sometimes frosty relations with its northern neighbour have warmed while ties with Washington have soured over tariffs on Vietnamese goods.While Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia secured contracts for Vietnam's 5G core infrastructure, with US chipmaker Qualcomm providing network equipment, Chinese companies have begun winning smaller tenders with state-owned operators, so far unreported public procurement data shows.A consortium including Huawei was awarded a $23 million contract for 5G equipment in April, weeks after the White House announced tariffs on Vietnamese goods. ZTE has won at least two contracts, one last week, totalling more than $20 million for 5G antennas. The first publicly disclosed deal came in September, a month after US tariffs took effect.Reuters could not establish whether the timing of these wins was linked to US tariffs, but the deals raised concerns among Western officials.The exclusion of Chinese contractors from Vietnam's digital infrastructure, including undersea fibre-optic cables, has long been identified by Washington as a key condition for support in advanced technologies.Huawei and ZTE are banned from US telecom networks as an "unacceptable risk" to national security. Sweden and other European countries have similar restrictions.Ericsson declined to comment on Chinese companies, but said it was "fully committed to support its customers in Vietnam."Huawei, ZTE, Nokia, Qualcomm, the US embassy in Vietnam, China's embassy, Sweden's foreign ministry or Vietnam's tech ministry responded to requests for comment.The unaligned Southeast Asian nation is a crucial battleground in the competition for global influence. Its proximity to China has made it a major industrial hub for multinationals such as Apple, Samsung and Nike , which rely on Chinese components and Western consumers.Under Western pressure, Vietnam long took "a wait-and-see approach" to Chinese technology, said Nguyen Hung, a specialist in supply chains at RMIT University Vietnam. But "Vietnam has its own priorities," he added, noting the new deals could spur deeper economic integration with China.Hanoi and Beijing have made progress recently on other sensitive projects, including cross-border rail links and special economic zones close to the Chinese border, which Vietnam had previously discarded as security risks.Huawei lost multiple bids this year on 5G equipment in Vietnam, according to tender data. But it has cooperated on technical services, and signed an agreement in June on 5G technology transfers with Viettel, Vietnam's army-owned main telecom operator, according to Vietnam's defence ministry.Viettel did not respond to a request for comment. One person at the company said Chinese technology was cheaper. The sources declined to be named because the information they shared was not public.The Chinese contracts have been discussed in at least two meetings of senior Western officials in Hanoi in recent weeks, diplomatic sources said. In one meeting, a U.S. official warned they could undermine trust in Vietnam's networks and jeopardise access to US advanced technology.In a meeting this month officials explored whether areas using Chinese technology could be sealed off from the rest of the network to prevent data leaks, one of the sources said.But suppliers of antennas and equipment could still gain access to network data, said Innocenzo Genna, a telecommunications lawyer, noting "Western contractors may face the awkward prospect of working alongside firms they do not trust."

[TITLE]Comcast to pay $1.5M fine for vendor breach affecting 270K customers:
[TEXT]
Comcast will pay a $1.5 million fine to settle a Federal Communications Commission investigation into a February 2024 vendor data breach that exposed the personal information of nearly 275,000 customers.

The breach occurred in February 2024, when attackers hacked into the systems of Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a debt collector Comcast had stopped using two years earlier.

The FCBS data breach was initially believed to have affected 1.9 million people in total, but the tally was raised to 3.2 million in June and, finally, to 4.2 million in July.

FBCS, which filed for bankruptcy before revealing a data breach in August 2024, notified Comcast on July 15 (five months after the attack) that customer data had been compromised, affecting 273,703 Comcast customers. Previously, it had assured Comcast in March that the breach did not affect any of its customers.

The threat actors stole personal and financial information between February 14 and February 26, including the names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and Comcast account numbers of affected current and former customers. Affected customers had used Comcast's Xfinity-branded internet, television, streaming, VoIP, and home security services.

Under the consent decree announced by the FCC on Monday, Comcast has also agreed to implement a compliance plan that includes enhanced vendor oversight to protect data and ensure customer privacy, ensuring its vendors properly dispose of customer information they no longer need for business purposes, as required by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984.

The telecommunications giant must also appoint a compliance officer, conduct risk assessments of vendors handling customer data every two years, file compliance reports with the FCC every six months over the next three years, and report any material violations within 30 days of discovery.

However, Comcast said in a statement to Reuters that it "was not responsible for and has not conceded any wrongdoing in connection with this incident," noting that its network wasn't breached and that FBCS was contractually required to comply with security requirements.

A Comcast spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer.

Comcast is an American mass media, telecommunications, and entertainment multinational company, and the fourth-largest telecom firm in the world by revenue, after AT&T, Verizon, and China Mobile.

It also has over 182,000 employees, hundreds of millions of customers worldwide, and reported revenues of $123.7 billion in 2024.

[TITLE]Microsoft New Zealand sees strong revenue growth – turnover now double its 2021 level:
[TEXT]
Net profit rose 13% from $47.4m to $53.4m.

Income tax expense was $17.9m from the year-ago $15.4m.

The cost of sales was reported as $1.36b.

A $45.0m dividend was paid to its parent company.

The past year has seen Microsoft NZ back down on two controversies.

One was the end of security upgrades for Windows 10 unless a customer paid $50.40 per computer to join an “extended upgrade programme” – a development that drew criticism from Consumer NZ and others. In the end, Microsoft provided most customers with an avenue to keep getting Windows 10 updates for free until October 2026.

Another was Microsoft 365 price increases of up to 38% as the company’s Copilot artificial intelligence (AI) assistant was added to the software suite – with an option to remain on the old pricing, minus Copilot, hidden unless a customer went to cancel their subscription. After court action from Australia’s market regulator (which is ongoing) and a warning letter from New Zealand’s Commerce Commission, Microsoft offered refunds.

The local operation’s success reflects Microsoft’s global fortunes. On October 30, Microsoft Corp reported an 18% revenue jump to US$77.7b ($134b) for its September quarter as demand for AI services boosted its cloud computing business as net profit rose 12% to $27.7b.

While its partnership with OpenAI (in which Microsoft holds a 27% stake) helped fuel revenue growth, related losses of US$3.1b from the investment in the ChatGPT maker impacted net income for the quarter.

Threat of tax on revenue melts away

In May, Revenue Minister Simon Watts discharged the Digital Services Tax Bill (introduced to the house under the Labour Government), which would have levied a flat 3% tax on Big Tech firms’ New Zealand revenue.

“We have been monitoring international developments and have decided not to progress the Digital Services Tax Bill at this time,” Watts said.

“A global solution has always been our preferred option, and we have been encouraged by the recent commitment of countries to the OECD work in this area.”

Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump said he did not support the OECD’s push to implement a global minimum corporate tax.

Former Finance Minister Grant Robertson first floated the idea of a 3% or 6% DST in 2019 but then put it on the backburner for most of the next four years.

The Digital Services Tax Bill (for a 3% tax) was introduced in the final days of Parliament before the 2023 election. It didn’t have time to get to a select committee, let alone pass.

Ahead of the 2023 election, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade warned that a digital services tax would raise less than $100m, with that amount likely to be lost to retaliatory tariffs and measures against cloud software firms like Xero who sell into the US market.

[TITLE]Binance, Polymarket lead as VCs deploy $25bn into crypto companies:
[TEXT]
Investor focus shifts to more regulatory-compliant products.

Fundraising in 2025 has already blown past analysts expectations.

Investors have deployed nearly $25 billion into crypto companies in 2025, dwarfing last year’s by over 150% and blowing past market watchers’ expectations.

Top guns involved in dealmaking this year include tech-focused firms Paradigm and Sequoia Capital, as well as Wall Street juggernauts BlackRock, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs.

The most popular sectors? Centralised exchanges with $4.4 billion, prediction markets with $3.2 billion, and DeFi platforms with $2.9 billion, according to data from DefiLlama.

“The projects attracting capital today are those aligned with regulatory clarity, operational resilience, and the ability to integrate with TradFi institutions and their standards,” Jordan Knecht, head of institutional strategies at GlobalStake, the blockchain services firm, told DL News.

Fundraising by crypto companies.

“In the middle of a choppy market, investors are signalling that they prefer durable, compliance-first businesses that aim to establish a long-term foundation for this asset class,” Knecht said.

Knecht isn’t alone to note that the crypto market has evolved this year.

Charles Chong, VP of strategy at crypto-native advisory firm BlockSpaceForce, told DL News that “the environment for crypto startups is shifting.”

Chong said that capital is rotating toward mature players whose revenue and unit economics justify valuation.

“None of this signals weakness; it simply reflects a market that is normalising and maturing,” he said, adding that raises are “becoming more rational, more aligned with fundamentals, and less driven by reflexive speculation.”

Georgii Verbitskii, angel investor and founder of the crypto investment firm TYMIO, told DL News that crypto is closely following the same pattern as other market cycles.

“In every major technology cycle, capital first flows into the base layer — the rails, liquidity, and settlement systems — before it moves into consumer-facing applications,” he said.

Here are some of the most notable raises this year.

Binance, $2 billion

Binance, said to be the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, secured a massive raise of $2 billion in March. This significant capital injection was led by Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and advanced technology investor MGX.

Binance CEO Richard Teng said that “this investment by MGX is a significant milestone for the crypto industry and for Binance.

Polymarket, $2 billion

Betting platform Polymarket closed a major funding round worth $2 billion in October, led by Intercontinental Exchange, valuing it around $8 billion. Once a fringe crypto‑betting site, the capital infusion reflects high institutional confidence.

Circle, $1.1 billion

Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the $76 billion stablecoin USDC, raised $1.1 billion in its June initial public offering. The blockbuster IPO was led by JP Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs serving as joint lead bookrunners, joined by Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and Société Générale as bookrunners.

Founded in 2013, Circle has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the United States’ warming to the crypto industry.

[TITLE]Work in progress: Hong Kong reaps the fruits of fintech seeds sown nearly 10 years ago:
[TEXT]
In the inaugural survey on fintech in 2017, Hong Kong ranked seventh and Singapore eighth. The same year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced the first phase of fintech development.

Hong Kong secured the world's top fintech ranking for the first time in the Global Financial Centres Index in September, while Singapore ranked fourth, according to the report by Z/Yen and the City of London that tracked 116 centres based on criteria like regulations, access to finance and talent.

While attendance in Hong Kong may have been thinner than in Singapore, the city has an edge over its Southeast Asian rival, thanks to its vibrant capital market providing funding for fintech companies and serving as a gateway to the Greater Bay Area.

This maturation has intensified Hong Kong's long-standing rivalry with Singapore . The two cities are competing to develop fintech, a rivalry highlighted this month as both hosted their 10th annual flagship fintech festivals.

The venue has moved from the PMQ (formerly the Police Married Quarters) to the massive Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, with the number of attendees growing 18-fold to 45,000 people. At the recent forum, speakers included some of the most high-profile figures in the financial sector like HSBC CEO Georges Elhedery and Standard Chartered Bank CEO Bill Winters .
