[TITLE]Vanguard caves on crypto to retain clients as rivals win flows — opens $9.3T platform to crypto ETFs:
[TEXT]
On Dec. 2, Vanguard will reportedly open its massive brokerage platform to spot Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

This strategic volte-face ends the asset manager’s steadfast isolation from the $3 trillion digital asset market.

For years, Vanguard stood as the most prominent holdout of the crypto space, driven by a philosophy that viewed the high volatility of digital assets as fundamentally incompatible with the principles of long-term, diversified portfolio construction.

This reversal, therefore, represents one of the most significant capitulations in the traditional finance sector’s gradual embrace of the crypto economy.

Crucially, Vanguard said it is not deviating from its core manufacturing philosophy. So, it would not be launching its own proprietary crypto funds.

Instead, it will serve as a critical gateway, allowing its conservative client base to access regulated products managed by rival issuers such as BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, and Bitwise Asset Management.

Speaking on the broader significance of the move, Hunter Horsley, Bitwise CEO, noted the stark contrast between the magnitude of the policy shift and the market’s muted reaction, a sign of the asset class’s maturity.

He noted:

“The 2nd largest brokerage in America flips its policy from sell-only to allowing crypto ETF purchases. And no one is fired up. Whether people are stoked right now or not — crypto is rapidly entering the mainstream.”

Why is Vanguard changing its decision

The firm’s restrictions on crypto ETFs had remained firmly in place even after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot Bitcoin funds in early 2024 and the first Ethereum products later that year.

Notably, Vanguard’s internal client guidelines and platform eligibility rules kept those ETFs from its self-directed brokerage system, citing regulatory ambiguity and investor protection concerns.

However, the calculus changed following a sweeping shift in the regulatory environment under the current US administration.

The SEC’s pivot toward a pro-innovation stance, combined with years of court decisions, effectively evaporated the regulatory uncertainty that Vanguard had long cited as a barrier.

Indeed, the approvals of spot crypto ETFs were underpinned by robust frameworks that establish how surveillance-sharing agreements, custody arrangements, and disclosure standards apply to digital assets.

These frameworks, first battle-tested with Bitcoin ETFs, became the template for subsequent products, significantly reducing the operational risk for brokers offering access through retail platforms.

Furthermore, the move is an acknowledgment of irrefutable market realities. A recent study found that 35% of younger, wealthy Americans have left their financial advisors because they do not allow access to crypto.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become one of the fastest-growing ETFs in US history, demonstrating that demand for crypto exposure had decisively shifted from niche trading platforms to mainstream asset managers.

Today, spot Bitcoin funds manage approximately $120 billion in assets across issuers, while Ethereum ETFs collectively hold nearly $20 billion.

At the same time, newer products tracking Solana and XRP are succeeding, thanks to strong market demand.

Beyond regulation, the absence of crypto access had become a burgeoning competitive liability for Vanguard.

Notably, many clients already held crypto ETFs in accounts outside Vanguard while maintaining traditional holdings on the platform. This bifurcation forced advisors to route trades through separate institutions, complicating processes such as tax-loss harvesting and model portfolio management.

So, this decision acknowledges that clients seeking exposure through regulated ETFs should be able to execute those trades within their primary Vanguard accounts rather than migrating capital to outside brokers.

Andrew Kadjeski, head of brokerage and investments at Vanguard, reportedly said:

“Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity. The administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured, and investor preferences continue to evolve.”

How will this impact the crypto ETF market?

The direct impact on ETF flows will depend on how Vanguard’s unique client base responds.

Vanguard manages more than $9.3 trillion in assets, but the addressable market for these products is narrower because only self-directed brokerage and IRA accounts are authorized to trade them. Institutional mandates, defined benefit plans, and other pooled vehicles generally remain restricted from such allocations.

Moreover, Vanguard clients exhibit behavior distinct from the active traders who drove early crypto ETF inflows. This demographic favors passive, long-dated index products over thematic or tactical funds.

As a result, initial allocations are expected to be modest. Still, a penetration rate of roughly 0.1% to 0.2% of eligible brokerage assets would imply early flows in the low-single-digit billions, spread across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP funds.

Meanwhile, the significance of Vanguard’s entry lies not in the velocity of the flows, but in the stickiness of the capital. Unlike the “mercenary capital” of hedge funds or the reactive flows of retail day traders, Vanguard inflows tend to be price-agnostic and permanent.

So, in a standard “60/40/1” portfolio—allocated to equities, bonds, and crypto respectively—automated systems maintain target weightings by selling outperforming assets and buying underperforming ones. If the price of Bitcoin or Solana drops, the portfolio algorithmically buys more to restore the 1% weighting.

This creates a structural “buy the dip” mechanism that could dampen volatility and raise floor prices over a full market cycle.

Moreover, broader distribution typically improves liquidity.

The influx of Vanguard’s diversified volume is expected to narrow bid-ask spreads and reduce execution costs for all investors, further tightening the efficiency of ETF arbitrage mechanisms and the responsiveness of pricing to underlying market movements.

As a result, even a conservative adoption curve could have outsized impacts. So, if only a fraction of Vanguard’s client base allocates a standard 1% to 2% “satellite” position to crypto ETFs, it represents tens of billions of dollars in net new demand.

[TITLE]Giving vouchers for Christmas? Consider cash as fifth of recipients yet to use last year’s:
[TEXT]
Almost two-thirds of people got a gift voucher last Christmas, but 22 per cent have yet to cash it in. Photograph: iStock

More than one in five of those who were previously given vouchers as Christmas presents have yet to use them, according to a consumer watchdog.

The annual Christmas survey from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) also suggests people are expecting to spend only slightly less this year than in 2024 despite the enduring cost-of-living crisis.

Almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they had received at least one gift voucher last Christmas.

However, 22 per cent of those who had been given such a gift had yet to cash it in.

“Our research shows how popular vouchers are as gifts, but if they’re not used, they’re a waste of money,” the CCPC’ s director of communications, Grainne Griffin, said.

“We are encouraging consumers to use gift vouchers as soon as possible, and if you’re thinking of giving someone a voucher this year, maybe consider if they would prefer cash – it comes with fewer terms and conditions.”

According to the research, consumers expect to spend €1,163 this Christmas compared with €1,177 in 2024, a decrease of €14.

The 45-54 year age group expected to spend the most, with the average expenditure coming in at €1,465.

The survey of just over 1,000 adults also pointed to substantial differences between family units – households with children are set to spend an average of €1,601 compared to €995 in those without.

“From our research it appears that consumers are taking quite a sensible approach to Christmas spending” Ms Griffin said.

“While costs have risen, most consumers don’t plan to spend any more than last year.”

However, she warned that it would still be “easy for spending to get out of control at Christmas, and the price increases can hit particularly hard at this time of year”.

She advised consumers to “plan carefully; list everything you’re going to have to spend money on for Christmas – presents, food, drink, nights out, travel – and then look at your sources of cash. Think

As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Union Budget for 2026 in February, the Modi government is once again placing fiscal consolidation at the core of its economic strategy. The upcoming budget will be Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive presentation, with the Centre aiming to further narrow the fiscal gap amid competing pressures of growth, welfare and capital spending.The government has set an ambitious fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP for 2025–26, a reduction from 4.8% in the previous fiscal, consistent with its commitment to bring the deficit below 4.5% by FY26. Achieving this target is crucial, as a lower deficit frees more financial space for private investment and supports long-term growth.The push for fiscal prudence comes at a time when the government continues to prioritise infrastructure development, rural welfare, healthcare and education, while simultaneously attempting to manage borrowing levels. The balancing act is further complicated by the possibility of higher spending and potential income tax cuts aimed at stimulating consumption in an economy poised for its slowest expansion in four years.For the fiscal year beginning April 1, the Centre has outlined key trends in its expenditure and revenue trajectory.India’s fiscal deficit for April–October stood at ₹8.25 lakh crore, or 52.6% of the full-year target, widening from 46.5% in the same period last year. The government is aiming to bring the deficit down to 4.4% of GDP this year from 4.8% a year earlier.During the first seven months of the year, major subsidies—covering food, fertiliser and petroleum—reached ₹2.46 lakh crore, amounting to 64% of the revised annual allocation, nearly unchanged from last year’s 65%.Total receipts during April–October touched ₹18 lakh crore, while overall expenditure rose to ₹26.25 lakh crore, translating to 51.5% and 51.8% of their respective budgeted estimates. A year earlier, receipts were at 53.7% of the target and expenditure at 51.3%.Revenue receipts for the April–October period climbed to ₹17.63 lakh crore, supported by:Tax revenues: ₹12.74 lakh croreNon-tax revenues: ₹4.89 lakh croreTax revenues were slightly lower than in the same period last year, while non-tax revenues surged sharply—driven by the Reserve Bank of India’s dividend transfer of ₹2.69 lakh crore, up from ₹2.11 lakh crore a year earlier. This windfall is expected to ease pressure on the Centre’s fiscal deficit.Tax and non-tax revenue realisations stood at 44.9% and 83.9% of budgeted estimates, respectively. While tax collections lag last year’s 50.5%, non-tax revenue has significantly improved from 73.2%.The revenue deficit for the period was ₹2.44 lakh crore, or 46.7% of the full-year target.

[TITLE]Is smooth sailing the new outrageous? Saxo releases its annual Outrageous Predictions for 2026:
[TEXT]
The annual Saxo outrageous predictions are never about being right, but always about challenging consensus narratives. Perhaps in 2026, smooth sailing is the new outrageous, says Saxo’s John Hardy image credit: Andrii Yalanskui/shutterstock

Saxo has previous over the years for what may appear at first glance to be improbable forecasts, coming to pass.

Predictions that were much closer to the truth than thought:

Late bloomer: Gold rockets to $3,000 as central banks fail on inflation mandate (OPs for 2022)

Trump 2.0 blows up the US dollar (OPs for 2025)

Nvidia balloons to twice the value of Apple (OPs for 2025)

The plan to end fossil fuels gets a rain check (OPs for 2022)

Volatility spikes after flash crash in stock markets (OPs for 2018)

Bitcoin triples in value, from current $700 level to $2,100 (OPs for 2017)

UK seen leaning toward 2017 exit from the EU (Brexit) on UKIP election landslide (OPs for 2015)

Gold corrects to $1,200 per ounce (OPs for 2013)

The Saxo forecasts are not a house view or a forecast; they are low-probability, high-impact thought experiments designed to stretch the imagination and sharpen debate about what could happen if things leap forward in unexpected ways.

“Saxo’s outrageous predictions cover a lot of ground this year. From a true extraterrestrial financial market and weight-loss drugs for pets to Taylor Swift helping to upend digital addiction among global youth, and something as outrageous as a US political event without turmoil.

While the predictions are never about being right, but always about challenging consensus narratives. Perhaps in 2026, smooth sailing is the new outrageous,” says John J. Hardy, global head of macro strategy at Saxo.

In tech, take cryptography and imagine what happens if Q-Day suddenly arrives in 2026, the day that quantum machines can crack yesterday’s digital locks effortlessly. Crypto collapses; gold screams to five figures; every bank and government scrambles to rebuild trust in a post-quantum security stack.

Market impact: Volatility in quantum computing stocks, IBM, cybersecurity stocks, bitcoin and other digital assets, gold, banks, etc.

In 2026, markets discover that sudden culture shifts can move macro. A single wedding – Swift and Kelce – tips a generation out of doomscrolling and into backyards, marriages, and baby carriages. Fertility and household formation booms. Economists coin a new phrase with a smile: the Swiftie Put.

Market impact: Negative for social media stocks, positive for everything homebuilding/DIY/décor, luxury, wedding venues, destination/travel

In politics, the aggravated partisanship of recent years is suddenly upended after the ugly partisan shenanigans in the US midterm elections shock the silent majority of independents into demanding reform and a strengthening of democratic institutions. Trump stays Trump, but America begins to move on.

Market impact: Rise in US Treasuries (lower yields), decline in social media stocks, crypto, gold, and silver.

In medicine, GLP-1 obesity drugs in pill form transform human and even pet health. Waistlines shrink, lifespans stretch, and all food companies race to reinvent themselves for a lighter world.

Market impact: Fast fashion does well as more people need to replace whole wardrobes. Winners and losers emerge in food producers, restaurants, and pet food makers. Healthcare and veterinary stocks rally as GLP-1 adoption broadens.

Above the atmosphere, capital markets discover their next frontier. A SpaceX IPO valuation clears a trillion dollars and turns “space economy” from slogan to spreadsheet. Orbital manufacturing and lunar projects migrate from science fiction to investment committee.

Market impact: Rocket companies join the fun, Teledyne, Microchip Technology.

Back on Earth, an AI model becomes a Fortune 500 CEO, executing without ego and forcing boards to consider the unthinkable: a human-machine partnership at the top.

Market impact: AI infrastructure, cloud, and governance-tech firms continue to surge, insurers and auditors reinvent coverage for algorithmic management. Investors at first assign a new governance-risk premium to any company run by code.

Geopolitics, never far from the tape in recent years, tests the monetary order as Beijing rolls out a gold-linked offshore yuan for redenomination of its trade. The dollar remains a king, but not the king.

Market impact: Gold advances above $6,000, USD/CNH heads below 5.0, US Treasury yields rise on foreign selling. The “golden yuan” becomes a durable second global anchor, not replacing the dollar, but ending its monopoly.

While carefully constructed and prompted AI may help run a company, beneath the buzzwords, a humbling reckoning unfolds: dumb AI, or poorly governed agents and “agentic” automations, misfire en masse, generating a trillion-dollar cleanup and a new profession of “AI janitors” to disinfect the codebase of modern life.

Market impact: Cybersecurity, audit, and consulting firms see surging revenues, valuations of highly autonomous AI platforms face pressure, and investors rotate toward companies offering resilience, oversight, and human control.

[TITLE]Community-led polycentric water management for drought mitigation in Southern Zambia:
[TEXT]
Abstract Recurrent droughts in Southern Zambia have increased rural community vulnerabilities, intensified water scarcity, and worsened food insecurity. Unpredictable rainfall and the drying of open water sources pose significant challenges to livelihoods. In response, Hanzila community in Zambia implemented a transformative locally-led initiative to enhance drought resilience, with support from district-level authorities, national government, and international partners. Sectoral silos in the government’s vertical polycentric decision-making framework were overcome by horizontal decision-making across all tiers. Accordingly, the installation of a solar-powered borehole facilitated year-round access to water for drinking, domestic use, livestock, and irrigation. An assessment of the impact of the solar-powered borehole established that 86% people had become less reliant on unclean water sources, with reduced travel to access water. Moreover, the proportion of households cultivating gardens increased from 23% to 69%, enhancing food security and nutrition. Over three quarters of the households that owned gardens now generated income from vegetable sales. The solar-powered borehole also created a reliable water source for 89% of the households that raised small livestock — goats, sheep, and chickens. Among the 48% of respondents who owned cattle, more than half had stopped using distant open water sources; instead, they now accessed water from the solar-powered borehole. However, households situated farther from the ten supply taps implemented with the borehole still had to travel longer distances to access water. To ensure all households have equal access to water when the available funding is limited, community members could contribute to finance the extension of the reticulation to reach all households.

[TITLE]African land policy reforms have been good for women and communities – but review of 18 countries shows major gaps:
[TEXT]
Land tenure is the relationship, defined in law and customs, that people as individuals or groups have with land. It involves a bundle of rights to land, such as the right to use, sell, or bequeath land. Secure tenure is crucial for people to have secure homes, for food production, and for the economy. For many it is also central to their identity and culture.

While there is broad agreement on the importance of effective governance of secure land tenure, the best way to achieve this is the subject of much debate. The core contestation is between commodifying land through individual rights and markets, versus protecting it as a social good through communal rights to prevent landlessness and inequality. An overlapping debate is between more customary or traditional systems and those based on statutory law and democratic principles.

Food systems, economic justice, and agrarian reform have been the focus of my scholarship over the last 20 years. Seeing both progress and the same old debates continue, my two co-researchers and I felt it a good moment to examine what has happened with land tenure governance and what we can learn from that.

Our research involved conducting a comprehensive review of 18 countries – 16 in Africa and two in Asia – between 2021 and 2023.

Our study found a significant shift towards the recognition of customary rights and the strengthening of women’s land rights. These are driven by a wave of new policies, legislation and programmes such as those in Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Malawi.

Although progress has been made, the struggle over land – balancing market interests with social protection, individual rights with communal governance – remains highly contested. Learning from the good examples and seeing what still needs to be done is crucial for further debates and action on the issue of land rights and governance.

The findings

Our review involved extensive interviews with a range of actors from government, civil society and academia in each country and a review of policies, legislation and other documents.

Our study also came just over ten years after the adoption of the Framework and Guidelines on Land Policy in Africa and the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure.

The two are internationally agreed guidelines intended to assist national governments to improve their land policies and governance. We used them as benchmarks against which to review the land tenure governance arrangements in each country.

We found that the past two decades have seen a remarkable surge in land policy and legislative activity. Fifteen of the 18 countries studied have adopted new or substantially amended land policies or laws since 2000. Twelve have done so since 2012.

Central achievements of these reforms have been the strengthening of women’s land rights and improved legal recognition of customary and communal land tenure systems. This is seen in the adoption of policies and legislation that recognise customary land rights and prohibit gender discrimination.

This has led to the increased inclusion of community participation in land decision making procedures. There are also programmes that have been implemented to register customary land rights.

Some countries, such as Zambia, have set targets for the minimum amount of land that should go to women. Such interventions have improved the land rights of millions who have historically been vulnerable to dispossession.

These shifts, in particular recognising communal and customary land rights, represent a move away from the wholesale individualisation, privatisation and commoditisation of land.

The proponents of land privatisation, most notably the World Bank, argue that it unlocks access to capital and leads to the transfer of land to those who can use it most effectively.

Those arguing against it claim that it has not worked, particularly in Africa, and leads to greater land inequality and landlessness.

Instead, the 15 countries in this study that have adopted new policies and legislation in the last two decades are forging a middle path. They are seeking to secure traditional rights while unlocking development potential, such as by securing farmers’ rights and enabling investments. The formal registration of individual rights to customary land has been achieved cost-effectively in several contexts, without a full privatisation of land and without leading to widespread landlessness.

Crucially, and contrary to earlier fears, recent land registration efforts have often benefited women more than men in several settings, such as Rwanda and Ethiopia.

The success stories

Two standout examples illustrate the potential of well-crafted and implemented reforms.

In Sierra Leone, the passage of the Customary Land Rights Act and the National Land Commission Act in 2022 set new benchmarks for protecting community and women’s rights. These laws entrench the increasingly recognised requirement of “free, prior and informed consent” from affected communities and families before any changes to their land rights or use can proceed.

The law breaks new ground by explicitly stipulating that such consent must be given by both “adult male and female members of the affected community,” ensuring women’s voices are heard. Furthermore, the Customary Land Rights Act mandates that a minimum of 60% of both women and men in families must approve decisions concerning family land. This is a potentially powerful measure to protect the interests of all dependants in extended families.

In Ethiopia, a different kind of success story has unfolded through a massive, state-driven land certification programme. This has resulted in the registration of individual community land rights to over 25 million land parcels.

This was achieved at a remarkably low cost of just US$8.50 per title and provided to beneficiaries for free. The programme has had a positive gender impact with 23%-24% of certificates issued in the names of women alone (compared to 14%-15% to men) and a further 55% issued as joint titles to couples.

This demonstrates that large-scale, cost-effective land registration that strengthens women’s tenure security is achievable.

Examples of stalled reform

Our study also revealed numerous implementation gaps. Policies and laws may align with international voluntary guidelines principles on paper. But translation into tangible security for citizens is often weak.

Furthermore, several countries, such as Cameroon and Senegal, are hampered by a failure to adopt new legislation altogether and still operate with land laws that are over 50 years old.

South Africa serves as a stark example of stalled reform. Following the end of apartheid over three decades ago, there was a flurry of post-liberation land legislation. However, the country has failed to finalise new legislation to address tenure insecurity on communal land, which is home to approximately 20 million people. The 2004 Communal Land Rights Act was declared unconstitutional, and a subsequent 2017 draft bill has yet to be passed.

Consequently, land governance in these areas remains in a legal vacuum.

South Africa also continues to rely on an outdated, slow and expensive land registration system for private land. The country has failed to implement a modern, fit-for-purpose national land registry that could serve all citizens. This legislative and administrative inertia has left the country’s land reform programme perpetually underperforming and land distribution as unequal as ever.

The journey is far from complete

The overall trajectory of land tenure governance in the first decades of the 21st century is one of cautious optimism. The examples of Sierra Leone’s progressive laws and Ethiopia’s mass certification show what is possible with political will and innovative approaches.

However, the journey is far from complete. The challenges of implementation are immense, and countries like South Africa, Cameroon and Senegal highlight the critical need to modernise legal frameworks and land administration.

[TITLE]CARBIOS and Wankai New Materials sign the definitive agreement establishing a strategic partnership to the large-scale deployment of CARBIOS’s PET biorecycling technology in Asia:
[TEXT]
Clermont-Ferrand (France), 2 December 2025 (8:45 AM CET). In line with the commitment signed on November 6, 20251, CARBIOS (Euronext Growth Paris: ALCRB) and Wankai New Materials (« Wankai »), a listed subsidiary2 of Zhink Group, the 3rd largest PET producer in China and 4th worldwide, announce the signing of the definitive agreement establishing a strategic partnership for the large-scale deployment of CARBIOS’s PET biorecycling technology in Asia, with the first step being the construction of a PET biorecycling plant in China.

The two companies have signed on 2 December 2025 the shareholders’ agreement for their joint venture, dedicated to the construction and operation of a first PET biorecycling plant in China, with a processing capacity of 50,000 tons of PET waste.

Wankai will be the majority shareholder of this company with a 70% stake, while CARBIOS will hold the remaining 30%. The financing of the plant’s construction, estimated at €115 million, will be covered 30% by equity and 70% by debt, with all debt guaranteed by Wankai.

The plant will be located in Haining (Zhejiang province) on site provided by Wankai, which is already equipped with infrastructure (equipment, waste treatment, etc.), thus reducing the investment cost. Construction is expected to begin during the first quarter of 2026, with commissioning targeted by the first quarter of 2027.

CARBIOS and Wankai have also approved on 2 December 2025 the license agreement, which will be granted by CARBIOS to the joint venture upon its incorporation.

CARBIOS and Wankai have committed to a long-term partnership with the ambition to build and operate several PET biorecycling plants in Asia. CARBIOS agrees to exclusively license its PET depolymerization technology in Asia to Wankai for a period of three years, subject to signing licenses with the latter for at least 100 kt per year of additional capacity. This term will be extended in five-year increments if additional licenses for at least 200 kt per year of extra capacity are signed.

To strengthen the strategic partnership between the two companies, Wankai has committed to subscribe, before 2 June 2026, to a dedicated capital increase of €5 million in the share capital of CARBIOS S.A.3, paid on the basis of an issue price per share of €8.0947, corresponding to the volume-weighted average of the last five trading days preceding the 1st of December 2025, reduced by a 10% discount.

Vincent Kamel, CEO of CARBIOS: « The signing of this agreement marks the achievement of a major strategic partnership with Zhink Group. We are taking a decisive step forward to accelerate the international deployment of our technology, a key innovation in the fight against plastic pollution. This is a major milestone in bringing our licensing model to life: together, we will help build a more sustainable future. »

[TITLE]From Martha Stewart to Dockers to Toys “R” Us, brand managers are raking in billions betting on classic American names:
[TEXT]
Also under the ABG umbrella are investments in the name, image, and likeness rights of various boldface names, including soccer superstar David Beckham and basketball great Shaquille O’Neal. ABG also owns the names and likenesses of long-deceased icons including Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, and Muhammad Ali.

The cherished American retail names now owned by these companies make a long list: WHP owns Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us, Anne Klein, Express, Bonobos, and Rag & Bone. Marquee owns the revamped Martha Stewart brand, BCBG, Laura Ashley, and Isotoner. ABG, the largest player in this space, owns a vast empire of more than 50 brands, including Eddie Bauer, Champion, and Reebok.

Dockers followed a well-trodden path, and one that many iconic brands have taken in recent years. Brand management companies including ABG, WHP Global, and Marquee Brands have assembled portfolios that include dozens of household-name brands. These companies have emerged as the new power brokers in fashion and retail, raking in some $50 billion in sales globally each year.

The Dockers pocket predicament—which some dismiss as an imagined problem—predates ABG’s ownership. But it shows the peril of a 1.5-inch difference—that razor’s edge between a loyal customer and one who abandons a product or company. Even the most beloved brands can become vulnerable following perceived changes or quality erosion that upset passionate consumers—and when heritage brands are purchased by holding companies like ABG, which seek to optimize and grow the brands globally, that passion can be a double-edged sword.

Levi Strauss is actually no longer the parent company of Dockers; in May it sold the label to brand ownership giant Authentic Brands Group (ABG) for an initial value of $311 million, with the potential to reach $391 million based on performance under Authentic’s ownership. (ABG declined to comment on the Dockers brand or its pocket measurements.)

By IwearPants’ measurement, the pockets on his new Dockers are 1.5 inches less deep than his old pair. And he made a plea: “If Dockers (or parent Levi Strauss) needs to raise the price by a couple of bucks per pair, so be it. Just give me back deep pants pockets on my Dockers.”

“My change and keys fall out sitting,” posted Robert C.

[TITLE]India Global Forum Announces First-of-its-Kind $250 Million Fund to Take Indian Brands Global:
[TEXT]
The $250 million fund will support high-potential Indian brands to expand globally, leveraging Dubai’s connectivity with India Global Forum’s powerful ecosystem.

DUBAI, UAE and NEW DELHI, Nov. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- India Global Forum (IGF) today announced a first-of-its-kind $250 million fund dedicated to helping India’s most ambitious consumer and industrial brands expand into global markets. Anchored by Ved Family Office and Ananta Capital, the fund was unveiled at IGF Middle East 2025: NXT Frontiers in Dubai in the presence of senior business leaders, policymakers and innovators shaping the future of the India–UAE corridor.

The new fund will combine growth capital, world-class logistics and market access, and IGF’s powerful convening and networks. Through a dedicated Accelerator Programme, Indian companies will be supported to scale into key international markets across the Middle East, Africa, Europe and beyond.

Unveiling the initiative at the fifth edition of IGF’s Dubai forum, Manoj Ladwa, Founder & Chairman, India Global Forum, said: “India is producing brands that are ready for the world, and Dubai is the natural launchpad for their global ambitions. Through this $250 million fund, we are unlocking a new era of opportunity, where Indian entrepreneurship meets world-class infrastructure, global capital and international demand.”

The programme brings together IGF’s unparalleled networks across business, government and innovation with Dubai’s logistics ecosystem through DP World. Participating companies will gain access to tailored market-entry support as well as curated introductions to investors, partners and potential customers.

The fund and accelerator will focus on high-potential Indian companies across sectors including food & beverage, consumer brands, chemicals, automotive, advanced manufacturing and industrial products. IGF will work closely with partners to identify companies with strong brands, global scalability and a compelling value proposition for international markets.

Reflecting on the significance of this moment for India–UAE business ties, Nilesh Ved, Chairman, Ved Family Office and Apparel Group, commented: “The UAE has long been a bridge between India and global markets. As anchor investors in this fund, we see a tremendous opportunity to back the next generation of Indian brands that can go global from Dubai. This initiative will give founders the confidence, capability and connectivity they need to scale internationally.”

Ashutosh Taparia, Founder & Managing Partner, Ananta Capital, added: “India is at an inflection point where homegrown brands are ready to compete and win globally. By anchoring this fund, we aim to provide patient, strategic capital and partner with entrepreneurs who are building durable, category-defining businesses.”

Speaking at the launch, Abdulla Al Hashmi, COO Parks & Zones, DP World GCC, said: “We welcome initiatives that empower Indian businesses to scale globally through the UAE. With one of the most advanced trade ecosystems in the world, Indian businesses can use Dubai’s connectivity to reach more than 3 billion consumers in fast-growing regional markets.”

The Accelerator Programme marks a major step forward in strengthening the economic partnership between India and the UAE. It offers founders access to global infrastructure, world-class logistics, curated networks and strategic capital — all under one integrated platform designed to take Indian brands global.

IGF Middle East 2025: NXT Frontiers convened 90 senior leaders from government, global corporations, venture capital, advanced technology, academia and next-generation enterprises to explore how India’s rapid digital and economic transformation can complement Gulf capital and innovation ecosystems to unlock growth across nine frontier themes: Capital, Deep Technology, Intelligence, Consumer Capital, Experience, Resilience, Healthspan, Ambition and Inclusion. Through roundtables, plenaries, fireside dialogues and curated networking, participants examined the opportunities and challenges reshaping the global economy amid geopolitical disruption and rapid digitalisation.

[TITLE]Meesho IPO: Key things to know and should you subscribe?:
[TEXT]
Value-focussed e-commerce platform Meesho, which mainly serves mass-market consumers in tier-II plus cities, is tapping the IPO market with a ₹5,421.20 crore offering. The company will raise ₹4,250 crore via a fresh issue of 38.29 crore shares, while promoters and few early investors will realise ₹1,171.20 crore by selling 10.55 crore shares at the upper end of the ₹105 to 111 price band. Post IPO, promoter holding will fall to 16.8 per cent from 19.1 per cent.

Of the fresh issue proceeds, ₹1,390 crore is earmarked for cloud infrastructure in subsidiary Meesho Technologies, ₹1,020 crore for marketing and brand initiatives and ₹480 crore for salaries of machine learning, AI and technology staff. Around ₹1,360 crore will fund acquisitions, strategic initiatives and general corporate purposes.

The IPO will make 10-year-old Meesho, backed by global investors such as Elevation Capital, Peak XV, Prosus and Softbank, the first large multi-category e-commerce marketplace to list in India, ahead of rivals Flipkart and Amazon India.

At the ₹50,096 crore implied m-cap, and considering the around ₹5,500 crore in cash and cash equivalents (including liquid investments), Meesho will have an enterprise value (EV) of close to ₹45,000 crore and is valued at roughly 4.75/ 4 times EV/operating revenue on FY25/H1FY26 annualised basis.

Lack of profitability (loss of ₹700 crore in H1FY26), thin contribution margins, volatile cash flows and a model heavily reliant on value-conscious customers are risks to consider. Competition can also get more intense in the e-commerce space if players with stronger balance sheets target the space Meesho operates in. In such cases, profitability timelines can get delayed and further cash raise may also be required. In this context, curren valuation does not offer sufficient margin of safety. Hence investors can skip the IPO.

Though other listed e-commerce players such as Swiggy, Eternal (Zomato) and FSN E-commerce (Nykaa) trade at 6–14x FY25 P/S, we believe Meesho is not truly comparable: its low-ticket model and thin contribution margin leave it on a meaningfully more challenging economic footing. Higher valuation of Swiggy and Zomato are driven by much faster growing quick commerce business.

Business

Meesho began as a WhatsApp-driven reseller platform for low-priced goods. In 2021, it pivoted to become a horizontal marketplace where brands sell directly to shoppers.

Its core business is a zero-commission, value-first marketplace designed to bring India’s vast unbranded and regional supply online at scale. It also works with content creators who make short videos and live streams to boost shopping experience.

Value-focussed platforms emphasise small-order, price-sensitive purchases, long-tail unbranded sellers and slower 4–7 day delivery.

Meesho’s revenue model rests primarily on logistics and fulfilment fees, and advertising income (online ads display). It does not manufacture or sell private-label products.

Orders placed are fulfilled either through its asset-light logistics network Valmo (64.5 per cent of total shipped orders in H1FY26) or logistics partners.

Products sold on Meesho are concentrated in apparel and home & kitchen/furnishing and beauty & personal care.

As Meesho scaled, average order value declined while annual order volumes rose. Contribution profit per order trajectory indicates that unit economics remain sensitive to growth intensity and spending levels.

In H1FY26/FY25, 72/77 per cent of shipped orders were Cash on Delivery (CoD).

Meesho now plans to scale a branded Meesho Mall within its app and build a low-cost local network for daily essentials, pushing the model towards more brand conscious, higher frequency categories that require tighter logistics.

Financials and valuation

Meesho’s financials (see table) show sharp scale-up with still-weak profitability. Annual revenue from operations rose 28 per cent CAGR in FY23 to FY25 period, with the rate climbing to 29 per cent in H1FY26. This rides on rapid growth in marketplace activity: Net Merchandise Value (NMV), which is cumulative checkout value of successfully delivered orders.

Unit economics have improved slightly versus the early loss years, but they remain sensitive to growth pushes. Contribution margin on NMV expanded from 2.9 per cent in FY23 to 5.6 per cent in FY24 before easing to 5 per cent in FY25 and 3.8 per cent in H1 FY26. It is calculated after all order-linked costs such as logistics and payment gateway fees, but before heavy central spends like advertising, most tech infrastructure and corporate overheads. These central costs sit largely in “other expenses” (dominated by logistics, advertising and cloud/software), which is roughly equal to Meesho’s entire revenue and more than 90 per cent of its cost base. Sustained profitability hinges more on improving logistics efficiency and keeping marketing and tech spend disciplined relative to growth.

FY25’s bottom line was hit by one-offs, mainly tax on the group reorganisation plus accelerated promoter ESOP vesting and related perquisite tax. The H1FY26 loss reflects heavier marketing and tech spend, along with further exceptional charges from the reorganisation and a vendor settlement. The FY25 restructuring demerged the e-commerce and grocery businesses into subsidiaries and merged Meesho Inc. into the parent.

Meesho’s proposed IPO valuation is priced fully in the absence of a clear path to profitability. Investors should wait a few quarters to assess the steady state of bottomline.

Earnings performance of recent e-commerce IPOs has been patchy, with post listing profits often failing to justify their rich valuations.
