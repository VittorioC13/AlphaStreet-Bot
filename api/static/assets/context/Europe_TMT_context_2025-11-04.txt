[TITLE]How an 'accidental banker' is turning this LA-based investment bank into one of the biggest deal machines:

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Scott Adelson didn't expect to be sitting in this seat right now.

"I'm probably an accidental investment banker," the CEO of Houlihan Lokey — which has become one of Wall Street's busiest investment banks by deal volume — said in an interview with Business Insider in September.

After earning an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Adelson started a small business and expected to spend his career building companies, not advising them. But when he joined a roughly 30-person valuation shop in Los Angeles in 1987, he thought he was making just a brief stop in the world of high finance.

Four decades later, and he's still there — and now sits at the helm of the bank, having been named to the chief executive role last year, and previously serving as copresident and global cohead of corporate finance.

Houlihan has come a long way from its roots as the restructuring and bankruptcy expert clients thought of when a liquidity panic was afoot. This year, Houlihan worked with financial sponsor clients like Carlyle and advised the hair care brand Color Wow on its sale to L'Oréal — part of the 240 transactions it handled through the third quarter, according to GlobalData league tables reviewed by Business Insider.

To be sure, other bulge-bracket banks handle larger corporate mergers or take-privates and have surpassed Houlihan in the transaction value they work on; however, in the middle-market arena — deals generally valued at around $1 billion and under — the firm has drawn significant deal flow.

During its most recent earnings disclosure this week — the bank's second quarter of the 2026 fiscal year — Houlihan announced that it generated revenues of $659 million, 15% higher than the same quarter last year. Corporate finance revenues of nearly $439 million were

[TITLE]Finovate Global Canada: Wealthsimple’s $10 Billion Valuation and a Look at Investment Trends:
[TEXT]
This week’s edition of Finovate Global features recent fintech news from Canada.

Wealthsimple secures $750 million at valuation of $10 billion

Canadian fintech Wealthsimple has raised CAD $750 million at a post-money valuation of CAD $10 billion. The funding round includes both a CAD $550 million primary offering and a secondary offering of up to CAD $200 million. Dragoneer Investment Group and GIC led the round, which also featured participation from new investor Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) as well as existing investors Power Corporation of Canada, IGM Financial Inc. ICONIQ, Greylock, and Meritech.

“This raise reflects deep confidence from new and returning investors in our mission and our role as a defining Canadian company,” Wealthsimple Co-Founder and CEO Michael Katchen said. “We were intentional in choosing partners committed to the long-term future of Wealthsimple. These are well-respected, global leaders with a proven track record (of) scaling category leaders, and who believe in our vision for the future of financial services.”

Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Wealthsimple offers a suite of low-cost financial solutions to help Canadians build wealth. The company’s platform features self-directed investing, managed portfolios, digital asset investing, tax filing, advisor services, and more in a single, integrated experience. Wealthsimple serves three million Canadians and has $100 billion in assets under administration.

“Few companies have achieved what Wealthsimple has in the last few years,” Dragoneer Investment Group Partner Christian Jensen said. “The Wealthsimple team has built an expansive financial platform that millions of Canadians trust. They’re not just participating in Canada’s financial services industry; they’re redefining it.”

Earlier this year, Wealthsimple unveiled a waitlist for its first credit card, which topped 300,000 Canadians in the first six months. The company’s fundraising news follows a profitable 2024 and current profitability in 2025, as well. The capital infusion will help Wealthsimple accelerate its product roadmap in investing, spending, and credit, as well as support the company’s efforts to expand its platform.

Fintech investment slows in H1 ahead of potential rebound in H2

Speaking of investment and Canadian fintech, KPMG’s Canada Fintech Investment Report is a great way to get up to speed on the investment trends that are supporting fintech innovation in Canada. The report was published in August, and focuses on investment trends from the first half of 2025.

While the report indicates that Canadian fintech investment fell significantly compared to international trends, the report authors suggest that the first half of 2025 represented a normalization in the wake of record high levels of investment in 2024. Areas of investor interest include AI, especially agentic AI, and digital assets, which represent a continuation of trends from 2024. A more positive regulatory tone toward cryptocurrencies—especially stablecoins—in the US has been credited for this rebound in interest in digital assets. The report also noted some interest in quantum computing among insurers.

“Last year was exceptionally strong for fintech investment, thanks to two major take-private deals,” Dubie Cunningham, a Partner in KPMG in Canada’s Banking and Capital Markets Practice, explained. “Since then, investment activity has dropped to more stable levels. In fact, when you consider the economic shifts such as tariffs affecting global trade, investment in the first half was quite robust compared to historical levels. There’s still a lot of dry powder ready to be deployed by investors, but they are demonstrating more selective behavior than in previous years. They’re looking for quality companies and we’re seeing longer tails for maturing mid-to-large stage private equity deals.”

Coming to Canada: Atlanta’s Rainforest and Lebanon’s Whish Money

This week reminds us of how attractive Canada is to a growing number of fintechs around the world. Rainforest, a embedded payments company based in Atlanta, Georgia, announced recently that it is looking to expand to Canada. The company, founded in 2022, secured $29 million in funding in September, taking its total capital raised to $57.5 million. The idea of expanding to Canada, as Rainforest Founder and CEO Joshua Silver explained to Global Atlanta, represents more than a regional expansion for the company itself. The move would also help Rainforest’s platform client expand their offerings in a new market.

Rainforest specializes in payments partnerships with software providers that target businesses in underserved industry sectors. These software providers themselves are an underserved segment of the industry—processing $50 million to $2 billion in annual payments. Rainforest offers an embedded payments solution that enables software platforms to provide a robust payments experience for their end merchants without having to register as a payment facilitator with card networks.

Hailing from even farther away than the Peach State where Rainforest resides is Whish Money. Headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon, and regulated by the country’s central bank, Whish Money announced this week that it had secured financial services licenses in Canada. The regulatory approvals are the first for the company outside of the MENA region, and is part of a global expansion that includes entering markets in the US, the UK, the EU, and Australia.

“Securing our Canadian license is a monumental step that validates our compliant, customer-focused model and sets the foundation for our international expansion,” Whish Money board chairman Toufic Koussa said. “This move is

[TITLE]Exclusive-Nexperia cuts wafer supplies to Chinese plant, ratcheting up chip disruptions:
[TEXT]
By Che Pan and Wen-Yee Lee

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has suspended supplies of wafers to its Chinese assembly plant, according to a letter addressed to its customers that was reviewed by Reuters, which could exacerbate a supply squeeze that is worrying automakers worldwide.

The letter, which was dated October 29 and signed by Nexperia interim CEO Stefan Tilger, said the company imposed the suspension on supplies to its plant in Dongguan, in southern China's Guangdong province, on October 26, saying it was "a direct consequence of the local management's recent failure to comply with the agreed contractual payment terms."

Nexperia has been locked in a dispute with its Chinese unit after the Dutch government took control of Nexperia from its Chinese owner Wingtech Technology on September 30. It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.

Nexperia's move came after the Dutch chipmaker's Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.

LARGE VOLUMES OF CHIPS

The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70% of the Netherlands-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.

"While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable," the letter said.

"Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers."

Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem.

Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.

A spokesperson for Nexperia confirmed it sent the letter and the company could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A spokesperson for the Dutch government referred questions about the wafer shut-off to Nexperia, saying the move had been a corporate decision while state intervention "concerns the preservation of production capacity and is not aimed at the company's day-to-day operations".

[TITLE]Trump-Xi meeting: What’s at stake and who has the upper hand?:
[TEXT]
From tariffs to TikTok, rare-earth metals to fentanyl, a packed agenda awaits the leaders of the US and China, the world’s two largest economies.

United States President Donald Trump expects “a lot of problems” will be solved between Washington and Beijing when he meets China’s President Xi Jinping in South Korea for a high-stakes meeting on Thursday, amid growing trade tensions between the two.

Relations between the two world powers have been strained in recent years, with Washington and Beijing imposing tit-for-tat trade tariffs topping 100 percent against each other this year, the US restricting its exports of semiconductors vital for artificial intelligence (AI) development and Beijing restricting exports of critical rare-earth metals which are vital for the defence industry and also the development of AI, among other issues.

Officials from Washington and Beijing have been locked in trade talks since August to de-escalate trade tensions, and they also came up with a framework for a trade deal during meetings in Malaysia over the weekend.

On the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, on Wednesday, Trump said an expected trade deal between China and the US would be good for both countries and “something very exciting for everybody”.

But only a meeting between Trump and Xi can confirm if a trade deal is really in the making.

Expectations for the agreement are modest, with analysts expecting the two world powers to continue to clash over their myriad differences long-term.

When are the two leaders meeting?

Trump is scheduled to meet Xi on Thursday in the port city of Busan in southeastern South Korea. The meeting is expected to start at 11am local time (01:00 GMT).

It will be the first time the leaders have met in person since Trump returned to the White House in January.

The US president last met Xi in 2019, during Trump’s first term, on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Osaka, Japan.

“I think we’re going to have a great meeting with President Xi of China, and a lot of problems are going to be solved,” Trump told journalists on Wednesday on Air Force One while en route to South Korea.

On Wednesday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the meeting between Xi and Trump in a statement and said the leaders “will exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest”.

What will Trump and Xi talk about?

Discussions are likely to cover:

Trade tariffs

Trafficking of fentanyl, a drug responsible for tens of thousands of deaths in the US each year

China’s export controls on critical rare-earth metals and its purchase of US soya beans

US export controls on semiconductors

Geopolitical and security issues, particularly Russia’s war in Ukraine and Washington’s position on Taiwan

Port fees on Chinese ships docking in US ports

Finalising a deal to buy TikTok, the social media platform, from its Chinese owners

Alejandro Reyes, adjunct professor at the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera that at this meeting, both sides will want to steady an uneasy rivalry – but for different reasons.

“For Washington, the goal is to show that its tough line on China has delivered results. The Trump team is walking into this summit after signing trade pacts with Malaysia, Cambodia and Japan that link market access directly to national security cooperation. These deals require America’s partners to align with US export controls and supply-chain rules – essentially making ‘economic security’ a shared obligation,” he said.

“For Beijing, the priority is to project calm and endurance. The meeting comes just after the fourth plenum, which reaffirmed Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s authority and set the direction for the next five-year plan. China’s message is that it has weathered Western pressure and is back to focusing on growth and domestic stability,” he added.

But discussions on disputes over trade tariffs, critical rare-earth metals, AI technology and geopolitical strategies, the issues that most define the current relationship between the US and China, according to Reyes, are not going to be easy to resolve.

“The mistrust is structural now – it’s built into how both countries think

[TITLE]The impact of industrial digitalization on the urban-rural income gap:
[TEXT]
Abstract Along with the rapid development of the global digital economy, China is experiencing profound transformations in industrial digitization. These transformations may significantly affect the urban-rural income gap. Using panel data from 30 Chinese provinces from 2012 to 2022, this paper empirically examined the impact of industrial digitalization on the urban-rural income gap based on a fixed-effects model. The findings reveal that the development of industrial digitalization in China widens the urban-rural income gap. Mechanism analysis indicates that industrial digitalization increases software business revenue and employment in the information services sector, thereby expanding the urban-rural income gap; additionally, industrial digitalization widens the income gap between urban migrants and rural migrant populations, further increasing the overall urban-rural income disparity. Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that in the eastern region, industrial digitalization significantly enlarges the urban-rural income gap, whereas its effects are not significant in the central and western regions. The conclusions of this study provide empirical support and policy insights for China in advancing industrial digitalization and promoting common prosperity.

1 Introduction With the rapid development of digital technology, the digital economy has become a pivotal engine of global economic transformation. The digital economy grow primarily through two channels: digital industrialization and industrial digitalization (ID) [1]. As a core component of the digital economy, ID entails the deep integration of digital technologies with traditional industries [2]. It plays a vital role in improving production efficiency, promoting industrial upgrading, and driving socio-economic development [3]. ID not only influences overall economic growth but may also have a profound impact on narrowing or widening the urban-rural income gap. The urban-rural income gap is a widespread challenge faced by both developed and developing countries around the world [4]. According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2022), rural residents in many advanced economies continue to earn significantly less than urban counterparts while facing constrained access to digital services, educational resources, and quality employment opportunities [5]. In emerging countries such as India and Brazil, these disparities are frequently amplified by infrastructural deficiencies and highly informal labor market [6]. To address this global challenge, multiple nations have adopted digitalization strategies targeting urban-rural convergence. For example, India’s “Digital India” initiative seeks to improve digital infrastructure in rural areas, while mobile platforms like M-Pesa in East Africa have made notable progress in promoting financial inclusion [7]. However, the effectiveness of these initiatives varies considerably across countries, influenced by factors such as institutional environments, infrastructure quality, and labor market structures. These divergent findings necessitate further investigation into the impact of ID on income distribution across heterogeneous national contexts—notably in major emerging countries like China, where the urban-rural income gap remains pronounced. Nonetheless, these global efforts often yield mixed results and are highly contingent on specific contextual conditions. The urban-rural income gap has long been a prominent issue in China’s socio-economic development. Although China has made progress in promoting urban-rural integrated development and reducing regional disparities, imbalanced regional development continues to sustain income divides [8]. With the advancement of ID, how to leverage this emerging force to narrow the urban-rural income gap has become an urgent and critical issue. By enhancing traditional industry efficiency and promoting coordinated regional economic development, ID may offer novel ideas and approaches for solving the urban-rural income disparity [9]. Consequently, exploring the impact and mechanisms of ID on the urban-rural income gap not only holds significant theoretical importance but also provides practical evidence for policy formulation. Clarifying how ID affects income distribution across different regions and development stages will offer valuable theoretical support for further promoting urban-rural integrated development and achieving inclusive prosperity goals. With the accelerated development of digital technologies, academia has engaged in extensive and diverse discussions on their impact on the urban-rural income gap. Some studies suggest that improvements in digital infrastructure, internet penetration, and digital financial coverage are enhancing rural economic vitality by elevating rural human capital and income levels, thereby narrowing the urban-rural income gap to some extent [10–14]. However, another series of studies points out that the early benefits of digital technologies usually prioritize urban residents, particularly those with higher technical literacy and resource accessibility-thus exacerbating the urban-rural income gap [15,16]. Intelligent and automated technologies significantly raise wage growth rates for highly skilled workers, who are more concentrated in urban areas, thereby expanding regional income inequality [17,18]. Furthermore, some scholars propose a “U-shaped” effect: digital technologies initially widen the urban-rural gap, but as their penetration deepens in rural areas, the gap may gradually narrow [19,20]. It is noteworthy that inconsistencies in existing research findings largely stem from differing interpretations and definitions of the broad concept of “digital technology.” As digital technology spans multiple dimensions, researchers have approached the topic from varying perspectives and adopted diverse measurement frameworks. Most current studies focus on digital infrastructure, financial inclusion, and individual-level digital skills, examining how these factors influence the evolution of the urban-rural income gap by enhancing rural economic capacity, improving access to financial services, and strengthening human capital accumulation. In contrast, systematic research from the perspective of “industrial digitalization” remains limited. As a key manifestation of the deep integration of technological progress into the economic system, ID provides a novel analytical framework for understanding urban-rural income disparities. Therefore, this paper seeks to fill this gap by systematically examining the impact of ID on the urban-rural income gap. This paper systematically examines the impact of ID on the urban-rural income gap from the perspective of ID. Through mechanism analysis and empirical testing, this study identifies two key channels: the development of software and information technology services, and the income gap between agricultural migrants and urban migrant populations. It further reveals how ID might intensify urban-rural income differentiation by increasing the concentration of high-end service industries and widening income disparities among migrant populations. Meanwhile, this paper conducts heterogeneity analysis across eastern, central, and western regions, comparing policy environments and structural conditions in different regions during the digital industry development process, aiming to expand theoretical explanations and empirical evidence for urban-rural income distribution issues within the context of the digital economy. The main contributions of this study are threefold. First, regarding theoretical mechanisms, this paper explores how ID affects the urban-rural income gap, particularly through two pathways: the development of the software and information technology services industry and income disparities among migrant populations. The research shows that ID, by promoting software and information technology services, increases employment in the information services sector and raises software business revenue. Urban residents benefit more due to their educational and skill advantages, while rural residents benefit less, further widening the urban-rural income gap. Additionally, ID exacerbates the income gap between agricultural migrants and urban migrants, further enlarging the urban-rural income disparity. Second, from the empirical analysis perspective, this paper uses panel data from 30 Chinese provinces between 2012 and 2022 and employs a fixed-effects model to empirically examine the relationship between ID and the urban-rural income gap. The results indicate that ID significantly widens the urban-rural income gap. Finally, in terms of heterogeneity analysis, this study compares impacts across different regions and finds that, in the eastern region, due to the advantages of digital infrastructure, the advancement of ID significantly widens the urban-rural income gap. In contrast, in the central and western regions, the impact of ID on the urban-rural income gap is insignificant because of relatively lower digital development levels. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant literature and proposes research hypotheses; Section 3 introduces the research design, including variable definitions, data sources, and model specifications; Section 4 presents the empirical analysis verifying the impact of ID on the urban-rural income gap; Section 5 discusses the mechanisms involved, identifying the transmission paths through the information services industry and income disparities among migrant populations; and Section 6 summarizes research conclusions, proposes policy recommendations, and discusses research limitations.

2 Theoretical analysis and research hypotheses The wave of ID has created unprecedented opportunities for modern society, fundamentally altering traditional industry operation modes and giving rise to many new economic forms and service models [21]. However, this process has not progressed uniformly across all regions; significant developmental imbalances between urban and rural areas have emerged due to existing divides [22]. This imbalance is particularly evident in infrastructure construction, technological resource accessibility, and human resource allocation, which together result in a notable widening of the urban-rural income gap. Urban areas, as central hubs of economic activities and technological innovation, are well-developed with digital infrastructures such as Internet facilities, high-speed broadband networks, and data centers, providing strong support for urban manufacturing, service industries, and other sectors [23]. By incorporating cutting-edge technologies such as big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, urban enterprises can optimize their production processes, enhance product and service quality, and explore emerging markets like e-Commerce and sharing economy [24]. These advancements not only enhance the competitiveness of enterprises, but also create more high-skilled, high-paying jobs opportunities for urban residents, thereby raising overall income levels. In contrast, rural areas, often geographically remote and economically less developed, frequently face inadequate digital infrastructure [25]. High-speed Internet access is not yet fully available in many rural areas, and the application of information and communication technologies remains relatively limited, restricting opportunities for agricultural and other traditional industries to transition toward intelligence and automation. Due to insufficient technological support, rural industries struggle to align precisely with market demands, limiting improvements in the added value of their products. Moreover, rural education and training systems have lagged digital trends, resulting in local labor forces lacking essential new skills and impeding their participation in higher-level economic activities. With advancements in digital technologies, especially the application of emerging technologies such as the Internet, big data, and artificial intelligence, significant transformations have occurred in agricultural production and non-agricultural employment sectors [26]. For individuals who can effectively utilize these technologies, unprecedented opportunities have arisen to enhance productivity, optimize resource allocation, and access new markets. However, the benefits of these technologies are not evenly distributed. Urban residents typically have better access to educational resources and technical training, enabling them to better adapt to new technologies and occupy the high-value-added jobs resulting from digital transformation. Conversely, rural areas, with lower educational attainment and technological adoption levels, see residents predominantly engaged in low-skilled, low-paid employment when participating in non-agricultural jobs. Even when rural residents attempt to improve household income through non-agriculture employment, they face higher search costs and risks compared to their urban counterparts. More importantly, the existence of a “secondary digital divide”, referring to disparities between urban and rural residents in their ability to apply digital technologies, not only prevents rural residents from fully benefiting from ID, but also potentially leads to a “Matthew effect”, where the strong get stronger, the weak get weaker. Over time, this gap may self-reinforce, continuously widening wage disparities between high-skilled and low-skilled workers, ultimately exacerbating the urban-rural income gap. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: H1: The development of industrial digitalization in China expands the urban-rural income gap. The software and information technology services industry refers to activities involving processing and providing information services through technologies such as computers. It mainly includes software development, information systems integration services, information technology consulting services, data processing and storage, integrated circuit design, and other IT services [27]. With the accelerated advancement of ID, enterprises in traditional industries increasingly rely on digital technologies to pursue higher efficiency and competitiveness, significantly influencing the software and information technology services industry. On one hand, it has created substantial new demands, such as intelligent manufacturing and supply chain optimization solutions for manufacturing industries; on the other hand, it has driven technological innovation and the transformation of service models. Service providers must continuously launch more intelligent and customized products, gradually shifting from traditional software sales to cloud-based services and subscription models, emphasizing user experience and service quality [28]. The development of the software and information technology services industry exacerbates urban-rural income disparities [29]. As more enterprises adopt digital solutions, the industry not only expands its scope of services, but also significantly improves quality through high-end technical services like cloud computing, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence, thereby achieving remarkable income growth. As a knowledge-intensive industry, the software and information technology services sector set high entry barriers, requiring practitioners to possess substantial educational backgrounds and technical skills, including but not limited to professional IT training, higher education attainment, and familiarity with the latest digital tools and platforms. Urban areas, typically offering superior educational resources, more vocational training opportunities, and more developed digital infrastructure, enable urban residents to more readily acquire qualifications and skills necessary for the IT services sector. Consequently, the growth of this industry disproportionately benefits urban populations who are already economically advantaged, enhancing their salaries and employment prospects. Additionally, the industry’s development is accompanied by automation and intelligent technologies, further reducing simple repetitive tasks. Traditionally, migrant workers, concentrated in labor-intensive sectors like manufacturing, construction, and low-end services, perform many repetitive jobs. However, advances in software algorithms, robotic process automation (RPA), and other intelligent technologies increasingly replace such jobs [30]. Migrant workers lacking essential retraining and reeducation opportunities lose critical income sources and struggle to transition quickly to high-value-added service positions. Conversely, well-educated urban workers adapt more rapidly to emerging job demands and benefit from the growth in the information services industry. This asymmetric employment restructuring directly exacerbates income inequalities between urban and rural areas. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: H2: Industrial digitalization expands the urban-rural income gap by promoting the development of software and information technology services industry, increasing software business income and employment in IT services. Within urban-rural factors flow, changes in migrant population income structures constitute a critical mechanism for understanding income disparities. Particularly amid deepening ID, the economic status and income levels of migrant populations are significantly affected. Migrant populations primarily include agricultural migrant workers and urban migrants, with fundamental differences in human capital characteristics, employment structures, and social integration [31]. Agricultural migrants refer to individuals holding rural household registration who migrate to cities for employment. They generally have lower educational attainment, inadequate skills training, and limited social resources, typically engaging in low-value-added, labor-intensive sectors within urban labor markets. Facing digital transformation, agricultural migrants often struggle to adapt to new skill requirements imposed by the digital economy, limiting their income growth potential. As urban digital industries expand rapidly, income levels of highly skilled, well-educated groups rise sharply, marginalizing agricultural migrants due to their skill disadvantages. This income disparity reduces their opportunities for economic improvement, exacerbating urban-rural income gaps. Urban migrants, who typically hold urban household registration and migrate within or across cities, usually possess higher educational levels and stronger skills, adapting more readily to digital economic demands. However, given continuously rising skill requirements in digital sectors, income growth among urban migrants still faces challenges. Although less severely impacted than agricultural migrants, they have not yet substantially benefited from digitalization in the short term [32]. Thus, the income enhancement effect of ID on urban migrants may be relatively limited. ID suppresses income growth for agricultural migrants without significantly increasing urban migrants’ income levels, further exacerbating urban-rural income disparities. Based on the above theoretical analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed: H3: Industrial digitalization expands the urban-rural income gap by reducing the income levels of agricultural migrants without significantly affecting urban migrant incomes. Based on geographical location and economic development levels, this study divides the 30 provinces of China into three regions: eastern, central, and western. In the economically advanced eastern region, the urban-rural income gap tends to widen as the level of ID increases. This region boasts relatively well-developed digital infrastructure and technological resources, along with close connections between urban and rural areas. As ID advances, urban areas are more capable of adopting and leveraging new technologies quickly, thereby creating more high value-added employment opportunities and accelerating urban economic growth [33]. In contrast, rural areas often lag in digital adoption, which exacerbates income disparities between urban and rural residents. Therefore, in the eastern region, where development is relatively high, ID significantly widens the urban-rural income gap. In the central region, although recent years have seen improvements in digital infrastructure driven by policy support and investment, the industrial structure still largely relies on traditional manufacturing and basic service industries. The penetration of digital technologies into core industries remains limited, constraining the role of ID in promoting economic growth and employment restructuring. Additionally, rural areas in the central region still lag in digital skills and information technology application capabilities. As a result, differences in the ability of urban and rural residents to benefit from the digital economy have not significantly widened. The limited employment and income gains driven by digitalization are mainly concentrated in a few urban core areas. Consequently, ID has not yet had a significant effect on the urban-rural income gap in the central region, which is reflected in the regression results as a statistically insignificant relationship. In the western region, ID is constrained by complex geographical conditions and a weak economic foundation. The level of digital infrastructure construction is generally low, and the pace of digital transformation lags markedly [34]. At present, ID in the western region is mostly concentrated in a few medium and large cities, while rural areas still face significant shortcomings in infrastructure, educational resources, and technology application. As a result, widespread adoption and deep integration of ID in rural areas remain difficult. Moreover, because both urban and rural areas in the west generally start from a low base in terms of digital development, the limited digital progress to date has not been sufficient to significantly alter the overall urban-rural income structure. Therefore, at the current stage, the impact of ID on the urban-rural income gap in the western region is not yet apparent, and the regression results reflect this insignificance. Based on the above theoretical analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed: H4: In China’s eastern region, ID significantly widens the urban-rural income gap, whereas in the central and western regions, its impact on the urban-rural income gap is not significant.

3 Methods and data This chapter mainly introduces the research methods and data used in this study, focusing on three aspects: model specification, variable definition, and data sources. It aims to clarify the technical approach and data foundation upon which the empirical analysis is based, thereby laying the methodological groundwork for the subsequent regression analysis and mechanism testing. 3.1 Modeling specification To determine the appropriate model specification, this study conducted a Hausman test. The test result (P = 0.0563) rejected the null hypothesis of the random effects model. Therefore, the fixed effects model was selected as the baseline regression method to investigate the impact of ID on the urban-rural income gap. This model controls both time-invariant regional characteristics and region-invariant temporal characteristics, effectively reducing omitted variable bias and improving the robustness of the estimation results. The specific model is set as follows: (1) Where denotes the urban-rural income gap; is the level of ID; is a vector of control variables, including the degree of openness to the outside world ( ), the intensity of fiscal support ( ), R&D intensity ( ), level of social consumption ( ), level of economic development ( ), level of education ( ), and population mobility trends ( ). and represent the individual provinces and the year, respectively; is the coefficient of the level of ID; and is a vector of coefficients for the series of control variables. and are the coefficient of ID level. is the random error term that follows a normal distribution. 3.2 Selection of variables 3.2.1 Dependent variable: Urban-rural income gap. Common indicators for measuring the urban-rural income gap include the Gini coefficient, Theil index, and the ratio of per capita disposable income between urban and rural residents. The Gini coefficient is an internationally recognized tool for measuring overall income inequality and can effectively reflect the distribution of social income. However, it mainly focuses on general income distribution and lacks the capacity to distinguish structural income disparities between urban and rural areas. The ratio of per capita disposable income between urban and rural residents is simple to compute and intuitively reflects the direct income gap between the two groups, but it fails to fully account for differences in population structure. In contrast, the Theil index not only measures overall income disparity but also decomposes the total disparity into within-group and between-group differences. It effectively considers the dual heterogeneity of income levels and population size, offering strong decomposability and dynamic analytical capabilities. As such, it can more accurately capture the changing characteristics of the urban-rural income gap [35]. Therefore, this study adopts the Theil index as the primary indicator for measuring the urban-rural income gap, aiming to enhance the scientific rigor and explanatory power of the analysis. The formula for calculating the Theil index is: (2) In this study, denotes the income of urban residents in year , and represents the income of rural residents in year . The variable refers to the ratio of total income between urban and rural residents, while represents the ratio of their total population. A higher Theil index indicates a greater disparity in income between urban and rural areas. For robustness testing, the urban-rural income ratio is employed as an alternative explanatory variable. 3.2.2 Core explanatory variable: Industrial digitalization. In June 2020, the Department of Informatization and Industrial Development of the State Information Center of China officially defined the concept of “industrial digitalization” for the first time, proposing a framework based on information networks as the foundation, data resources as the key element, and scenario applications as the core. Despite growing academic interest, there is still no universally accepted standard for measuring ID. Some researchers adopt single indicators such as the digital penetration rates of the three major industries published by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, or the number of industrial robots, to proxy digitalization. However, due to the multi-faceted nature of ID, relying on single-dimensional indicators often leads to measurement bias. Composite indicator systems, which can capture ID from multiple angles, have become a mainstream method in recent years. At the industrial level, studies commonly start from secondary indicators such as direct consumption coefficients and complete dependency ratios to estimate digital input intensity. At the regional level, particularly in provincial studies, researchers generally adopt multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks, considering factors such as digital talent, digital investment, digital output, and digital infrastructure. Drawing upon prior research and considering data availability and measurability, this paper constructs a comprehensive evaluation system based on four primary dimensions: digital infrastructure, digital talent, digital investment, and digital output, with a total of 12 secondary indicators used for measurement [36] (see Table 1).

ID evaluation indicator system. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335065.t001 Among these dimensions, digital infrastructure reflects the regional allocation of digital resources and the extent of network coverage, serving as the foundational condition for digital transformation. Digital talent captures the stock and quality of human capital that supports the digital transformation of industries, focusing on the availability of information technology professionals and related technical personnel. Digital investment represents the financial and labor resources that a region allocates to research and development as well as innovation, reflecting the intensity and sustainability of its digital transformation efforts. Finally, digital output refers to the economic returns generated through digital economic activities, highlighting the productivity improvements and value creation brought
