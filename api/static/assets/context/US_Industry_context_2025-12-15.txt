[TITLE]Johnvents, Ondo reaffirm investment in agribusiness, manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Johnvents Group has reaffirmed its commitment to deepening partnerships, investing in capacity, and building industries that will accelerate Nigeria’s economic transformation and boost Africa’s global competitiveness.

The resolve came as the Ondo State Government restated its ambition to position the state as a competitive hub for agribusiness, manufacturing, technology, and energy.

According to a statement, the Johnvents Group’s leadership gave the assurance during the company’s 2025 End-of-Year Celebration held at The Dome, Akure, where industry leaders, international partners, traditional rulers, including the Deji of Akure, and senior government officials gathered to review what the firm described as “a transformative year.”

Delivering the welcome address, Group Executive Director of Johnvents, Tarun Chawla, stated that the organisation had strengthened its operations and expanded its global presence. He noted that the company’s growth was made possible by a supportive business environment provided by the Ondo State Government.

He said, “This year reshaped us as a business. We strengthened our operations, expanded our relevance, and demonstrated what a committed team can achieve when purpose and discipline align. The stability and clarity your administration provides form the foundation on which organisations like ours continue to grow and innovate.”

Chawla appreciated the confidence of partners such as British International Investment, the International Finance Corporation, AFRIEXIM Bank, and other financial institutions in the Group’s long-term vision. He said Johnvents had now become “a global value-chain participant with investments and collaborations spanning Africa, the UAE, Asia, and Europe.”

In his keynote address, the Executive Governor of Ondo State, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, described Johnvents Group as a model of how homegrown enterprises can become global powerhouses without losing touch with their host communities.

Aiyedatiwa noted: “Johnvents stands today as a monument to what focused investment and structured institutional support can achieve. With over ten factories, more than 1,500 direct employees, thousands of benefiting households and an ecosystem of over 5,000 farmers, Johnvents is living proof that prosperity becomes inevitable when ingenuity meets institutional support.”

He listed reforms in ease of doing business, digitisation of government processes, security enhancement, infrastructure expansion, and the work of the Ondo State Development and Investment Promotion Agency as critical pillars of the state’s strategy to strengthen private-sector competitiveness.

The governor noted that the success of companies like Johnvents aligns with the administration’s vision of an inclusive, opportunity-driven economy. “The Johnvents story assures every investor here and across the world that Ondo State is ready for investment, ready for expansion and ready for global competitiveness,” he emphasised.

The event also celebrated the resilience of Johnvents’ workforce and the company’s widening contributions to community development, including education, youth empowerment and agribusiness initiatives.

Johnvents added that it is committed to partnering with local and global institutions, scaling capacity, and building industries that deliver value across Nigeria’s agricultural and manufacturing value chains.

The Group operates seven businesses, including Johnvents Cocoa Factory, Johnvents Trading, Johnvents Foods, Johnvents Industries DMCC, Johnvents Farms, Premium Cocoa Product (Ile-Oluji), and Haven Hauling, spanning production, processing, manufacturing, and trade of commodities and food products in Nigeria and other regions.

Transportation Secretary Duffy Launches “Make Travel Family Friendly Again” Campaign, Announces $1B in Funding to Support Initiative

Posted on by Miami Rebel

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy today launched his “Make Travel Family Friendly Again” campaign ahead of a busy holiday travel season. The goal of the campaign is to address a common refrain from the public – it can be challenging to travel as a family. From needing more dedicated spaces for young children and exercise equipment, to finding places for mothers to nurse their children, to staying fit on the go, or struggling to find more healthy food options, the Trump Administration is committed to making every stage of the travel journey more seamless.

To improve families’ experiences in airport terminals, Secretary Duffy announced $1 billion in funding to incentivize more family-friendly resources in airport terminals. This can include:

Creating more children’s play areas or exercise areas Adding mothers’ rooms or nursing pods Reconfiguring security checkpoints to create family screening lanes Building sensory rooms for children with special needs Other creative terminal projects that focus on enhancing the family travel journey As part of the campaign launch, Secretary Duffy was joined by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr. Paul Saladino, a double board-certified Physician Nutrition Specialist, Isabel Brown, a content creator and young mom, and Luke Saunders, the CEO and Founder of Farmer’s Fridge.

In addition to the federal funding USDOT is providing to enhance physical infrastructure, the group also emphasized the administration’s interest in collaborating with airports and private sector partners to improve access to nutritional food options.

[TITLE]Kennedy Wilson, Affinius Provide $384M Construction Financing Package for Jersey City Multifamily Project – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
New Jersey developer Panepinto Properties has landed a $384 million financing package to develop the first building in its two-tower multifamily project on the Jersey City waterfront, Commercial Observer can first report.

Kennedy Wilson provided a $306 million senior loan, while Affinius Capital supplied $78 million of preferred equity for the planned 678-unit Harborside 8 project.

“We are proud to play a role in bringing this high-impact multifamily project to fruition in Jersey City, which continues to experience low vacancy levels and consistent rent growth,” Thomas Whitesell, head of Kennedy Wilson’s debt investment group, said in a statement.

The property is scheduled for completion in 2028. Units in Harborside 8 will have views of the Hudson River and Manhattan skyline, and amenities will include a rooftop terrace, a pool, a fitness center and coworking spaces.

“Harborside 8 will address the significant demand for premium multifamily housing in one of the region’s most dynamic and fastest-growing markets,” David Greenburg, Affinius Capital’s co-head of credit originations, said in a release. “Panepinto Properties brings proven execution capabilities and extensive New Jersey market knowledge, critical advantages for a development of this scale in Jersey City.”

Panepinto Properties, led by founder and CEO Joseph A. Panepinto Sr., acquired the development site that will be utilized for Penepinto’s Harborside 8 and Harborside 9 projects from Veris Residential — formerly Mack-Cali Realty — for $75 million, Real Estate NJ reported. Veris has been busy divesting properties, also recently selling The James in Park Ridge, according to NJ Biz.

The towers will have a combined 1,267 units. Harborside 8 will reach 65 stories and comprise 678 rental units, 8,578 square feet of retail space, a 350-space parking garage and a 40,000-square-foot public park along the Hudson River, according to Real Estate NJ.

JLL’s Tom Didio negotiated the financing.

[TITLE]Kawa Capital Provides $79M Construction Loan for Boston-Area Life Sciences Project – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, a Boston-area developer specializing in transportation projects, has secured $79.3 million to build The Bolt, a 180,000-square-foot life sciences lab, office and manufacturing complex in Woburn, Mass., a suburb 10 miles outside Boston.

Kawa Capital Management provided the construction financing for a project that is expected to require a total of $125 million of investment capital. Aries Capital served as the capital markets advisor on the transaction.

Jeremy Lash, director at Kawa Capital Management, described The Bolt in a statement as a “high-quality asset” in a popular market near Boston.

“We are confident The Bolt will draw interest from energy, manufacturing, life sciences and technology companies looking for prime space in an optimal location,” he said.

Located at 216 New Boston Street in Woburn — which has become a minor hub for life sciences development in recent years — The Bolt is part of a larger $400 million investment project by Cabot, Cabot & Forbes.

These other projects include the development of Emblem 120, a 289-unit luxury multifamily complex with ground-floor retail, and Zero New Boston, a planned building that would bring 250 apartments and 1,200 square feet of retail to Woburn.

In a statement, Daniel Nagler, chief investment officer at Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, called Woburn “an ideal location,” noting that the suburb is accessible from both Boston and Cambridge via two highways and a commuter rail station, positioning it as a regional destination for life sciences and other CRE development.

“We believe it will continue to attract innovative companies, and it is why we are so bullish on the location,” Nagler added.

The Bolt is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2027.

[TITLE]Goldman Sachs Is Bullish On The Boeing Company (BA):
[TEXT]
The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is among the 12 Best Performing Dow Stocks in 2025.

Goldman Sachs Is Bullish On The Boeing Company (BA)

On December 9, 2025, TheFly reported that Goldman Sachs kept a Buy rating and a $257 price target on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). This came after Goldman Sachs reviewed the company’s monthly delivery figures. The firm pointed out that The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)’s aircraft order inventory is still substantial in comparison to supply and that November gross orders were solid, extending year-to-date momentum. According to the company, a multi-year rise in deliveries across all aircraft platforms is supported by the backlog.

On the same day, Reuters reported that The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) had only delivered 44 in November, down from 53 in October, and was falling behind European rival Airbus, which delivered 72 planes. Deliveries included six 787s, two 777 freighters, four 767s, and 32 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, five of which were delivered to Southwest Airlines. In November, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) reported 164 new orders, 126 net new orders, and 38 cancellations. There were 74 orders for the 777X, including 65 from Emirates and 9 from China Airlines. Furthermore, the business received 30 orders from undisclosed customers for the 787 and 43 orders for the 737 MAX. Five 737 MAX orders from Comair, four 787 orders from Air Canada, and fifteen 777X orders from Etihad were cancelled. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) delivered 537 aircraft through November 30, booked 1,000 new orders, with 908 net after cancellations, and had a 6,019 order backlog at the conclusion of the month.

Jay Malave, the chief financial officer of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), stated last week that the business anticipates positive cash flow in 2026 as a result of growing jet deliveries.

The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is a key aerospace and defense company that operates in three segments: commercial aircraft; defense, space, and security; and global services.

While we acknowledge the potential of BA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
