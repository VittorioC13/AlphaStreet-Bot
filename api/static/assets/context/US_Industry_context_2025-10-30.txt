[TITLE]Aeluma Acquires Significant Capital Equipment Assets to Accelerate Manufacturing Readiness:
[TEXT]
GOLETA, Calif., Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aeluma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALMU), a semiconductor company specializing in high-performance, scalable technologies for mobile, AI, defense and aerospace, robotics, automotive, AR/VR, and quantum computing, today announced that it has acquired significant capital equipment assets from a major components and solutions supplier to expand its prototyping and wafer-scale test capabilities. This investment supports Aeluma’s go-to-market plan and will help qualify manufacturing processes for key target markets.

“This asset acquisition is a prime example of Aeluma’s commitment to accelerating growth while maintaining disciplined capital management,” said Jonathan Klamkin, Ph.D., Founder and CEO of Aeluma. “We acquired key equipment at minimal cost, enabling a rapid expansion of our in-house prototyping and wafer-scale testing. I want to thank our team for identifying and negotiating this strategic acquisition, which circumvented the typical long lead times and high costs of new equipment.”

The state-of-the-art resources acquired include automated and semi-automated wafer probers, backend packaging and prototyping equipment, test and validation instruments, and facility infrastructure. The enhanced in-house capabilities are critical to complement Aeluma’s outsourced wafer fabrication and shorten the path to market as the company advances its strategic priorities pursuing commercial revenue across defense and aerospace, data center interconnects, mobile and consumer electronics.

Mumbai: Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research expects Aditya Birla Capital to emerge as a strong candidate for the MSCI index in the February 2026 review, following a block deal by Advent International's affiliate, Jomei Investments, on Tuesday. Jomei sold its entire 2.04% stake in the company at around ₹308 per share in block deals worth ₹1,639 crore on both the exchanges, a move that will lift the stock's free float and improve its eligibility for index inclusion.An MSCI inclusion could lead to potential inflows of around $230 million, said Nuvama Alternative's Abhilash Pagaria."At around ₹305-310, the stock becomes a strong contender for MSCI inclusion in the February 2026 review," he said. "The stock remains a good tactical play, with room to gradually move towards the ₹340." Aditya Birla Capital shares rose 0.6% to close at ₹312.45 on Tuesday. So far this year, the stock has gained nearly 75%.

[TITLE]Mobility startup Tsuyo Manufacturing raises $4.5 million in round led by Avaana Capital:
[TEXT]
Mobility startup Tsuyo Manufacturing has raised $4.5 million in a funding round led by early-stage investment firm Avaana Capital The company will utilise the funds to build a new greenfield manufacturing facility, set up a research and development (R&D) centre, and expand its export operations and partnerships with automakers across Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea, and Europe.“EV is a relatively new domain, and the industry has only recently evolved. In fact, (only) over the last four to five years, people have started taking it seriously. Government incentives, schemes, and policies are also being introduced in a big way,” founder and chief executive Vijay Kumar told ET.Founded in 2020, the New Delhi-based company designs and manufactures core systems that power electric vehicles (EVs) — including motors and controllers used in three- and four-wheelers, trucks, buses, and off-road vehicles, such as mining dump trucks, forklifts, and electric tractors. It supplies these components to automakers, like Mahindra , Volvo, Eicher , and Sonalika.Currently, it has two operational units in Greater Noida.The company has supplied 1.5 lakh powertrain units so far. It has filed four patents, and 25 more are in the pipeline, including for motors that use hybrid magnets and do not rely on rare-earth materials.According to Kumar, the company does not cater to the two-wheeler segment because 99% of scooters and their components are imported by China. “These are traders’ markets, and the technology is largely commodity-based, so there isn’t much scope for differentiation.”The company’s revenue has grown by 10x in five years, he said.“In terms of production capacity as well, compared to when we started, the annual production we achieved last year was almost seven to eight times higher,” he added.Currently, India accounts for 95% of its revenue.Commenting on the investment, Vikas Verma, venture partner at Avaana Capital, said, “Their vertically integrated powertrain, critical for electrification across automotive and industrial applications, exemplifies indigenous, scalable innovation that will define India’s role in building globally resilient supply chains and reducing reliance on rare earth mineral-based technologies.”

Karoline Leavitt Calls Indian Trucker Illegal Alien After Deadly California Road Accident Kill Three

US transportation secretary Sean Duffy warned Sunday that he is about make good on a threat to revoke millions in federal funds for California because he says the state is illegally issuing commercial driver's licenses to non-citizens.In an appearance on Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures," Duffy said governor Gavin Newsom has refused to comply with department of transportation rules that require the state to stop issuing such licenses and review those already issued. His statement came after investigations into two recent fatal crashes involving Sikh drivers showed widespread malpractice in issuance of commercial driving licences (CDLs)."So, one, I'm about to pull $160 million from California," Duffy said. "And, as we pull more money, we also have the option of pulling California's ability to issue commercial driver's licenses."Eva Spiegel, a spokesperson for California's department of motor vehicles, said the Trump administration "has no legitimate basis" to withhold federal highway transportation funds. "The federal govt previously allowed commercial driver's licences for asylum seekers and refugees and on Sept 26 announced emergency regulations to cease this practice that went into effect on Sept 29.California is in compliance with these regulations and will remain in compliance with federal law. "When Duffy threatened to revoke funds last month, a spokesperson for Newsom dismissed the attack and noted that CDL holders from California have a significantly lower rate of crashes than both the national average and that of Texas, which is the only state with more licenced commercial drivers.Duffy said California has unlawfully issued tens of thousands of these licences to non-citizens. Duffy said earlier he would withhold $40 million from California as it is failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers. agencies

[TITLE]TSMC begins construction of Kumamoto second fab with $13.9 billion investment · TechNode:
[TEXT]
TSMC’s Japanese subsidiary, JASM, has signed a contract with the government of Kikuyō Town in Kumamoto Prefecture to build its second wafer fabrication plant, which marks the start of construction. The new plant involves a total investment of around $13.9 billion and will focus on 6-nanometer chips for cutting-edge applications such as autonomous driving and artificial intelligence, with production expected to begin by the end of 2027. The second plant is located east of the first plant, covering 69,000 square meters, and will create 1,700 new jobs. Together with the first plant, the two fabs will employ more than 3,400 people. The Japanese government is providing a subsidy of 1.2 trillion yen ($7.8 billion) for the two plants to support the domestic semiconductor industry. This project will upgrade Japan’s chip technology from 28 nanometers directly to 6 nanometers. [Icsmart, in Chinese]

Iran, Russia to sign key deal on construction of Rasht-Astara railway next month: Minister

Iran Press TV

Monday, 27 October 2025 6:12 AM

Iran's Minister of Roads and Urban Development Farzaneh Sadeq says Iran and Russia are to sign a long-anticipated agreement on the construction of the Rasht-Astara railway.

Sadeq said on Sunday that the agreement will be signed next month, marking a major step in advancing the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC).

The 162-kilometer strategic transport corridor is expected to facilitate freight and cargo transit between Iran, Russia, and Azerbaijan.

On October 2, Iran and Russia started officially to implement a 20-year Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty, signed by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Moscow on January 17, 2025.

The deal signaled a significant step towards deepening bilateral ties between the two countries in various fields.

The minister noted that she paid visits to Azerbaijan and Pakistan over the past two weeks in line with Iran's active diplomacy to promote interactions with the neighboring countries, particularly through the key role of transportation in regional interaction.

Sadeq said her recent talks in Baku on transit guarantees, particularly in the Rasht-Astara railway project, were well beyond initial expectations.

She further noted that her recent talks in Pakistan centered on establishing a connection between Pakistan and Eurasian and Caucasian countries via Iran, and a connection between China and Iran through Pakistan and transportation of goods from China to Iran and finally to Europe via Pakistan.

The minister said that transport infrastructure plays a role in the development of regional relations, adding, "The expansion of highways and railway infrastructure can play an effective role in facilitating Iran's relations with neighboring countries," she emphasized.

She said restrictions and tough sanctions have failed to hinder development projects over the past year.

[TITLE]Australian company Hypersonix secures major defence and aerospace investment for green hydrogen hypersonic flight:

Australian company Hypersonix secures major defence and aerospace investment for green hydrogen hypersonic flight

by Simon Mansfield

Sydney, Australia (SPX) Oct 28, 2025

Hypersonix Launch Systems, based in Brisbane, recently completed a $46 million Series A funding round led by High Tor Capital of the UK, with support from Saab and RKKVC, as well as participation by the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation (NRFC) and Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC). The investment will accelerate the development of reusable hydrogen-powered hypersonic aircraft designed for defence and aerospace missions. Hypersonix employs 45 specialists in engineering, manufacturing, and testing.

The Series A round marks NRFC's first investment in the defence sector and aims to strengthen domestic capability in hypersonic and counter-hypersonic technologies for Australia and allied nations. QIC Ventures described the company's technology as a significant advancement for allies requiring faster, more frequent flight capability through hydrogen propulsion.

Founded in 2019, Hypersonix develops flight systems powered by green hydrogen. Its SPARTAN scramjet engine, which reaches Mach 12 and has no moving parts, was invented by co-founder Dr Michael Smart. Unlike kerosene-fuelled engines, SPARTAN eliminates CO2 emissions and reduces maintenance by relying on hydrogen fuel. Dr Smart emphasized the importance of building clean and reusable aerospace platforms with applications in real operational environments, while co-founder David Waterhouse stated the capital raise marks a pivotal moment for Australian aerospace development.

CEO Matt Hill highlighted that this funding supports both national and allied defence priorities and enables Hypersonix to launch the world's first hydrogen-powered hypersonic aircraft. Chairman Arthur Sinodinos, former US Ambassador and Australian Minister, said the investment demonstrates support for local leadership in next-generation aerospace and sovereign industrial capability.

Proceeds from the round will fund a NASA-backed test flight of the DART AE vehicle, powered by SPARTAN, with operations under the US Department of Defense HyCAT program via the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). Hypersonix was selected as the first contract for HyCAT from a pool of more than 60 companies. The project aims to demonstrate the world's first sustained hypersonic flight using green hydrogen.

Additional funds will build advanced manufacturing facilities in Queensland and advance development of VISR, an 8-metre-long, reusable hydrogen-fuelled aircraft equipped with four SPARTAN engines and ceramic matrix composites for sustained hypersonic flight, supporting intelligence, surveillance, rapid delivery, and space system testing.
