Oracle 's historic stock surge this week marked the latest chapter in the story of a single private company that's dominated the tech landscape for almost three years: OpenAI. In Oracle's blowout earnings report, OpenAI was a key catalyst due to a massive amount of money the artificial intelligence startup expects to spend on cloud computing technology in the coming years. It's becoming a familiar theme. A week earlier, Broadcom shares popped almost 10% after the chipmaker and software vendor said it forged a $10 billion deal to build custom processors for a customer that analysts said was OpenAI. Among tech's megacaps, Microsoft has the closest link to OpenAI, having invested more than $13 billion in the company and serving as its key cloud partner for six years. Nvidia's march to becoming the world's most valuable company is intimately tied to OpenAI, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) sit at the heart of large language model development and are essential for running big AI workloads. Those four companies alone — Oracle, Broadcom, Microsoft and Nvidia — have seen their combined market caps swell by over $4.5 trillion since OpenAI burst into public view with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. And those gains are a big reason why the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have sustained sharp rallies, with both benchmarks closing at a record on Friday. OpenAI's outsized influence has some market experts understandably concerned. It remains a cash-burning startup that's governed by a nonprofit parent.

The company's $500 billion valuation is supported by a small number of investors betting that OpenAI will prevail in the face of hefty competition from the likes of Meta and Google as well as other highly-valued newcomers like Anthropic and any number of players out of China. "While we love ChatGPT, OpenAI is still a not for profit limited in its ability to raise capital," said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview with CNBC. Luria, who recommends holding Oracle shares, dug into the company's numbers as the stock was in the midst of a 36% jump on Wednesday, its biggest gain since 1992. In its quarterly earnings report late Tuesday, Oracle said it signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers during the period. One of those was with OpenAI, which said previously that it agreed to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity with Oracle. Investors knew, based on a filing with the SEC in June, that Oracle signed a $30 billion cloud contract with an unnamed company that's set to begin in two years. CNBC confirmed a Wall Street Journal report from Wednesday that OpenAI has agreed to spend $300 billion in computing power over

[TITLE]IBM's head of venture capital shares the 5 'pillars' she considers when deciding to back a startup:

Emily Fontaine engages with VC firms, startups, and portfolio companies every day, she told Business Insider, and she knows what she wants from them.

As IBM's global head of venture capital, Fontaine leads IBM Ventures, which partners with companies working on everything from quantum computing to artificial intelligence to cybersecurity. She said she wants to connect with 800 startups worldwide this year.

"We've got a really good formula for that," Fontaine said on how she decides whether to invest. "Our mission is super clear: accelerate enterprise innovation with emerging technologies that are delivering real business value."

Fontaine said she evaluates investments based on "five key pillars."

Strategic fit

As the head of a corporate ventures arm, Fontaine said it's important to back startups that align with IBM's broader goals.

"We want to back companies with a differentiated vision that's aligned to major trends and IBM's long-term strategy," she told Business Insider.

While once known as a hardware giant, IBM has recently started focusing on AI and hybrid cloud. Fontaine oversees the company's $500 million Enterprise AI fund.

Technology and product

Fontaine's next evaluative pillar focuses on the product itself: "Are these breakthrough solutions? Are they exceptional quantum quality? Is this technology fantastic?"

Market and competition

Beyond considering the actual technology, Fontaine said she thinks about a startup's financial viability, like the total addressable market and "strong tailwinds," or whether industry trends are favorable.

"Is there clear white space for leadership?" she asked, referencing a company's ability to fill a gap in the market.

Team

Fontaine described herself as a collaborative leader. She said she goes to the office as much as possible and encourages her team members to do the same. Twice a week, she blocks out her whole team's calendar for dedicated collaborative time.

The same focus on teamwork applies to the startups she backs, which, for one, need "high-quality founders with deep domain expertise."

"But even more so — as we do not lead deals, we co-invest alongside top-tier VCs — you have to think about who's on the cap table?" Fontaine said. "Is that a cap table you believe in?"

A cap table — or capitalization table — is a document that outlines investors' equity stakes in a startup.

Financial discipline

Ambition is great, but Fontaine said she's also focused on making sure a startup has reasonable financial goals.

"Do they have realistic milestones? Do they have scalable models?" she said.
