[TITLE]Kurdistan’s Oil Exports Top 200,000 Bpd amid Fragile New Deal:
[TEXT]
Crude oil exports from Iraq’s semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan have reached 205,000 barrels per day (bpd), but the oil flows via a pipeline to the Turkish point of Ceyhan could be under threat again.

Oil exports from Iraq’s northern region of Kurdistan via the Iraq-Türkiye Pipeline to Ceyhan resumed on September 27, after two and a half years of halt over disagreements between the federal Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) over how export revenues should be distributed.

Crude from Kurdistan is now steadily flowing at a rate of about 205,000 bpd, according to details on output and exports obtained by the Kurdistan24 news outlet.

Yet, the fragile three-party agreement signed by the federal Iraqi government, the KRG, and most of the foreign firm operating in Kurdistan could unravel, the Kurdish website reports.

The federal government in Baghdad has reportedly failed to adhere to the agreement—it has failed to pay to the international oil companies their contractually obligated financial dues to cover operational costs and investment returns, according to Kurdistan24.

Eight foreign companies operating in Kurdistan have signed agreements with the KRG and the Federal Government of Iraq to enable the restart of international crude exports from the region.

This agreement paved to way to the restart of exports, which were halted for two and a half years, after they were shut in in March 2023 due to a dispute over who should authorize the Kurdish exports.

The federal government in Baghdad and the regional Kurdish government in Erbil squabbled for more than two years over who should be responsible for the oil exports and the subsequent revenue distribution.

Under the agreement to restart oil exports, hailed as historic by Iraq’s federal government, KRG began delivering at the end of September about 190,000 bpd of crude to Iraqi state marketing company SOMO. Kurdistan is also entitled to keep 50,000 bpd to use for local consumption.

[TITLE]National Fuel to Acquire CenterPoint’s Ohio Natural Gas Utility Business:
[TEXT]
WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y., Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National Fuel Gas Company ("National Fuel" or the "Company") (NYSE: NFG) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement with CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (“CERC”), a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) (“CenterPoint”) to acquire CenterPoint’s Ohio natural gas utility business (“CNP Ohio”).

National Fuel is acquiring the equity interests in CNP Ohio for total consideration of $2.62 billion on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to customary closing adjustments, representing an acquisition multiple of approximately 1.6x estimated 2026 rate base of $1.6 billion. Upon closing, National Fuel will also acquire a dedicated team of employees that operate approximately 5,900 miles of distribution and transmission pipeline and serve approximately 335,000 residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers that consume approximately 60 Bcf of natural gas per year. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of calendar 2026, pending completion of a notice filing and review with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, Hart-Scott-Rodino review, and other customary closing conditions.

This acquisition will add significant regulated scale for National Fuel, doubling the size of the Company’s gas utility rate base, while expanding its operations into the neighboring state of Ohio, a jurisdiction that is both highly supportive of natural gas and maintains a constructive regulatory framework. This significant increase in regulated cash flows, alongside National Fuel’s unique ability to fund future growth capital with free cash flow from its integrated upstream and gathering operations, will further support the Company’s investment grade balance sheet.

“Our acquisition of CNP Ohio aligns with National Fuel’s strategic objective to increase the scale of our regulated operations through the addition of high-quality assets in a favorable regulatory and political jurisdiction. Gaining a strong presence in a neighboring service territory, with a similar workforce culture, and operations that mirror our existing gas utilities in New York and Pennsylvania is an added benefit for our Company as well as our customers, employees, and shareholders,” said David P. Bauer, President and Chief Executive Officer of National Fuel.

“Acquiring a natural gas utility of this quality, with a long runway of capital investment pathways, is a great opportunity to reinvest free cash flow from our integrated upstream and gathering operations, further enhancing the long-term outlook for regulated growth,” Bauer continued. “In addition, our prudent approach to financing this acquisition, combined with our increased scale and larger proportion of regulated cash flows, will further strengthen our investment grade credit profile which, in the long-term, should support further avenues for growth on both the regulated and non-regulated sides of our business.”

Compelling Strategic and Financial Benefits

Increased Scale of Gas Utility Business Balances Portfolio: Pro forma for CNP Ohio, National Fuel’s gas utility business will now serve approximately 1.1 million customers across three contiguous cold-weather states – New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Given the relative size of this acquisition, National Fuel’s gas utility rate base is expected to double to approximately $3.2 billion. As a result, the Company’s business mix will significantly rebalance, with an increasing share of earnings and growth from its stable and predictable regulated businesses.

[TITLE]Minerals Technologies Inc. Announces Investment to Support Significant Growth Opportunity in the Use of Renewable Fuels:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Minerals Technologies Inc. (NYSE: MTX) (“MTI”), a leading, technology-driven specialty minerals company, today announced an investment at its plant in Uşak City, Turkey to support the growth of its Rafinol™ line of products for the natural oil purification market. Rafinol™ is supplied from the Uşak plant, which is dedicated to the mining and manufacture of adsorbents and bleaching earth used for the purification of both renewable fuels and edible oils.

“This investment supports the strong, ongoing demand we see in the $1.1 billion global natural oil purification market,” said D.J. Monagle III, Group President of MTI’s Consumer & Specialties segment, which includes natural oil purification. “Renewable fuel accounts for 12% of the total market and is its fastest-growing segment, driven by regulatory changes requiring the increased use of renewable fuels in the United States and Europe. Rafinol™ is the leading technology servicing this market.”

The investment in Uşak will allow customers to continue to take advantage of MTI’s key differentiators, including the unique nature of its mineral reserves, geographically well-positioned mining and manufacturing operations, superior performance of its products, and technical and applications support.

MTI’s natural oil purification business consists of two product lines under the Rafinol™ brand. The first product line is used for the purification of biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel, with its powerful adsorption properties helping to remove even the highest impurities from feedstocks derived from used vegetable oils, grease, and animal fats. The second product line provides bleaching earths and adsorbents for the clarification of commonly used consumer oils and fats, including hard-to-bleach oils.

“Our investment in natural oil purification is one of several long-term, sustainable growth drivers for our company and in line with our continued expansion into higher-growth, consumer-oriented markets that are aligned with macro trends,” said Douglas T. Dietrich, MTI’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “It is also a clear example of MTI’s ability to apply our core technologies to our mineral reserves in order to drive solutions for our customers’ most complex problems.”

[TITLE]First SMR in Alberta Could Power the Oil Sands:
[TEXT]
A study by X-energy Canada has confirmed the feasibility and benefits of repurposing an existing thermal generation site in Alberta with X-energy's small modular reactors, World Nuclear News reports.

Funded by Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA), the study found that the Xe-100 high-temperature gas-cooled reactor is uniquely suited to Alberta's energy needs. As well as producing electricity, it is specifically designed to provide 565°C heat and steam for industrial applications, unlocking a broad range of use cases for Alberta's industrial and oil and gas sectors, the company said. The province's established supply chain capabilities are well-positioned to support the manufacturing and construction of the technology, while the Xe-100's design means it can use air-cooling systems, significantly reducing overall water usage, and offering greater siting flexibility over conventional light-water reactors.

In 2023, ERA committed $7 million for Cenovus, a Calgary-based energy company, to study the use of small modular reactors in the oil sands.

In August, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said the government sees “tremendous potential” for nuclear in the province.

While Alberta does not currently have any nuclear generating capacity, in 2021 it signed a memorandum of understanding with Ontario, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan to collaborate on SMR development, and has signed MOUs with several SMR developers. According to World Nuclear News, Energy Alberta has proposed building a nuclear power plant based on large-scale Candu Monark reactors at a site in the Peace River region of northern Alberta.

[TITLE]Eos Energy Executes Next Phase of Growth Strategy with U.S. Manufacturing Expansion and New Software Hub Under Project AMAZE:
[TEXT]
$24 million state-led economic development package underscores the shared commitment between Eos and Pennsylvania to advance U.S. manufacturing and job creation

Expansion reinforces the Company’s progress and transformation as Pennsylvania becomes a national hub for energy, technology, and manufacturing innovation

PITTSBURGH, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) ("Eos" or the “Company”), an American energy company and the leading innovator in designing, sourcing, manufacturing, and providing zinc-based battery energy storage systems (BESS) manufactured in the United States, today announced the next phase of its growth strategy with the expansion of its U.S. manufacturing footprint and the establishment of a new software hub strengthening American energy storage capacity, energy independence, and industrial job growth.

In partnership with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Allegheny County, the Company was awarded a joint $24 million economic development package to support U.S. manufacturing and the continued growth of 1,000 high quality American jobs. The incentive package will help the Company scale operations to meet growing market demand driven, in part, by AI infrastructure, while advancing energy innovation in Pennsylvania.

“Energy storage is the backbone of a modern energy system, and this significant milestone marks our progress to bring America’s battery to scale,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “Through Project AMAZE, we’re proving that you can make things in America again by building world-class capacity, pairing advanced manufacturing with innovative software, and doing it here in Pennsylvania to ensure a more energy-efficient and secure future. We thank Governor Shapiro, Allegheny County, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, and the Pittsburgh Technology Council for their unwavering support and shared vision for advancing Americas quest to lead in energy.”

Eos will expand its manufacturing capacity with a new state-of-the-art 432,000 sq. ft. facility in Marshall Township, PA, that will house additional production lines that complement the Company’s existing Turtle Creek manufacturing facility with plans to reach 8 GWh of annualized energy storage capacity. The new facility enables Eos to transition from single piece flow operations to high-efficiency, large-scale production, marking the culmination of years of process development designed to bring U.S. made energy storage to market at scale.

“The demand for energy is going up — and my Administration is capitalizing on Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and net energy exporter to attract leading energy manufacturers like Eos Energy to the Commonwealth,” said Governor Shapiro. “We’re doubling down on our efforts to aggressively compete for — and win — major projects like this one by cutting red tape, building out our skilled workforce, and investing in the next generation of energy technology. I’m proud that Pennsylvania will be home to Eos’ new global headquarters — and my Administration will continue to work to cut energy costs, create good-paying jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.”

Eos will also establish a new software hub at Nova Place, Pittsburgh’s premiere technology and innovation center, that supports the Company’s growing workforce and proprietary battery management system, software, controls and analytics platform, DawnOSTM. Eos joins a thriving community of other advanced manufacturing, data/telecommunications, AI, electric utilities, and robotics leaders in Pittsburgh’s innovation headquarters.

As part of its expanding software and engineering focus, the Company plans to deepen its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, a leading institution in robotics, AI, computer science, and engineering to further develop a state-of-the-art workforce to work in Eos’ software hub.

“Carnegie Mellon University is thrilled to celebrate this milestone with Eos, and we are looking forward to the many opportunities it unlocks – for Pittsburghers, our students, and America’s bright future in manufacturing,” said CMU President Farnam Jahanian. “On behalf of the CMU community, I extend my sincere congratulations to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Eos CEO Joe Mastrangelo and their teams for leading the way in strengthening Western Pennsylvania’s roles as an innovation engine for the nation and as a driver of the talent that will power it.”

“Pennsylvania has an extensive history of being at the forefront of innovation. We’re proving that in Pittsburgh you can not only build products in America but also offer world class education and intellectual capabilities to grow emerging industries,” said Pranesh Rao, Eos Senior Vice President of Storage System Engineering. “Building our software hub in Pittsburgh—surrounded by talented workers and a fast-growing innovation ecosystem—is both a strategic move and a catalyst to propel Eos to the next level.”
