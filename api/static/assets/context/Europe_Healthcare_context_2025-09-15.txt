[TITLE]US financial giants boost UK investments and jobs across London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester:
[TEXT]
New US investments will create 1,800 jobs from Belfast to Edinburgh and boost benefits for millions of customers.

Total of over £1.25 billion of private US investment committed to the UK’s world-leading financial services sector including PayPal, Bank of America, Citi Bank, and S&P.

Demonstrates the enduring strength of the UK-US ‘golden corridor’ in financial services, with British banks expanding operations into the US and booming cross-border investment flows reinforcing that working with America is best for Britain.

Deal lines up £20 billion in trade between the two nations – including an expected £7 billion commitment from BlackRock to grow in the UK.

London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester are set to benefit from a wave of new US investment into the financial services sector, reinforcing the strength of the UK-US economic partnership ahead of next week’s Presidential State Visit.

Working with America is best for Britain — and today’s announcement proves it. A total of over £1.25 billion in private sector commitments from leading US firms — including PayPal, Bank of America, Citi Bank, and S&P Global — will support job creation, drive innovation, and deliver improved services for consumers in the UK.

US giants are capitalising on Britain’s leadership in financial services – expanding operations and opening new offices across the nation, with London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester set to gain from a wave of skilled job creation.

Bank of America is set to create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast, marking its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland — a major milestone that underscores the region’s growing role in global financial services.

Citi Group today confirms it is investing £1.1 billion across its UK operations, including a further commitment to growing its presence in Northern Ireland where the bank is already one of the top employers in Belfast now employing over 4,000 people — firmly establishing Belfast as a major technology powerhouse.

BlackRock are celebrating the opening of their new Edinburgh office this week, which will see their 800-strong footprint nearly double, as part of their multi-billion dollar investment into the UK.

In Manchester, S&P Global are investing over £4 million into their Manchester offices which will support 200 permanent jobs to boost their nearly 3,000-strong UK workforce.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

Today’s announcements reinforce the UK’s position as the world’s leading investment destination. Our financial services sector is at the heart of a modern, dynamic Industrial Strategy. Strengthening ties with the US boosts our economy, creates jobs, and secures our role in global finance, delivering on our Plan for Change. These investments reflect the strength of our enduring ‘golden corridor’ with one of our closest trading partners, ahead of the US Presidential State Visit.

This marks a significant vote of confidence in the UK’s position as a global financial hub and in the government’s plan to make Britain the best place in the world to invest — a vision underpinned by the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy, which is driving investment into priority sectors like financial services.

These investments highlight the enduring value of the transatlantic relationship — a cornerstone of shared prosperity that supports millions of jobs and drives growth in every region.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:

This commitment from America’s leading financial institutions demonstrates the immense potential of the UK economy, our strong relationship with the US and the confidence global investors have in our Plan for Change, which is making the UK the best place in the world to invest and do business. These investments will create thousands of high-skilled jobs from Belfast to Edinburgh, kickstarting the growth that is essential to putting money in working people’s pockets across every part of the United Kingdom.

Broadridge is making major investments into their new London office, further strengthening its UK presence and deepening transatlantic ties in financial services.

As part of the UK’s expanding fintech and digital innovation sector, PayPal is announcing a £150m investment in product innovations and growth that will benefit customers throughout the UK, reinforcing Britain’s position as a key market for the brand globally.

Jane Fraser, Citi Group CEO said:

Citi’s commitment to the UK runs deep. This is home to many of our most senior leaders and nearly 14,000 colleagues across London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. We’re proud to be serving 85% of the FTSE 100 and to have stood beside UK companies through every market cycle, raising capital, financing growth and helping them compete on the world stage. The UK isn’t simply one of our largest markets; it is core to Citi’s foundation as a truly global bank.

The UK-US investment relationship has never been stronger, with over £1.2 trillion invested in each other’s countries at the end of 2023.

These new investment announcements are accompanied by new significant commitments by financial companies to ramp up their commercial activity and capital flows between our two economies in the coming years.

Blackrock is expecting to allocate over £7 billion to the UK market next year on behalf of clients, and is investing £500 million into enterprise data centres across the country.

Rothesay is planning to double its investment in the US (by £7 billion) over the next few years, and OakNorth is committing to increased capital and lending of over £3.5 billion to support its US operations.

British banks are expanding their US footprint; Barclays alone has deployed over $2 trillion in capital across the US in 2024 and continues to play a pivotal role in strengthening UK-US investment ties. The bank has an ambition to double this amount over the next decade, expanding its footprint and supporting growth across sectors.

All in all, that will see investment and capital commitments of over £8 billion coming to the UK, and over £12 billion going the other way, creating jobs and opportunity in both countries.

Earlier this year, the Chancellor launched the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, which included financial services as a high growth sector, signifying the UK’s commitment improving financial regulations and driving investment and skilled jobs into the UK.

The UK and US agreed an Economic Prosperity Deal which secured major tariff reductions for key sectors and protected jobs in the automotive and aerospace sector. Discussions continue with the US on a wider UK-US Economic Deal which will look at increasing digital trade, strengthen supply chains and boost access for our world-leading services companies.

Background

Today’s announcements mark the start of a week of activity to strengthen economic ties between the US and UK. Further announcements reflected in the totals above are expected this week:

Please see below for a list of all the investments announced today.

Bank of America is set to create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast, marking its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland — a major milestone that underscores the region’s growing role in global financial services.

Brian Moynihan, Chair and CEO of Bank of America, said:

At Bank of America we are focused on helping our clients advance economic opportunity and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. The early US-UK trade agreement that the President and the Prime Minister began discussing in February has provided the business community with the certainty and framework it needs to strengthen transatlantic commerce. We are pleased to be able to extend Bank of America’s investment in the UK with the creation of a new Belfast operations facility to support our global business, bringing up to 1,000 new opportunities to Northern Ireland.

Citi Group are investing £1.1 billion into the UK. The UK is Citi’s second largest market globally, employing 14,000 people across the UK, working across four main sites – London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. Citi Bank have undertaken a major investment into the refurbishment of our Canary Wharf headquarters and continued investment into their Northern Ireland operations.

BlackRock will open their new Edinburgh offices on 18 September, which shows their ongoing commitment to the area - this new home will allow Blackrock to grow from 800 to 1,400. Once complete, two of the top five largest BlackRock offices will be in the UK.

Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, said:

As the largest asset manager in the UK, BlackRock is proud to serve over 13 million British people who are saving for retirement. Today we are announcing an investment of half a billion pounds into enterprise data centres across the country, advancing digital infrastructure for British-based businesses. In addition, over the last year our clients around the world invested over £7bn into UK public equity and fixed income securities. We expect this trend to continue, supporting jobs, growth and innovation across a wide range of British industries.

PayPal is announcing a £150m investment in product innovations and growth that will benefit customers throughout the United Kingdom. This incorporates financing for new product initiatives that have been created for British consumers, which are due to launch in the coming months. It reinforces Britain’s position as a key market for the brand globally.

PayPal CEO, Alex Chriss said:

The UK has always been an important region for PayPal, serving millions of customers and businesses for the last two decades,” said PayPal President & CEO Alex Chriss. As the pioneer of e-commerce, PayPal is making a £150mm investment in UK to enable British consumers and businesses to be among the first in the world to experience our latest innovations, including AI-enabled shopping experiences.

Barclays is building out its Americas headquarters in Times Square, New York. With state-of-the-art facilities and technology, this flagship office will connect the US and UK and serve as a global hub that drives innovation for clients and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.

In 2024, Barclays helped raise and lend a total of $2 trillion in financing and capital for US clients. Our ambition is to double this amount over the next decade.

C.S. Venkatakrishnan, Group Chief Executive at Barclays said:

As the leading British bank, with deep roots in the United States, Barclays is uniquely positioned to unlock opportunities that deepen commerce, drive innovation, and fuel sustainable growth. Our transatlantic presence enables us to connect clients to capital, ideas, and partnerships that power progress across both markets.

OakNorth are investing over $5 billion into the US market over the next three years, helping create thousands of new jobs across the country. As a digital bank focused on the lower middle market, OakNorth supports a wide range of businesses that drive productivity throughout the economy.

OakNorth was one of the first foreign digital banks to get approval to set up a US Representative Office in 2024 under the oversight of the FED and NYDFS.

Rishi Khosla, co-founder and CEO of OakNorth said:

The US State Visit marks a pivotal moment in UK-US relations, with both governments reaffirming their shared commitment to free enterprise, strategic cooperation, and sustainable growth. The scale and ambition of the investments being made reflect the unique strength of the economic partnership between our two nations. At OakNorth, we see this relationship in action every day - since July 2023, we have lent nearly $2bn to lower mid-market businesses in the US, and we are committed to investing billions more in the coming years. By supporting these vital businesses, we aim to help drive innovation, create jobs, and fuel sustainable growth across both economies.

Starling Group is investing over $100 million over the coming years to unlock growth in their US operations.

Raman Bhatia, Starling Group CEO said:

The US State Visit highlights the importance of a strong UK-US economic relationship that helps create jobs, sustainable growth and pushes the bounds of innovation. At Starling Group we are driving forward activity to bring our model of responsible digital banking to US consumers, and we welcome both governments reaffirming their shared commitment to free enterprise and strategic cooperation. As part of our ambition to unlock growth, Starling Group is planning to invest well over $100m in the US over the next few years.

Revolut is set to invest over $500 million in the United States over the next 3-5 years to accelerate its expansion and support its ambition to scale as a bank for American consumers. This investment is expected to create hundreds of high-quality U.S. jobs and underscores the strength of the UK-US economic partnership.

[TITLE]Weight loss jabs connected with a death every week, damning report reveals:
[TEXT]
Weight loss injections have been found to be connected with a death every week since January, according to the latest shocking UK data.

Since January, 24 deaths associated with popularised weight loss jabs, such as Wegovy, Mounjaro and Ozempic, have been recorded by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

As of June, the current figure stands at 106 deaths, after 82 were recorded back at the start of the year. The startling figure amounts to more than one fatality a week, while around 1.5million Britons are expected to use the drugs.

The drugs are now available on the NHS for qualifying patients | GETTY

In the report, the MHRA indicated that tirzepatide was associated with 38 fatalities by June - a startling jump from 18 in January. Liraglutide, which is offered to patients under the brand-name Saxenda, was linked with 37 deaths. Meanwhile, semaglutide, which is used in Wegovy, was connected to 31 deaths. In June, the jabs became available on the NHS for those with obesity, although the majority of users have sourced the injections privately. As their popularity soars, the drugs’ side effects have been increasingly investigated by medics, ranging from nausea and vomiting to more serious conditions, such as pancreatitis.

[TITLE]My father the fraud: Daughter reveals how key scientist in Primodos scandal built career on lies:
[TEXT]
A renowned pharmacologist and expert witness in the Primodos drug scandal has been unmasked as a fraud - by his daughter.

Professor Michael Briggs, who was also a NASA scientist and adviser to the World Health Organisation, built his glittering career on lies by faking his qualifications.

The revelations come in a new book called The Scientist Who Wasn't There, written by his daughter Joanne Briggs - and Sky News can now reveal how his story sheds new light on a medical scandal that has rumbled on for five decades.

From 1966 to 1970, Professor Briggs was UK research director for Schering pharmaceuticals, which made the pregnancy test drug Primodos, sold in the UK with great commercial success.

Image: Joanne Briggs has unmasked her father's lies

Later, hundreds of mothers would claim that the drug damaged their babies in the womb - and Briggs was called as an expert witness to challenge their case.

His involvement in understanding the effects of Primodos runs from the 1960s to the current day, and questions remain over whether his research was among a more recent body of work which has been used by the government to justify not setting up a redress scheme for disabled claimants.

Yet, Briggs was a man who faked research.

"When I was small, I believed my dad to be the only man who knew all science," Joanne Briggs writes.

The son of a typewriter mechanic from Manchester, he was an enigmatic figure, often dressed in a blazer and sunglasses. In one old family photo, Joanne says he looks like "an operative from MI5, after he'd been issued with a wife and child".

Professor Briggs claimed he had advised film director Stanley Kubrick on the making of 2001: A Space Odyssey.

He had indeed worked for NASA on the Mars probe, based at the California Institute of Technology, though Joanne believes he used "a three-card trick" to get the job.

Speaking to Sky News in her kitchen in Sussex, she pulls out two A4-bound books.

One purports to be a PhD thesis from Cornell University in 1959 by MH Briggs. The other is a Doctor of Science degree dated 1961 from Wellington University in New Zealand.

"Both of these documents are unfortunately fakes," says Joanne, explaining that her father worked for a year as a teaching assistant at Cornell and, at best, did a master's thesis.

The "super doctorate" from Wellington would have required a real PhD, and Joanne believes he did submit something, but examiners described it as "unfavourable".

"He had a very contorted CV, that's for sure," says Joanne. "He never completed a sustained piece of work leading to a higher degree of the kind that you would expect a scientist to have."

Professor Briggs's name cropped up in Sky News investigations into Primodos. First in leaked letters from Schering in which scientists were discussing their concerns

[TITLE]As insurers struggle with GLP-1 drug costs, some seek to wean patients off:
[TEXT]
By Jamie Ducharme, KFF Health News

After losing 50 pounds on the injectable weight loss medication Zepbound, Kyra Wensley received a surprising letter from her pharmacy benefit manager in April.

Her request for coverage had been denied, the letter said, because she’d had a body mass index of less than 35 when she started Zepbound. The 25-year-old who lives in New York had been taking Zepbound without incident for months, so she was confused: Why was her BMI, which had been around 32 when she started, becoming an issue only now?

Wensley had no interest in quitting an effective drug. “Going right off like that, it’s easier said than done,” she said.

Her doctor fought to keep her on the GLP-1 agonist, the category that includes weight loss and Type 2 diabetes drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound. But Wensley ultimately had to switch from Zepbound to Wegovy to meet her plan’s requirements. She said she doesn’t like Wegovy as much as her old medication, but she now feels lucky to be on any GLP-1.

Lots of research suggests such medications must be used indefinitely to maintain weight loss and related health benefits. But with list prices of roughly $1,000 a month, public and private payers are struggling to keep up with ballooning demand for GLP-1 weight loss drugs and in some cases are eliminating or restricting their coverage as a result.

North Carolina Medicaid plans to end GLP-1 coverage for weight loss on Oct. 1, just over a year after starting the coverage. Pennsylvania is planning to limit Medicaid coverage to beneficiaries at the highest risk of complications from obesity. And despite recent reports of a potential federal pilot program to extend coverage of GLP-1 obesity drugs under Medicaid and Medicare, all state Medicaid programs are likely to be under pressure due to steep spending cuts in the budget reconciliation package recently signed into law by President Donald Trump.

Already, many GLP-1 users quit within a year, studies suggest — often due to side effects, high costs, or insurance issues. Now a growing number of researchers, payers, and providers are exploring deliberate “deprescription,” which aims to taper some patients off their medication after they have taken it for a certain amount of time or lost a certain amount of weight.

The U.K.’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which creates guidance for the National Health Service, recommends two-year limits on the use of some weight loss medications, such as Wegovy. And the concept was raised in a recent Institute for Clinical and Economic Review report on affordable access to obesity drugs.

A. Mark Fendrick, who directs the Center for Value-Based Insurance Design at the University of Michigan, has argued that if some people using GLP-1s to lose weight were eventually transitioned off, more people could take advantage of them.

“If you’re going to spend $1 billion or $100 billion, you could either spend it on fewer people for a long period of time, or you can spend it on a lot more people for a shorter period of time,” he said.

Fendrick’s employer, the University of Michigan, indeed does that. Its prescription drug plan caps coverage of GLP-1 drugs at two years if they’re used solely for weight loss.

Jamie Bennett, a spokesperson for Wegovy and Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk, declined to comment on the concept of deprescription, noting that its drugs are intended for chronic conditions. Rachel Sorvig, a spokesperson for Zepbound and Mounjaro manufacturer Eli Lilly, said in a statement that users should “talk to their health care provider

Total of over £1.25 billion of private US investment committed to the UK’s world-leading financial services sector including PayPal, Bank of America, Citi Bank, and S&P.

Demonstrates the enduring strength of the UK-US ‘golden corridor’ in financial services, with British banks expanding operations into the US and booming cross-border investment flows reinforcing that working with America is best for Britain.

Deal lines up £20 billion in trade between the two nations – including an expected £7 billion commitment from BlackRock to grow in the UK.

London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester are set to benefit from a wave of new US investment into the financial services sector, reinforcing the strength of the UK-US economic partnership ahead of next week’s Presidential State Visit.

Working with America is best for Britain — and today’s announcement proves it. A total of over £1.25 billion in private sector commitments from leading US firms — including PayPal, Bank of America, Citi Bank, and S&P Global — will support job creation, drive innovation, and deliver improved services for consumers in the UK.

US giants are capitalising on Britain’s leadership in financial services – expanding operations and opening new offices across the nation, with London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester set to gain from a wave of skilled job creation.

Bank of America is set to create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast, marking its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland — a major milestone that underscores the region’s growing role in global financial services.

Citi Group today confirms it is investing £1.1 billion across its UK operations, including a further commitment to growing its presence in Northern Ireland where the bank is already one of the top employers in Belfast now employing over 4,000 people — firmly establishing Belfast as a major technology powerhouse.

BlackRock are celebrating the opening of their new Edinburgh office this week, which will see their 800-strong footprint nearly double, as part of their multi-billion dollar investment into the UK.

In Manchester, S&P Global are investing over £4 million into their Manchester offices which will support 200 permanent jobs to boost their nearly 3,000-strong UK workforce.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

Today’s announcements reinforce the UK’s position as the world’s leading investment destination. Our financial services sector is at the heart of a modern, dynamic Industrial Strategy. Strengthening ties with the US boosts our economy, creates jobs, and secures our role in global finance, delivering on our Plan for Change. These investments reflect the strength of our enduring ‘golden corridor’ with one of our closest trading partners, ahead of the US Presidential State Visit.

This marks a significant vote of confidence in the UK’s position as a global financial hub and in the government’s plan to make Britain the best place in the world to invest — a vision underpinned by the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy, which is driving investment into priority sectors like financial services.

These investments highlight the enduring value of the transatlantic relationship — a cornerstone of shared prosperity that supports millions of jobs and drives growth in every region.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:

This commitment from America’s leading financial institutions demonstrates the immense potential of the UK economy, our strong relationship with the US and the confidence global investors have in our Plan for Change, which is making the UK the best place in the world to invest and do business. These investments will create thousands of high-skilled jobs from Belfast to Edinburgh, kickstarting the growth that is essential to putting money in working people’s pockets across every part of the United Kingdom.

Broadridge is making major investments into their new London office, further strengthening its UK presence and deepening transatlantic ties in financial services.

Jane Fraser, Citi Group CEO said:

Citi’s commitment to the UK runs deep. This is home to many of our most senior leaders and nearly 14,000 colleagues across London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. We’re proud to be serving 85% of the FTSE 100 and to have stood beside UK companies through every market cycle, raising capital, financing growth and helping them compete on the world stage. The UK isn’t simply one of our largest markets; it is core to Citi’s foundation as a truly global bank.

The UK-US investment relationship has never been stronger, with over £1.2 trillion invested in each other’s countries at the end of 2023.

These new investment announcements are accompanied by new significant commitments by financial companies to ramp up their commercial activity and capital flows between our two economies in the coming years.

Blackrock is expecting to allocate over £7 billion to the UK market next year on behalf of clients, and is investing £500 million into enterprise data centres across the country.

Rothesay is planning to double its investment in the US (by £7 billion) over the next few years, and OakNorth is committing to increased capital and lending of over £3.5 billion to support its US operations.

British banks are expanding their US footprint; Barclays alone has deployed over $2 trillion in capital across the US in 2024 and continues to play a pivotal role in strengthening UK-US investment ties. The bank has an ambition to double this amount over the next decade, expanding its footprint and supporting growth across sectors.

All in all, that will see investment and capital commitments of over £8 billion coming to the UK, and over £12 billion going the other way, creating jobs and opportunity in both countries.

Earlier this year, the Chancellor launched the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, which included financial services as a high growth sector, signifying the UK’s commitment improving financial regulations and driving investment and skilled jobs into the UK.

The UK and US agreed an Economic Prosperity Deal which secured major tariff reductions for key sectors and protected jobs in the automotive and aerospace sector. Discussions continue with the US on a wider UK-US Economic Deal which will look at increasing digital trade, strengthen supply chains and boost access for our world-leading services companies.

[TITLE]Weight loss jabs connected with a death every week, damning report reveals:
[TEXT]
Weight loss injections have been found to be connected with a death every week since January, according to the latest shocking UK data.

Since January, 24 deaths associated with popularised weight loss jabs, such as Wegovy, Mounjaro and Ozempic, have been recorded by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

As of June, the current figure stands at 106 deaths, after 82 were recorded back at the start of the year. The startling figure amounts to more than one fatality a week, while around 1.5million Britons are expected to use the drugs.

The drugs are now available on the NHS for qualifying patients | GETTY

In the report, the MHRA indicated that tirzepatide was associated with 38 fatalities by June - a startling jump from 18 in January. Liraglutide, which is offered to patients under the brand-name Saxenda, was linked with 37 deaths. Meanwhile, semaglutide, which is used in Wegovy, was connected to 31 deaths. In June, the jabs became available on the NHS for those with obesity, although the majority of users have sourced the injections privately. As their popularity soars, the drugs’ side effects have been increasingly investigated by medics, ranging from nausea and vomiting to more serious conditions, such as pancreatitis.

[TITLE]My father the fraud: Daughter reveals how key scientist in Primodos scandal built career on lies:
[TEXT]
A renowned pharmacologist and expert witness in the Primodos drug scandal has been unmasked as a fraud - by his daughter.

Professor Michael Briggs, who was also a NASA scientist and adviser to the World Health Organisation, built his glittering career on lies by faking his qualifications.

The revelations come in a new book called The Scientist Who Wasn't There, written by his daughter Joanne Briggs - and Sky News can now reveal how his story sheds new light on a medical scandal that has rumbled on for five decades.

From 1966 to 1970, Professor Briggs was UK research director for Schering pharmaceuticals, which made the pregnancy test drug Primodos, sold in the UK with great commercial success.

Image: Joanne Briggs has unmasked her father's lies

Later, hundreds of mothers would claim that the drug damaged their babies in the womb - and Briggs was called as an expert witness to challenge their case.

His involvement in understanding the effects of Primodos runs from the 1960s to the current day, and questions remain over whether his research was among a more recent body of work which has been used by the government to justify not setting up a redress scheme for disabled claimants.

Yet, Briggs was a man who faked research.

"When I was small, I believed my dad to be the only man who knew all science," Joanne Briggs writes.

The son of a typewriter mechanic from Manchester, he was an enigmatic figure, often dressed in a blazer and sunglasses. In one old family photo, Joanne says he looks like "an operative from MI5, after he'd been issued with a wife and child".

Professor Briggs claimed he had advised film director Stanley Kubrick on the making of 2001: A Space Odyssey.

He had indeed worked for NASA on the Mars probe, based at the California Institute of Technology, though Joanne believes he used "a three-card trick" to get the job.

Speaking to Sky News in her kitchen in Sussex, she pulls out two A4-bound books.

One purports to be a PhD thesis from Cornell University in 1959 by MH Briggs. The other is a Doctor of Science degree dated 1961 from Wellington University in New Zealand.

"Both of these documents are unfortunately fakes," says Joanne, explaining that her father worked for a year as a teaching assistant at Cornell and, at best, did a master's thesis.

The "super doctorate" from Wellington would have required a real PhD, and Joanne believes he did submit something, but examiners described it as "unfavourable".

"He had a very contorted CV, that's for sure," says Joanne. "He never completed a sustained piece of work leading to a higher degree of the kind that you would expect a scientist to have."

Professor Briggs's name cropped up in Sky News investigations into Primodos. First in leaked letters from Schering in which scientists were discussing their concerns
