in the United States

TORONTO, Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LNG Energy Group Corp. (TSXV: LNGE) (TSXV: LNGE.WT) (OTCQB: LNGNF) (FWB: E26) (the “Company” or “LNG Energy Group”) is pleased to announce that the Company’s Colombian branch has emerged from the Proceso de Recuperación Empresarial (“PRES”), as regulated under Colombia Law 2437 of 2024, for insolvency protection, with a Reorganization Agreement (“Agreement”) that has been approved by more than 70% of all credit categories, including over 90% employee support. The Colombian branch was additionally admitted to judicial validation of the Agreement before the Superintendencia de Sociedades (the Superintendency of Corporations) on October 23, 2025. The Agreement contemplates a staggered repayment schedule, starting on the date of final judicial validation, of the different credit classes over 39 quarters (final maturity around 2034), with allowance for accelerated payments, should this be a possibility. Admittance to judicial validation of the Agreement grants the Company’s Colombian branch the continuity of the protections provided by the PRES.

The Company would like to announce the settlement of US$10,725,641 in outstanding debt with Lewis Energy Group (“LEG”). This obligation originated from the Share Purchase Agreement and the Sale and Purchase Agreement – Additional Assets (“APA”) entered on August 15, 2023. The original debt totaled US$19,115,414, of which US$8,389,773 had been repaid. The outstanding balance owed was settled in lieu of seizure via LEG’s enforcement of the collateral rights and first security established in the APA, resulting in the transfer of the Additional Assets — Rig 16, Rig 22, Rig 6, and various yellow iron equipment. The Additional Assets were valued by a third-party appraiser in October 2023 and were recorded on the September 2025 trial balance sheet of the Company at a net book value of US$7,354,416.

We expect to announce additional results of the strategic review process as LNG Energy Group continues to execute initiatives to enhance its liquidity position, optimize costs, reduce financial obligations and stabilize natural gas production.

Operational Update

The Company’s average daily production in Q3 and year to date was 9.2 Mmcf/d and 11.9 Mmcf/d, respectively, and realized sales prices were US$10.7 per Mcf and US$9.8 per Mcf, in Q3 and year to date, respectively. The productivity on some of the wells has declined due to several subsurface factors preliminarily identified, that do not seem to have impacted the original gas in place. The Company continues evaluating and taking actions to enhance value.

Cease Trade Order

The Failure-to-File Cease Trade Orders in Multiple Jurisdictions (FFTCO) continues and the Company is working to file the Company’s annual audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the related management’s discussion and analysis, and the CEO and CFO certificates relating to the audited annual financial statements as required by National Instrument 52-109 – Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings (collectively, the “Required Documents”) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. Such filings will constitute the Company's application to have the FFCTO revoked. There can be no assurance that the FFCTO will be revoked on the timeline contemplated by the Company.

[TITLE]Energy Stocks Rise Sharply After U.S. Sanctions Hit Russia's Oil Giants:
[TEXT]
This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Oct 23 - A fresh round of U.S. sanctions aimed at Russia's largest oil companies jolted energy markets Thursday, sending oil prices and many U.S. energy stocks higher, according to a statement from the U.S. Treasury.

West Texas Intermediate crude rallied more than 5% to trade above $61 a barrel as traders weighed the prospect of reduced Russian supply and tighter secondary-market access.

The measures target Rosneft and Lukoil and roughly 30 affiliated subsidiaries involved in exploration, refining and distribution. Treasury officials warned that foreign banks and intermediaries that facilitate significant transactions tied to those firms may face heightened enforcement risk, raising the prospect of secondary penalties.

Markets reacted quickly. APA (NASDAQ:APA) climbed about 4%, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) rose about 3% and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) surged about 3%. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Devon Energy (DVN), EOG Resources (EOG), EQT (NYSE:EQT) and SLB (NYSE:SLB) each moved about 2%. Valero (NYSE:VLO) gained about 3%, and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) was up about 2%.

Traders said the sanctions reinsert geopolitical risk just as inventories were rebuilding, prompting a rapid repricing across the energy complex. The move may tighten global flows if allied nations adopt similar measures, analysts said.

[TITLE]Oil Disruption Widens as China Pauses Some Russia Buys:
[TEXT]
Chinese state-owned companies including Sinopec canceled some purchases of seaborne Russian crude after the US blacklisted Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC, adding to signs of disruption in the oil market.

The majors have begun to assess the curbs, as well as similar moves by the EU, according to people with knowledge of the situation, asking not to be identified discussing sensitive issues. The companies halted purchases of some spot cargoes, mostly ESPO, a grade from Russia’s Far East, they said.

The global oil market has been jolted this week by the wave of US sanctions, which have targeted Russia’s two largest producers and are intended to raise the pressure against Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. Prices spiked on Thursday after the Trump administration’s package was announced, and Brent futures are on course for a weekly gain of more than 7%.

China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., as Sinopec is formally known, as well as China Zhenhua Oil Co., didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment. On Thursday, Beijing pushed back against the US move, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson saying that “China consistently opposes unilateral sanctions that lack a basis in international law.”

US President Donald Trump plans to raise Chinese buying of Russian oil with his counterpart Xi Jinping at a meeting in South Korea next week. The summit will hand the leaders of the two largest economies an opportunity to make progress toward a broader trade deal after a period of strained relations.

State-owned Chinese buyers account for more than 400,000 barrels-a-day of Russian seaborne shipments, up to 40% the overall volume arriving on vessels, according to Kpler Ltd. Russia also delivers crude to China via pipelines.

“Flows to China are set to fall,” said Michal Meidan, director of the China Energy Research program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Still, the pipeline flows look set to continue given that the payments are based on a loan scheme that doesn’t seem to go via western banks, she said.

In addition to China, Russian flows to India, another key buyer, are expected to plunge following the US penalties. The sanctions mark a big shift in Western policy, which previously sought to limit revenue for the Kremlin with a price cap designed to prevent a supply disruptions and price spikes.

The Chinese state-owned companies could seek cheap alternatives, cut runs, or start unplanned maintenance as grades from the Middle East and West Africa become more pricey, with Indian users also seeking replacements for Russian barrels, the people said.

State-linked companies “may scale back their Russian crude purchases, but private refiners are unlikely to be affected,” said Emma Li, lead China analyst at Vortexa Ltd.

Brent futures — the global benchmark — were steady near $66 a barrel on Friday. While they have surged this week, prices remain 12% lower this year amid concern that rising supplies from OPEC+ — a broad producers’ alliance that includes Russia — will contribute to a global surplus.

The US Treasury Department sanctioned the two oil giants after accusing Russia of a “lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine.” They’re the first major US penalties against Moscow since Trump returned to the White House in January.

The sanctions “will indeed have certain serious consequences for us, but overall, they will not have a significant impact on our economic well-being,” Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Thursday. Moscow has about a month to prepare before the restrictions take full effect.

[TITLE]OPEC ready to raise oil output if required after US sanctions on Russia, Kuwaiti minister says:
[TEXT]
Synopsis

OPEC is prepared to increase oil production. This comes after new United States sanctions on Russian oil companies. Kuwait's oil minister stated OPEC will boost output if needed to cover market shortfalls. Global oil prices have already risen due to the sanctions. India is also considering reducing Russian oil imports. The shift is expected to benefit Middle Eastern oil producers.

[TITLE]Reliance to halt oil imports under Rosneft deal:
[TEXT]
Privately-owned Reliance Industries will stop importing oil under its long-term deal to buy nearly 5,00,000 barrels per day of crude from Russian oil major Rosneft, after the oil producer was sanctioned by the United States, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.

Reliance, the top Indian buyer of Russian crude, also buys Russian oil from the spot market for its refining complex, the world’s biggest, with a capacity to process 1.4 million bpd of oil.

[TITLE]National Fuel to Acquire CenterPoint’s Ohio Natural Gas Utility Business:
[TEXT]
WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y., Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National Fuel Gas Company ("National Fuel" or the "Company") (NYSE: NFG) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement with CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (“CERC”), a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) (“CenterPoint”) to acquire CenterPoint’s Ohio natural gas utility business (“CNP Ohio”).

National Fuel is acquiring the equity interests in CNP Ohio for total consideration of $2.62 billion on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to customary closing adjustments, representing an acquisition multiple of approximately 1.6x estimated 2026 rate base of $1.6 billion. Upon closing, National Fuel will also acquire a dedicated team of employees that operate approximately 5,900 miles of distribution and transmission pipeline and serve approximately 335,000 residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers that consume approximately 60 Bcf of natural gas per year. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of calendar 2026, pending completion of a notice filing and review with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, Hart-Scott-Rodino review, and other customary closing conditions.

This acquisition will add significant regulated scale for National Fuel, doubling the size of the Company’s gas utility rate base, while expanding its operations into the neighboring state of Ohio, a jurisdiction that is both highly supportive of natural gas and maintains a constructive regulatory framework. This significant increase in regulated cash flows, alongside National Fuel’s unique ability to fund future growth capital with free cash flow from its integrated upstream and gathering operations, will further support the Company’s investment grade balance sheet.

“Our acquisition of CNP Ohio aligns with National Fuel’s strategic objective to increase the scale of our regulated operations through the addition of high-quality assets in a favorable regulatory and political jurisdiction. Gaining a strong presence in a neighboring service territory, with a similar workforce culture, and operations that mirror our existing gas utilities in New York and Pennsylvania is an added benefit for our Company as well as our customers, employees, and shareholders,” said David P. Bauer, President and Chief Executive Officer of National Fuel.

“Acquiring a natural gas utility of this quality, with a long runway of capital investment pathways, is a great opportunity to reinvest free cash flow from our integrated upstream and gathering operations, further enhancing the long-term outlook for regulated growth,” Bauer continued. “In addition, our prudent approach to financing this acquisition, combined with our increased scale and larger proportion of regulated cash flows, will further strengthen our investment grade credit profile which, in the long-term, should support further avenues for growth on both the regulated and non-regulated sides of our business.”

Compelling Strategic and Financial Benefits

Increased Scale of Gas Utility Business Balances Portfolio: Pro forma for CNP Ohio, National Fuel’s gas utility business will now serve approximately 1.1 million customers across three contiguous cold-weather states – New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Given the relative size of this acquisition, National Fuel’s gas utility rate base is expected to double to approximately $3.2 billion. As a result, the Company’s business mix will significantly rebalance, with an increasing share of earnings and growth from its stable and predictable regulated businesses.

Ability to Reinvest Free Cash Flow in Regulated Growth: Given the expected significant free cash flow from the Company’s integrated upstream and gathering operations, the ability to reinvest directly into growing rate base is accretive to long-term earnings and shareholder value.

Given the expected significant free cash flow from the Company’s integrated upstream and gathering operations, the ability to reinvest directly into growing rate base is accretive to long-term earnings and shareholder value. Supportive of Long-Term Dividend Growth: The acquisition enhances the long-term outlook for regulated earnings growth and is supportive of the Company’s long history of paying dividends, which National Fuel has increased each of the past 55 years and has paid consecutively since 1902.

Enhances Long-term Credit Profile: The increased contribution to National Fuel’s earnings and cash flows generated from its regulated assets will meaningfully improve the Company’s credit profile. In addition, the financing for this acquisition is expected to include a combination of debt, free cash flow from National Fuel’s integrated upstream and gathering operations, and a modest amount of equity, all of which is designed to maintain the Company’s investment grade rating.

Accretive to Earnings Per Share: Given the anticipated financing mix, the acquisition of CNP Ohio is expected to be immediately accretive to the Company’s regulated earnings per share when excluding acquisition-related expenses. On a consolidated basis, at current natural gas prices, the acquisition’s impact on adjusted operating results is expected to be neutral in fiscal 2028, the first complete year after closing, and accretive thereafter.

Benefits to All Stakeholders

Continued Commitment to Affordability and Reliability : Consistent with its long history of operating a safe, reliable and affordable gas utility, National Fuel will continue to deliver the high-quality level of reliable service at fair prices that CNP Ohio’s customers have come to expect.

Leveraging a Talented Workforce: Through the integration of CNP Ohio’s talented workforce and strong operational performance into National Fuel’s organization, the Company expects to build on its track record of delivering safe, trusted, and resilient service.

Financing

In connection with the acquisition, National Fuel has obtained a fully committed bridge facility for the entire purchase price supported by The Toronto-Dominion Bank, New York Branch and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.

At closing, National Fuel will issue a promissory note in the amount of $1.2 billion to CERC. The remainder of the purchase price will be paid in cash. The promissory note, which was part of CenterPoint’s transaction structure and was incorporated into National Fuel’s business valuation, will have a maturity date of 364 days post-closing and will carry an interest rate of 6.5%.

National Fuel intends to execute permanent financing, inclusive of the amount to repay the $1.2 billion promissory note, using approximately $300 to $400 million of common equity, along with the issuance of long-term debt and expected future free cash flow from the Company’s integrated upstream and gathering businesses to fund the transaction. The Company expects that its ultimate financing mix will maintain a strong credit profile that supports its investment grade credit rating.

[TITLE]mBank and PGGM enter into PLN 3.8 billion credit risk sharing transaction backed by financing to the renewable energy sector:
[TEXT]
WARSAW, Poland, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- mBank and PGGM have entered into a credit risk sharing transaction referencing a PLN 3.8 billion portfolio of corporate loans in Poland. Approximately 75% of the portfolio is backed by financing of wind-farms and photovoltaic installations. The remainder of the portfolio references project finance lending in the areas of health care, telecommunications, and other industries of strategic importance to the lender.

This is the first large-scale project finance significant risk transfer transaction (SRT) from the CEE region, primarily backed by a portfolio of renewables. It is also the third transaction in three years between mBank and PGGM.

The transaction represents an important milestone for mBank and is executed shortly following the announcement of mBank’s new strategy for 2026-2030 titled “Full Speed Ahead!”. The transaction will help the bank advance its sustainability agenda. In the strategy, the bank aims to allocate 15% of its corporate credit portfolio to sustainable finance by 2030, contributing to the energy transition of the Polish economy.

For PGGM and its end investor PFZW, the transaction offers a unique opportunity to support the energy transition in Central and Eastern Europe. It reflects PGGM’s and PFZW’s long-standing commitment to contribute to Sustainable Development Goals in the context of PFZW’s 3D investment approach, while strengthening the strategic relationship with mBank.

The transaction has been structured in accordance with the European Union’s regulatory framework for significant risk transfer (SRT), ensuring compliance with capital relief requirements.

Luca Paonessa, Lead Portfolio Manager, Credit Risk Sharing at PGGM: “This is the third transaction we execute with mBank, and the first with a strong focus on sustainability and energy transition. We are particularly proud of this project, as it reinforces two of our investment principles: the focus on partnerships with like-minded banks, and the belief that banks can play a critical role in the energy transition. Ultimately, this shows that credit risk sharing is an effective tool for mobilizing private capital for sustainable development. It therefore fits perfectly in PGGM’s 3D investment approach where we aim for an optimal balance between risk, return and sustainability for PFZW’s pension assets.”

Karol Prażmo, Managing Director - Treasury & Investor Relations at mBank: “We are proud to be once again writing SRT market history together with PGGM—this time through the first large-scale project finance SRT from the CEE region, backed by a portfolio of renewable energy projects. The transaction strengthens our capital base, builds on our position as a leading bank in the renewables sector, increases our capacity for new business, and more broadly supports Poland’s energy transition. It reflects the shared strategic focus of both mBank and PGGM on sustainability and ESG. I would like to thank the entire PGGM and mBank team for successfully closing this landmark transaction.”

[TITLE]AI Data Centers Build Their Own Power Plants Because the Grid Isn’t Ready:
[TEXT]
Tech companies are creating an energy Wild West grabbing land and turbines.

Desperate for Electricity

The Wall Street Journal reports AI Data Centers, Desperate for Electricity, Building Their Own Power Plants

In West Texas, natural-gas-fired power generation is under construction as part of the $500 billion Stargate project from OpenAI and Oracle (ORCL). Gas turbines are in use at Colossus 1 and 2, the massive data centers Elon Musk’s xAI is building in Memphis, Tenn. More than a dozen Equinix (EQIX) data centers across the country are using fuel cells for power.

With the push for AI dominance at warp speed, the “Bring Your Own Power” boom is a quick fix for the gridlock of trying to get on the grid. It’s driving an energy Wild West that is reshaping American power.

Most tech titans would be happy to trade their DIY sourcing for the ability to plug into the electric grid. But supply-chain snarls and permitting challenges are complicating everything, and the U.S. isn’t building transmission infrastructure or power plants fast enough to meet the sudden surge in demand for electricity.

Data centers have long taken power for granted, said KR Sridhar, founder and chief executive of Bloom Energy (BE) which provides fuel cells to companies that need on-site power, often in a hurry. “You build the data center. Well, you just plug it in.”

That isn’t possible anymore given the city-sized amounts of electricity needed to train AI models. One data center can devour as much electricity as 1,000 Walmart stores, and an AI search can use 10 times the amount of energy as a google search.

President Trump in January declared a national energy emergency, in part to keep the U.S. from falling behind China in the AI race. He has issued a series of related executive orders including one that aims to fast-track data-center construction and needed power infrastructure.

China will invest twice as much as the U.S. this year in power plants, storage and the grid, according to the International Energy Agency. It added

[TITLE]New Trump Administration Energy Rule Would Enable Data Centers with ‘Large Loads’:
[TEXT]
Data centers are being built with unprecedented gusto all over the U.S. The reason for this is fairly well known: the AI business requires gargantuan amounts of electricity and computing power. Every time you use an app like DALL-E to, say, make one of those dumb AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse committing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, you’re apparently using as much energy as it takes to charge an iPhone. Now picture how much electricity is being used if millions of Americans do it at the same time.

The Trump administration has made it known that it’s a friend to the AI industry (it recently launched the AI infrastructure initiative Stargate) and so, it makes perfect sense that its Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, has decided to cut the red tape when it comes to hooking data centers up to the electrical grid.

In a statement published Friday, the Energy Department announced its plan to amend current rules to allow organizations that consume a lot of electricity to connect to the grid much faster: “U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today to initiate rulemaking procedures with a proposed rule to rapidly accelerate the interconnection of large loads, including data centers, positioning the United States to lead in AI innovation and in the revitalization of domestic manufacturing.”

Hear that, guys? Chris Wright is apparently such a big fan of large loads that, in a bout of deregulatory fervor, he’s now helping to usher in a new era of easier data center connection. While the specifics of Wright’s proposed rule are a little bit complicated, the obvious takeaway seems to be an effort to make the regulatory process less onerous on people who want to hook up a lot of servers to the grid. The Register notes that one proposed rule is to “limit the time taken to review connection decisions to 60 days,” ostensibly so applicants don’t get bogged down in a lengthy review process.

Duke Energy Corporation (DUK) Price Target Raised by $9 at Morgan Stanley

Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) engages in the distribution of natural gas and energy-related services.

Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) received a boost on October 22 when Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro raised the stock’s price target from $127 to $136, while maintaining an ‘Equal Weight’ rating on its shares. The update is a part of the firm revising its price targets for Regulated & Diversified Utilities / IPPs in North America under its coverage. The firm highlighted that the utilities sector outperformed the S&P last month. The analyst expects a key focus for the sector to be on the evolution of data center pipelines in the upcoming Q3 reports and will be looking for comments around interconnection times.

Backed by government-regulated rate structures, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK)’s stable cash flows have allowed it to pay dividends for 99 consecutive years as of late 2025. Moreover, Duke currently has a massive $83 billion investment program underway to expand its transmission and distribution network, enabling it to grow its EPS at a rate of 5% to 7% through 2029. The growth in earnings should allow the utility to continue increasing its shareholder distributions.

While we acknowledge the potential of DUK as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
