[TITLE]Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission blocks 3.2 GW coal power plan, citing clean energy push:
[TEXT]
The power regulator of Rajasthan, India’s largest solar power producer, has refused permission for a proposed 3,200-megawatt coal power project, saying it conflicts with clean energy goals and lacks justification under demand forecasts, a filing showed.

The Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission said in an order published on Thursday it had dismissed a petition by state-run Rajasthan Urja Vikas and IT Services Ltd seeking approval to procure coal power for 25 years through bidding.

The utility argued the new capacity was needed to meet rising round-the-clock demand.

However, the regulator said the proposal was inconsistent with the Central Electricity Authority’s latest Resource Adequacy Plan.

The Resource Adequacy Plan estimates Rajasthan will require only 1,905 MW of additional coal capacity by 2035-36, far less than the 3,200 MW sought.

The decision comes even as other Indian states are accelerating their coal power purchases, citing strong power demand and the need for round-the-clock, base-load power.

The Rajasthan power regulator also noted upcoming nuclear projects, large-scale solar additions and battery storage plans would ease supply gaps for the state.

Long-term coal contracts could lock in costly power and undermine renewable integration, the commission said in its order.

The commission warned that locking in coal for 25 years could burden consumers with high tariffs and worsen air quality, as the proposed plant would burn about 40,000 tonnes of coal daily, releasing hundreds of tonnes of particulate matter.

It also flagged renewable energy curtailment as a persistent issue and advised the state to maximize the use of its solar and wind resources before adding new coal capacity.

[TITLE]Heed electricity, gas safety during floods, Energy Commission cautions:
[TEXT]
PUTRAJAYA: The Energy Commission has reminded the public to remain vigilant and prioritise electricity and gas safety during the current flood season.

In a statement Monday (Nov 24), the commission said floods pose various risks, including fallen electricity poles, broken power lines, and damage to electrical and gas equipment. It also outlined several safety measures to be taken before, during and after a flood.

“If instructed to evacuate, place electrical appliances in a high and safe location to prevent them from being submerged. Switch off the main power supply at the electrical distribution board, as well as any installations connected separately from the main switch, such as solar PV systems, electric fences or electric vehicle chargers. Also, close the valves of gas cylinders or piped gas," it said.

The commission further advised the public to avoid areas with submerged electrical lines or installations, such as substations and switch rooms, and to refrain from touching poles or any structures that carry electricity.

It also reminded the public not to move fallen electricity poles or severed power lines, but instead to report them immediately to the electricity utility provider.

To ensure the safe use of electricity and gas after a flood, the main switch on the electrical distribution board and gas line valves must be turned off before any cleaning work begins.

"Before switching the main supply back on, ensure that all electrical equipment is in good condition and completely dry. Always remain cautious when carrying out post-flood cleaning activities near electrical lines, installation structures or piped gas systems.

"Avoid using any electrical or gas equipment if its safety is uncertain. If you are still in doubt, seek the assistance of an electrical or gas contractor registered with the Energy Commission," the statement said.

The public is also reminded to keep important emergency numbers, including the police, the fire and rescue department, the hospital and utility service providers, easily accessible at all times.

Green Hydrogen: An Alternative That Reduces Emissions And Cares For Our Planet

The decarbonisation of the planet is among the objectives that countries around the world have set for 2050. The production of green hydrogen, a technology based on the transformation of this element through electrolysis, is one of the keys. The IEA estimates that it would make it possible to save the 830 million tonnes of CO2 per year that originate when this gas is produced using fossil fuels.

Our way of life needs an increasing amount of watts to function. The war in Ukraine has caused a global energy crisis due to the lack of fossil fuels. This has led to an unprecedented rise in the price of natural gas and coal, causing Europe to import much more liquefied natural gas than usual, with the attendant problem of worsening climate change. However, decarbonising the planet suggests a different world in 2050: one that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable, and driven by clean energies such as green hydrogen.

Advantages And Disadvantages Of Green Hydrogen Market

This energy source has pros and cons that we must be aware of. Let's go over some of its most important good points:

100 % sustainable: green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production.

green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production. Storable: hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production.

hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production. Versatile: green hydrogen can be transformed into electricity or synthetic gas and used for commercial, industrial or mobility purposes.

However, green hydrogen also has negative aspects that should be borne in mind:

High cost: energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain.

energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain. High energy consumption: the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels.

the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels. Safety issues: hydrogen is a highly volatile and flammable element and extensive safety measures are therefore required to prevent leakage and explosions.

Impact of green hydrogen

Hydrogen as a fuel is a reality in countries like the United States, Russia, China, France and Germany. Others like Japan are going even further and aspire to become a hydrogen economy. Below we explain what the impact will be in the future:

Electricity and drinking water generator : These two elements are obtained by reacting hydrogen and oxygen together in a fuel cell. This process has proved very useful on space missions, for example, by providing crews with water and electricity in a sustainable manner.

Energy storage : Compressed hydrogen tanks are capable of storing energy for long periods of time and are also easier to handle than lithium-ion batteries because they are lighter.

Transport and mobility : Hydrogen's great versatility allows it to be used in those consumption niches that are very difficult to decarbonise, such as heavy transport, aviation and maritime transport. There are already several projects under way in this area, such as Hycarus and Cryoplane, which are promoted by the European Union (EU) and aim to introduce it in passenger aircraft.

[TITLE]Libya Reopens Its Oil Patch and Big Oil Shows Up:
[TEXT]
U.S. and European oil and gas majors are back to doing business in Libya, a decade after pulling out as civil war engulfed one of the top oil producers and the biggest oil resource holder in Africa.

Amid a relatively calm security situation this year, Libya launched its first bid round for oil and gas exploration in 18 years.

The previous such bid round was held in 2007, four years before the toppling of Muammar Ghaddafi in 2011, which led to a protracted civil war in the country with various factions and tribal interests vying for control of key institutions and major oilfields.

More than a decade after the ousting of Ghaddafi, Libya remains divided with an UN-recognized government based in Tripoli and forces loyal to strongman Khalifa Haftar in the east, where several of Libya’s key oil-producing fields and export terminals are located. Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA) have long been backed by Russia, which shifted focus to Libya after the toppling of Bashar al-Assad in Syria at the end of last year.

Senior officials of the Tripoli government visited Washington D.C. last week to boost the strategic U.S.-Libya partnership and bilateral relations. And reportedly, to convince the U.S. that Libya needs its help to reduce Russian influence and become a reliable energy partner for Western companies, including the U.S. supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron.

Big Oil Lines Up for Big Contracts in Libya

Exxon, Chevron, and the top European oil and gas majors have recently signed deals with Libya to return to exploration and production in the country. Big Oil is also bidding in Libya’s first exploration bid round in 18 years.

Libya is offering a total of 22 blocks for exploration and development, 11 offshore and 11 onshore blocks, which are believed to hold huge untapped resources. The acreage up for grabs is close to existing infrastructure, which would enable cost-effective exploration and development, and efficient production for global markets, Libya says.

The country has also introduced new, more attractive fiscal conditions for the production sharing agreements it will offer to the successful bidders.

Libya’s crude oil production currently exceeds 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), the National Oil Corporation (NOC) says.

The corporation looks to boost oil production to 2 million bpd within the next three years, “contingent on sufficient funding.”

The landmark bid round is now in its final stages, and the international majors, including Chevron, Eni, Repsol, Shell, and TotalEnergies, are all pre-qualified to bid in the exploration tender.

Foreign majors have recently made steps to return to operations in Libya.

BP and Eni, for example, returned to Libya last year after a decade of avoiding the country amid its civil war.

Per a statement by the NOC of Libya, Italy’s Eni resumed exploratory drilling in the Ghadames Basin in October 2024. The company operates the exploration block where it is drilling in partnership with BP and the Libyan Investment Authority—the country’s sovereign wealth fund.

This year, NOC signed agreements with BP and Shell to explore and evaluate the oil and gas potential of several fields. BP will conduct studies to assess the potential for exploration and production in the Messla and Sarir fields, as well as in some surrounding exploration areas. Shell, for its part, will evaluate prospects and conduct a comprehensive technical and economic feasibility study to develop the al-Atshan field and other fields fully owned by the NOC.

Exxon also signed a preliminary deal for exploration at four offshore blocks in Libya. At the signing of the agreement, NOC said that “It is worth noting that ExxonMobil was one of the companies that expressed interest in participating in the public bidding round initiated by the NOC for exploration in Libya, which includes 22 offshore and onshore blocks available for investment.”

Chevron is also considering opportunities in Libya, chief executive Mike Wirth said on the supermajor’s investor day earlier this month.

“The thing that is interesting today is, there are a number of opportunities out there in terms of new country entries. We've had discussions underway that have been reported in the media, so I can acknowledge these in Libya,” Wirth told analysts.

Libya Looks to Advance Strategic Partnership with U.S.

Simultaneously with the first bid round in nearly two decades, Libya is pitching its oil industry to the U.S. as an alternative to Russian oil and solving the problem with Haftar’s army controlling areas in the country containing critical reserves and infrastructure, Libyan officials told the Financial Times during last week’s visit to Washington.

“We have a problem,” senior Libyan official Mahmoud Ahmed Alfiste told FT, noting that while NOC is recognized as the only legitimate entity as a custodian of Libya’s production and exports, “Haftar and his sons are controlling” areas with some critical reserves.

Libya’s Finance Minister, Khaled Al-Mabrouk, who was part of the delegation on the visit to the U.S., said, “We look forward to substantial and sustained dialogue with our U.S. partners to invest in Libya's transformation and to join in supporting a unified, stable Libya that benefits both countries’ strategic interests and the stability and growth of the wider region.”

The return of Big Oil to Libya suggests international majors believe in Libya’s potential and could be the first step toward the economic revival in the North African oil producer and exporter.

[TITLE]Why an ASEAN power grid is key to tapping Southeast Asia’s green potential:
[TEXT]
The International Energy Agency reports that energy demand across Southeast Asia rose at twice the global average rate in 2024 and finds that consumption is set to double by 2050. To maintain rising living standards, economies across the region are pushing into higher-value and more energy-intense industries, data centres being one obvious example.

That creates a problem.

The ASEAN nations enjoy vast but as yet largely untapped potential for renewable energy, especially PV solar, and onshore and offshore wind. The IEA puts potential supply at 20 terawatts, roughly 55 times the region’s present generation capacity. And this energy would be cheap. But the increase in overall demand is for now far outpacing new supply from renewables. Until that changes, ASEAN nations remain dependent on rising fossil fuel imports that expose them to price risk, potential supply disruptions, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

Asian corporate executives have focused recently on coping with tariffs and trade restrictions, potential supply chain disruptions and geopolitical insecurity—rather than energy and power. In the latest EY-Parthenon Global CEO Outlook survey, Asia-Pacific CEOs expressed greater unease than their peers in Europe and the Americas

[TITLE]Turkey will host the next UN climate summit – here’s how it plans to use its moment in the spotlight:
[TEXT]
In a break from tradition, the next major UN climate summit will be hosted by Turkey but chaired by a different country, Australia. This is the first split arrangement in three decades of these summits, known as “Cops”. The unusual deal, devised to avoid diplomatic tension, highlights new alliances to fight climate change globally.

Cop31 will take place late next year in the Mediterranean city of Antalya. While a representative from Turkey will be formally elected as “the president”, Australia will appoint a vice-president to lead the negotiations.

The agreement was reached after almost a full year of stalemate, as both countries had refused to withdraw their bids to host. Turkey had previously stepped back from its bid to host Cop26, which ultimately took place in Glasgow in 2021. For this reason, it was determined to serve as host this time to represent developing nations, as a bridge between Asia and Europe.

Australia, by contrast, aimed to highlight the concerns of endangered Pacific island states through its role in the event. The final agreement between the two countries is unusual, yet it may open the door to greater pluralism and new forms of partnership.

Turkey’s role as host is distinct not only because of the unique arrangement with Australia, but also due to its unique position within the UN’s climate convention. Turkey signed the Paris agreement in 2016 but delayed ratifying it for five years.

As a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) – a group of largely high-income countries – Turkey was formally treated by the Paris agreement as an “industrialised” nation. That meant it was expected to provide financial support for emissions reduction efforts in developing nations – an obligation it disputed.

In 2021, Turkey finally secured a unique recognition as the only developing country among a list of OECD countries (known as annex I), allowing it to finally ratify the treaty.

This status still creates practical challenges. Unlike other developing countries, Turkey has only limited access to international climate finance such as the Green Climate Fund. As Ankara consistently raised the demand to be removed from annex 1, it is likely that the issue will surface during the Cop31 discussions.

Energy politics, climate ambitions

Sitting at the intersection of Europe, the Middle East and central Asia, Turkey also serves as a critical link for major oil and natural gas pipelines from Russia and the Caspian Sea to Europe.

As Europe seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian energy, its growing reliance on alternative routes has increased Turkey’s strategic significance. This geopolitical leverage shapes how Turkey approaches its climate diplomacy – and what it is likely to prioritise at Cop31.

After ratifying the Paris agreement, Turkey announced its target of reaching net zero emissions by 2053. There are credible proposals to phase out coal by 2030, while Turkey passed a “climate law” earlier this year to provide a legal framework for these transitions.

ARTEM ARTEMENKO / shutterstock

However, the feasibility of these targets remains uncertain. Partly, that’s because Turkey has an inconsistent record on complying with international law. But it’s also because the country’s energy production is booming.

Turkey is the world’s 15th-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, producing around 400 million to 500 million tonnes annually. Emissions are expected to keep rising as energy demand continues to increase in parallel with economic growth.

Although growth slowed after a 2018 currency crisis and the COVID shock, energy use is still projected to increase – just not as sharply as in the 2000s and early 2010s. Turkey’s pledge to cut emissions 40% by 2030 should therefore be understood as a reduction relative to a rising baseline.

As the economy boomed in the 2000s, Turkey more than doubled its energy generation capacity, with growth peaking in 2013. Wind and solar capacity grew rapidly, from virtually zero in the 1990s to around 17% in 2025, but most of the new capacity came from power plants fuelled by natural gas.

As the country pledged to phase out coal by 2030, coal plants were not prioritised during this expansion. Yet, the proliferation of gas power raises significant concerns about sustainability.

Adding to this uncertainty, a 2023 amendment now allows mining in previously protected forest areas, raising questions about whether Turkey’s legal framework can support a reliable and credible transition to net zero emissions.

All this means that when attention shifts to Antalya next year, Turkey will be under pressure to show its ambitious climate targets are more than just words. The world will be watching to see if a country so embedded in the global fossil fuel trade can help broker a deal that accelerates the end of that era.

[TITLE]Indian Power Regulator Urged to Delay Stricter Clean Energy Rules:
[TEXT]
India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has urged the country’s federal power regulator to delay the implementation of new rules for clean energy generators to stick to their commitments to supply electricity to the grid.

The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) earlier this year proposed to introduce stricter rules for wind and solar power generators to ensure a minimum gap between their estimates of power delivered to the grid and the actual electricity they send.

The deviation has been an issue in India’s grids as the share of renewable energy, especially solar power, is rising in the electricity mix.

However, the uncertainty in predicting power generation from renewable energy sources threatens to lead to grid imbalances.

CERC in September proposed stricter rules on generators’ planning and forecasting to take effect from April 2026, and gradually reduce the permissible gap between forecasts and actual supply.

But India’s renewable energy ministry said a recent letter to the CERC, reviewed by Reuters, that errors in forecasts cannot be avoided as they are mostly the result of the unpredictable nature of solar and wind power generation. Therefore, introducing penalties for deviations would be “imprudent”, the ministry said in the letter.

It said the deviation charges could “have a catastrophic effect” on the currently booming clean energy industry.

India’s renewables developers have also warned that CERC’s proposed stricter rules would harm investment in renewable energy.

India added a record 22 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity in the first half of 2025, up by 57% from a year earlier, according to Rystad Energy data. Solar led the newly-added capacity with 18.4 GW installations, followed by 3.5 GW of wind, and 250 megawatts (MW) of bioenergy generated from plant and animal waste.

In July, India boasted achieving five years ahead of schedule its target to have 50% of its installed electricity capacity coming from non-fossil fuel sources.

Green Hydrogen: An Alternative That Reduces Emissions And Cares For Our Planet

The decarbonisation of the planet is among the objectives that countries around the world have set for 2050. The production of green hydrogen, a technology based on the transformation of this element through electrolysis, is one of the keys. The IEA estimates that it would make it possible to save the 830 million tonnes of CO2 per year that originate when this gas is produced using fossil fuels.

Our way of life needs an increasing amount of watts to function. The war in Ukraine has caused a global energy crisis due to the lack of fossil fuels. This has led to an unprecedented rise in the price of natural gas and coal, causing Europe to import much more liquefied natural gas than usual, with the attendant problem of worsening climate change. However, decarbonising the planet suggests a different world in 2050: one that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable, and driven by clean energies such as green hydrogen.

Advantages And Disadvantages Of Green Hydrogen Market

This energy source has pros and cons that we must be aware of. Let's go over some of its most important good points:

100 % sustainable: green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production.

green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production. Storable: hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production.

hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production. Versatile: green hydrogen can be transformed into electricity or synthetic gas and used for commercial, industrial or mobility purposes.

However, green hydrogen also has negative aspects that should be borne in mind:

High cost: energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain.

High energy consumption: the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels.

the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels. Safety issues: hydrogen is a highly volatile and flammable element and extensive safety measures are therefore required to prevent leakage and explosions.

Impact of green hydrogen

Hydrogen as a fuel is a reality in countries like the United States, Russia, China, France and Germany. Others like Japan are going even further and aspire to become a hydrogen economy. Below we explain what the impact will be in the future:

Electricity and drinking water generator : These two elements are obtained by reacting hydrogen and oxygen together in a fuel cell. This process has proved very useful on space missions, for example, by providing crews with water and electricity in a sustainable manner.

Energy storage : Compressed hydrogen tanks are capable of storing energy for long periods of time and are also easier to handle than lithium-ion batteries because they are lighter.

Transport and mobility : Hydrogen's great versatility allows it to be used in those consumption niches that are very difficult to decarbonise, such as heavy transport, aviation and maritime transport. There are already several projects under way in this area, such as Hycarus and Cryoplane, which are promoted by the European Union (EU) and aim to introduce it in passenger aircraft.

[TITLE]Electricity Price Squeeze: Something’s Going to Give:
[TEXT]
Using current economic trends to predict the future can be misleading, since all trends are subject to limits and countertrends. In this article, I’ll apply that truism to a trend that a lot of people are talking about—soaring electricity prices in the United States.

Across the US, electricity prices are rising more than twice as fast as the overall cost of living. The main driver of costs is the enormous electricity demand of over a thousand new data centers, built mostly for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Each data center, depending on its size, requires anywhere from a few kilowatts up to 100 megawatts of power (enough to power a medium-sized city). Installations of new data centers are growing at more than 10 percent annually; at that rate, the total number of data centers will double in less than seven years. Indeed, the International Energy Agency expects global electricity demand from data centers to double by the end of this decade, when it will total more than the entire electricity demand of Japan. Goldman Sachs Research predicts that 60 percent of this increased demand will be met by fossil fuel sources.

Understanding why rising electricity demand from data centers is a serious problem requires more than a glance at your latest utility bill. Energy isn’t just one of many inputs into the economy; in effect, it is the economy, since doing anything requires it. Of all the energy used in the US and globally, only a little over 20 percent is in the form of electricity; the rest entails the direct burning of fossil fuels (most electricity is generated also by burning fossil fuels; in the US, 60 percent of electricity comes from fossil fuel sources—mostly natural gas). Electricity is not a direct source of energy; it’s an energy carrier. But, for households and industries alike, it is an extremely useful way of conveying energy to end users. Just flip a switch or push a button and electricity makes something happen. It does many things for us, but its role in enabling communications and data processing gives electricity a pivotal importance in the overall energy mix of modern society.

Energy usage for data processing and communications doesn’t tend to rise and fall in response to short-term changes in power prices; economists call it “inelastic.” So, when electricity prices soar, households and businesses must adjust. For households, that typically means buying fewer discretionary consumer products; for businesses, it means raising prices for services or goods. The whole economy grinds slower. We have a storied history of recessions in 1973, 1979, and 2008 that were related to rising fossil fuel prices impacting the entire economy (see photos of gasoline lines and shortages from 1973). What happened with fossil fuels could happen with electricity: as electricity assumes a central role in our energy system, future price spikes could conceivably be as crippling as the OPEC oil embargoes of the 1970s.

Growing electricity demand for data centers is also a problem because of climate change. Almost all of society’s “progress” in reducing emissions has been in the electricity generation sector (e.g., using solar panels instead of coal to generate electricity). But if electricity demand grows fast, that makes it harder to continue increasing renewables’ share of electricity generation: demand spikes put utility companies in panic mode, so they deploy any new generating capacity they can quickly obtain—and, so far, they’re resorting to new natural gas turbines more often than new wind projects or solar arrays.

Data centers may be a largely unforeseen disruption to an enormous project that energy planners call the energy transition. As society moves away from fossil fuels, more of its energy usage will occur via electricity—which is the energy output of solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric dams. The transition depends on an ongoing electrification of the economy, starting with electric vehicles. With data centers sucking up so much electricity, it becomes all the harder to deploy electricity to other uses and sectors, which is what planners had been counting on.

Electricity prices can’t keep going up and up. Something’s got to give. Let’s first explore the more obvious solutions to the electricity price dilemma, and then the systemic limits and countervailing trends that will determine which of those solutions is more feasible and likely. I’ll finish by proposing a hybrid supply/demand response that would minimize the economic pain of high electricity prices while putting the country on a more sustainable path.

More Electricity Demand? Just Increase Supply!

The obvious solution to rising electricity prices is to meet new demand with new supply. Just generate more power. What energy sources are available for that purpose?

(US electricity generation by energy source, US Department of Energy. The Trump DoE may have stopped updating its data, as its website features no graph carrying these trendlines forward to 2024.)

Natural gas is currently the main energy source for electricity generation in the US, and its share of total generation has grown sharply in recent years. Also, the US is the world’s biggest gas producer. Further, natural gas is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, though it still produces carbon emissions. These factors together make natural gas the obvious solution for most utility companies. But there are some caveats regarding the future of natural gas, which we’ll unpack in the next section when we explore limits and countertrends.

Nuclear power has been stagnant in the US for the past three decades: 12 commercial reactors were retired between 2013 and 2021, and two new ones (in Georgia) were recently put into service. The average age of US nuclear plants is 42 years. The nuclear industry, eager for a comeback, has proposed construction of small modular reactors (SMRs) that would allegedly be cheaper and safer than existing nuclear plants, which typically have been slow and costly to build and have been targeted by citizen opposition due to safety concerns. However, the industry’s rosy claims for SMRs are disputed. In the meantime, Microsoft has partnered with the owners of the Three Mile Island nuclear facility, site of the worst nuclear disaster in US history.

Renewables consist mostly of solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. Power generation in this sector is expanding quickly, but likely not enough to avert supply shortages or price spikes if AI keeps growing at its current pace. The Trump administration is doing all it can to stall the further expansion of renewables, which continues despite these headwinds. Trump’s opposition to renewables appears to be political rather than economic, perhaps aimed to repay campaign donations from fossil fuel companies. The oil industry’s drilling technology could be used for deep geothermal electricity generation, the potential scale of which is enormous. The first commercial plants are now under construction; upfront costs are projected to be high, with low and stable operational costs. However, scaling up deep geothermal production to a significant fraction of the nation’s electricity supply might take decades.

Coal has seen a dramatic and relentless fall in its share of overall power generation in the US (though not in China or India). This is due not just to the pollution and climate policies of previous federal administrations. Fuel supply issues (most of America’s higher-quality coal is already largely depleted), together with cheaper natural gas, have persuaded most electric utility companies that coal is a fuel of the past. The Trump administration is calling for a return to coal, but few utility companies appear to be listening. That’s likely because the federal push for new coal power plants seems driven more by an appeal to voters in mining states like West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, and Wyoming than by economics.

None of those supply solutions seems ideal. Moreover, before we try to choose a candidate and say, “problem solved,” it’s essential that we examine limits and countertrends that could cause the current electricity price trajectory to shift.

Why the Electricity Price Trend Could Change

US electricity prices could rise even faster, or the current trend could go into reverse and electricity could get cheaper. What are the foreseeable limits or countertrends that could lead to either of those outcomes?

One factor is natural gas prices, which have been relatively low and stable for the past couple of decades; indeed, adjusted for inflation, they have declined significantly. This has been due to rising North American shale gas supplies released by fracking. Cheap natural gas, in turn, has kept US electricity prices relatively stable until recently. Now, however, two factors are contributing to a likely increase in natural gas prices.

The first is the growth of the US liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry. Currently Europe is, for political and security reasons, phasing out Russian natural gas delivered by pipeline. Instead, Europeans are buying more LNG imported by tanker, a costly substitute. Gas producers in the US, flush with shale gas, are eager to serve these new customers, who are willing to pay much more for natural gas than Americans do currently. So, new LNG export terminals are springing up on the US Gulf Coast, with some already shipping their first cargoes. With a growing share of US natural gas being exported (projected to be over 10 percent of total production by 2030), domestic prices for the fuel will likely rise, forcing gas-burning utility companies to hike up electricity prices further and faster.

Meanwhile, America’s shale gas miracle may soon start to peter out. As I noted in a recent article, shale gas fields suffer from rapid depletion of individual wells and thus require high rates of drilling. Most US shale gas regions have already passed their peak of production and are in their plateau or decline phase of extraction. One prominent resource analytics firm forecasts that total US shale gas production will peak between 2027 and 2030. If natural gas production falls, it may be difficult for other electricity sources to grow fast enough to avert power supply problems or rate hikes.

A factor that could conceivably slow electricity price increases, or perhaps even cause prices to fall, is investors’ potential unwillingness to further finance the buildout of AI. In recent months, many Wall Street analysts have expressed dismay at the expanding gap between AI spending—projected to hit $1.5 trillion this year—and actual revenues for companies developing and using AI. Many investors now believe AI stocks are a financial bubble whose bursting could cause a recession or depression for the entire US economy, even the global economy.

A bursting AI bubble could at least temporarily halt electricity price increases tied to new data centers. But it might be a dreadful “solution,” especially for people who are neither wealthy nor politically connected. Past financial crises have been stanched with bailouts for banks and investors, thereby transferring wealth from the public to risk-taking entrepreneurs, while ordinary folks deal with job losses and vanishing retirement nest eggs.

A Better Solution to Unaffordable Electricity

Any realistic solution to soaring electricity prices must address both supply and demand.

Supply: Of the sources of energy for electricity generation, renewables make the most sense, even though they are subject to their own limits and drawbacks, including unsustainable requirements for scarce raw materials and major concerns
