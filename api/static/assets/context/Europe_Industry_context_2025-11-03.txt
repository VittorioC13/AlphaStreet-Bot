[TITLE]GlobalFoundries Plans Billion-Euro Investment to Expand Chip Manufacturing in Germany:
[TEXT]
GlobalFoundries (GF) today announced plans to invest €1.1 billion to expand its manufacturing capabilities at its Dresden, Germany site. The investment will enable a production capacity increase to more than one million wafers per year by the end of 2028, making it the largest site of its kind in Europe.The expansion, known as project SPRINT, is expected to be supported by the German federal government and the State of Saxony under the framework of the European Chips Act, with EU approval for the full program expected later this year. This investment underscores Saxony's role as a critical hub for semiconductor manufacturing and innovation and reinforces Europe's strategic goal of supply chain resilience.As a part of the project, the facility will be upgraded to offer end-to-end European processes and data flows for critical semiconductor security requirements.Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as part of his visit to GF Dresden on 28 October, welcomed the planned investments in Germany: "The SPRINT project is a commitment to Germany as an industrial and innovation location - and above all to the sovereignty of our country and Europe. The investment in chip manufacturing in Dresden sends a signal that Germany wants to play an active role in shaping the development of the global semiconductor market. Germany already plays a leading role in microelectronics in Europe. With its national microelectronics strategy, the federal government is setting the course for further expanding this strength."Saxony's Minister President Michael Kretschmer adds: "The further expansion of semiconductor manufacturing here at GlobalFoundries is a clear commitment to a unique location. The billion-euro investment is more good news for Silicon Saxony, Europe's most important microelectronics location, and demonstrates the attractiveness and dynamism of the cluster that has grown here. This will not only strengthen the Saxon economy—Germany and Europe will also benefit. After all, more chips manufactured here also means more German and European sovereignty and technological independence in this key industry. Germany's economic vulnerability due to excessive dependencies is currently being demonstrated by the example of chip manufacturer Nexperia."The new manufacturing capacity will focus on GF's highly differentiated technologies - with critical performance features including low power, embedded secure memory, and wireless connectivity - all essential for meeting Europe's chip demand for automotive, internet of things (IoT), defense and critical infrastructure applications. These sectors are being rapidly transformed by the rise of physical AI technologies for which GF's semiconductors are essential. The investment will also support continued innovation in next-generation compute architectures and quantum technologies as they scale into the next decade."Recent disruptions in the automotive sector underscore just how vulnerable global chip supply chains truly are. Our planned expansion in Dresden is yet another step in GF's strategy to address these challenges head-on and deliver on our commitment to support Europe's need for secure supply chains and differentiated technologies," said Tim Breen, CEO of GlobalFoundries. "By scaling our manufacturing footprint in Europe, in the U.S. and around the world, GF is reinforcing its role as a resilient and trusted partner to customers in critical industries and building a foundation for the next wave of innovation as physical AI becomes reality."Dr. Manfred Horstmann, senior vice president and general manager European fabs at GlobalFoundries, adds: "With this planned investment, we are deepening our commitment to Germany and Europe. Expanding cleanroom capacity is not just

[TITLE]Development Finance Must Shift Away from Aid:
[TEXT]
As traditional donors slash foreign-aid budgets, developing countries must mobilize a broader range of financing sources. National development banks, sovereign wealth funds, debt swaps, and public-private partnerships can foster sustainable investment and help reduce energy poverty.

BEIJING – Traditional donors have sharply scaled back their aid commitments to developing countries over the past year. Some, like the United States, have virtually eliminated their aid programs. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), official development assistance (ODA) from member countries declined by 7.1% in 2024, its first annual drop in six years.

This trend was not limited to a few major donors. Of the 33 members of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC), 22 slashed their aid budgets, and only four countries met the United Nations’ target of allocating 0.7% of gross national income to ODA.

The outlook for the coming year offers little hope for improvement, as major DAC donors have announced additional cuts. Most notably, US President Donald Trump’s administration has suspended most foreign aid and dismantled the Agency for International Development (USAID), which dispersed most US government aid dollars.

Meanwhile, the United Kingdom plans to reduce aid spending from 0.5% of GNI to 0.3% by 2027. Similar retrenchment across Europe and North America is reshaping international assistance, disrupting humanitarian and climate-related programs, and creating financing gaps in critical sectors such as health, education, and clean energy.

In our 2017 book Going Beyond Aid, we urged developing-country governments to reduce their dependence on foreign aid, not only because it was becoming an unreliable source of funding, but also because other, better ways of financing development were becoming more available. That message is more urgent than ever.

As reliance on aid becomes untenable, the international community must mobilize a broader array of financing sources to advance green and sustainable growth. This includes national development banks, industrial investment funds, sovereign wealth funds, and institutional investment in public markets, as well as innovative mechanisms such as debt swaps and public-private partnerships (PPPs). These tools can unlock domestic resources, attract long-term investors, and create synergies between public goals and private capital.

Equity investment offers a promising avenue for engaging non-traditional development partners while reducing developing countries’ dependence on debt. Government investment funds, public and private financial institutions, and other private actors can participate by taking equity stakes in public enterprises, financing infrastructure projects, or joining PPPs. Such participation not only alleviates debt burdens but also improves the performance and management of public assets.

As government-funded, mission-driven institutions, public development banks (PDBs) have the potential to provide patient capital for green and sustainable investment in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs). Building on the pioneering database of public development and financial institutions created by the Institute of New Structural Economics at Peking University, future research can identify effective ways to harness these institutions to fuel low-carbon growth.

Responding to growing demand from the economies of the Global South, development partners have increasingly adopted an “entire value chain” approach to the green transition in recent years. This strategy facilitates transfers of low-carbon technologies, diffusion of digital innovations (including trade in services), and industrial modernization, enabling countries included in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to accelerate their shift toward sustainable development.

Empirical research supports this approach. An analysis covering 139 countries finds that, following policy directives to incorporate green and low-carbon principles into the BRI, carbon intensity (CO ₂ emissions per unit of GDP) among participating countries declined significantly between 2013 and 2022. These findings are consistent with another recent study showing how China’s solar-energy expansion has helped transform Africa’s power sector.

Investment in infrastructure and industrial development can also generate positive spillover effects. Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa shows that the presence of at least one Chinese-financed infrastructure project in a second-order administrative region (comparable to a municipality) is associated with a 5% increase in nighttime luminosity – a widely used proxy for economic activity. Neighboring regions experienced a 10-15% rise in luminosity, indicating that the benefits of such projects extend well beyond the immediate investment site.

These outcomes underscore the critical role of infrastructure investment, particularly in energy and transportation projects. By improving electricity access, affordability, and connectivity, they reduce energy poverty, bolster public services, and stimulate economic activity in underserved areas.

To meet the evolving challenges of development finance, both traditional and non-traditional donors and creditors should move beyond aid and adopt multidimensional strategies that combine trade, investment, infrastructure, green technology, and digital connectivity, including fintech solutions, to support EMDEs. Importantly, such collaborations should be viewed as a mutual learning process in which partners assume complementary roles and shared responsibilities.

[TITLE]GTT : Q3 2025 Activity Update - Press Release:
[TEXT]
Revenue of 600 million euros for the first nine months of 2025, strong growth of 29%; annual objectives revised upwards

9M 2025 revenue: 599.6 million euros, up 29.0% vs. 9M 2024; +27.6% at constant scope

Order intake: 19 LNG carriers, 7 ethane carriers, 1 FLNG, 18 LNG-powered container ships and 1 LNG bunker vessel

Very strong pick-up of final investment decisions in LNG

Acquisition of Danelec completed on July 31, 2025

2025 objectives revised upwards: revenue in the range of 790–820 million euros and EBITDA in the range of 530–550 million euros

Paris, 31 October 2025. GTT, the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases, today announces its revenue for the first nine months of 2025.

Commenting on the results, Philippe Berterottière, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GTT, said: “The commercial performance of our core business remained robust during the first nine months of 2025, despite persistent geopolitical uncertainty. In the United States, the lifting of the moratorium on new LNG projects has spectacularly reignited investment decisions. Ten new liquefaction projects have been approved, including six in the United States, for a record capacity of 84 Mtpa. This momentum is driving a very significant increase in the need for new LNG carriers.

In the digital field, the acquisition of the Danish company Danelec, completed on 31 July 2025, positions GTT as a global leader in vessel performance management and Voyage Data Recorders. This transaction creates a new growth pillar for the Group, with strong complementarity with Ascenz Marorka and synergies, mainly through significant cross-sales expected in the medium term.

GTT’s innovation efforts continue. In September 2025, we launched GTT CubiqTM, a new LNG tank technology providing a concrete response to container-ship owner’s needs.

On the financial front, our revenue rose 29% over nine months, driven by the increase in the number of LNG carriers under construction. Given the strong performance of GTT’s core business and the contribution from Danelec, we are raising our 2025 objectives.”

Business activity over the first nine months of 2025

- LNG and ethane carriers: Commercial performance remains solid

Following a 2024 that marked the second record year in terms of order intake, and in an uncertain geopolitical environment, GTT achieved a solid commercial performance in its core business over the first nine months of 2025, with 19 LNG carrier orders and seven Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLEC) orders. This momentum confirms the resilience of global demand for LNG transport, supported by massive investment decisions in new liquefaction projects.

Notably, among these 19 LNG carrier orders, six are for ultra-large vessels (271,000 m³ compared with the standard 174,000 m³), placed with the Chinese shipyard Hudong-Zhonghua. These vessels will be fitted with GTT’s NO96 Super+ membrane containment system. Deliveries are scheduled between 2027 and 2031.

The seven VLECs ordered will each offer a total capacity of 100,000 m³, the largest to date for this type of vessel, and will feature GTT’s Mark III membrane containment system. Delivery of these ethane carriers will take place in 2027 and 2028, confirming the growing strength of the ethane market, driven by the expansion of global petrochemicals.

Over the period, GTT also received an order for one FLNG1 with a total capacity of 238,700 m³. Ordered by Samsung Heavy Industries, this FLNG will be deployed in Africa.

- LNG as fuel: Growth in the LNG-powered container ship market

The LNG as fuel market continues to develop in a context of intensifying competition from Chinese shipyards. In the first nine months of 2025, GTT recorded an order from HD Hyundai Heavy Industries for the design of cryogenic tanks (12,750 m³) for 12 new container ships, as well as an order from HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering for the design of cryogenic tanks (8,000 m³) for six new container ships. All of these LNG tanks will be fitted with GTT’s Mark III Flex membrane containment system, together with the “1 barg”2 design, which enables an operating pressure of 1 barg, compared to 0.7 barg previously. This technical innovation addresses forthcoming regulations requiring cold ironing at the quayside, confirming its added value for the maritime industry.

In the third quarter of 2025, GTT also received an order from Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. for the design of tanks for an LNG bunker vessel with a total capacity of 18,600 m³, scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of 2028.

- Digital: Strong commercial momentum and a change of scale with Danelec

GTT’s digital business experienced a marked acceleration over the first nine months of 2025. Several commercial successes confirmed the added value of the Group’s solutions. The TMS group selected Ascenz Marorka to equip its entire fleet of more than 130 vessels (oil tankers, bulk carriers, liquefied gas carriers and container ships) with its Smart Shipping solutions.

China Merchants Energy Shipping (CMES) also chose Ascenz Marorka to equip eight LNG carriers with a complete suite of onboard systems.

In addition, Ascenz Marorka extended its geographic reach with the opening of a new real-time fleet performance monitoring centre.

Finally, a decisive milestone was reached with the completion, on 31 July 2025, of the acquisition of Danelec, a major player in the collection and analysis of maritime data. Thanks to this transaction, GTT has become the global leader in vessel performance management and has joined the top tier of players in the critical Voyage Data Recorders (VDR) segment, now covering 15%3 of the global fleet. The integration of Danelec began rapidly and paves the way for accelerated growth driven by cross-sales, expected to reach between 25 and 30 million euros in 2030, thanks to the strong complementarity of the offerings of Danelec, Ascenz Marorka and VPS.

- Elogen: Completion of the restructuring

Following the strategic review of Elogen’s activities carried out at the beginning of the year, the information and consultation procedures with employee representative bodies were completed in July 2025. A workforce reduction plan, involving the elimination of 110 positions out of 160, has been implemented and will be finalised before the end of the year, mainly through voluntary departures. In parallel, the construction of the Gigafactory in Vendôme has been definitively halted. All provisions related to the restructuring were recorded in the first half of 2025.

The signing of a contract for the supply of a 1 MW stack and the partnership agreement with Rockfin to ramp up the rollout of hydrogen production systems in Europe are encouraging signals for Elogen’s future activity.

- Innovation: continuous development of new technologies

Innovation remains at the heart of GTT’s strategy, with several major advances recorded over the first nine months of 2025. The approvals recently granted by classification society reflect the international recognition of our solutions. At the Gastech exhibition in Milan in September 2025, GTT obtained an AiP4 from Bureau Veritas for its new GTT Cubiq™ tank technology for container ships. At the same occasion, GTT also received from Lloyd’s Register a second AiP for its optimized containment systems for ethane transportation as well as a General Approval5 for an improved version of the NO96 Super+ technology, confirming the Group’s ability to continuously evolve its containment systems.

Finally, GTT announced a strategic partnership with BLOOM ENERGY and PONANT EXPLORATIONS GROUP to develop an innovative integrated energy system designed for sustainable vessel propulsion.

- GTT Strategic Ventures: New investments to accelerate the maritime energy transition

Since the beginning of the year, the GTT Strategic Ventures investment fund has strengthened its portfolio with two new minority stakes:

In April 2025, GTT Strategic Ventures invested in novoMOF, a company specialising in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), compact and high-performance materials for CO₂ capture, particularly well-suited to maritime transportation.

In July 2025, it invested in CorPower Ocean, whose wave energy technology harnesses the power of the sea with resilience and efficiency, offering stable and competitive electricity generation among renewable marine energies

Order book as of 30 September 2025

As of 1 January 2025, GTT’s order book, excluding LNG as fuel, comprised 332 units. The following developments have occurred since January 1:

Deliveries completed: 58 LNG carriers, 1 ethane carrier and 5 onshore storage tanks;

Orders received: 19 LNG carriers, 7 ethane carriers and 1 FLNG.

As of 30 September 2025, the order book, excluding LNG as fuel, stood at 295 units, broken down as follows:

267 LNG carriers;

22 ethane carriers;

3 FSRUs (Floating Storage and Regasification Units);

3 FLNGs (Floating Liquefied Natural Gas units).

Regarding LNG as fuel, with the delivery of 18 vessels and orders for 18 container ships and one LNG bunker vessel, the order book stood at 51 vessels as of 30 September 2025.

Evolution of consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2025

(in millions of euros) 9M 2025 9M 2024 Change Revenue 599.6 464.7 +29.0% Newbuilds 558.3 429.0 +30.2% of which LNG carriers/ethane carriers 528.1 400.4 +31.9% of which FSRUs6/FSUs7 6.6 - N/A of which FLNGs8 7.3 2.7 +171.7% of which onshore storage tanks and GBSs - 1.7 N/A of which LNG-powered vessels 16.4 24.2 -32.2% Electrolysers 3.7 6.6 -44.5% Digital 19.9 10.8 +83.4% Services 17.7 18.3 -3.1%

Consolidated revenue for the first nine months of 2025 amounted to 599.6 million euros, up 29.0% compared with the first nine months of 2024, and up 27.6% at constant scope.

Revenue from new builds totalled 558.3 million euros, up 30.2% compared with the first nine months of 2024, benefiting from the increase in the number of LNG carriers under construction. Royalties from LNG and ethane carriers amounted to 528.1 million euros (+31.9%), 7.3 million euros for FLNGs (+171.7%) and 6.6 million euros for FSRUs/FSUs. Royalties generated by the LNG-as-fuel business amounted to 16.4 million euros, down 32.2% due to a high comparison base.

Revenues from Elogen’s electrolyser business amounted to 3.7 million euros for the first nine months of 2025, compared with 6.6 million euros for the first nine months of 2024.

The digital business grew sharply to 19.9 million euros, an increase of 83.4%. This performance includes Danelec’s contribution over two months (6.5 million euros). Excluding Danelec, i.e. at constant scope, the increase would have been 23.9%, supported by equipment sales and an increase in subscriptions for digital solutions.

Finally, services generated 17.7 million euros, down 3.1% compared with the first nine months of 2024, due to the decline in pre-project studies, which are intermittent by nature.

2025 objectives revised upwards reflecting the good performance of GTT’s core business and the integration of Danelec

Taking into account the absence of delays in shipbuilding schedules, the good performance of GTT’s core business and the integration of Danelec, the Group is revising its objectives for the 2025 financial year upwards, namely:

2025 consolidated revenue of between 790 million euros and 820 million euros (compared with 750 to 800 million euros previously);

2025 consolidated EBITDA of between 530 million euros and 550 million euros (compared with 490 to 540 million euros previously);

a 2025 dividend distribution target corresponding to a minimum payout of 80% of consolidated net income9.

The Indian industry holds a critical responsibility in enhancing air quality, said Rajesh Verma (IAS), Chairperson, Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas (CAQM), emphasising the need for stronger industrial commitment and cleaner production practices to combat rising pollution levels "Industry plays a pivotal role in improving air quality," said Mr Rajesh Verma (IAS), Chairperson, Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas (CAQM).He was speaking at the formal signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) and Confederation of Indian Industry ( CII ), aimed at advancing collaborative efforts to improve air quality across the Delhi NCR region."Air quality improvement needs perpetual learning and implementation to drive large-scale change on the ground," highlighted Verma."I am confident that this MoU will take this movement forward to galvanise field action with support from CII, especially with the entrepreneurial ideas, industry innovation, and Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) to wider stakeholders," he shared. Under the MoU, CII and CAQM will reinforce initiatives for air quality management, recalibrate policies for improved air emissions compliance in industrial and construction subsectors and scale up clean & green economy solutions. Additionally, both parties will jointly develop and implement awareness & capacity-building programmes targeting industries, farmers, and citizens.Speaking at the occasion, Madhav Singhania, Immediate Past Chairman, CII Northern Region and Deputy Managing Director & CEO, JK Cement Ltd , emphasised that this is a significant step forward in the collective pursuit towards improved air quality and a healthier future for the region."As much as clean air is crucial for healthier and resilient cities, it is also imperative for a thriving economy and globally competitive businesses. Through this MoU, we are deepening our shared commitment to drive awareness, foster behavioural change, and mobilise resources to achieve on-ground, tangible outcomes," he stated.The air quality in the national capital remained in the 'severe' category on Saturday morning as the overall AQI recorded around 1:30 pm was 296. Severe air quality of the Air Quality Index (AQI) indicates a high level of air pollution that can cause respiratory impacts even in healthy people and serious health issues for those with pre-existing lung or heart conditions. At this level, health effects can be experienced during even light physical activity, and all people, especially vulnerable groups, should limit their outdoor exertion.

[TITLE]America’s First Hybrid-Electric Regional Aircraft is Taking Shape:
[TEXT]
AURA AERO Opens First of Two Massive Production Sites for the ERA

French aircraft manufacturer AURA AERO has officially cut the ribbon on its first US production site at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s Research Park in Daytona Beach, Florida. The 11,000-square-foot facility will house the INTEGRAL trainer program and the future launchpad for its 19-seat hybrid-electric regional aircraft, the ERA.

The company plans to build its first American-assembled aircraft at the new site, starting with the INTEGRAL line: a two-seat, aerobatic-capable trainer available in both piston and all-electric versions. The aircraft recently earned European certification and has FAA approval in the works. With a growing appetite for modern, efficient trainers nationwide, AURA AERO believes the US will be a key growth driver.

“The opening of AURA AERO’s headquarters at Embry-Riddle’s Research Park marks a significant milestone in our collaboration with an innovative company shaping the future of sustainable aviation,” said Embry-Riddle President Barry Butler. “AURA AERO’s presence enhances our research ecosystem and offers unparalleled opportunities for students and faculty to engage directly with next-generation electric and hybrid-electric aircraft.”

AURA AERO’s long-term plans extend far beyond the training market. By 2028, the company expects to open a second, 500,000-square-foot facility in Florida dedicated to assembling the ERA, which it touts as the ‘world’s first’ hybrid-electric regional aircraft. The aircraft, designed to carry 19 passengers, already has more than 650 letters of intent worth an estimated $10.5 billion. Roughly one-third of those orders are from US customers.

Florida state officials are backing the project heavily. The state’s aerospace development agency, Space Florida, helped secure the investment and expects over a thousand new high-skill jobs to sprout as a result.

“Florida has long been a leader in aeronautics and space, and the technical expertise of its workforce is a tremendous asset in asserting our leadership in the electric and hybrid-electric aviation sectors,” added Jeremy Caussade, President and co-founder of AURA AERO. “The State of Florida, Space Florida and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University have always believed in us and supported us from the beginning in this project, which is now coming to fruition.”
