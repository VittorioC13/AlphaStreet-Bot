[TEXT]
Data-Driven Direct to Consumer Marketing That Beats Agencies

In today's market, direct to consumer marketing (DTC) is your brand's personal connection to its customers. It means you sell your products right to your audience, skipping the retail middleman. While this is a powerful way to build a brand, growing it can be a major challenge. Many DTC brands hire traditional marketing agencies but often end up with high bills, slow results, and a frustrating lack of clear communication.

That’s where a data-driven approach changes the game. Instead of relying on guesswork, this strategy uses real customer information to make smart, fast, and profitable decisions. This guide will walk you through how to take back control of your growth by using data, helping you build a marketing engine that can outperform what a standard agency offers. While there is no single playbook for success, the most successful DTC brands share a focus on using data to find their own unique path [1].

The Downfall of the Traditional Agency Model

For a long time, marketing agencies were seen as the only way to grow. But for modern DTC brands that need to be fast and efficient, the old agency model often creates more problems than it solves.

The Problem with Agency Partnerships

The issues with old-school agencies are common and predictable:

Financial Burden: Brands are frequently locked into expensive monthly retainers and high minimum ad spends that don’t always guarantee a return on investment.

The "Black Box" Problem: Agencies can be like a black box—you put money in, but it’s difficult to see where it’s actually going or what your true results are.

Slow Processes: The agency world can be incredibly slow. Long briefs, multiple rounds of feedback, and delayed campaign launches are common, creating friction as brands and agencies navigate rising costs and new technologies [7].

Misaligned Incentives: Often, an agency's goal is to get you to spend more on ads, since that's how they increase their fees. Your goal, however, is to be profitable and build long-term customer relationships. These two goals don't always align.

Embracing a Data-Driven Direct to Consumer Marketing Strategy

The best way forward is to move from the outdated agency model to a strategy that puts data first. This doesn't mean you have to do everything by yourself, but it does mean taking ownership of your brand's direction.

What is Data-Driven DTC Marketing?

Data-driven DTC marketing simply means using the information you collect directly from your audience—like their purchase history and browsing habits—to make every marketing decision. It’s

[TITLE]U.K. Retail Industry Finds Little Cheer in Labour Government’s Latest Budget:
[TEXT]
LONDON — Retail, beauty and luxury organizations reacted with dismay to the 2025 budget delivered by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves on Wednesday and accused the government of failing, once again, to support business.

Although Reeves kept the Labour party’s electoral promise of not raising income tax, she instead offered a package laden with loads of other taxes that will hit middle-earners, homeowners, businesses, employees and tourist-dependent industries such as retail and hospitality.

The government announced plans to freeze income tax thresholds, meaning that more people will be dragged into higher brackets as their salaries increase.

It will also slap extra taxes on employees’ pension contributions, and the funds that employers pay into pension pots, and jack up the National Living Wage for workers, and the minimum wage for teenagers, putting further pressure on employers.

Selfridges is among the larger stores that will continue to be impacted by soaring business taxes in the U.K. David Parry/Courtesy

Reeves is also giving local mayors across the country powers to impose a “tourist tax” on overnight stays. She has largely preserved the stiff taxes that companies pay on their physical stores, hotels and other brick-and-mortar properties, especially in the big cities.

That “business rates” tax has long been a bone of contention here, with companies accusing government of de facto favoring online retailers over physical stores. Under Reeves’ new proposals, some businesses with smaller premises will be eligible for lower tax rates.

Helen Brocklebank, chief executive officer of U.K. luxury lobby Walpole, called the budget “a missed opportunity. Instead of introducing measures that would boost growth and help businesses thrive, the Chancellor chose the opposite.”

She said Britain’s 81 billion pound luxury sector “remains a resilient driver of growth for the U.K. economy and supports 454,000 jobs across the country. Luxury businesses want to invest and grow, but this budget missed its chance to support this agenda. Large luxury retailers now face higher business rates, while hospitality faces a double whammy of business rates and a tourist tax.”

[TITLE]Top consumer watchdog fines JioMart over risky walkie-talkie listings:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: India's top consumer watchdog has held Reliance JioMart guilty of misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices by allowing the sale of uncertified walkie-talkies on its platform, government officials aware of the matter said, in a first such action against an e-commerce portal.

Accordingly, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA imposed a penalty of ₹100,000 and directed JioMart to ensure that no walkie-talkies or any product requiring statutory approval is listed without full compliance with applicable laws. A compliance report has to be filed within 15 days.

The CCPA order of 21 November, reviewed by Mint, follows a months-long inquiry that began in May, when the regulator issued notices to several e-commerce platforms over illegal sales of wireless devices operating in restricted frequency bands - or radio frequencies that are reserved for emergency services like police, or ambulance communication, defence services, or aviation. Any interference with these airwaves can disrupt essential services, and also potentially raise national security concerns.

During its inquiry, the authority found that JioMart had listed walkie-talkie models without disclosing crucial information such as operating frequency, licensing requirements or proof of Equipment Type Approval (ETA) from the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing of the Department of Telecommunications.

The ETA certifies that a wireless device uses only those radio frequencies that are legally permissible in India and follows the technical standards set by the government.

May mislead buyers

The omission by JioMart could mislead buyers into assuming the devices were legal for unrestricted use, violating consumer rights under the Consumer Protection Act, particularly the right to be informed

[TITLE]Euro-Zone Inflation Near 2% to Seal Deal on ECB Rate Hold:
[TEXT]
BNP Paribas, in a recent note, offered a different take. “As we move into 2026, we expect the ECB to see stronger growth and inflation than it currently expects, which should further strengthen the case for a prolonged rate hold,” wrote Paul Hollingsworth, the bank’s head of developed markets economics. “We continue to see the next move as a hike.”

“Euro-area inflation will likely remain steady in November at just above the central bank’s 2% target, before resuming a sustained deceleration in December. That may add pressure on the ECB to ease policy next year, even though the Governing Council is currently resisting such a move.”

The unresolved sense of direction from the ECB is being mirrored by conflicting views from economists. Bloomberg Economics, for example, predicts inflation will slow in future months, adding to the case for rate cuts.

If there’s any bias within the Governing Council at present, it might be toward scouring the data for upward pressure on price growth. Vice President Luis de Guindos told Bloomberg Television on Nov. 26 that “the risk of undershooting is limited, in my view.” President Christine Lagarde, who’s repeatedly highlighted the good position that policy is currently at, may offer her own perspective in testimony to lawmakers in Brussels on Wednesday.

Officials find themselves in a holding pattern at present, with no clear consensus on what the next move for rates should be. Mixed signals from national reports on Friday might feed that sense of ambiguity, after stronger-than-expected inflation in Germany and Spain was balanced by weaker-than-anticipated numbers for France and Italy.

Such readings for the final inflation numbers before the European Central Bank’s Dec. 18 decision might harden the resolve of policymakers to keep borrowing costs unchanged. That would leave them able to focus instead on their pivotal quarterly forecasts, featuring the first outlook stretching as far as 2028.

Consumer prices probably rose 2.1% in November from a year earlier, according to the median of 29 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey ahead of Tuesday’s release. The underlying measure, which strips out volatile elements such as energy, is seen remaining at 2.4%.

A euro-zone inflation reading that’s likely to stay close to 2% should be enough to satisfy officials that they can avoid tweaking interest rates in December.

Shoppers pass through Alexanderplatz during Black Friday sales in Berlin, Germany, on Nov. 28.

Story Continues

Elsewhere, the Paris-based OECD will release new forecasts on Tuesday, a consumer-price gauge is coming from the US, policymakers in the UK will share their financial-stability assessment, and Brazil may come to the end of its longest streak of growth in decades.

Click here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.

US and Canada

Federal Reserve officials will get a dated reading on their preferred inflation gauge before settling in the following week for their final policy meeting of the year. On Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis releases its September income and spending report — long delayed because of the government shutdown.

The figures will include the personal consumption expenditures price index and a core measure that excludes food and energy. Economists project a third-straight 0.2% increase in the core index. That would keep the year-over-year figure hovering just below 3%, a sign that inflationary pressures are stable, yet sticky and above the Fed’s goal.

Against such a backdrop, the debate among officials will largely center on the job market and whether rates should be reduced for a third straight time when policymakers meet Dec. 9-10. Investors see a cut as more likely than not.

Fed policymakers are in their usual pre-meeting quiet period. Still, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett appeared on CBS’ on Sunday, where he touted a positive market response to indications that Donald Trump could pick the next Fed chair before the end of the year — a job that the president’s chief economic adviser is seen as likely to win.

Read more: Fed Contender Hassett Says Market Is Ready for Trump Chair Pick

While the latest jobs report showed a larger-than-expected rise in payrolls, the gain was concentrated in just a few industries. The unemployment rate ticked up to an almost four-year high, and there’s been a steady drumbeat of layoff news from companies.

Other economic data in the coming week include ADP private employment figures for November, as well as Institute for Supply Management surveys of manufacturers and service providers. The Fed is also scheduled to release September industrial production figures.

For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for the US

In Canada, meanwhile, jobs data for November are expected to show persistent weakness as the US trade war batters key industries and weighs on broader hiring. Some analysts see employers shedding staff after two strong reports made up for losses over the summer.

The Bank of Canada plans to hold its policy rate steady at 2.25% as long as the economy and inflation evolve as expected, and it foresees a soft labor market with weak wage growth.

Asia

Asia steps into the first week of December with a packed calendar — led by a wave of manufacturing purchasing manager indexes along with price indicators that will help gauge the region’s momentum into year-end.

Data published Sunday showed that China’s factory activity improved but remained in contraction in November, extending its streak of declines to a record as the country’s economic slowdown deepens.

The tone will also be shaped by remarks from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda on Monday, with markets alert to any signals on the likelihood of a December rate hike.

Australia begins the week with housing data that’s expected to confirm another month of gains, alongside a run of third-quarter figures — including company profits and inventories — ahead of its GDP release on Wednesday, when South Korea publishes its revised figures too.

Also on Monday, Japan issues a broad set of quarterly indicators, covering capital spending, sales, and profits, that will feed into GDP revisions the following week.

Indonesia reports inflation and trade data. A sweep of PMIs from across Asia — including Australia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam — will offer an early reading on factory conditions as global demand remains uneven.

The start of the week coincides with the start of December, which means Anna Breman begins her five-year term as New Zealand’s central bank chief. Breman, who is from Sweden, Breman becomes the first female governor and the first foreigner to lead the institution since Englishman Leslie Lefeaux was its inaugural head in 1934.

Tuesday brings New Zealand’s third-quarter terms of trade, followed by South Korea’s inflation for November. Australia reports its current account balance as well as government spending for the September quarter.

Thursday features Japan’s weekly portfolio-investment flows and Australia’s household-spending for October, together with the latest trade numbers.

Attention turns to India on Friday, where the country’s central bank is expected to lower the repurchase, or repo, rate, making borrowing cheaper for banks and in turn for households and businesses.

Also on Friday, South Korea releases current account data, Japan has household spending, while the Philippines and Taiwan report inflation readings for November. Singapore’s retail-sales report will show whether the improvement seen last quarter carried into October.

For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Asia

Europe, Middle East, Africa

While the threat of post-budget fiscal turmoil in markets appears to have subsided, the Bank of England is likely to identify other financial stability dangers when it releases its latest risk assessment on Tuesday, accompanied by a press conference with Governor Andrew Bailey.

With several global peers having released their own analyses in the past month, risks ranging from a stock bubble to parallels with the subprime debt crisis might come up. Little more than a month ago, Bailey warned of “alarm bells” in private credit.

In Switzerland, a second monthly reading of inflation barely above zero may arrive on Thursday, keeping pressure on the central bank there. The following day, Sweden’s measure of consumer-price growth targeted by officials is seen weakening drastically, to a six-month low.

Aside from inflation, the neighboring euro-zone will see national data pointing to the state of manufacturing at the start of the fourth quarter. German factory orders, along with French and Spanish industrial production, will come out on Friday.

In Ukraine — the scene of government upheaval after the exit of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff — parliament will debate the draft of the 2026 budget on Tuesday amid demands from the International Monetary Fund.

In Poland the following day, the central bank will decide whether to continue with rate cuts after a series of reductions spurred by lower-than-expected inflation. A majority of economists predict it will do so.

Data in South Africa on Tuesday will likely show economic growth slowed slightly in the third quarter, to 0.5% from 0.8%, as the US’s 30% tariff on some exports weighed on manufacturing.

Saudi Arabia is set to announce its 2026 budget the same day, followed by a press conference with Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan.

And the next day in Turkey, data will probably show inflation eased in November to

WIRED Featured Deals

Tent Deals

Need a new shelter from the storm? There are more tent deals right now than we usually see this time of year, giving you some great options for not a lot of money. Check out our guides to the best backpacking tents and best car camping tents for more details.

Six Moon Design's Lunar Solo (7/10, WIRED Review) is my favorite single-wall ultralight solo tent. It's not without its quirks (read the pitching tips), but if you want something more than a tarp, that still weighs just 26 ounces (740 grams), this one is hard to beat. It's well ventilated for a single-walled tent, with the ability to raise up the front door when weather is nice. I also like that it only needs one trekking pole (or one pole if you don't hike with trekking poles). You'd be hard-pressed to find a tent even half this nice at this price.

The Copper Spur UL 2 is currently our top pick for lightweight freestanding backpacking tents, and it's been a popular choice with readers for years. This is a high-quality, well-designed tent that's lightweight, easy to set up, and roomy enough to be livable in the backcountry. The “awning” design (with trekking poles or sticks) is a nice extra, and the mix of 15D nylon and 20D ripstop, while it feels fragile, has held up well over time. The 3-person Copper Spur UL 3 is also on sale for $450 ($150 off).

Sea to Summit’s “3-plus season” tents are capable enough in almost any weather while staying crazy light—just 3 pounds, 12 ounces for this two-person model. I used the three-person version on a five-day trip to Loon Lake in northern California in early October, a true “shoulder season” trip with daytime highs in the 80s, nighttime lows in the 40s, and overnight winds of up to 60 mph. My favorite design detail is that the pole bag is kept rigid by an insert of opaque white plastic. Clip it to the tent’s ceiling, pop in your headlamp, and illuminate your abode. —Michael Calore

Nemo's Dagger Osmo line of tents are reasonably light with roomy interiors and have proved very storm-proof in my testing. The three-person version has long been my tent of choice for trips with my kids. Setup is simple thanks to the single main pole design (which forks at each end) with a cross pole in the middle. There are two spacious vestibules for storing gear, and if you leave the rain fly off, the mesh room is excellent for stargazing.

The Nemo Mayfly is a three-season backpacking tent with a trail weight of 3 pounds, 8 ounces for the two-person version I tested. Split between two people, each is carrying under 2 pounds. The Mayfly uses a semi-freestanding design to keep weight down, which does mean you have to stake out the foot end. It's on the small side as well, at 27.9 square feet of living space, with two 7-square-foot vestibule areas. I find it plenty livable for two, and the cross pole gives you a wider roof area than most tents this size. I love the white mesh (instead of black) and the super simple clips that keep the rain fly secured.

Hyperlite's Dyneema Composite Ultamid tents are my favorite lightweight backcountry shelter for groups. I use the 4-person version (also on sale for $721 ($128 off)) with my kids as it's the only thing on the market that can sleep 4, but weighs less than 2 pounds (22.4 oz). It's a single wall tent, so condensation does need to be managed, but it's pretty easy to vent. It's also dead simple to pitch and rock solid in the wind. The pyramid design does mean there's less room to the sides, but on the plus side it's tall enough that I can stand up in the middle if I crouch a little (I'm 5' 10"). There are two downsides to this tent. THe first is the price, but this sale makes it a little cheaper. The other is that it is big and requires a pretty good size space to pitch it. Also note that if you're going to be in very buggy areas, you might want the floorless mesh insert which is $84 ($16 off).

Sea to Summit's ultralight Alto tent (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is designed to keep weight down on your solo adventures. At just 33 ounces for a semi-freestanding tent, it remains one of the lighter options on the market, and at this price it's hard to pass up. The mesh netting helps keep weight down, though for something warmer, the Plus version, which has less mesh, is also on sale for $412 ($137 off), an equally outstanding deal.

Goassamer Gear's The Two is an ultralight, two-person shelter that weighs just

[TITLE]Ahead of Black Friday, Report Reveals Attacks on Garment Workers' Right to Organize:
[TEXT]
With clothing companies that will be offering discounted Black Friday deals this week relying heavily on the labor of tens of millions underpaid and overworked garment workers across the Global South, two reports by the human rights group Amnesty International make the case that ensuring these employees are afforded the right to organize their workplaces is key to ending worker exploitation across the fashion industry.

The organization interviewed 64 garment workers in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, and Pakistan from 2023-24, including 12 union organizers and labor rights activists, for its report titled Stitched Up,

[TEXT]
Global stocks pause after 4 day winning streak

Global stock indexes stabilize after recovering most November losses on surging expectations Federal Reserve will cut rates faster and more deeply than previously anticipated

Global stock indexes held steady Thursday after four consecutive days of gains erased most November losses. The MSCI All Country World Index showed little change, having trimmed its monthly decline to just 0.4% after dropping nearly 4% earlier in November.

European and Asian benchmarks posted modest movements while US markets remained closed for Thanksgiving. S&P 500 futures traded flat as investors digested the recent rally fueled by shifting Federal Reserve expectations.

Bitcoin climbed above $91,000 for the first time in a week, signaling returning risk appetite among traders. Gold prices showed minimal movement while the dollar paused a two day retreat against major currencies.

Rate cut expectations drive sentiment shift

The stock market recovery tracked dramatically firming expectations for Federal Reserve policy easing. Money markets now price approximately 80% probability of a quarter point rate cut next month, with traders leaning toward three additional cuts by the end of 2026.

Just over a week ago, market participants projected only three total cuts through late 2026. The revised outlook reflects growing conviction that inflation pressures have eased enough to allow more aggressive monetary loosening than officials previously signaled.

Daniel Murray, chief executive officer of EFG Asset Management Switzerland, suggested conditions are building for a classic year end rally. He expects the macroeconomic environment to remain supportive into 2026 with decent corporate earnings outlooks and added tailwinds from lagged effects of rate reductions.

The shifting sentiment also reflects fresh optimism after concerns over stretched technology valuations hammered equity markets earlier this month. Investors appear more confident that corporate fundamentals can support current price levels given expectations for lower borrowing costs ahead.

Regional markets show divergent patterns

Japanese and South Korean equities outperformed regional peers Thursday, with technology shares leading gains in both markets. In Europe, Germany’s DAX index rose 0.2% as athletic apparel maker Puma jumped 14% on reports of takeover interest from multiple bidders.

UK government bonds and the pound retreated slightly after Wednesday’s rally following the Autumn budget presentation. Chancellor Rachel Reeves carved out a larger fiscal buffer that initially buoyed sentiment, though tax raising measures required cast shadows over economic growth prospects.

Bill Diviney, head of macro research at ABN AMRO, wrote that the UK government did what it needed to keep bond markets supportive. He acknowledged some risk to the backloaded fiscal consolidation approach but noted it builds on already considerable deficit reduction efforts.

Commodity markets await policy signals

Oil prices remained steady as investors assessed next steps in US led diplomatic efforts to end the Ukraine conflict. Traders also refrained from taking substantial positions ahead of this weekend’s OPEC plus meeting where production policy decisions could reshape supply expectations.

Platinum touched its highest level in more than a month, supported by optimism over fresh demand after a Chinese exchange launched a new futures contract. The precious metal has struggled this year amid weak industrial demand but showed signs of stabilizing.

Corporate developments shape individual moves

Chinese property developer China Vanke faced rejection from at least two major local banks as it attempted securing a short term loan to calm default fears that fueled bond price plunges this week. The situation highlights ongoing stress in China’s real estate sector despite government support measures.

Chinese sports apparel company Anta Sports Products explores a potential takeover of Puma according to people familiar with the matter. The transaction would mark another major cross border acquisition by Chinese companies seeking European brand portfolios.

JPMorgan Chase plans to build a new three million square foot tower in London serving as its principal UK headquarters. The bank estimates the project could contribute approximately $13 billion to the local economy over six years.

Oracle faced rising concern among debt investors as a gauge of credit risk on its bonds reached a three year high in November. Morgan Stanley analysts warned conditions will worsen in 2026 unless the database company can assuage investor anxiety about massive artificial intelligence spending plans.

Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer suggested lower Federal Reserve rates, ongoing economic growth and moderate dollar weakness bode well for equities in 2026. His outlook reflects growing Wall Street consensus that markets can extend gains despite elevated valuations.

[TITLE]Do your research before giving in to ‘Travel Tuesday’ temptations:
[TEXT]
Chain stores have Black Friday. Online marketplaces have Cyber Monday. For local businesses, it’s Small Business Saturday.

In the last 20 years, more segments of the retail industry have vied for their own piece of the holiday shopping season. The travel trade has firmly joined the trend with another post-Thanksgiving sales push: Travel Tuesday.

On the same day as the nonprofit world’s Giving Tuesday, airlines, hotels, cruise ship companies, travel booking platforms and tour operators get in on the annual spirit to spend by promoting one-day deals. Consumer advocates say there are legitimate savings to be had but also chances to be misled by marketing that conveys a false sense of urgency.

“People see ‘40 percent off’ and assume it’s a once-in-a-lifetime steal, without recognizing that the underlying price may have been inflated or that the same itinerary was cheaper last month.” Sally French, a travel expert at personal finance site NerdWallet, said.

She and other seasoned travelers advised consumers who want to see if they can save money by booking trips on Travel Tuesday to do research in advance and to pay especially close attention to the fine print attached to offers.

People hoping to score last-minute deals for Christmas or New Year’s should double-check for blackout dates or other restrictions, recommended Lindsay Schwimer, a consumer expert for the online travel site Hopper.

It’s also wise to to keep an eye out for nonrefundable fares, resort fees, double occupancy requirements or upgrade conditions that may be hidden within advertised discounts, according to French.

Shoppers should be wary of travel packages with extra transportation options or add-on offers, French said. Instead of lowering fares or room rates, some companies use statement credits, extra points, included amenities and bundled extras as a way to tempt potential customers, she said.

“Many travel brands want to keep sticker prices high to maintain an aura of luxury, but they still need to fill planes, ships and hotel rooms,” French said. “Add-on perks are their workaround.”

Consumers who are prepared rather than impulsive and on the lookout for the up-sell are in a much better position to identify authentic bargains, consumer experts stressed. Knowing what a specific trip would typically cost and comparison shopping can help expose offers based on inflated underlying costs and whether the same itinerary might have been cheaper at other times, they said.

“Compare prices, check your calendar and make sure the trip you’re booking is something you genuinely want, not something you bought because a countdown timer pressured you,” French said. “What gets glossed over is that the best deal might be not booking anything at all if it doesn’t align with your plans.”

India's primary market is gearing up for a strong closing to the year 2025, with a mix of large mainboard offerings and a tail of SME IPOs together set to mobilise close to Rs 6,900 crore. The bulk of this fundraising will come from Meesho, the week's biggest issue by far, alongside Aequs and Vidya Wires on the mainboard. A cluster of SME IPOs will add to the activity, keeping the primary market momentum strong as December begins.The Rs 5,421 crore IPO of Meesho opens on December 3 and will be the most closely watched issue of the week. The e-commerce marketplace is offering shares in the Rs 105-111 band. With its scale, customer growth and improving operational metrics, Meesho's listing is expected to draw significant investor interest.The company operates on a zero-commission model and is India’s largest e-commerce platform by annual transacting users and order volumes. The issue includes both a fresh allotment and a sizeable offer for sale by early backers and founders.Two more mainboard IPOs open alongside Meesho next week. Aequs, an aerospace and precision-manufacturing supplier, plans to raise Rs 921.81 crore at a price band of Rs 118-124. Vidya Wires, offering specialty wires used across industrial applications, is aiming to raise Rs 300 crore with a price band of Rs 48–52.Both issues open on December 3 and close on December 5. Together with Meesho, these three mainboard IPOs account for more than Rs 6,640 crore of the week’s fundraising.While the mainboard dominates in size, the SME segment will contribute meaningfully to overall activity. Across the week, nine SME IPOs will be open for subscription, together raising around Rs 252 crore. These include Astron Multigrain (Rs 18.40 crore), Invicta Diagnostic (Rs 28.12 crore), Speb Adhesives (Rs 33.73 crore), Clear Secured Services (Rs 85.60 crore), Ravelcare (Rs 24.10 crore), Helloji Holidays (Rs 10.96 crore), Neochem Bio Solutions (Rs 44.97 crore) and Luxury Time (Rs 18.74 crore).The SME pipeline for the week stands at roughly Rs 250 crore, keeping interest high among small-cap investors looking for niche, early-stage businesses.With nearly Rs 7,000 crore on the table from both mainboard and SME offerings, next week marks one of the most active windows of the year for IPO watchers. Meesho's large issue will set the tone, but Aequs and Vidya Wires add depth to the mainboard, while smaller companies across manufacturing, diagnostics, consumer products and software round out the SME roster.Mainboard investors will be focused on subscription trends and anchor interest in Meesho, which is expected to dictate overall sentiment. For the SME segment, market participants will track oversubscription levels and listing premiums, which have cooled in recent weeks.: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

India's retail market is set to grow from Rs 83 lakh crore to as much as Rs 135 lakh crore by FY30, with e-commerce expanding at a 20–25% CAGR. Non-electronics categories remain underpenetrated at around 5%. Platforms that aggregate fragmented, affordable supply -- a model proven in China -- are expected to lead the next phase of growth.
