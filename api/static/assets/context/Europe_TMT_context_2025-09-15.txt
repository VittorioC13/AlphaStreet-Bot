[TITLE]Europe’s Automotive Industry Needs Urgent Action—Not Another Diagnosis:
[TEXT]
On 12 September, the President of the European Commission will convene key stakeholders to discuss the future of Europe’s automotive industry. As trade union leaders representing millions of workers across this vital sector and its supply chains, we urge the EU to move beyond analysis and deliver urgent, strategic action.

The automotive industry is facing a perfect storm. Production has dropped by 20% in just four years. The transition to clean mobility, while essential, is proving more disruptive than anticipated. On the shopfloor, anxiety and anger are becoming the norm. Without bold intervention, this toxic mix could threaten the future of one of Europe’s most strategic industries.

Europe’s car industry is also losing ground globally. While domestic demand can help, it cannot replace the 4.5 million vehicles exported in 2024. A fair and strategic trade agenda is needed—one that secures market access and rebuilds supply chains for key components like batteries and semiconductors.

Decarbonisation is non-negotiable. But the transition must be just. Climate legislation must be fit for purpose and adapted when necessary. The upcoming EU “Progress Report” on CO₂ emissions must lead to pragmatic solutions—addressing infrastructure gaps, affordability, supply chain resilience including investments in battery production —and delivering guarantees for workers.

Boosting demand must be the first priority. Legislative tools—such as corporate fleet regulations and public procurement—should be used to accelerate the uptake of clean vehicles. Bridging the affordability gap is essential. Many Europeans simply cannot afford a new car, and solutions like social leasing must be scaled across member states.

Investment is equally critical. Households, companies, and public authorities need support to invest in vehicles and infrastructure. Yet austerity budgets are undermining both public and private investment. The next EU budget must reflect Europe’s climate and industrial ambitions, aligning macroeconomic governance with strategic goals like climate neutrality and industrial resilience.

The future of 13 million workers and entire regions depends on bold, coordinated action. We need a stable, skilled workforce, strong social dialogue, and tools like SURE 2.0 and a Just Transition Directive to manage change fairly and democratically.

Europe must rise to the challenge. Workers are watching. The time for gesture politics is over. Workers and their unions expect quick, concrete, and courageous decisions. Their future—and Europe’s industrial strength—is on the line.

[TITLE]Bessent will meet Chinese officials in Spain for trade and TikTok talks:
[TEXT]
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is traveling to Madrid this weekend for trade talks with Chinese counterparts

Bessent will meet Chinese officials in Spain for trade and TikTok talks

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will travel to Madrid this weekend for negotiations with his Chinese counterparts over tariffs and national security issues related to the ownership of social media platform TikTok.

Bessent is slated to meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Madrid to discuss national security and economic issues, a Treasury news release states.

This will be the fourth round of discussions between U.S. and Chinese counterparts after meetings in London, Geneva and Stockholm. The two governments have agreed to several 90-day pauses on a series of increasing reciprocal tariffs, staving off an all-out trade war.

During the last round of discussions in Stockholm, Bessent described his talks with the Chinese as “ very fulsome."

“We just need to de-risk with certain, strategic industries, whether it’s the rare earths, semiconductors, medicines, and we talked about what we could do together to get into balance within the relationship,” Bessent said at the time.

China remains one of the biggest challenges for the Trump administration after it has struck deals over elevated tariff rates with other key trading partners, such as Britain, Japan and the European Union.

The U.S. and China delegations are also expected to continue discussions about ownership of TikTok.

Congress approved a U.S. ban on the popular video-sharing platform unless its parent company, ByteDance, sold its controlling stake. President Donald Trump said last month that he will keep extending the sale deadline until there’s a buyer.

But Trump has so far extended the deadline three times during his second term — with the next deadline coming up Wednesday.

A Pew Research Center survey conducted in late February and early March found that about one-third of Americans said they supported a TikTok ban, down from 50% in March 2023. Roughly one-third said they would oppose a ban, and a similar percentage said they weren’t sure.

The Treasury Department also says Bessent will meet Spanish government counterparts to discuss the relationship between Spain and the United States.

After his Spain trip, Bessent is expected to travel to the U.K. to join Trump for his official state visit with Britain’s King Charles at Windsor Castle.

[TITLE]Telefónica Outlines Strategy to Consolidate European Telecoms, Divest Latin American Assets:
[TEXT]
Telefónica (NYSE:TEF) is one of the most undervalued telecom stocks to invest in. On September 8, Telefonica CEO Marc Murtra outlined his vision for a consolidated European telecoms market, stating that the company is looking to acquire telecom assets in Europe and Brazil while selling off its Spanish-speaking Latin American assets.

The strategy is part of a broader plan to increase scale and maintain the company’s investment-grade credit rating. Murtra argues that Europe’s telecom market is too fragmented, with 41 companies serving over 500K mobile customers each in 2024, compared to only 5 in the US, 4 in China and Japan, and 3 in South Korea. He believes that in exchange for consolidation, European telecom companies should invest in other related sectors, such as cybersecurity and data centers, as part of a social contract with regulators.

Telefónica Outlines Strategy to Consolidate European Telecoms, Divest Latin American Assets

To gain financial flexibility for M&A, Telefonica has agreed to sell its units in Argentina and Uruguay and is exploring potential sales in Chile, Mexico, and Ecuador. Analysts at Kepler believe these sales could provide up to 3.6 billion euros ($4.21 billion) in funding. Potential acquisition targets for Telefonica could include Vodafone Spain, a joint venture with 1&1 in Germany, assets in Brazil, or a 50% stake in Virgin Media O2.

Telefónica (NYSE:TEF) provides telecommunications services in Europe and Latin America. The company offers mobile & related services and products.

While we acknowledge the potential of TEF as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Zen, Neos carry out 400 Gbps upgrade between Manchester and London:
[TEXT]
Looking to address surging bandwidth demands through rapidly increasing AI adoption, datacentre growth and full-fibre roll-out across the UK, and linking two of the country’s leading business hubs, business connectivity provider Neos Networks has expanded its longstanding partnership with B Corp-certified telecoms provider Zen Internet with a major upgrade to 400Gbps connectivity between Manchester and London.

Neos Networks claims the UK’s largest business-dedicated network with more than 600 points of presence and 90 datacentres nationwide, providing high-capacity critical connectivity for businesses, from telecoms and energy to banking and emergency services.

Headquartered in Rochdale and employing 650 people, Zen offers a range of broadband, data, voice, hosting and infrastructure services to homes and businesses across the UK. It claims to be the largest B Corporation certified telecommunications and network connectivity provider in the UK.

With a network spanning over 2,800 exchanges, with more than 80% enabled for 10 Gb services, Zen also provides what it describes as “complex” network and cloud services for a range of large businesses and corporate customers through its strategic partnerships with Amazon Web Services and Cisco.

Delivered over Neos Networks’ nationwide fibre network, the upgrade to the advanced corridor is designed to support the UK’s growing bandwidth requirements as datacentre investment, AI adoption and full-fibre roll-out increase across the nation, and strengthening Zen’s strategy in the independent broadband provider (altnet) market expanding fibre access for businesses and consumers alike.

It is also intended to ensure Zen’s core network is ready for the future. Beyond the Manchester to London link, Zen uses Neos’s upgraded core and exchange-backhaul services, which are critical for delivering ultrafast, resilient connectivity.

“Our long-standing partnership with Zen Internet highlights the vital role of advanced fibre infrastructure when it comes to meeting the UK’s AI ambitions,” said David Bruce, CRO at Neos Networks commenting on the new deal. “Zen’s mission to become the country’s leading altnet aggregator is well-aligned with the breadth, quality and reliability of our backbone networks, and by working together, we’re ensuring an ecosystem that will ultimately benefit the UK as a whole.”

Zen Internet technical director John Lyons added: “In Neos we have a partner that not only delivers robust, high-capacity network solutions, but also real agility and collaboration, helping us deliver for our end users. Our collaboration is built on open communication, rapid provisioning and shared engineering standards like equipment duplication, diverse routing and true east-west redundancy. This approach means we can rely on Neos to deliver a network that consistently meets the high standards our customers expect.”

Just weeks ago, Zen Internet announced a strategic partnership with Sky Business Wholesale to allow its partners and direct business customers gain access to Sky’s Ethernet-enabled exchange footprint. The partnership was also designed to further strengthen Zen’s partner portal, The Fibre Hub, after its launch in May 2025 to further enhance nationwide connectivity by aggregating services from the UK’s leading alternative networks. This offers access to a full-fibre footprint of nearly 20 million premises via infrastructure providers Openreach, CityFibre, ITS and Freedom Fibre.

ASML invests €1.3 billion in French startup Mistral AI, securing an 11 percent stake

Partnership will apply AI to ASML’s research development and lithography system operations

Mistral AI gains funding and a European partner as valuation rises to €11.7 billion

ASML Holding NV has signed a strategic partnership with French startup Mistral AI, looking to combine its chipmaking expertise with Mistral’s artificial intelligence models.

The move is one of the largest collaborations between the semiconductor sector and a European AI firm.

ASML, based in Veldhoven in the Netherlands, is the world’s only supplier of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, critical for producing the most advanced chips. Its equipment is used by leading semiconductor companies to manufacture processors for smartphones, data centers, and AI accelerators.

€1.3 billion funding

Although ASML occasionally invests in suppliers, it rarely takes direct stakes in startups.

Mistral AI, founded in 2023 and headquartered in Paris, develops LLMs and open-source AI tools. It is viewed as the European alternative to US AI darlings such as OpenAI and Anthropic, and counts Microsoft among its existing investors.

As part of the deal, ASML will invest €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) in Mistral’s Series C funding round, leading the raise and securing an 11 percent stake on a fully diluted basis.

The round will bring Mistral’s valuation to €11.7 billion ($12.6 billion).
