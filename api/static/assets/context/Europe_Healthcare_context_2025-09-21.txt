[TITLE]GENFIT Announces Discontinuation of its VS-01 Program in ACLF: VS-01 Development Refocused on UCD:
[TEXT]
Lille (France), Cambridge (Massachusetts, United States), Zurich (Switzerland), September 19, 2025 - GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases, today announced its decision to discontinue its VS-01 program in ACLF (Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure), and reprioritize the development of VS-01 on UCD (Urea Cycle Disorder).

GENFIT’s decision follows the occurrence of a peritonitis case reported as Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in the UNVEIL-IT® clinical trial evaluating VS-01 in patients with ACLF grades 1, 2 or 3a and ascites and subsequent review and feedback from the independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC). The committee concluded that the trial could continue but required additional data and monitoring. Despite the possibility to move ahead with the study, GENFIT decided – after considering the target population’s clinical profile as well as the implications of this type of safety signal for the benefit/risk ratio of VS-01 in this indication – to discontinue both UNVEIL-IT® and the proof-of-concept study evaluating VS-01 in patients with Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) grades 2 to 4 in the presence of Acute Decompensation (AD) or ACLF grade 1 and ascites. GENFIT would like to thank patients, families, as well as investigators and their teams involved in these two trials.

GENFIT will continue the preclinical evaluation of VS-01 in UCD, a genetically driven disorder characterized by acute hyperammonemic crisis (HAC). The condition, patients and drug administration set-up will be very different from what they were in ACLF. There is a significant unmet medical need in this indication, and based on ammonia clearance data, we believe VS-01 has the potential to be a useful therapeutic option for children affected by this disease.

GENFIT remains fully committed to ACLF and associated conditions such as Acute Decompensation (AD) or Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE). ACLF is characterized by a critical unmet medical need, with no approved treatment options for patients facing poor prognosis and life-threatening risks. Since we embarked in this therapeutic area, we have engaged in multiple KOL interactions and observed growing interest in this indication, together with clear support for our clinical strategy. This feedback reinforces our confidence in our plan and validates our positioning. In this context, we ambition to accelerate the development of the four other assets currently under development in ACLF, which are all based on different mechanisms of action and use different routes of administration. We hope to deliver positive results, as we move forward, starting with safety data and early markers of efficacy on healthy volunteers with G1090N, expected at the end of this year. Other programs in the ACLF pipeline are SRT-015, CLM-022 and VS-02-HE.

By year-end, we also aim to share Phase 1b data in another life-threatening indication, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). CCA is a rare type of biliary tract cancer with high mortality and limited treatment options, and GNS561 is a novel autophagy/PPT1 inhibitor currently evaluated in combination with a MEK inhibitor in CCA with KRAS mutation.

Following the discontinuation of our VS-01 program in ACLF, we anticipate a substantial reduction in our operating expenses. This will provide strategic flexibility, either as an opportunity to extend projected cash runway by at least a year versus previous guidance, i.e. beyond 20281, or as a means to explore new mechanistic approaches through business development initiatives aiming to tackle the multiple dimensions of the urgent gaps in ACLF care.

[TITLE]European shares end the week little changed:
[TEXT]
European shares were little changed on Friday, capping an eventful week on a benign note with sentiment that was largely shaped by crucial central bank decisions, including the US Federal Reserve’s widely expected interest rate cut.

Dublin

In Dublin, the market ended the week slightly lower, losing 0.3 per cent.

Banking shares gained, mirroring wider moves in the European market. AIB ended the day up 1.4 per cent, while Bank of Ireland added 0.9 per cent.

That was offset by declines in Kerry and Glanbia, while insulation specialist Kingspan lost 2 per cent and Ryanair was nearly 1 per cent off the pace. Ferries group Irish Continental also edged lower, losing 1.4 per cent over the session.

Home builders Glenveagh and Cairn also made gains over the day,

London

The blue-chip FTSE 100 closed down 0.12 per cent, registering a marginal weekly decline on looming worries around inflation. The mid-cap FTSE 250 fell 0.63 per cent and also recorded a weekly loss.

Media stocks fell the most among sectors, down 2.2 per cent, with WPP declining 5.2 per cent.

However, gains in precious metal miners helped stem losses in the FTSE 100, up 5 per cent, as gold prices moved higher.

Fresnillo, Hochschild and Endeavour Mining gained between 5.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent.

Spire Healthcare jumped 14.1 per cent after the private hospital group said it was exploring strategic options, including a potential sale of the company.

Europe

The pan-European STOXX 600 closed 0.04 per cent lower at 554.81 points, while it was largely flat for the week.

The European banks index led gains for the day, up 1.26 per cent as it rebounded from a slump seen earlier this week.

Defence stocks rose 0.8 per cent, hovering near record highs. But the overall gains were offset by the media index, down 2.4 per cent to an over two-week low.

Energy stocks were also a drag, down 0.8 per cent. European technology stocks rallied, becoming the week’s top-performing sector with a gain of 4.9 per cent.

Further push came from advances in regional semiconductor stocks, rallying in line with global counterparts after a $5 billion deal between Intel and Nvidia.

Tyre maker Continental jumped 29.3 per cent a day after spinning off Aumovio. The auto parts and components supplier gained 1.2 per cent.

Hedge fund Man Group jumped 5.3 per cent after UBS upgraded the stock to “Buy” from “Neutral”.

European logistics companies Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd dropped 5.9 per cent and 4.8 per cent, respectively, as analysts flagged a sharp drop in container freight indices and warned US port volumes could soften.

New York

Wall Street’s main indexes were muted in choppy trading on Friday, with the Nasdaq easing from a record high, while FedEx rose as the parcel delivery firm posted upbeat quarterly results.

FedEx gained 2.7 per cent after reporting quarterly profit and revenue above analyst estimates on Thursday, as cost-cutting and strength in domestic deliveries helped offset weaker international volumes.

Apple added 2 per cent following a price target raise from JP Morgan, while Tesla was up 1.8 per cent after a report of Baird’s upgrade on the stock to “outperform” from “neutral”.

Their gains boosted the S&P 500 technology and consumer discretionary sectors, up 0.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively. These were the only sectors trading higher.

Industrials and energy indexes led broader declines.

At 11:37am in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.86 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 46,149.28, the S&P 500 gained 2.79 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 6,634.75 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 39.15 points, or 0.18 per cent, to 22,510.20.

In other stocks, Lennar fell 3 per cent after the home builder reported a lower third-quarter profit and forecast fourth-quarter home deliveries below estimates. – Additional reporting: Reuters

[TITLE]Rights Groups Call for Probe of World Bank Hospital Funding:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg) -- More than 50 human rights organizations, nonprofits and international development experts are calling on the World Bank to investigate its health-care investments in Africa and Asia, citing Bloomberg News articles about alleged patient abuses.

In stories published this year, Bloomberg found patients at World Bank-funded hospitals who said they were denied emergency medical care and held because of unpaid bills. The reporting also showed how whistleblowers raised alarms about what they called pressure to boost revenue by performing unnecessary procedures at one hospital in Kenya. Officials at another hospital in Pakistan alleged that financial reports were falsified. The hospital companies involved denied abusing patients or prioritizing profit over care.

Oxfam International, Bank Information Center, a Kenyan medical practitioners union and 57 other organizations and experts, urged the International Finance Corp., the arm of the World Bank that invests in businesses, to freeze any additional funding to for-profit health-care providers. They also called for an investigation by the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, an independent office responsible for addressing complaints from people impacted by IFC projects. And they asked the bank to put in place procedures to ensure that those harmed by its investments could seek effective remedies.

In a letter sent to the bank’s president and board of executive directors on Friday, the groups wrote that Bloomberg’s findings “corroborate years of evidence and concerns presented to the World Bank Board regarding the grievous harm caused by IFC’s direct and indirect healthcare investments to patients, workers and health systems. As the articles show, these issues are not isolated but rather recurring and systemic across several active IFC investments and in multiple jurisdictions.” The letter also cited reporting by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that raised similar questions.

The IFC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It previously told Bloomberg it has rigorous protocols in place for protecting patients and would tighten its appraisal and supervision process to address concerns.

[TITLE]Huawei Paris Launch: Watch GT 6 Pro and Ultimate 2 add underwater messaging, cycling power, and medical grade health:
[TEXT]
At Paris’s Vélodrome National, Huawei staged its most ambitious ecosystem showcase to date. The event focused on an interconnected lineup of wearables, smartphones, tablets, audio, and creative software. The strategy challenges Apple’s ecosystem advantage while addressing gaps competitors have not resolved.

Designer: Huawei

Huawei reports 200 million wearable shipments worldwide and cites the number one global position in wrist-worn devices during the first half of 2025. The GT Series alone has shipped 54 million units. These totals frame why Huawei sees itself as a category leader.

Consider a cyclist who needs real-time power data without expensive meters, a diver 40 meters down losing buddy contact, a creator editing 4K footage on location, someone requiring medical-grade blood pressure monitoring, or an artist who wants PC-level tools on mobile. This Paris showcase addresses each scenario with technology that stretches what consumer electronics can do.

Revolutionary Technology Addresses Real-World Problems

This launch connects breakthrough innovations across product categories to solve problems competitors have not addressed. The Watch GT 6 Pro introduces what Huawei describes as an industry-first virtual cycling power system that calculates real-time output without external power meters. According to Huawei, more than 1,000 wind tunnel experiments informed resistance models for varied riding scenarios. Riders enter basic inputs, including bike weight and body weight, then see power data in real time.

The Ultimate 2 debuts what Huawei positions as a sonar-based underwater messaging system. Divers can exchange preset messages at depths up to 30 meters, which addresses a safety gap that traditional dive computers do not solve. The system allows pairing with up to 50 diving buddies before descent, with preset message capability once underwater. During emergencies, pressing the upper left button sends an SOS alert that propagates through nearby watches, creating a multi-point safety network extending coverage beyond the initial 30-meter range through relay capabilities.

The Watch D2 offers 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring that Huawei says is certified by TÜV Rheinland. The goal is clinical-grade accuracy in a consumer device. Users can set up to 10 separate reminders per day or configure multiple consecutive measurements within custom time periods with 30 or 60-minute intervals. PulseWave Arrhythmia Analysis provides continuous heart health monitoring in the background, while a new emotional well-being indicator adds mental health tracking.

Complete Wearables Portfolio: Four Watches Targeting Every User

Watch GT 6 Pro: Professional Sports Authority

The GT 6 Pro keeps the octagonal design and adds a 3D bezel for dynamic highlights. The 1.47-inch AMOLED reaches 3,000 nits peak brightness, a 150 percent improvement for sunlight visibility. Aerospace-grade titanium with a hard coating improves scratch resistance. IP69 and 5ATM ratings support high-pressure water jets and swimming. Do not use these ratings to imply scuba diving.

Battery life reaches up to 21 days with light use and

[TITLE]GENFIT Announces Discontinuation of its VS-01 Program in ACLF: VS-01 Development Refocused on UCD:
[TEXT]
Lille (France), Cambridge (Massachusetts, United States), Zurich (Switzerland), September 19, 2025 - GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases, today announced its decision to discontinue its VS-01 program in ACLF (Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure), and reprioritize the development of VS-01 on UCD (Urea Cycle Disorder).

GENFIT’s decision follows the occurrence of a peritonitis case reported as Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in the UNVEIL-IT® clinical trial evaluating VS-01 in patients with ACLF grades 1, 2 or 3a and ascites and subsequent review and feedback from the independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC). The committee concluded that the trial could continue but required additional data and monitoring. Despite the possibility to move ahead with the study, GENFIT decided – after considering the target population’s clinical profile as well as the implications of this type of safety signal for the benefit/risk ratio of VS-01 in this indication – to discontinue both UNVEIL-IT® and the proof-of-concept study evaluating VS-01 in patients with Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) grades 2 to 4 in the presence of Acute Decompensation (AD) or ACLF grade 1 and ascites. GENFIT would like to thank patients, families, as well as investigators and their teams involved in these two trials.

GENFIT will continue the preclinical evaluation of VS-01 in UCD, a genetically driven disorder characterized by acute hyperammonemic crisis (HAC). The condition, patients and drug administration set-up will be very different from what they were in ACLF. There is a significant unmet medical need in this indication, and based on ammonia clearance data, we believe VS-01 has the potential to be a useful therapeutic option for children affected by this disease.

GENFIT remains fully committed to ACLF and associated conditions such as Acute Decompensation (AD) or Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE). ACLF is characterized by a critical unmet medical need, with no approved treatment options for patients facing poor prognosis and life-threatening risks. Since we embarked in this therapeutic area, we have engaged in multiple KOL interactions and observed growing interest in this indication, together with clear support for our clinical strategy. This feedback reinforces our confidence in our plan and validates our positioning. In this context, we ambition to accelerate the development of the four other assets currently under development in ACLF, which are all based on different mechanisms of action and use different routes of administration. We hope to deliver positive results, as we move forward, starting with safety data and early markers of efficacy on healthy volunteers with G1090N, expected at the end of this year. Other programs in the ACLF pipeline are SRT-015, CLM-022 and VS-02-HE.

By year-end, we also aim to share Phase 1b data in another life-threatening indication, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). CCA is a rare type of biliary tract cancer with high mortality and limited treatment options, and GNS561 is a novel autophagy/PPT1 inhibitor currently evaluated in combination with a MEK inhibitor in CCA with KRAS mutation.

Following the discontinuation of our VS-01 program in ACLF, we anticipate a substantial reduction in our operating expenses. This will provide strategic flexibility, either as an opportunity to extend projected cash runway by at least a year versus previous guidance, i.e. beyond 20281, or as a means to explore new mechanistic approaches through business development initiatives aiming to tackle the multiple dimensions of the urgent gaps in ACLF care.

[TITLE]Huawei Paris Launch: Watch GT 6 Pro and Ultimate 2 add underwater messaging, cycling power, and medical grade health:
[TEXT]
At Paris’s Vélodrome National, Huawei staged its most ambitious ecosystem showcase to date. The event focused on an interconnected lineup of wearables, smartphones, tablets, audio, and creative software. The strategy challenges Apple’s ecosystem advantage while addressing gaps competitors have not resolved.

Designer: Huawei

Huawei reports 200 million wearable shipments worldwide and cites the number one global position in wrist-worn devices during the first half of 2025. The GT Series alone has shipped 54 million units. These totals frame why Huawei sees itself as a category leader.

Consider a cyclist who needs real-time power data without expensive meters, a diver 40 meters down losing buddy contact, a creator editing 4K footage on location, someone requiring medical-grade blood pressure monitoring, or an artist who wants PC-level tools on mobile. This Paris showcase addresses each scenario with technology that stretches what consumer electronics can do.

Revolutionary Technology Addresses Real-World Problems

This launch connects breakthrough innovations across product categories to solve problems competitors have not addressed. The Watch GT 6 Pro introduces what Huawei describes as an industry-first virtual cycling power system that calculates real-time output without external power meters. According to Huawei, more than 1,000 wind tunnel experiments informed resistance models for varied riding scenarios. Riders enter basic inputs, including bike weight and body weight, then see power data in real time.

The Ultimate 2 debuts what Huawei positions as a sonar-based underwater messaging system. Divers can exchange preset messages at depths up to 30 meters, which addresses a safety gap that traditional dive computers do not solve. The system allows pairing with up to 50 diving buddies before descent, with preset message capability once underwater. During emergencies, pressing the upper left button sends an SOS alert that propagates through nearby watches, creating a multi-point safety network extending coverage beyond the initial 30-meter range through relay capabilities.

The Watch D2 offers 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring that Huawei says is certified by TÜV Rheinland. The goal is clinical-grade accuracy in a consumer device. Users can set up to 10 separate reminders per day or configure multiple consecutive measurements within custom time periods with 30 or 60-minute intervals. PulseWave Arrhythmia Analysis provides continuous heart health monitoring in the background, while a new emotional well-being indicator adds mental health tracking.

Complete Wearables Portfolio: Four Watches Targeting Every User

Watch GT 6 Pro: Professional Sports Authority

The GT 6 Pro keeps the octagonal design and adds a 3D bezel for dynamic highlights. The 1.47-inch AMOLED reaches 3,000 nits peak brightness, a 150 percent improvement for sunlight visibility. Aerospace-grade titanium with a hard coating improves scratch resistance. IP69 and 5ATM ratings support high-pressure water jets and swimming. Do not use these ratings to imply scuba diving.

Battery life reaches up to 21 days with light use and
