[TEXT]
A growing number of mainland Chinese tech firms are tapping Hong Kong for research talent and overseas expansion, as the Asian financial hub moves to attract Big Tech and start-ups to boost its technology sector.

Arm China, the Chinese unit of British semiconductor firm Arm Holdings, would establish a chip intellectual property research and development centre in Hong Kong in 2026 that would focus on artificial intelligence and robotics, Arm China senior technical director Zou Wei said last month.

The new centre would be located at the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, and aimed to recruit around 100 people within three years, according to Zou.

Not long ago, Hong Kong's share-sale market was a symbol of China's slowdown: Deal books were thin, investor sentiment was sour and bankers were fleeing the industry. This year, the script has flipped.Share sales nearly quadrupled to more than $73 billion through initial public offerings, placements and block trades. For the first time since 2013, that made Hong Kong the No. 1 fundraising spot in Asia, ranking just behind the US globally. The city has been at the front of a dealmaking boom across the continent that included a record year for IPOs in India, and strong markets in mainland China and Japan.In Hong Kong, Chinese companies fuelled the frenzy with gargantuan deals to power their global expansion plans.

[TITLE]Hong Kong set to keep its IPO crown in 2026 on mega deals and return of US capital: UBS:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong's initial public offering (IPO) market is on track to maintain its status as the world's top fundraising venue next year, underpinned by a pipeline of mega deals and the return of US capital, according to UBS.

The Swiss investment bank expects more than HK$300 billion (US$38.5 billion) to be raised from 150 to 200 IPOs in 2026, surpassing the roughly HK$270 billion raised this year, which vaulted the city back to No 1 globally.

UBS also forecast that the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index could climb to 30,000 points next year, implying a 17.5 per cent gain from Thursday's close of 25,530.

[TITLE]Asian stocks rise on Fed rate cut optimism:
[TEXT]
Asian equities rose Friday as investors tracked a record day on Wall Street in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut.

The gains came despite renewed concerns

[TITLE]Global stocks fall ahead of Fed rate announcement:

Most markets fell on Wednesday following a tepid day on Wall Street as investors bided their time ahead of a highly anticipated Federal Reserve policy announcement later in the day.

Earnings from tech giants Oracle and Broadcom this week are also in view amid lingering worries about an artificial intelligence-fuelled bubble that caused some panic on trading floors last month.

With US central bankers expected to cut interest rates for the third straight session later Wednesday, the main focus is on their post-meeting statement, boss Jerome Powell’s news conference and the “dot plot” forecast for 2026 policy.

After November’s tech-led swoon, markets have enjoyed a healthy run in recent weeks as weak jobs figures reinforced expectations for another step lower in borrowing costs.

But that has cooled heading into the Fed gathering amid speculation it will announce a “hawkish cut” that plays down the chances of a fourth successive reduction.

Data on Tuesday showing an uptick in job openings — against estimates for a drop — further tempered expectations for a string of cuts next year, with markets now pricing in two more over the next 12 months, compared with three previously seen.

Pepperstone’s Chris Weston said the figures “catalysed a repricing of US forward Fed rate expectations”.

After a weak day in New York, where the S&P 500 and Dow dropped, Asia fared no better.

Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Seoul, Mumbai, Wellington, Jakarta and Manila all fell, though Hong Kong and Taipei edged up.

Shanghai dropped even as data showed China’s consumer prices rose last month at their fastest pace in almost two years, following an extended period of deflationary pressure in the world’s second-largest economy.

London, Paris and Frankfurt opened in the red.

Still, there is some hope that the Fed will turn more dovish next year with President Donald Trump’s top economic aide, Kevin Hassett — the frontrunner to succeed Powell in May — saying he sees plenty of room to substantially lower rates.

“While he has indicated that he would respond to the data and that he would not bow to political pressure to decide whether to cut interest rates, if he becomes the next chair, it is clear that on the current backdrop, he is comfortable with more easing than many board members, wrote National Australia Bank’s Taylor Nugent.

Aside from the Fed saga, investors are also keenly awaiting earnings from software giant Oracle and chipmaker Broadcom, which will be used to judge the outlook for the tech sector in the wake of huge investments in artificial intelligence.

Markets have been pumped higher for the past two years by the surge into all things AI, though there has been some concern of late that the hundreds of billions splashed out might not see returns as early as hoped.

“Oracle may not have a substantial weight in the S&P 500 or NAS100 to move the index on its own,” said Pepperstone’s Weston. “But what they detail on its capex intentions and future funding plans could resonate across the AI space.”

Rich Asian investors are plowing record money into complex stock bets that saddled them with big losses just a few years ago. Issuance of structured products linked to Hong Kong and Singapore equities has surged 80% this year to a record of more than $200 billion, according to estimates from BNP Paribas SA, one of the top issuers. Products known as accumulators-which make their holders continuously buy stocks at preset levels-and fixed-coupon notes that offer monthly returns are particularly popular.The revival coincides with a surge in Asia's equities driven by the artificial intelligence frenzy. Typically marketed by private banks to wealthy clients, structured-note bets this year have been concentrated in Chinese mega-caps such as Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, a shift away from US names like Nvidia Corp. The instruments help holders build exposure to stocks in a more controlled way, though their complex structure means losses can worsen under certain conditions."Issuance was very limited for the last few years, up until September of last year," said Tony Lee, of JPMorgan Chase & Co., referring to notes tied to Asian stocks. “Because of the recovery of the Chinese market, the product underlyings have shifted from US stocks into Hong Kong stocks.”While US investors’ appetite toward structured products has been growing, Asia remains the main market. More than 60% of the global sales came from the region in the first seven months of 2025, led by China and Hong Kong, according to industry data provider SRP.The instruments generally offer a smaller maximum payout than stocks, but some investors are lured by their regular, fixed payments that are usually higher than bond yields, or by the embedded protection they offer.Yet the risks can be overlooked: The Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, the Covid outbreak and China’s internet crackdown that triggered a multi-year stock slump are just a few incidents that handed steep losses to investors.Traded over-the-counter, accumulators are contracts that force investors to buy a set amount of underlying securities at a fixed price over regular intervals. In a rising market, the purchase price is usually at a discount. During downturns, however, holders are often locked into buying at above-market prices.At CA Indosuez Wealth Management, some of the most-traded accumulators require investors to purchase double the initially agreed amount of Alibaba shares if the stock price drops more a certain amount, often between 10% and 20% of the level at the start of the investment, according to Ting May Woo, the firm’s head of advisory solutions in Singapore.For fixed-coupon notes, the return is typically tied to an asset such as an equity gauge, single stock or group of shares. Barclays Plc recently offered one that pays an annualized coupon of 9% every month and has the principle linked to the performance of Alibaba, Tencent and Meituan, according to a term sheet seen by Bloomberg. If any of the three stocks drops 28% or more from its price at the investment entry, holders have to buy its shares at a higher price than the current trading level or settle in cash at losses.Alibaba is the most popular underlying asset among the structured notes issued in Asia this year, according to Daniel So, senior trading strategist at Goldhorse Capital Management, which runs a fintech platform that offers pricing of structured notes. The coupon offered by notes tied to Chinese AI names often ranges between 10% and 20% annualized, higher than the 10% to 12% for those tracking an index, he said.Demand is surging as the stocks rally. Alibaba shares jumped nearly 90% this year in Hong Kong, while the Hang Seng Tech Index rose 26% to end years of underperformance against US peers.At Royal Bank of Canada, between 30% and 40% of the equity-linked notes tracked Hong Kong-listed equities in 2025, according to Kin Lok Lee, head of structured products for the wealth-management arm in Hong Kong. That’s up from about 20% in 2024, when around 80% of the fixed-coupon products were linked to US names, he added.“Investors who buy these notes usually can accept the worst-case scenario — which is to buy these shares at pre-determined strike levels higher than market prices — because they hold the belief that these stocks will eventually recover,” Goldhorse’s So said.It’s not uncommon for wealthy investors to take on leverage, allowing them to boost bets and amplify returns, according to CA Indosuez’s Woo. Of course, the losses would also get amplified in an adverse scenario.The challenge for BNP Paribas is to manage risk given that the current notes are concentrated on a small number of names, according to Charles-Edouard Garnier, the bank’s head of equity-derivatives sales for Asia-ex Japan. Still, this year’s market gains have spurred risk taking and reinvestment as products terminated early with share prices climbing beyond knock-out levels before maturity.“I wouldn’t be surprised to have another very decent growth next year, assuming that the market doesn’t collapse,” he said.
