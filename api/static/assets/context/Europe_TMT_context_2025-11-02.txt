[TITLE]Finovate Global Canada: Wealthsimple’s $10 Billion Valuation and a Look at Investment Trends:
[TEXT]
This week’s edition of Finovate Global features recent fintech news from Canada.

Wealthsimple secures $750 million at valuation of $10 billion

Canadian fintech Wealthsimple has raised CAD $750 million at a post-money valuation of CAD $10 billion. The funding round includes both a CAD $550 million primary offering and a secondary offering of up to CAD $200 million. Dragoneer Investment Group and GIC led the round, which also featured participation from new investor Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) as well as existing investors Power Corporation of Canada, IGM Financial Inc. ICONIQ, Greylock, and Meritech.

“This raise reflects deep confidence from new and returning investors in our mission and our role as a defining Canadian company,” Wealthsimple Co-Founder and CEO Michael Katchen said. “We were intentional in choosing partners committed to the long-term future of Wealthsimple. These are well-respected, global leaders with a proven track record (of) scaling category leaders, and who believe in our vision for the future of financial services.”

Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Wealthsimple offers a suite of low-cost financial solutions to help Canadians build wealth. The company’s platform features self-directed investing, managed portfolios, digital asset investing, tax filing, advisor services, and more in a single, integrated experience. Wealthsimple serves three million Canadians and has $100 billion in assets under administration.

“Few companies have achieved what Wealthsimple has in the last few years,” Dragoneer Investment Group Partner Christian Jensen said. “The Wealthsimple team has built an expansive financial platform that millions of Canadians trust. They’re not just participating in Canada’s financial services industry; they’re redefining it.”

Earlier this year, Wealthsimple unveiled a waitlist for its first credit card, which topped 300,000 Canadians in the first six months. The company’s fundraising news follows a profitable 2024 and current profitability in 2025, as well. The capital infusion will help Wealthsimple accelerate its product roadmap in investing, spending, and credit, as well as support the company’s efforts to expand its platform.

Fintech investment slows in H1 ahead of potential rebound in H2

Speaking of investment and Canadian fintech, KPMG’s Canada Fintech Investment Report is a great way to get up to speed on the investment trends that are supporting fintech innovation in Canada. The report was published in August, and focuses on investment trends from the first half of 2025.

While the report indicates that Canadian fintech investment fell significantly compared to international trends, the report authors suggest that the first half of 2025 represented a normalization in the wake of record high levels of investment in 2024. Areas of investor interest include AI, especially agentic AI, and digital assets, which represent a continuation of trends from 2024. A more positive regulatory tone toward cryptocurrencies—especially stablecoins—in the US has been credited for this rebound in interest in digital assets. The report also noted some interest in quantum computing among insurers.

“Last year was exceptionally strong for fintech investment, thanks to two major take-private deals,” Dubie Cunningham, a Partner in KPMG in Canada’s Banking and Capital Markets Practice, explained. “Since then, investment activity has dropped to more stable levels. In fact, when you consider the economic shifts such as tariffs affecting global trade, investment in the first half was quite robust compared to historical levels. There’s still a lot of dry powder ready to be deployed by investors, but they are demonstrating more selective behavior than in previous years. They’re looking for quality companies and we’re seeing longer tails for maturing mid-to-large stage private equity deals.”

Coming to Canada: Atlanta’s Rainforest and Lebanon’s Whish Money

This week reminds us of how attractive Canada is to a growing number of fintechs around the world. Rainforest, a embedded payments company based in Atlanta, Georgia, announced recently that it is looking to expand to Canada. The company, founded in 2022, secured $29 million in funding in September, taking its total capital raised to $57.5 million. The idea of expanding to Canada, as Rainforest Founder and CEO Joshua Silver explained to Global Atlanta, represents more than a regional expansion for the company itself. The move would also help Rainforest’s platform client expand their offerings in a new market.

Rainforest specializes in payments partnerships with software providers that target businesses in underserved industry sectors. These software providers themselves are an underserved segment of the industry—processing $50 million to $2 billion in annual payments. Rainforest offers an embedded payments solution that enables software platforms to provide a robust payments experience for their end merchants without having to register as a payment facilitator with card networks.

Hailing from even farther away than the Peach State where Rainforest resides is Whish Money. Headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon, and regulated by the country’s central bank, Whish Money announced this week that it had secured financial services licenses in Canada. The regulatory approvals are the first for the company outside of the MENA region, and is part of a global expansion that includes entering markets in the US, the UK, the EU, and Australia.

“Securing our Canadian license is a monumental step that validates our compliant, customer-focused model and sets the foundation for our international expansion,” Whish Money board chairman Toufic Koussa said. “This move is

[TITLE]Datavault AI Issues Formal Response to Wolfpack Research’s Malicious Short Report; Company Affirms the Strength of Its Intellectual Property, Leadership, and Strategic Direction:
[TEXT]
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN -- Datavault AI (NASDAQ: DVLT) (“Datavault,” “DVLT,” or the “Company”), a leader in data tokenization and management, has noted that Wolfpack Research recently issued a self-serving and malicious short report targeting the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, Nathaniel T. Bradley. The Company strongly condemns this action and issues the following formal statement:

1. The Wolfpack Research Report Contains False and Defamatory Claims Aimed at Manipulating DVLT Stock for Financial Gain

The Wolfpack Research report includes numerous false, misleading, and defamatory statements intended to manipulate Datavault AI’s stock for the financial benefit of short sellers.

These claims lack factual foundation and have caused reputational harm to the Company and its stockholders. Wolfpack Research has openly acknowledged its short position in DVLT shares—demonstrating that its so-called “research” is driven by self-interest rather than truth.

“It’s obvious that these actors are financially benefitting from spreading false information,” said Nathaniel Bradley, Chief Executive Officer of Datavault AI. “We intend to file suit to hold Wolfpack Research accountable for its malicious conduct and to protect the rights of our shareholders.”

Short selling is a recognized market practice; however, intentional market manipulation through false and defamatory statements is not. The Company is evaluating Wolfpack Research’s actions and will pursue all legal remedies available under applicable law.

2. Datavault AI Has Engaged Legal Counsel and Formally Demanded Wolfpack Research Cease and Desist its Tortious Conduct

Datavault AI has retained Paul Hastings LLP and Dickinson Wright PLLC to advise on litigation strategy and regulatory action. The Company is evaluating its legal rights and intends to pursue all available remedies to protect its reputation and the legitimate interests of its stockholders.

Jacob Frenkel, Securities Enforcement Practice Chair at Dickinson Wright PLLC and lead litigation counsel for Datavault AI, stated: “the proper place for such purveyors and backers of ‘short and distort’ content is in a defendant’s chair in a courtroom, and that is exactly where the Company intends to put Wolfpack Research. Such abusive, fraudulent and manipulative practices mislead the market, sow distrust and harm shareholders. Mr. Bradley is committed to acting with the best interest of his Company’s shareholders, which is the precise reason for pursuing legal recourse against such defamatory report-writers. The lawsuit will spell out the false and misleading statements with specificity to the point of being a roadmap for federal enforcement authorities also to put the authors and instigators of the Wolfpack Research report in a defendant’s chair.”

3. Datavault AI Reaffirms the Strength of Its Intellectual Property and Strategic Value

Datavault AI’s value is anchored in its robust intellectual property portfolio, which comprises over 70 U.S. and international patents covering AI-driven data valuation, inaudible audio signal technology, blockchain tokenization frameworks, and enterprise data monetization systems.

“Our strategy is rooted in IP and execution, not speculation,” said Bradley. “The technology we’ve developed is already creating value across industries —from digital identity and healthcare to acoustic data and real-world asset tokenization. That foundation is unshakable.”

Datavault’s IP portfolio provides licensing revenue opportunities and a formidable barrier to entry for competitors. Recent patent grants include those covering carbon-credit tokenization on blockchain, virtual-reality data integration, and AI-driven audio tracking systems.

4. Professional History of Nathaniel T. Bradley

Nathaniel T. Bradley is a prolific American inventor and entrepreneur with more than two decades of experience in mobile marketing, audio processing, AI, and data monetization. He founded AudioEye, Inc. (NASDAQ: AEYE), pioneering digital accessibility technology used worldwide, and later Augme Technologies / Hipcricket, a mobile advertising platform that served Fortune 500 clients. Bradley was recognized as an EY Entrepreneur of the Year Finalist and received the Edison Gold Award for Social Impact.

At Datavault AI, Bradley has led the development of innovations in AI data valuation, blockchain for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and AI-powered audio communication through the Company’s ADIO® technology. His reputation for building mission-driven, patent-protected platforms is widely recognized across both technology and capital markets.

5. Recent Successes and Milestones

Formed a strategic alliance with NYIAX to enable smart-contract data exchanges. Completed the acquisition of CompuSystems Inc. (CSI) assets, expanding enterprise event data capabilities. Launched the WiSA E Endeavour™ Receiver Module through the Company’s Acoustic Science division. Partnered with Nature’s Miracle Holding Inc. and Harrison Global Holdings Inc. to launch “The X Club” for the global XRP community. Signed a 12-month national media series with New to The Street to enhance investor visibility. Clarified executive vesting disclosures to reinforce corporate governance transparency. Announced the incorporation and preparation of launching four independent data-exchanges – International Elements Exchange Inc., International NIL Exchange Inc., Information Data Exchange Inc., and American Political Exchange Inc., leveraging Datavault AI’s patent portfolio (now exceeding 70 assets) and targeting real-world asset tokenization, NIL rights monetization, corporate data marketplaces and political donation transparency.

[TITLE]ChatGPT-creator OpenAI announces massive new data center in Michigan:
[TEXT]
The northwest side of U.S. 12 between Case Road and Willow Road in Saline Township – part of the site where Texas-based Related Digital has proposed building a data center – as seen looking north from above Willow Road near Rustic Glen Golf Course on Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025. Jacob Hamilton | MLive.com

WASHTENAW COUNTY, MI – OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is opening a massive new data center in Michigan that state officials say will be one of the most advanced AI infrastructure facilities in the U.S.

The 2.2-million-square-foot data center will be built in early 2026 in Saline Township, a rural community in southeast Washtenaw County, the company announced Thursday, Oct. 30.

OpenAI said the facility will not need any additional power generation to operate, using a closed-loop cooling system that significantly reduces water consumption. DTE Energy will serve the data center, using existing excess transmission capacity so there won’t be any impact on local energy supply.

“Michigan has long been at the center of American engineering and manufacturing,” the company said in a news release. “We’re proud to build here and to continue expanding the infrastructure needed to ensure the benefits of AI reach everyone.”

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Michigan was selected for the multi-billion-dollar project because of the state’s strong construction and tech workforce, capable of both building and operating the facility.

“Today, we won the largest economic project in Michigan history,” Whitmer said in a statement announcing the project. “This transformational new Stargate OpenAI facility, built by Oracle and Related Digital, will create 2,500 good-paying union construction jobs, more than 450 permanent high-skill, high-paying jobs on site, and 1,500 more in the community while helping us lead the future of advanced manufacturing and technology.”

“I’m grateful to these cutting-edge companies for betting on Michigan, building on our work to compete for and win big projects in next-generation industries from cars and clean energy to semiconductors and batteries.”

The project, being developed by Related Digital, has been met with pushback from local officials in Saline Township. The fact that OpenAI was behind the project was previously undisclosed to the public.

Maintaining the area’s rural character has been a key issue among many of the dozens of residents who expressed concerns or outright opposed the data center proposal at township meetings. Worries also included electricity usage, the impact of construction, noise generation, and potential negative impacts on the environment and neighbors.

Whitmer said the project will preserve more than 700 acres of open space that will be retained and used as farmland, wetland, and forest. The Michigan Department of Transportation said the project will have minimal effects on local traffic.

Related Digital also agreed to invest $14 million toward local fire departments, a community investment fund and farmland preservation trust. The Saline Township Board of Trustees requested the investment as part of a deal allowing the data center to move forward.

DTE said the new power-hungry data center will increase the total demand on its system by 25%, adding 1.4 gigawatts in demand. DTE CEO Joi Harris said the utility planned to spend an additional $6 billion over the coming five years to serve the data center customer and continue modernizing its grid. Harris said the data center will not result in increased customer rates.

OpenAI has previously announced six other U.S. Stargate sites with Oracle and SoftBank, located in Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, and Ohio. Combined with those projects, Michigan’s new facility will bring Stargate to over 8 gigawatts of planned capacity, representing more than $450 billion in investment over the next three years, OpenAI said.

[TITLE]Saudi Arabia, UAE Pour Over $130 B Into AI To Offset Oil Price Risks:
[TEXT]
Previously, we reported that Saudi Arabia is digging in for a "long and shallow" oil price war as it looks to regain market share from rivals like U.S. shale producers and OPEC+ members who have been exceeding their production quotas. This comes after Saudi Arabia made significant production sacrifices to support prices for over three years, which allowed competitors to increase their output. Saudi Arabia has also been hedging its oil price bets by rapidly diversifying its economy away from fossil fuels in recent years, expanding into areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), sports and tourism. Indeed, Saudi Arabia's Minister for Investment Khalid Al Falih has revealed that non-oil activities now drive more than half the country’s GDP, with that percentage growing.

And, the battle between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for Middle East AI supremacy is quickly heating up. The two countries are not only spending heavily to beef up their AI infrastructure, including building some of the world’s largest data center clusters, but are also forming strategic alliances with U.S. tech giants. Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 strategy has singled out AI as vital to the country’s economic transformation, with 70% of its goals involving data and AI.

Saudi Arabian artificial intelligence company Humain has launched a $10 billion venture capital fund called Humain Ventures dedicated to investing in AI startups across the United States, Europe, and Asia. Owned by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Humain Ventures is a key part of Saudi Arabia's larger strategy to become a global hub for AI, and a key part of its Vision 2030 plan for economic diversification. Launched earlier in the current year, Humain has already begun deploying capital into AI infrastructure projects. In pursuit of its AI ambitions, Humain also entered into significant partnerships with major U.S. technology companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud service AWS, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and giant data center REIT Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX).

Back in May, Oracle announced a $14 billion investment in Saudi Arabia's digital cloud and AI infrastructure over 10 years, as part of its commitment to the Kingdom's Vision 2030. This investment will expand the company's cloud and AI presence by building a comprehensive network of data centers, including existing regions in Riyadh and Jeddah and planned expansions in NEOM and Dammam. AWS and Humain have announced a joint $5 billion investment to build an AI zone in the Kingdom. Meanwhile, Equinix has announced plans to build a $1 billion data center in Saudi Arabia to meet surging demand for AI, cloud and enterprise workloads.

The UAE has also launched a slew of AI investments. Last year, the Abu Dhabi government launched MGX, a technology investment company specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced technologies. The fund was founded as a partnership between Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, and the AI and cloud computing company G42. MGX focuses on AI infrastructure (data centers and connectivity), Semiconductors (chip design and manufacturing)

Core AI technologies and applications (software, data, and robotics). At its launch, MGX had a target of managing over $100 billion in assets, making it one of the largest funds in the world dedicated to AI.

Since its March 2024 launch, MGX has made several high-profile moves, showcasing its ambition to become a major player in the global AI industry. In September 2024, MGX formed a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) dubbed the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP) to invest up to $100 billion in AI data centers and energy infrastructure. Nvidia is a key partner of GAIIP, offering its expertise in AI factories and data centers. Meanwhile, Stargate UAE is a massive AI data center cluster in Abu Dhabi, developed in partnership between the Emirati AI firm G42 and US tech giants like OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Stargate UAE is the first international deployment of OpenAI's ambitious global AI infrastructure initiative, also named "Stargate". Positioned as a "national infrastructure," Stargate UAE will provide the country with its own powerful and secure AI capabilities as part of the UAE's broader strategy to diversify its economy and reduce reliance on external technology infrastructure. The project's central feature is a 1-gigawatt AI supercomputing cluster, with an initial 200-megawatt phase planned to be operational by 2026. This facility will be equipped with advanced Nvidia hardware to meet the massive computational demands of training and running large AI models.

Further, Abu Dhabi has unveiled plans to invest AED 13 billion (equivalent to $3.54 billion) in its Digital Strategy 2025–2027, with the goal of becoming the world's first fully "AI-native" government by 2027. The strategy aims to automate 100% of all government processes and integrate AI into all digital services.

[TITLE]AGR Verdict: Limited Relief Seen for Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel Faces Setback:
[TEXT]
Telecom majors Bharti Airtel Ltd., Vodafone Idea Ltd., and Indus Towers Ltd. have dawn focus after the Supreme Court's judgment on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues was made public, with analysts flagging limited room for relief.

The apex court this week allowed the central government to reconsider issues related to Vodafone Idea's adjusted gross revenue dues raised for the period up to fiscal year 2016-2017, offering a potential breather to the debt-laden telecom operator.

The order's Point 7 clarified that any relief package from the government can only be extended to the company and not to other players. This has been viewed as negative for Bharti Airtel, which still faces AGR liabilities estimated between Rs 40,000 crore and Rs 50,000 crore.

For Vodafone Idea and Indus Towers, Point 6 of the order stated that any claim is restricted only to the additional AGR demand raised for the period up to the financial year 2017.

Analysts believe this means even if relief is granted, it would apply only to the newer AGR demand of about Rs 9,450 crore, which represents just 12% of VI's total AGR dues and about 5% of its overall debt.

Market participants said the judgment dims hopes of broad-based relief for the telecom sector, reinforcing concerns around high leverage and regulatory uncertainty.

[TEXT]
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SurgePays, Inc. (NASDAQ: SURG), a wireless and fintech technology company connecting underserved consumers to essential mobile and financial services, today announced the launch of its new Growth Marketing and Data Partnerships Division. The initiative marks a significant step in SurgePays’ strategy to transform its expanding consumer data ecosystem into a scalable, high-margin growth engine.

The division will be led by James Herber, who has been appointed Vice President of Growth Marketing and Data Partnerships. He brings deep expertise in digital acquisition, audience strategy, and partnership development across the fintech and telecommunications industries. In this newly created role, Mr. Herber will lead efforts to monetize SurgePays’ expanding data ecosystem, strengthen digital marketing capabilities, and build recurring revenue channels that enhance long-term shareholder value.

It accelerates the company’s transition from a transactional platform into a data-driven revenue network. By leveraging verified consumer interactions from its telecom and fintech channels, SurgePays is positioned to deliver targeted marketing, cross-sell opportunities, and predictive insights to both internal and external partners.

“The intersection of marketing and data represents SurgePays’ next growth frontier,” said James Herber, Vice President of Growth Marketing and Data Partnerships. “We are building a platform where every engagement produces intelligence, and every insight creates measurable value for our partners and shareholders. Our initial objective was to eliminate the cost of acquiring a customer relationship, but with the team and tools at SurgePays, I believe this division will become one of the company’s largest revenue drivers within the next twelve to eighteen months. We look forward to sharing updates soon as we launch our front-end website and introduce additional complementary products and services.”

The initiative is expected to generate high-margin recurring revenue through data partnerships, analytics integrations, and targeted marketing programs. As SurgePays continues to scale its wireless and fintech operations, the combination of customer intelligence and marketing execution will serve as a long-term competitive advantage.
