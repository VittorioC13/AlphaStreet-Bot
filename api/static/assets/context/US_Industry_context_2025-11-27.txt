[TITLE]Why ‘hold forever’ investors are snapping up venture capital ‘zombies’:
[TEXT]
Italian company Bending Spoons flew largely under the radar — until last month. In a span of 48 hours, the company announced the acquisition of AOL and a massive $270 million raise, quadrupling its valuation to $11 billion, up from $2.55 billion set in early 2024.

Bending Spoons has grown rapidly by acquiring stagnating tech brands like Evernote, Meetup, and Vimeo, then turning them profitable through aggressive cost-cutting and price increases. While the company’s approach is similar to private equity, there is one key difference: Bending Spoons has no plans to sell these businesses.

Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, a firm that also acquires and revitalizes what he calls “venture zombies,” is convinced this “hold forever” strategy will become increasingly prominent in the coming years as AI-native startups make older VC-backed software businesses less relevant.

“Our belief is that the venture power law, in which 80% of companies ‘fail,’ produces many great businesses, even if they’re not unicorns,” Dumont told TechCrunch.

Dumont defines a “great business” as one that can be purchased at a low price and quickly revived to generate substantial cash flows. This “buy, fix, and hold” strategy is the playbook for a growing number of investors, from the 30-year-old Constellation Software, which pioneered the model, to newer players, including Bending Spoons, Tiny, SaaS.group, Arising Ventures, and Calm Capital, according to Dumont.

“Our whole model is to buy these companies, make them profitable, and use those earnings to grow the business,” Dumont said.

In 2023, Curious raised $16 million in dedicated capital for buying software companies that have stalled and can no longer secure follow-on investment.

Since then, the firm has bought five businesses, including UserVoice, a 17-year-old startup that raised $9 million in VC funding from Betaworks and SV Angel.

“It’s a great business, but the cap table wasn’t aligned with keeping it. These funds get old, and these companies just sit there,” Dumont said. “We provide liquidity and also reset these companies for profitability.”

Although Dumont didn’t disclose how much he paid for UserVoice, he said that stagnant companies sell for a fraction of the valuation commanded by healthy SaaS startups, which typically sell for 4x annual revenue or more. Based on our conversation, we estimate that “venture zombies” sometimes sell for as low as 1x yearly revenue.

By implementing cost-cutting and price increases, Curious can push these businesses to achieve 20% to 30% profit margins almost immediately. “If you have a million-dollar business, you’re kicking off $300,000 in earnings,” he offered as an example.

They achieve the turnarounds because, unlike the stand-alone companies, they can centralize functions like sales, marketing, finance, and other admin roles, across all of their portfolio companies. “We’re not trying to sell the businesses we acquire and don’t need VC-scale exits, so we can balance growth and profitability more sustainably,” Dumont said.

When asked why VCs don’t urge their startups to be profitable like Curious does, Dumont responded by saying: “Investors don’t care

[TITLE]Fundamentals and Capital Are Back for NYC’s Office Market: Forum:
[TEXT]
“New York is back — period.” Those were the words used by Vornado Realty Trust’s Glen Weiss to describe the state of office leasing in New York City at Commercial Observer’s Fall State of Office Forum on Nov. 20 at Terminal Warehouse on the far West Side of Manhattan.

The rest of the speakers and panelists seemed to share that sentiment.

Indeed, there was a definite sea change from previous years, when many of the city’s landlords and brokers tried to put the best face on a market that was unsure if it could fully overcome work-from-home trends, or crushing interest rates, or the general uncertainty that has haunted the office market since COVID.

The morning kicked off with Megan Abraham of The Goldie Initiative introducing a conversation between Jonathan Mechanic, chairman at law firm Fried Frank‘s real estate practice, and David Levinson, chairman and CEO of L&L Holding Company, which developed Terminal Warehouse with Columbia Property Trust.

Levinson touted the low vacancy rate for prime Manhattan office space, the rising rents and the facts that money was coming back into the market and deals were getting inked again. “I wish I had empty space in my building on Park Avenue,” Levinson said. “I would get 30 to 40 percent more rent.”

The action jumped to a panel entitled “Lessons Learned From a Pivotal Year: Office’s Comeback & Forecasts for 2026,” which included Vornado’s Weiss, Empire State Realty Trust’s Chistina Chiu, SL Green Realty’s Steven Durels and Eastdil Secured’s Will Silverman. Andrew Charles from law firm HSF Kramer moderated the panel.

“There’s really no sublease space,” Weiss said a few minutes after declaring Gotham office victorious at the end of its years-long battle with COVID. “There are no blocks of space. [In] the better buildings there are single-digit vacancies. . . . Demand is robust. Tenants are expanding. Everyone wants to live, work and eat in New York.”

“Nobody talks about return to office any more — because it’s already happened,” said Chiu.

And the sales and financing market has been robust.

This is “probably the first in at least 25 years of a fundamentals-led capital markets recovery in New York City,” said Silverman (emphasis his). “Every prior moment, any time we came out of the darkness, it was always the capital markets getting in front of the fundamentals. This was the first time it was the other way around. I can’t tell you how many conversations we had in late 2024 and early 2025 with private equity firms calling and saying, ‘We’re getting more constructive on office.’ We’d say, ‘What changed your view?’ They’d say, ‘We tried to find space.’”

Silverman said that in addition to two recent buyers from Greece, he’s seen an Argentinian buyer who had never bought in New York before. “Eastdil did [$9.5] billion in office financing,” Silverman said about New York City alone ($30 billion nationwide, Silverman later told CO).

Likewise, Weiss also declared that buyers “like us” have a big appetite for new product, and Durels spoke about SL Green’s recent purchase of the old Brooks Brothers building at 346 Madison Avenue for an “800,000-square-foot building that we’ll start demolition on spec.”

Tenants are also back, as per the panel “Between the Headlines: Market Drivers Impacting Growth & Talent Acquisition,” moderated by Lowenstein Sandler partner Julia Sanabria. Adam Frazier of Columbia Property Trust, David Goldstein of Savills and Tyler McCaine of Tishman Speyer described a very different landscape three years ago than now.

Part of Gotham’s success has something to do with the fact that it’s been competitive with prime tech markets. If one had said 15 years ago that New York City would have been securing tech tenants over places like San Francisco, “you would have been laughed at,” said Related’s Philippe Visser in a later conversation with Joanne Franzel and Jennifer Yashar of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. Back then, New York “had some dot-coms — and that’s adorable,” but it wasn’t getting the big techies. That’s changed.

“There’s zero square feet you can rent at Hudson Yards right now,” said Visser (again, emphasis his). In fact, Visser said that Related is so enamored with office that it announced in September that 625 Madison Avenue — which it had bought from SL Green in 2024 and previously planned to rebuild as residential — was being reconceived as high-end office.

“Two-hundred dollars per foot is the new 100,” said Visser. “And 300 is the new 200.”

The one specter that hovered over the morning’s good cheer was the recent election of Zohran Mamdani to the mayoralty.

“Do I really need to say it?” asked Silverman, without invoking Mamdani’s name, when asked what potential stumbling blocks the office market could face. (Rather, Silverman cloaked the issue as recent political developments.)

Others were explicit — and realistic — about Mamdani’s ascent.

“I don’t think it will be better [for the city],” said Levinson, “but it’s a question of how much more difficult it will be.”

Something slightly less spoken about were threats to the market like AI. “It’s on everyone’s mind,” said Visser. “No one really knows the answer.”

But none of this really dampened the mood. The next panel “Office & Mixed-Use: Bringing the 15-Minute City Concept to the Heart of the Big Apple” was moderated by Danielle Lesser of Morrison Cohen and featured the Downtown Alliance’s Jessica Lappin, Brookfield Properties’ Alex Liscio, Newmark’s Chris Mongeluzo and Silverstein Properties’ Jeremy Moss, whose conversation delved into the curation of a big working campus and prime office buildings.

Hospitality is also very much on office developers’ minds, as evidenced in the final panel of the day, “Spotlight Case Studies: Inside the Developments Delivering World-Class Workplace & Guest Experiences,” which was moderated by Nina Roket of law firm Olshan Frome Wolosky and featured the Real Estate Board of New York’s Sandhya Espitia, hospitality firm Convene’s Brian Holland, owner Sage Realty’s Jonathan Iger and Cushman & Wakefield’s Alan Schmerzler.

“One of the things we’ve implemented is the concept of surprise and delight,” said Iger, talking about the personalization necessary in hospitality — like having a coloring book for a child who was taken by their parent to work that day. But that also has to be managed sensibly.

In the past, when the building was throwing breakfasts for tenants, the staff would “order breakfast burritos for 1,000 — because they don’t want to run out,” Iger said. Or, hospitality personnel would bake cookies for every last tenant in the tower. A more subtle approach is to make 50, and leave them wanting more.

[TITLE]Elliott Affiliate’s $6 Billion Citgo-Shares Bid Wins Auction:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg) -- Lea en español

An affiliate of Elliott Investment Management won a court-ordered auction for control of the parent company of US oil refiner Citgo Petroleum Corp., Venezuela’s most-valuable foreign asset.

US District Judge Leonard Stark in Wilmington, Delaware, said Tuesday he would adopt a special master’s recommendation that Amber Energy’s $5.89 billion bid was the highest and best generated by the lengthy auction process for shares held by Citgo’s US parent, moving the case closer to conclusion after eight years of litigation.

“The Amber bid offers the best overall combination of price and certainty of closing of any bid submitted,” Stark said in his 162-page decision. “The Amber bid is neither grossly inadequate nor manifestly unjust and therefore should be” approved, he wrote. The refiner is a subsidiary of PDV Holding, owned by Venezuela’s oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA.

PDVSA bonds due in 2020, which are backed by shares in a PDV Holding affiliate, ticked higher after the news, trading slightly above par. Holders of the debt will be paid off through a deal with Amber, in which investors will release their pledge against the company in exchange for $1.68 billion in cash at the closing of the sale, according to the filing.

Amber said in a statement it’s “committed to partnering with CITGO team members to build on its historic foundation and further strengthen CITGO as a leader in the refining, transportation, and marketing of products vital to the US economy.”

Gold Reserve Ltd., a Venezuelan creditor suing the country for the expropriation of its mining assets, made a revised offer of $7.9 billion, but left out the bondholders.

Representatives Gold Reserve didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Stark’s ruling. A New York federal judge has confirmed the validity of those PDVSA bonds, making it more likely Amber would walk away the winner. Gold Reserve has argued bondholders don’t have a valid claim.

While Stark backed Amber’s bid, he also gave bidders until Nov. 28 to submit any last objections to the offer before issuing a final sale order.

Citgo operates refineries, pipelines, terminals and fuel-distribution channels in the US. PDV Holding is under the control of the South American nation’s political opposition, though PDVSA on the ground is controlled by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The opposition represents PDVSA in US courts, because the US doesn’t recognize Maduro.

The process hasn’t come without controversy. Gold Reserve tried to disqualify the judge and the special master, claiming they unfairly favored Amber. Gold Reserve claimed the process had been skewed because advisers to the special master — law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges and investment bank Evercore Inc. — acted for Elliott and its affiliates in other matters. Amber and the special master denied any conflicts or favoritism.

Stark refused to disqualify himself or Special Master Robert Pincus, a former Skadden Arps lawyer who he appointed to oversee the auction.

It’s the latest development in the years-long legal battle over Venezuela’s largest foreign asset. A lengthy list of creditors, including Canadian miner Crystallex International Corp. and US driller ConocoPhillips Co., have been lining up for years to collect compensation from a Citgo sale. Some are seeking to recover losses from the nationalization of their assets in Venezuela by late President Hugo Chávez, whom Maduro succeeded in 2013.

The case is is Crystallex International Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 17-mc-00151, US District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

[TITLE]United Construction Buys Queens Property From Madison Realty Capital for $64M – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
United Construction and Development Group, a prolific developer in Queens, has acquired an office and retail building in the borough’s Flushing neighborhood.

United Construction, run by Chris Jiashu Xu, purchased the three-story, 104,292-square-foot property at 41-60 Main Street from Madison Realty Capital for $64.25 million, according to the seller’s broker, JLL.

The building on the corner of Main Street and Sanford Avenue is fully occupied and hosts office tenants Capital One Bank, Preferred Bank and MassMutual Insurance. Retail tenants at the property include Chinese bakery Fay Da Bakery and JD Drug Store.

JLL’s Ethan Stanton, Michael Mazzara, Drew Isaacson and Brendan Maddigan brokered the deal for the seller, while no brokers represented the buyer.

Spokespeople for United Construction and Madison Realty Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Crain’s New York Business first reported the news.

News of the deal comes after Madison Realty Capital acquired the Flushing property in February 2024, as Commercial Observer previously reported.

Bankrupt developer Jeffrey Wu handed off the building to Madison Realty Capital — a creditor — for $80 million after filing a Chapter 11 petition in 2020 to initiate bankruptcy proceedings for his company, Flushing Landmark Realty. Madison Realty Capital had previously provided a $66 million bridge loan for Wu to refinance two Flushing properties in 2014.

It’s unclear what Xu intends to do with his new property, but the developer already has a lineup of projects planned for Queens.

Over the summer, Xu filed plans to build a 39-story, 387-unit residential tower at 23-07 43rd Avenue in Long Island City, as well as a two-tower, 630-unit residential property at 61-06 Junction Boulevard in Rego Park, Crain’s reported.

[TITLE]Cemtrex Enters into Agreement to Acquire Invocon, Adding Proven Aerospace & Defense Engineering Capabilities:
[TEXT]
Hauppauge, NY, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- - Cemtrex, Inc. (Nasdaq: CETX), a diversified industrial and technology company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Invocon, Inc., a Texas-based systems-engineering firm with a 40-year history designing, manufacturing, and supporting mission-critical instrumentation, wireless sensing systems, and flight hardware for aerospace, defense, and advanced government programs

Invocon’s technologies have been deployed across satellites, launch vehicles, target missiles, space shuttles, and the International Space Station, including 17 shuttle systems, 10 ISS systems, and numerous next-generation flight programs for major primes and government agencies.

Invocon also holds a deep intellectual property portfolio, including multiple U.S. patents related to hypervelocity impact detection, gridless lethality assessment, acoustic and RF sensing, and advanced flight-system telemetry. Invocon’s systems have been used in over 40 shuttle flights, over 30 target missile flights, and a range of high-reliability space and defense missions requiring precise sensing in extreme environments.

This acquisition represents a significant strategic expansion for Cemtrex, bringing in capabilities in high-reliability electronics, flight instrumentation, wireless data acquisition, lethality assessment systems, and complex system design, all supported by a long-standing and experienced engineering team.

Under the terms of the agreement, Cemtrex will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Invocon for $7.06 million, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close on or around January 1, 2026.

Cemtrex Chairman and CEO Saagar Govil commented, “Invocon brings nearly four decades of experience building flight-proven hardware and advanced sensing systems for some of the most demanding aerospace and defense applications. Their technologies have supported shuttle missions, ISS systems, target missiles, and major prime-led flight programs. This is a highly specialized engineering organization with capabilities that are extremely difficult to replicate, and it fits directly with our long-term strategy of expanding into high-reliability and mission-critical technologies.”

Govil continued, “This acquisition provides the foundation for Cemtrex’s new Aerospace & Defense segment and positions us to participate in a wider range of engineering programs that require precision, durability, and deep technical expertise. Invocon’s heritage in flight hardware, wireless telemetry, impact detection, and high-reliability electronics aligns with opportunities across traditional aerospace, defense modernization efforts, and emerging commercial-space markets over the long term.”

Following the closing, Cemtrex expects to establish a new reporting segment, Aerospace & Defense, with Invocon serving as the cornerstone for expanding into advanced engineering programs for government agencies, prime contractors, and next-generation commercial-space customers.
