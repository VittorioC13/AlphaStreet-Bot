[TITLE]Iran confirms seizure of oil tanker in Strait of Hormuz:
[TEXT]
Iran on Saturday confirmed seizure of a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker as it traveled through the narrow Strait of Hormuz over violations including carrying an illegal consignment, state media reported.

A report by the official Irna news agency carried a statement by the Revolutionary Guard that said the tanker was taken to Iranian waters. It did not elaborate on the “illegal consignment," the crew or say where the ship was now heading.

It said the seizure came following a court order and the operation was aimed at “protecting Iran’s national interests and resources.” It identified the oil tanker as the Talara and said it was carrying 30,000 tons of petrochemical products.

The seizure happened on Friday. Tehran has been increasingly warning it could strike back after a 12-day war with Israel in June that saw the U.S. strike Iranian nuclear sites.

It said the ship had been en route to Singapore when Iranian forces intercepted. A private security firm, Ambrey, described the assault as involving three small boats.

A U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton drone had been circling above the area where the Talara was for hours on Friday observing the seizure, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed.

The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center separately acknowledged the incident, saying a possible “state activity” forced the Talara to turn into Iranian territorial waters.

Cyprus-based Columbia Shipmanagement later said in a statement that it had “lost contact” with the tanker, which was carrying high sulphur gasoil. It did not immediately provide any update on Saturday.

Iran has been blamed for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a drone attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew members in 2021. Those attacks began after U.S. President Donald Trump in his first term in office unilaterally withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

In 2022, Iran took two Greek tankers and held them until November of that year. Iran seized the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship MSC Aries in April 2024.

Years of tensions between Iran and the West, coupled with the situation in the Gaza Strip, exploded into a full-scale 12-day war in June.

Tehran has long threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all traded oil passes. The U.S. Navy has long patrolled the Mideast through its Bahrain-based 5th Fleet to keep the waterways open.

[TITLE]US officials working to corner EU energy market – FT:
[TEXT]
Washington wants to substitute the oil and gas exports to the bloc with its own, the Financial Times has said

The US is moving to push Russian energy out of the EU market and position itself to fill the gap, the Financial Times reported Friday.

Washington has also deliberately blocked a bid by Sweden-based Gunvor Group to acquire the foreign assets of Russian oil major Lukoil, according to the outlet.

Gunvor withdrew its $22 billion proposal after US officials accused the company of acting as “the Kremlin’s puppet.” Earlier in November, the US Treasury warned in a post on X that the company would “never get a license to operate and profit” if it pursued the deal.

The potential acquisition surfaced after US President Donald Trump imposed new sanctions on Lukoil and another Russian oil giant, Rosneft, prompting the former to seek buyers for its overseas holdings.

The bid was announced as “US officials toured Europe as part of efforts to sell American energy and eliminate ‘every last molecule’ of Russian gas from the continent,” the FT wrote. The decision to block the deal came from “high up in the Treasury,” the paper reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.

Afterward, Washington issued a general license enabling other bidders to pursue Lukoil’s international assets, the FT said. Private US equity firm Carlyle expressed interest this week, according to the report.

Lukoil confirmed on Friday that it is in “ongoing negotiations on the sale of its international assets with several potential buyers,” without naming them.

US officials have openly stated their intention to replace Russia in the EU energy market. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in September that the US was prepared “to displace all of the Russian gas that goes into Europe and all of the Russian refined products from oil as well.”

The Kremlin has condemned the sanctions as an “unfriendly step” but maintained it is still seeking “good relations with all countries, including the US.”

The restrictions on Lukoil are already affecting Europe. Earlier in November, Bulgaria curbed fuel exports to its fellow EU states amid supply concerns. Lukoil owns the country’s largest refinery, more than 200 gas stations and a major fuel transport network.

[TITLE]Consumers Feel Pinch at Pump as Russia Drives Oil Refining Boom:
[TEXT]
The Valero Houston refinery. Valero Energy Corp. and Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS have seen stellar rises, while Orlen SA gained more than 100% year-to-date.

It’s a great time to be an oil refiner — but a less great time to be filling up at the pump.

Most Read from Bloomberg

In Europe, the US and Asia, giant plants are making money by doing what they’ve always done: converting crude oil into vital fuels and selling them at a profit.

What’s different today is the scale of the threat to global supplies: Relentless attacks on Russia’s energy infrastructure, outages at key plants in Asia and Africa and permanent closures across Europe and the US have removed millions of barrels of diesel and gasoline from the world market.

On top of these real-world impacts are traders’ fears of what’s yet to come: imminent US sanctions on Lukoil PJSC and Rosneft PJSC and fresh European Union curbs on fuels made from Russian crude threaten already squeezed supply-chains.

The result is ongoing pressure on costs at the pump despite a fall in global oil prices — something that’s unlikely to sit well with a US administration that sees “affordable energy” as essential.

“Global refinery margins are astronomical,” said Eugene Lindell, head of refined products at consultancy FGE NexantECA. “The signal you’re giving the global refining system, no matter where the refinery is located, is to just run flat out.”

In the US, Europe and Asia, margins are the highest they’ve been at this time of year since at least 2018, according to fair value data compiled by Bloomberg. The profits are so good that refiners’ stock prices are also surging: processors including Valero Energy Corp. and Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS have seen stellar rises, while Orlen SA gained more than 100% year-to-date.

While expectations of a glut are dragging on crude prices, disruption to the global refining system is limiting how much oil can be turned into products like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. While that benefits the processors still running, it also means the slump in headline oil prices isn’t being felt at the pump.

READ: Russia’s Sliding Oil Flows and Prices Strain Putin’s War Chest

A constant stream of attacks on Russia’s refineries — just this month, Ukraine claimed strikes on the Saratov, Orsk and Volgograd plants — is hampering fuel production. Last month, Russia’s huge oil product exports were on course to hit a multi-year low, and that was before drone attacks damaged key loading facilities in the port city of Tuapse.

Lukoil has yet to find a buyer for its international units after a deal with Swiss-based Gunvor fell through.

The Trump administration extended a sanctions waiver for Russian oil giant Lukoil, days before Washington's measures were set to take effect.

The U.S. Treasury Department issued licenses to allow Lukoil to keep operating many of its businesses around the world until Dec. 13 — and until April 2026 for its refinery in Bulgaria — as the company looks to sell off its foreign assets.

Last month, American President Donald Trump announced “tremendous” new sanctions targeting Lukoil and Kremlin-owned Rosneft over Moscow’s refusal to negotiate an end to its war in Ukraine. The punitive measures had been set to come into force on Nov. 21.

[TITLE]New Sodium-Ion Batteries Threaten The US Coal Recovery Plan:
[TEXT]
Like zombies rising from the grave to devour the living, old coal power plants have begun to shake off the dust, adding to the burden of skyrocketing electricity costs. Not to worry. They won’t last long. The so-called national “energy emergency” that promised new life to the nation’s fleet of aging coal power plants is already evaporating under the weight of new sodium-ion batteries and other economical energy storage systems that take full advantage of the nation’s abundant, economical supply of wind and solar energy.

The Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Solution

By now, everyone knows that wind and solar — especially solar — are the fastest, most accessible, and most economical domestic energy resources available in the US today, with energy storage systems adding to the mix.

That explains why renewable energy has been the overwhelming choice for new capacity additions in recent years. The numbers don’t lie. In the first half of this year, for example, renewable energy resources accounted for 93% of new capacity additions to the US grid, for a total of 30.2 gigawatts, with solar and energy storage projects accounting for 83%.

All else being equal, wind and solar capacity additions will accelerate as energy storage systems drop in cost. The first half of that equation depends on which way the winds of federal energy policy blow, but the second half is a matter of innovation and investor engagement, and that is where a fresh burst of cleantech activity has already materialized.

In recent years, researchers have been focusing on sodium-ion technology as a more economical alternative compared to the familiar lithium-ion formula for battery energy storage systems (see more sodium-ion battery background here). Advocates for a sodium-ion future suffered a setback earlier this year when the high-profile US startup Natron shut down operations at its North Carolina factory and Michigan headquarters. However, other sodium-ion innovators have already picked up the torch.

The Peak Energy Sodium-Ion Solution

Among the torch bearers is the US energy storage firm Peak Energy. The startup launched only two years ago but it came into the sodium-ion scene with a head start in experience among senior executives, including from Tesla and Apple as well as the leading global energy storage firm Powin.

Peak Energy surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar when it burst out of stealth mode in October of 2023 with a business model based on vertical integration and a cost-cutting passive cooling system, and they hit the ground running. In July of 2024, Peak nailed down $55 million in Series A funding, spearheaded by the Xora Innovation branch of Temasek along with existing investor Eclipse and strategic partner TDK Ventures. Newcomers Lachy Groom, Tishman Speyer, TechEnergy Ventures, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures, and DETV-Scania Invest also supported the Series A round.

“Peak Energy claims that its sodium-ion battery technology can offer advantages in cost, supply chain security, scale, and safety over lithium-ion, the industry’s current default battery storage choice. The funding is also expected to lay the groundwork for a domestic, giga-scale sodium-ion battery factory slated to open in 2027,” Mercom Capital reported last year.

Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Coal Power Plants

One advantage of sodium-ion technology over other formulas is its scalability, and Peak already aims to put that to the test. Earlier this year, the company launched its grid-scale sodium-ion system into the market, and last week it announced plans to build the largest sodium-ion BESS in the world, in partnership with the up-and-coming independent power producer Jupiter Power.

The initial agreement calls for a 720-megawatt sodium-ion system to be delivered to Jupiter in 2027. With Jupiter holding an option for another 4,000 megawatts between 2028 and 2030, Peak estimates that the total value of the contract could top $500 million.

As for what sparked Jupiter’s interest in a new energy storage platform when the old one is working so well, that’s a good question. There is always room for improvement. In addition to its existing portfolio, Jupiter has a 12,000-megawatt pipeline brewing in the US, and Peak Energy promises to deliver more bang for the buck.

“Peak’s sodium-ion batteries promise less degradation over their lifetime and reduced operations and maintenance costs compared to lithium-ion systems on the market today,” Peak explains, putting the 20-year improvement at 30% compared to other systems.

“Lower system degradation can also reduce augmentation requirements, meaning operators will not have to add additional battery units or components over a project’s lifetime in order to maintain storage capacity over the project’s lifespan,” Peak adds.

Peak also draws attention to its passive cooling system, which enables it to bypass fabrication, maintenance, and repair costs typical of lithium-ion systems while reducing auxiliary power costs by 97%.

Zombie Coal Power Plants Rise From The Dead To Attack The Living

Against the backdrop of falling costs for wind, solar, and utility-scale energy storage systems, it’s difficult to see how any coal power plant in the US can survive much longer. The coal industry was already bending under the weight of low-cost natural gas in the early 2000’s, and now renewables and energy storage have added to the pressure.

In addition, coal power does not necessarily meet the oversimplified, under-defined “reliability” standard set forth by US President Donald Trump’s own American Energy Dominance policy. The 932-megawatt Sandy Creek coal power plant in Texas, for example, suffered a catastrophic failure in April and restoration is not expected until March of 2027.

The pace of coal retirements, though, is complicated by existing grid conditions and rising electricity demand, among other factors. In February, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reported that the US grid would drop 8.1 gigawatts of coal power this year in scheduled retirements, including some of the nation’s largest: Intermountain Power in Utah (1.8 gigawatts), JH Campbell in Michigan (1.33 GW), and Brandon Shores in Maryland (1.27 GW). However, by February, the wheels were already in motion to push the Brandon Shores closure back to 2029. The new date was reached under an agreement between the plant operator Talen Energy, the Maryland Public Service Commission, local ratepayers and utilities, and the Sierra Club, among other stakeholders, pending a major upgrade to the regional transmission system.

In addition, coal retirements are not necessarily replaced by renewables. The Intermountain capacity, for example, will be replaced in part by a new gas power plant.

In May, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright also shook things up when he summarily ordered the JH Campbell facility to keep running 90 days past its scheduled retirement date of May 31, an order later extended to November despite the extra costs.

The JH Campbell order is just one piece of the coal puzzle. Last spring, the Energy Department announced that coal projects will share in a new federal low-cost loan pot of $200 billion, and in October, Energy Secretary Wright announced a new round of $625 million in funding specifically aimed at coal, including $375 million set aside to recommission and retrofit old power plants.

Coal industry stakeholders have begun to respond to the new incentives, but one thing is for sure. The sun will rise and the wind will blow long after the current occupant of the White House leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully one hopes, this time. When he does, a new generation of reliable, economical energy storage systems will be ready to restore the momentum to the renewable energy transition in the US.

[TITLE]US/EU/NATO "Political West" Pressures Serbia to Cut Ties with Russia's Oil Industry - Global Research:
[TEXT]
Back in 2008, Serbia sold NIS (Naftna Industrija Srbije, literally the Oil Industry of Serbia) to Russian Gazprom Neft for around $560 million, with the latter committing to invest another $640 million in modernization by 2012.

Taking inflation into account, that would be equivalent to $840 million and $970 million in today’s money, respectively.

At the time, the mainstream propaganda machine and Western embassies were very unhappy with this deal, calling it supposedly “bad for Serbia”.

However, they “conveniently” forgot that, after the direct US/NATO aggression in 1999, much (if not most) of Serbia’s industrial potential and infrastructure was deliberately targeted and destroyed, resulting in approximately $100 billion in damage (which is nearly $200 billion in today’s money).

Worse yet, after the color revolution on October 5, 2000, the political West pretty much hijacked the country and directed the puppet government to finish off whatever US/NATO bombs failed to destroy. Entire state-owned companies and corporations were forced into artificial bankruptcy, creating an economic power vacuum that was filled by Western “investors” (i.e., speculators and thieves in suits). They bought most of the ruined state-owned companies for pennies, dismantled them, and then destroyed or resold the industrial assets to other countries. Thus, the sovereign economy that generations of Serbs kept (re)building by themselves (after it was destroyed in WWII by the Axis powers, the geopolitical predecessor of NATO) was once again obliterated by the Western invader.

It should be noted that this sovereign economy helped Serbia/Yugoslavia hold out for nearly a decade during NATO aggression in the 1991-1999 time period. After the 2000 color revolution (nicknamed the “Bulldozer Revolution”, although the CIA code name was the “Black Revolution”), the US-led political West made sure this economy is no longer a “threat to Serbia’s democratic path”. Only a handful of state-owned enterprises survived, including the aforementioned NIS (the only oil producer in the country). However, by 2008, it was in a pretty bad shape, so Belgrade needed a partner that would invest in and modernize the company. The alternative was the collapse of the country’s energy security, destroying whatever was left of the Serbian economy.

Thus, even the pro-EU/NATO puppet government had to find a way to save NIS, which automatically excluded Western corporations, as their primary goal was precisely the destruction of Serbia’s sovereign economy. Gazprom came to the rescue, buying the country’s oil producer and promising investment in modernization and expansion of its capacity. The Russian oil giant not only kept its end of the bargain, but also included the exponential expansion of natural gas storage capacity, thereby drastically improving Serbia’s energy security. By early 2013, a bit more than four years after Gazprom acquired NIS, the once-doomed Serbian oil company became the single largest contributor to the country’s state budget. In 2024, NIS paid nearly $2.5 billion in taxes only.

This means that only its tax contribution since 2008 hovers around $40 billion. That’s an absolutely massive increase, especially for a small country like Serbia. Unsurprisingly, anything good for the country and the Serbian people raises alarms in the political West, so the world’s most aggressive power pole kept pushing that Belgrade needs to cut ties with the “evil Russians”, because that’s “good for Serbia’s democratic path”. Fully aware that such a move would destroy NIS and the minimum sovereignty Belgrade still had (thanks to the Kremlin’s indispensable support), every Serbian government in the last 15 years (no matter how pro-Western or at least officially “neutral”) flatly refused to do so. However, after the special military operation (SMO) started, the pressure has become virtually insurmountable.

Unfortunately, what broke the camel’s back was the American threat to impose full sanctions on NIS because it has more than 50% Russian ownership. In the last several months, the United States has been particularly aggressive in threats and blackmail, aiming to impose a total blockade on transactions for NIS. This would’ve led to a massive energy crisis in Serbia, as the country would be unable to refine oil. The obvious goal was to arm-twist the government into either confiscating Gazprom’s NIS shares or forcing the Russian oil giant to sell them. Moscow fully understood what was at stake, but it also wasn’t too keen on giving up a company it had pretty much saved and rebuilt. The Kremlin and Belgrade spent months looking for various loopholes and workarounds.

By early November, Gazprom announced a request to extend its operating license as it negotiated ceding control of NIS to a third party. On November 11, Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Đedović Handanović also confirmed this. At present, Gazprom holds the majority stake in NIS, while Serbia owns 29.9%. The US, the most aggressive country in human history, decided to block all transactions involving NIS on October 8, forcing banks to stop processing NIS-related payments and halting deliveries through Croatia’s JANAF pipeline, which has been Serbia’s primary supply line for Russian and Kazakh crude since 2022. With the cessation of these deliveries, NIS would be able to operate only until November 25, which is exactly how long its internal reserves would last.

NIS operates Serbia’s only refinery in the city of Pančevo, which supplies about 80% of the country’s gasoline and diesel, as well as over 90% of jet fuel and heavy fuel oil. It should be noted that Pančevo suffered massive destruction during the direct NATO aggression in 1999, as the world’s most aggressive racketeering cartel deliberately targeted all petrochemical facilities, causing widespread devastation that also contaminated the environment, which has been the leading cause of death among civilians in the last 26 years. Thus, the very fact that the US/NATO is once again targeting this city and its vital industrial sector (albeit not with bombs this time, at least for now) is proof that the political West is the leading security threat to Serbia and the Serbian people.

Not to mention that NIS is now in grave danger, as its Russian owners have effectively been forced out due to American pressure. It remains to be seen whether Serbia will be able to find a third party that could replace Gazprom. There’s speculation that Hungarian MOL could take over, which would be the “next best thing”, although this remains to be confirmed. Either way, Serbia is perhaps the best example of what happens when the US-led collective West pushes a country into a geopolitical “stunlock”, chipping away the remnants of its sovereignty and forcing it to renounce its own national interests for the sake of US/NATO imperialism and expansionism. For Serbia, the growth and strengthening of the multipolar world remains the only chance for survival.

[TITLE]Adnoc Buy of Covestro Wins Conditional EU Approval:
[TEXT]
ADNOC won conditional EU approval for its $13.9 billion takeover of Covestro after it dealt with EU concerns that its state subsidies could stifle competition.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. won conditional European Union approval for its EUR 12 billion ($13.9 billion) takeover of Covestro AG after it dealt with EU concerns that its state subsidies could stifle competition.

The European Commission said Friday that an offer from Adnoc to maintain Covestro's intellectual property in Europe as well as concessions on the company's unlimited state guarantee from the UAE settled its earlier fears. Those commitments are valid for 10 years.

"Commitments offered by Adnoc effectively address the potential negative effects by allowing market participants to access key Covestro patents in the field of sustainability," EU competition chief Teresa Ribera said in a statement. "Clear, pre-defined access to these patents will enable others to innovate and advance research in an area that is critical for Europe's future."

The planned purchase of Covestro would give Adnoc - the biggest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates - control over a German company that supplies materials for some of the world's most prominent phone and carmakers. Adnoc would own Covestro through its investment unit XRG, set up in last year as the company's international platform for natural gas, chemicals and energy solutions.

In July, the commission, the EU's antitrust arm, opened a full-scale investigation into the deal under tough new foreign subsidies rules. These are aimed at preventing sovereign states from using their financial muscle to crush competition in the 27-nation bloc. EU officials warned at the time that Adnoc's state funding may give it an unfair advantage over rivals with less-deep pockets.

The seizure happened on Friday. Tehran has been increasingly warning it could strike back after a 12-day war with Israel in June that saw the U.S. strike Iranian nuclear sites.

In this Jan. 19, 2012 file photo, a plane flies over the mountains of northern Oman as trading vessels are seen in the Strait of Hormuz, near the town of Khasab, Oman. AP

It said the ship had been en route to Singapore when Iranian forces intercepted. A private security firm, Ambrey, described the assault as involving three small boats.

U.S. Central Command forces also acknowledged the incident, saying in a statement on Sunday that the M/V Talara was seized after being boarded by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces via helicopter.

"IRGC operatives then steered the tanker to Iran's territorial waters where the ship remains," the statement said. "Iran's use of military forces to conduct an armed boarding and seizure of a commercial vessel in international waters constitutes a blatant violation of international law, undermining freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce. We call on Iran to articulate to the international community the legal basis for its actions."

A U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton drone had been circling above the area where the Talara was for hours on Friday, observing the seizure, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed.

The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center separately acknowledged the incident, saying a possible "state activity" forced the Talara to turn into Iranian territorial waters.

In 2022, Iran took two Greek tankers and held them until November of that year. Iran seized the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship MSC Aries in April 2024.

Years of tensions between Iran and the West, coupled with the situation in the Gaza Strip, exploded into a full-scale 12-day war in June.

Tehran has long threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all traded oil passes. The U.S. Navy has long patrolled the Mideast through its Bahrain-based 5th Fleet to keep the waterways open.

[TITLE]New Sodium-Ion Batteries Threaten The US Coal Recovery Plan:
[TEXT]
Like zombies rising from the grave to devour the living, old coal power plants have begun to shake off the dust, adding to the burden of skyrocketing electricity costs. Not to worry. They won’t last long. The so-called national “energy emergency” that promised new life to the nation’s fleet of aging coal power plants is already evaporating under the weight of new sodium-ion batteries and other economical energy storage systems that take full advantage of the nation’s abundant, economical supply of wind and solar energy.

The Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Solution

By now, everyone knows that wind and solar — especially solar — are the fastest, most accessible, and most economical domestic energy resources available in the US today, with energy storage systems adding to the mix.

That explains why renewable energy has been the overwhelming choice for new capacity additions in recent years. The numbers don’t lie. In the first half of this year, for example, renewable energy resources accounted for 93% of new capacity additions to the US grid, for a total of 30.2 gigawatts, with solar and energy storage projects accounting for 83%.

All else being equal, wind and solar capacity additions will accelerate as energy storage systems drop in cost. The first half of that equation depends on which way the winds of federal energy policy blow, but the second half is a matter of innovation and investor engagement, and that is where a fresh burst of cleantech activity has already materialized.

In recent years, researchers have been focusing on sodium-ion technology as a more economical alternative compared to the familiar lithium-ion formula for battery energy storage systems (see more sodium-ion battery background here). Advocates for a sodium-ion future suffered a setback earlier this year when the high-profile US startup Natron shut down operations at its North Carolina factory and Michigan headquarters. However, other sodium-ion innovators have already picked up the torch.

The Peak Energy Sodium-Ion Solution

Among the torch bearers is the US energy storage firm Peak Energy. The startup launched only two years ago but it came into the sodium-ion scene with a head start in experience among senior executives, including from Tesla and Apple as well as the leading global energy storage firm Powin.

Peak Energy surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar when it burst out of stealth mode in October of 2023 with a business model based on vertical integration and a cost-cutting passive cooling system, and they hit the ground running. In July of 2024, Peak nailed down $55 million in Series A funding, spearheaded by the Xora Innovation branch of Temasek along with existing investor Eclipse and strategic partner TDK Ventures. Newcomers Lachy Groom, Tishman Speyer, TechEnergy Ventures, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures, and DETV-Scania Invest also supported the Series A round.

“Peak Energy claims that its sodium-ion battery technology can offer advantages in cost, supply chain security, scale, and safety over lithium-ion, the industry’s current default battery storage choice. The funding is also expected to lay the groundwork for a domestic, giga-scale sodium-ion battery factory slated to open in 2027,” Mercom Capital reported last year.

Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Coal Power Plants

One advantage of sodium-ion technology over other formulas is its scalability, and Peak already aims to put that to the test. Earlier this year, the company launched its grid-scale sodium-ion system into the market, and last week it announced plans to build the largest sodium-ion BESS in the world, in partnership with the up-and-coming independent power producer Jupiter Power.

The initial agreement calls for a 720-megawatt sodium-ion system to be delivered to Jupiter in 2027. With Jupiter holding an option for another 4,000 megawatts between 2028 and 2030, Peak estimates that the total value of the contract could top $500 million.

As for what sparked Jupiter’s interest in a new energy storage platform when the old one is working so well, that’s a good question. There is always room for improvement. In addition to its existing portfolio, Jupiter has a 12,000-megawatt pipeline brewing in the US, and Peak Energy promises to deliver more bang for the buck.

“Peak’s sodium-ion batteries promise less degradation over their lifetime and reduced operations and maintenance costs compared to lithium-ion systems on the market today,” Peak explains, putting the 20-year improvement at 30% compared to other systems.

“Lower system degradation can also reduce augmentation requirements, meaning operators will not have to add additional battery units or components over a project’s lifetime in order to maintain storage capacity over the project’s lifespan,” Peak adds.

Peak also draws attention to its passive cooling system, which enables it to bypass fabrication, maintenance, and repair costs typical of lithium-ion systems while reducing auxiliary power costs by 97%.

Zombie Coal Power Plants Rise From The Dead To Attack The Living

Against the backdrop of falling costs for wind, solar, and utility-scale energy storage systems, it’s difficult to see how any coal power plant in the US can survive much longer. The coal industry was already bending under the weight of low-cost natural gas in the early 2000’s, and now renewables and energy storage have added to the pressure.

In addition, coal power does not necessarily meet the oversimplified, under-defined “reliability” standard set forth by US President Donald Trump’s own American Energy Dominance policy. The 932-megawatt Sandy Creek coal power plant in Texas, for example, suffered a catastrophic failure in April and restoration is not expected until March of 2027.

The pace of coal retirements, though, is complicated by existing grid conditions and rising electricity demand, among other factors. In February, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reported that the US grid would drop 8.1 gigawatts of coal power this year in scheduled retirements, including some of the nation’s largest: Intermountain Power in Utah (1.8 gigawatts), JH Campbell in Michigan (1.33 GW), and Brandon Shores in Maryland (1.27 GW). However, by February, the wheels were already in motion to push the Brandon Shores closure back to 2029. The new date was reached under an agreement between the plant operator Talen Energy, the Maryland Public Service Commission, local ratepayers and utilities, and the Sierra Club, among other stakeholders, pending a major upgrade to the regional transmission system.

In addition, coal retirements are not necessarily replaced by renewables. The Intermountain capacity, for example, will be replaced in part by a new gas power plant.

In May, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright also shook things up when he summarily ordered the JH Campbell facility to keep running 90 days past its scheduled retirement date of May 31, an order later extended to November despite the extra costs.

The JH Campbell order is just one piece of the coal puzzle. Last spring, the Energy Department announced that coal projects will share in a new federal low-cost loan pot of $200 billion, and in October, Energy Secretary Wright announced a new round of $625 million in funding specifically aimed at coal, including $375 million set aside to recommission and retrofit old power plants.

Coal industry stakeholders have begun to respond to the new incentives, but one thing is for sure. The sun will rise and the wind will blow long after the current occupant of the White House leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully one hopes, this time. When he does, a new generation of reliable, economical energy storage systems will be ready to restore the momentum to the renewable energy transition in the US.

Fueling Indonesia's drive for energy security and green agenda

Jakarta (ANTARA) - A fuel shortage affecting private gas stations in late 2025 is nearing resolution after the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry mediated base fuel import negotiations between private retailers and state-owned energy company Pertamina.The ministry said on November 7 that British Petroleum (BP), through its joint local venture BP-AKR, had ordered another 100,000 barrels of base fuel from Pertamina after securing the same volume in late October. BP stations have since resumed selling RON 92 fuel.Negotiations between Pertamina and private operator Vivo are also close to completion, according to the ministry.The development follows Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia’s decision not to grant further quota increases this year beyond the 10 percent addition already provided to private fuel importers.In September, the minister shifted 571,748 kiloliters from Pertamina’s remaining import allocation of 7.52 million kiloliters to private retailers to maintain their supply through December 2025.He said the ministry must ensure domestic energy availability while safeguarding Indonesia’s trade balance, noting that fuel imports still exceed national production.In 2024, Indonesia imported 330 million barrels of oil, comprising 128 million barrels of crude and 202 million barrels of refined products, while domestic production reached 212 million barrels.The ministry’s Director General of Oil and Natural Gas, Laode Sulaiman, said the government is considering a 10 percent quota increase for private companies next year, although their 2026 allocation has not been finalized.Indonesia is pursuing higher national production and cleaner energy sources to reduce its reliance on fuel imports. The government has offered 75 oil and gas blocks under the revised gross split scheme and launched the 10-percent ethanol blend (E10) policy.As of September, national oil output reached 619,000 barrels per day, exceeding the 2024 State Budget target of 605,000 barrels per day and marking the first such achievement since 2008.Indonesia remains heavily dependent on imported gasoline. Last year, gasoline imports reached 22.8 million kiloliters, or 62.23 percent of supply. This year’s supply is projected at 37.3 million kiloliters, with imports accounting for 63 percent.By 2030, gasoline demand is forecast to reach 42.1 million kiloliters, with imports potentially rising to 27.81 million kiloliters, or 66.10 percent of supply, without significant policy intervention.To address the issue, the ministry is preparing an E10 implementation roadmap, drawing on Indonesia’s success in reducing diesel imports through the B40 biodiesel program, which saved US$40.71 billion between 2020 and 2025.Indonesia has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Brazil to expand renewable energy cooperation and learn from Brazil’s long-running ethanol blending program.Indonesia will need at least 1.4 million kiloliters of ethanol to implement E10 nationally in 2027. Lahadalia said the government plans to meet this demand domestically by developing ethanol plants using cassava, corn, and sugarcane.A sugarcane-based ethanol facility is planned in Merauke, South Papua. The government has identified 920,000 hectares of potential land across 18 provinces as part of a 1-million-hectare target for ethanol feedstock.To attract investment, incentives such as tax holidays will be offered to companies building ethanol plants in Indonesia.Public concern has surfaced regarding ethanol’s hygroscopic nature. Professor Ronny Purwadi of the Bandung Institute of Technology clarified that ethanol’s ability to absorb water does not automatically lead to corrosion, particularly for coated metals or equipment kept dry.He said E10 could help lower sulfur levels in Indonesia’s fuel supply, which average 1,500 parts per million, far higher than the Euro V standard of 50 parts per million. Ethanol blending also reduces emissions by producing no solid carbon residue.The ministry will coordinate with automotive manufacturers to test E10 in Indonesia’s tropical climate. Vehicles released after 2000 are generally compatible with 10-percent ethanol blends.Lahadalia said efforts to manage fuel imports, strengthen national production, and develop clean energy reflect the government’s commitment to energy self-sufficiency as mandated by President Prabowo Subianto.

[TITLE]A Power-Hungry Southeast Asia Wants China’s Energy:
[TEXT]
For the United States, the key was oil and gas. Its oil giants proved formidable geoeconomic players, whether working with U.S. friendly regimes during the Cold War or providing liquefied natural gas to Europe as it struggles with Russia today. In turn, they have shaped U.S. policy, including the country’s decades-long entanglement in the Middle East.

Geopolitical power has long been linked with literal power. Britain’s status as the world’s leading coal producer fueled not just the Industrial Revolution domestically but gave it enormous global influence.

In turn, they have shaped U.S. policy, including the country’s decades-long entanglement in the Middle East.

Now, some see China as a new type of energy power—an electrostate. It is not only installing renewable energy faster than any country in the world, but it is also exporting the technologies for producing renewable energy on a massive scale, according to energy think tank Ember. In 2025, the value of these exports hit $20 billion—a new record. What does this mean in practical terms? Energy-hungry neighbors in Southeast Asia provide an interesting glimpse.

Like most developing countries, nearly all member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are unwilling to embrace an energy transition unless they see the chance for profit in it. From partners, they want green energy that is cheap, and if possible, they want to see some domestic production of goods such as solar panels. Alongside this, fossil fuels will persist, so long as they represent a good business proposition. As they make inroads in ASEAN, renewables are not replacing fossil fuels but being layered on top, much as in China.

The United States and its, for the time being, allies in Asia and Europe still have a considerable role in the region’s energy sector—but are confined to oil and gas. Similarly, ASEAN’s own governments have powerful domestic fossil companies, such as Petronas in Malaysia, that they can leverage. Renewable energy, however, is heavily dominated by China.

China has been the single-most significant investor in ASEAN’s power sector. From 2015 to 2024, China accounted for 31.9 percent of all foreign direct investment in the generation and transmission of electricity and gas (excluding pipelines), according to data provided by ASEAN. Intra-ASEAN FDI provides a shade more, but much of this comes from the international financial entrepôt of Singapore. Japan, South Korea, and to a lesser extent Europe have played noticeable roles, too. Meanwhile, the United States seems to have almost quit the field—even before the onset of President Donald Trump’s second term.

While more detailed breakdowns are not easily available, a variety of datasets suggest that Chinese dominance in energy is only set to grow.

Take, for example, solar panels, where China’s leadership is now a truism. Between 2010 and 2024, China produced

[TITLE]The AI bubble may be showing up in an unexpected place: the shady forecasts of future electricity demand—and skyrocketing bills:
[TEXT]
The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they’ll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.

But the challenges — some say the impossibility — of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.

One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built — eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.

The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that’s ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.

Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas — such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.

“There’s speculation in there,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. “Nobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what’s speculative, what’s double-counting, what’s real, what’s not.”

One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built — eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.

The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that’s ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.

Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas — such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.

“There’s speculation in there,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. “Nobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what’s speculative, what’s double-counting, what’s real, what’s not.”
