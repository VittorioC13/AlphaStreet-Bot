NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — A group of countries that are part of the OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countries has agreed to a small boost in oil production, citing a steady global economic outlook.

The group said after a virtual meeting on Sunday that it will raise oil production by 137,000 barrels per day in November, they same amount it announced for October. The group has been raising output slightly in a series of boosts all year, after announcing cuts in 2023 and 2024.

In a statement the group said the move was due to “a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals.” It added the production adjustments may be paused or reversed as market conditions evolve.

Saudi Arabia holds significant influence in OPEC+ as the dominant member of the OPEC producers’ cartel, and Russia is the leading non-OPEC member in the 22-country alliance.

Along with Saudi Arabia and Russia, the group that met Sunday is made up of Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman. Their next meeting is scheduled for Nov. 2.

[TITLE]Apollo Funds to Acquire Eagle Creek Renewable Energy, One of the Largest U.S. Hydroelectric Power Platforms:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Oct. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apollo (NYSE: APO) today announced that Apollo-managed funds (the "Apollo Funds") have agreed to acquire Eagle Creek Renewable Energy ("Eagle Creek" or the "Company"), a leading independent owner and operator of hydroelectric facilities across the U.S. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Eagle Creek owns and operates 85 hydroelectric facilities across 18 states, providing renewable power to support rapidly growing energy demand from data center infrastructure and the Industrial Renaissance in the U.S. Hydropower is differentiated as a low carbon reliable energy source with baseload capabilities. The Company’s nearly 700 MW portfolio makes it one of the largest and most diversified independent hydro platforms in the country, and its facilities produce enough electricity to power over 260,000 homes.

“The Eagle Creek team have built one of the leading independent hydro portfolios in the U.S., with a strong safety and performance track record and a diversified footprint,” said Joseph Romeo, Partner at Apollo. “We see significant opportunity to support the business in its next phase—further expanding the platform and providing reliable, clean power generation to meet the growth in demand. We look forward to bringing our network and significant industry experience to bear alongside this highly experienced team as we seek to accelerate growth.”

“We’re incredibly proud of the platform our team has built to date, providing clean, reliable power to communities, utilities and businesses across the U.S.,” said Neal Simmons, Chief Executive Officer of Eagle Creek. “With the Apollo team’s support, we look forward to building on that foundation, strengthening our operations and finding new ways to serve the growing needs of our customers.”

Since 2022, Apollo-managed funds and affiliates have committed, deployed, or arranged approximately $59 billion1 of energy transition-related investments, supporting companies and projects across energy, infrastructure and industrial sectors.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals, and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.

BMO Capital Markets served as financial advisor and Vinson & Elkins served as legal counsel to Apollo Funds.

--

1. As of June 30, 2025. The firmwide target (the “Target”) to deploy, commit, or arrange capital commensurate with Apollo’s proprietary Transition Investment Framework (“TIF”) is more than $100 billion by 2030. The TIF, which is subject to change at any time without notice, sets forth certain activities classified by Apollo as Transition Activities, and the methodologies used to calculate contribution towards the Target. Only investments determined to be currently contributing to a Transition Activity in accordance with the TIF are counted toward the Target. Under the TIF, Apollo uses different calculation methodologies for different types of investments in equity, debt and real estate.
