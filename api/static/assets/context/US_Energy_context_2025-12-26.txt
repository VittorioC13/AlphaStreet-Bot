J.D. Irving has secured an agreement to sell power from the large wind farm it's building in western New Brunswick to N.B. Power.

The Bright Mountain wind project, first announced by JDI in the spring of 2024, got regulatory approval from the province last winter.

In a news release, N.B. Power announced that an agreement had been signed to purchase 200 megawatts of energy from the project.

“We are pleased to see such a strong interest to add renewables to our grid and to proceed with this shovel ready project,” said N.B. Power Lori Clark in the release.

“With our province facing an energy shortfall as early as 2028, this agreement and strategic partnership will help us integrate additional renewable power into our systems at an expedited rate, which is so necessary to help us meet the growing energy needs of New Brunswickers both cost-effectively and efficiently.”

No details or terms of the agreement have been provided.

Construction activities have already begun at the site, which is JDI's first venture into the wind business.

The latest construction update posted on JDI’s website for the project, from October, said “exploratory activity with light construction activity” would be going on at the site.

An earlier update said timber harvesting and work at the pad sites for the turbines took place from June to September.

JDI got approval last November for the first phase of its $550 million Brighton Mountain wind farm project near Juniper in Carleton County. The website says this phase is expected to be completed in 2027.

Company documents available on the project website show the first phase will have up to 34 turbines on the northern half of the project property with a capacity of up to 200 megawatts.

The second phase, which would include up to 24 turbines with a capacity of up to about 150 megawatts, would need its own approval.

At a public meeting in Juniper in the summer of 2024, several local residents spoke out against the project, citing environmental concerns and what they called a lack of communication from the company.

[TITLE]Energy Transfer Shelves Lake Charles LNG to Focus on Pipelines:
[TEXT]
The Dallas, Texas-based company said it 'remains open to discussions with third parties who may have an interest in developing the project'.

Energy Transfer LP has indefinitely paused the under-development Lake Charles LNG project in Louisiana to refocus investment on natural gas pipelines.

The pause allows the Dallas, Texas-based company to "focus on allocating capital to its significant backlog of natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects that Energy Transfer believes provide superior risk/return profiles", it said in a statement on its website.

"Energy Transfer management has determined that its continued development of the project is not warranted by Energy Transfer but remains open to discussions with third parties who may have an interest in developing the project".

Earlier this year the United States Department of Energy (DOE) granted Energy Transfer's request to extend the deadline for Lake Charles LNG to start exports from 2025 to 2031.

Lake Charles LNG is permitted to export a cumulative 851 billion cubic feet a year of natural gas equivalent, under two DOE orders originally issued July 2016 and June 2017.

Energy Transfer says the project, a conversion from an existing regasification site, has all authorizations from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In September 2024, it awarded an engineering, procurement and construction contract to a joint venture between KBR Inc and Technip Energies NV.

Concurrent with the pause announcement, Energy Transfer said it has increased the capacity of the Transwestern Pipeline's planned Desert Southwest expansion project.

"To meet the need for additional capacity identified through a recent open season, the project's mainline pipeline diameter will be upsized from 42 inches to 48 inches, which will increase the project’s capacity to up to 2.3 billion cubic feet per day, depending on final compression configuration", Energy Transfer said in a separate statement.

"There is significant demand growth in the Desert Southwest region, including the potential to retire and or convert coal-fired power plants to natural gas, which could further benefit the project.

"The ultimate capacity of the Desert Southwest expansion project will be based on market demand".

Energy Transfer still expects to put the expansion into service by 2029.

"The upsized project is now expected to cost up to approximately $5.6 billion excluding Allowance for Funds Used During Construction", Energy Transfer said. "As a result, Energy Transfer's total growth capital expenditures for 2026 are expected to increase by approximately $200 million".

[TITLE]What Would A Peace Deal In Ukraine Mean For The Global Oil Market?:
[TEXT]
The prospect of a peace deal in Ukraine has been gaining momentum in the global oil market over the past few days, stripping away part of the geopolitical risk premium that has kept prices elevated since Russia’s invasion on 24 February 2022. Following meetings last week in Berlin with Ukrainian and European officials, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner stated that consensus was reached on around 90% of the issues within a 20-point peace plan. Ukraine has indicated that it may drop its NATO membership bid in exchange for legally binding U.S. and European security assurances, similar to NATO’s Article 5. This states that an attack on one member is an attack on all, obligating other members to assist, potentially with armed force, to restore security. The U.S. has now said that it is offering ‘Article 5-like’ assurances, with President Donald Trump now reportedly willing to submit to the Senate for approval. Meanwhile, Russia has indicated it could accept Ukraine joining the European Union (E.U.) of 27 countries as part of a settlement, a major shift from its earlier stance. However, it continues to demand that Ukraine withdraw from parts of Donetsk still under Kyiv’s control, while Ukraine rejects ceding territory. Talks continue, with Trump saying in the last few days that “we’re closer now [to a peace deal] than we have been,” so what would it mean if such an agreement was reached tomorrow?

Even if a full peace agreement were reached tomorrow – freely agreed by both Ukraine and Russia -- it would likely take months for any significant rolling back of U.S. sanctions on Russia to occur, and years before all such prohibitions were removed. “Literally thousands of sanctions have been imposed on Russia since [24 February] 2022, involving codification through multiple executive orders, Treasury designations, and sometimes congressional legislation, so removing them doesn’t just mean a signature,” a senior Washington-based source who works closely with the U.S. Treasury Department exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “Removing each one will require a formal review process, inter?agency coordination, and sometimes Senate approval if treaty?level commitments are involved,” he noted. “Don’t forget that these sanctions often also feed into similar ones on third-country firms and individuals that are connected to Russia, so getting rid of those would require another level of legal process and negotiations with allies in Europe and Asia, which would be very time consuming,” he underlined. “And on top of that any major rollback could be challenged every step of the way by the lawmakers, which would take it out of the control of the executive,” he told OilPrice.com. Ultimately, sanctions are seen as the tangible sign of U.S. resolve, and any rapid removal – absent a clear milestone achieved by Russia – would risk being read by allies and adversaries alike as a reward for aggression. Given this, any substantive longer-term effects on the global oil market would likely be muted.

Even more so, as it is highly likely that such an initiative would involve a graduated process, as with Iran, according to the Washington source. Indeed, once the U.S. had agreed to the ‘Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action’ (JCPOA, or colloquially ‘the nuclear deal’) on 14 July 2015, sanctions relief for Iran was phased in over years, contingent on verified compliance milestones, with Treasury and State monitoring implementation before easing restrictions, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. “It’s pretty clear that the Europeans would want to see this sort of a rollback, and Ukraine too, with [sanctions] relief charted against benchmarks, not a blanket lifting overnight,” said the Washington source. “In this case [Ukraine], we’d be looking for proof that Russia is not continuing with military support for its occupied territories, or a further build-up of Russian military in those regions, and this would require international monitoring,” he observed. Moreover, as seen in the E.U.’s recent ‘Sanctions Snapback’ on Iran, any relief programme for Russia would almost certainly contain a similar mechanism to re?impose measures if Moscow breached peace terms. Judging from the Snapback on Iran, and the likely terms for Russia of any peace deal, such a snapback for Moscow would involve a quick and broad-based reimposition of sanctions on it and third parties relating to military hardware, dual-use (civilian and military) technology, and finance as monitored through the lens of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF enforces 40 standards against money laundering and nine against terrorist financing, with sweeping powers to sanction individuals, firms, or states that fall short. Its grey? and black?list designations trigger escalating restrictions, making it an aggressive enforcement tool.

In any event, Europe – both the E.U. and other countries, including Great Britain – looks even less likely than the U.S. to start rolling back sanctions on Russia any time soon. After years of effectively bankrolling the Russian war machine through vast imports of the country’s oil and gas, the message finally appears to have sunk in: the rest of Europe is in President Vladimir Putin’s sights after Ukraine. He laid the groundwork for what was to come back in his second state?of?the?nation speech after his 2004 re?election, broadcast live on Russian television, when he said: “The demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century. As for the Russian people, it became a genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory.” Following that, his tentative first military incursion into a sovereign European country – Georgia in 2008 – showed him that he could get away with more, in the classic ‘salami slicing’ strategy of territorial advancement that he has used since. This was because of the ineffectual response from Europe to this aggression – itself a result of the fact that the continent, particularly Germany, was unwilling to jeopardise its cheap Russian gas and oil supplies, as also detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. When the same meek response met his 2014 invasion of Ukraine, and subsequent annexation of Crimea, it was game on for the full invasion of Ukraine in 2022. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte laid it out bare for Europe just over a week ago: “We are Russia’s next target. And we are already in harm’s way.” With this view now widespread among Europe’s top leaders, the meaningful rollback of sanctions on Moscow looks unlikely, with the corollary lack of long-term follow-through in the global oil market.

President Trump has further fuelled Europe’s determination to take its own path on Russia, having made it clear early in this presidency that NATO members who did not dramatically increase their defence spending could not rely on U.S. military support in the event of attack from Russia. The last time NATO met, members agreed to increase their defence spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, up from an average of 2% last year. Against this backdrop, it would be too obscene even for Germany to advocate the resumption of oil and gas imports in size from Russia. Indeed, around two weeks ago, the E.U. fully agreed to implement its ‘REPowerEU Roadmap’, which European Commission (E.C.) President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted as enabling the continent to: “Enter the era of Europe’s full energy independence from Russia [as] Today, we are stopping these imports permanently.” She underlined: “By depleting [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.” E.C. Commissioner, Dan Jørgensen, put it even more plainly: “We [the E.U.] will “never go back to our dangerous dependence on Russia, we will never go back to volatile supplies and market manipulation, and we will never go back to energy blackmail and economic exposure.” As such, the agreement contains bans on E.U. imports of pipelined natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and oil from Russia, as analysed fully by OilPrice.com. As one senior source in the EU’s security complex exclusively told OilPrice.com last week: “Regardless of what the Americans do, and regardless of any peace deal in Ukraine, we’re not rolling back anything on Russia.”

[TITLE]U.S. Snatches Venezuela Oil Tanker in Dark‑Hour Strike on Narco‑Terror Funding:
[TEXT]
In a stealth operation carried out before dawn on Dec. 20, the U.S. Coast Guard—working alongside the Department of War—seized an oil tanker last seen in the terrorist state of Venezuela. The United States accused the ship’s operators of moving sanctioned crude to fuel narco‑terror activity. Officials issued a stark warning to traffickers: “We will find you, and we will stop you.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem released a video on social media showing a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter landing on the deck of an oil tanker in international waters off the coast of Venezuela. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump declared the government of Venezuela to be a Foreign Terrorist Organization and ordered the complete naval blockade of the country.

“The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,” Noem posted on X. “We will find you, and we will stop you.”

DHS called the seizure a “lightning strike operation to seize the Motor Tanker Centuries. Officials stated the ship was carrying oil subject to U.S. sanctions.

U.S. and Venezuelan officials report that the seizure of the Panamanian-flagged “Centuries” tanker took place in international waters near the coast of Venezuela. The ship was reportedly bound for Asia, possibly China, reports indicate.

NBC News reported on the Venezuelan reaction, writing:

Venezuela’s minister of the interior, Diosdado Cabello, condemned the operation in a Saturday post on Instagram. “The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela denounces and rejects the theft and hijacking of a new private vessel transporting Venezuelan oil, as well as the forced disappearance of its crew, committed by military personnel of the United States of America in international waters,” Cabello said.

In a post on social media, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth added to the U.S. actions, writing, “President Trump has been clear: the blockade of sanctioned oil tankers departing from, or bound for, Venezuela will remain in full force until Maduro’s criminal enterprise returns every stolen American asset.”

Earlier this month, Breitbart’s John Hayward reported that the Trump administration ordered the seizure of another tanker carrying sanctioned Venezuelan oil. This vessel was reportedly headed to Cuba.

In a speech where he did not directly respond to the tanker’s seizure, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said, in a speech, that the Venezuelan military is “prepared to break the teeth of teh North American empire, if necessary.”

[TITLE]Crude oil prices fall on Russia-Ukraine peace hopes, Venezuela supply cues:
[TEXT]
Crude oil futures traded lower on Friday morning following reports that raised hopes of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

At 9.59 am on Friday, February Brent oil futures were at $59.71, down by 0.18 per cent, and February crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $55.89, down by 0.20 per cent. January crude oil futures were trading at ₹5074 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Friday against the previous close of ₹5114, down by 0.78 per cent, and February futures were trading at ₹5098 against the previous close of ₹5134, down by 0.70 per cent.

Quoting US President Donald Trump, a Reuters report said he believes talks toward ending the war in Ukraine are ‘getting close to something’.

Citing a White House official, the report said the US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are set to meet a Russian delegation in Miami this weekend. Referring to the recent Russian gains on the battlefield, Trump said, “I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there.”

A peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will ease concerns over global crude oil supply disruptions. Russia is one of the world’s major crude oil producers.

Meanwhile, reports said that Venezuela has authorised two unsanctioned very large crude carriers to set sail for China.

Trump had recently announced that the US would impose a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country. This had put at risk around 600,000 barrels of oil per day in exports. China is the major buyer of this crude.

January natural gas futures were trading at ₹329.20 on MCX during the first hour of trading on Friday, down 1.99 per cent from the previous close of ₹335.90.

On the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), January guargum contracts traded at ₹9910 in the first hour of trading on Friday, up 0.22 per cent from the previous close of ₹9888.

January jeera futures were trading at ₹21035 on NCDEX in the initial hour of trading on Friday, down 0.47 per cent from the previous close of ₹21135.

[TITLE]Two Natural Gas Stocks to Watch as Demand Surges:
[TEXT]
In the spirit of that realization, we are going to look at a couple of well-established gas drillers to see which presents the most attractive picture for growth and shareholder returns. First, we will review Canadian E&P, ARC Resources (OTC: AETUF), a leading Montney driller. The stock of ARC has pulled back during the second half of 2025, and we will have a look at the cause to understand if it remains investible. Next, we will look at U.S. driller, Antero Resources (NYSE: AR). Antero has just made a big acquisition…

This year, we have other drivers that might give the stocks of these companies a boost. Powering AI data centers and LNG exports has opened up new markets and pricing regimes for these companies. LNG exports alone are expected to consume another 14 bn cubic feet per day by 2029. That’s music to the ears of gas company CEO’s, and they are ramping up their operations to make sure they can meet this demand.

Gas-focused E&P stocks have been getting a bid in the last few months. It’s normal around this time of year. Storage injection season has come to a close, and across most of North America, people are turning their heat higher to keep out the cold. For the gas drillers, that means it’s finally time to ring the cash register.

As a special Christmas treat to our readers, we have made this month's Global Energy Alert stock deep dive available to all! Enjoy the read, and if you want more of where this came from, then make sure you

[TITLE]Abia enacts new electricity law, unveils regulatory agency:
[TEXT]
The Abia State Government has enacted the Abia State Electricity Law, 2025, and established the Abia State Electricity Regulatory Authority to oversee electricity market activities within the state.

The new law, enacted pursuant to powers granted to states under the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and the Electricity Act, 2023, empowers Abia to independently regulate electricity generation, transmission, distribution and trading within its territory.

Addressing journalists on Wednesday, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ASERA, Mr Emeka Onyegbule, said the authority had formally taken over regulatory oversight of the state’s electricity market following the issuance of a final transfer order by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission.

Onyegbule said the ASERA board was inaugurated on April 30, 2025, in line with the provisions of the new law.

Onyegbule said, “The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, NERC, in the exercise of the powers conferred under the Electricity Act 2023, issued an interim Transfer Order no: NERC/2025/058 dated the 24th day of June 2025; formally transferring regulatory oversight of the Electricity Market in Abia State from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to the ASERA.

“The Interim Order elapsed after a six-month transition period, paving the way for the Final Transfer Order from the Commission that completely put the regulatory oversight of the state market under ASERA.”

He said the transition culminated in the issuance of a final transfer of regulatory authority order by NERC on December 24, 2025.

“With this transfer, all activities within the electricity value-chain, including generation, transmission, distribution and trading, fall under the direct oversight and regulation of the Authority effective from the date of the Transfer Order,” he said.

He assured licensees and stakeholders that ASERA would operate a fair, objective and transparent regulatory regime, guided strictly by the provisions of the law and its regulatory instruments.

Onyegbule said the authority would ensure compliance with licence terms and contractual obligations, while protecting consumer interests and promoting quality service delivery.

“We will ensure that stakeholders discharge contractual obligations to one another while upholding the terms of their licenses, and customers’ voices will be heard and respected, while we will focus on quality service delivery,” he stated.

Also speaking, the Commissioner for Information, Prince Okey Kanu, said the enactment of the electricity law paved the way for the establishment of ASERA as an independent regulator of the Abia electricity market.

Kanu noted that the transfer of regulatory powers from NERC to ASERA was in line with the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2023, which allows states to regulate their electricity markets.

The Commissioner for Public Utilities, Mr Ikechukwu Uwanna, said the process began on March 17, following the enactment of the electricity law, describing it as a step towards building a world-class electricity market in the state.

Uwanna said the new regulatory framework would encourage investment, protect consumers and improve efficiency in electricity service delivery across Abia State.

[TITLE]Trump Just Sent This Lesser-Known Stock Plunging. Should You Buy the Dip?:
[TEXT]
Orsted ADR (DNNGY) stands as a global leader in renewable energy, specializing in offshore and onshore wind farms, solar power, energy storage, green hydrogen, and bioenergy solutions. The company drives the energy transition by developing large-scale projects that deliver clean power to millions, with a focus on cost-competitive offshore wind and innovative storage technologies to stabilize grids and support electrification.

Founded in 1973, it is headquartered in Fredericia, Denmark, with operations across Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific.

Orsted’s Stock Performance

Orsted ADR trades just above its 52‑week low of about $5.75 and far below the $33 high, reflecting a deep de-rating after capital raises and guidance cuts. Over the past five days, the stock has declined by roughly 12.8%, approximately 4.63% lower over the last month, and is down nearly 51.38% over the last three months, resulting in a year-to-date (YTD) loss of close to 59% and a decline of over 12 months.

By contrast, European utilities benchmarks have been roughly flat to modestly positive over the same 1‑year period, meaning Orsted has sharply underperformed its sector peers amid project delays, dilutive equity issuance, and weaker EBITDA guidance.

Orsted Results

Orsted ADR reported Q3 2025 EBITDA of DKK 3.1 billion, down DKK 6.5 billion from Q3 2024 as exceptional partnership and trading gains did not repeat. The quarter swung to a net loss of DKK 1.7 billion (around USD $260 million), versus a net profit of DKK 5.2 billion a year earlier, coming in weaker than analyst expectations that had anticipated a small profit or near‑breakeven result.

Underlying operating trends were mixed. Offshore EBITDA fell on lower wind speeds, step‑downs in subsidies at older projects, and the absence of last year’s unusually strong power trading, partly offset by ramp‑up at Gode Wind 3 and grid‑delay compensation at Borkum Riffgrund 3. Onshore EBITDA declined modestly to about DKK 0.8 billion, while Bioenergy & Other turned negative.

For the first nine months, EBITDA (ex-partnerships and cancellation fees) was DKK 17.0 billion, roughly in line with the prior year, but impairments and higher capital employed pushed reported ROCE down to 2.0% (10.2% on an adjusted basis). Operating cash flow for Q3 was negative DKK 1.2 billion, with 9M operating cash flow of DKK 6.7 billion versus DKK 8.1 billion in 2024.

Despite the weak quarter, Orsted reaffirmed full‑year 2025 EBITDA guidance of DKK 24–27 billion, excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees, citing solid nine‑month performance and typically stronger wind conditions in Q4. The company also maintained its 2025 gross investment guidance of DKK 50–54 billion and highlighted progress on its 8.1 GW offshore construction pipeline and capital-structure strengthening via a large rights issue and the planned 50% farm-down of Hornsea 3.

Orsted Stock Slides

Orsted shares plunged 13% in late trading after the U.S. Department of the Interior suspended leases for five offshore wind projects already under construction. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum cited national security concerns as the reason for the pause, impacting key U.S. developments in the Danish renewable giant's portfolio. Ørsted shares closed down 12.7% amid the news.

Should You Buy DNNGY?

Orsted offers compelling long-term value for renewable believers, trading near 52-week lows despite reaffirmed 2025 EBITDA guidance. Recent U.S. project pauses add near-term risk, but Europe's offshore wind pipeline remains robust, reflecting upside and providing investors an opportunity to buy the dip.

[TITLE]Tech Behemoth Gobbles Up Power Company In $5 Billion Deal to Juice Data Centers:
[TEXT]
From THE DAILY CALLER

Audrey Streb

DCNF Energy Reporter

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, announced on Monday that it will acquire the data center and energy infrastructure company Intersect for $4.75 billion in cash and “the assumption of debt.”

Though Google already owns a majority stake in the company, the deal will further support the Big Tech company’s build-out of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure while keeping Intersect’s operations separate, according to Alphabet. As America’s energy demand climbs while projected AI data center needs skyrocket, Big Tech has been searching for reliable electricity sources — with some companies looking to resurrect nuclear plants.

“Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership. We look forward to welcoming Sheldon and the Intersect team,” CEO of Google and Alphabet Sundar Pichai said in a statement Monday. (RELATED: Big Tech May Soon Have Monopoly On Power As America Faces Energy Crisis)

Alphabet notes that this acquisition “will augment Alphabet and Google’s ongoing commitment to partnering with utilities and energy developers across the sector to unlock abundant, reliable, affordable energy supply that enables the buildout of data center infrastructure without passing on costs to grid customers.”

“Intersect has always been focused on bringing innovation to the industry and we look forward to accelerating at scale as part of Google,” Sheldon Kimber, Intersect founder and CEO, said in a statement Monday. “Modern infrastructure is the linchpin of American competitiveness in AI. We share Google’s conviction that energy innovation and community investment are the pillars of what must come next.”

The Trump administration has advanced similar messaging promoting U.S. dominance in the AI industry, signing an executive order on Dec. 11 that decrees a “national policy framework for AI.”

“We remain in the earliest days of this technological revolution and are in a race with adversaries for supremacy within it,” the Dec. 11 executive order reads.

While President Donald Trump stresses the vitality of building out data center infrastructure to keep America’s competitive edge in the AI race, some local communities have been protesting data center development over concerns the facilities will spike electricity costs, take up rural land and drain water resources.

States like California, Florida and New York have recently advanced or signed AI policies in moves their governors argue shield the public from Big Tech. Democrats and Republicans are split on AI messaging headed into the 2026 midterms, with prominent politicians on both sides of the aisle vowing to shut down data center development until clearer consumer and local protections are established.

Notably, some recent reports have referenced quiet data center deals between tech companies, developers and utilities that defy local communities’ wishes. Protesters have gathered to fight what they call “secret deals,” fearing that Big Tech companies will reap financial benefits at the expense of local communities, often without residents’ knowledge or consent.
