[TITLE]Georgia Tech reportedly inks massive nine-figure apparel deal to ditch Adidas:
[TEXT]
Georgia Tech is going to have a new apparel partner and it comes with a big time price tag. According to ESPN’s Pete Thamel, the Yellow Jackets have agreed to a 10-year deal with Under Armour to become the school’s official apparel provider, starting July 1, 2026.

Source: Georgia Tech and Under Armour have agreed to a new 10-year deal for UA to become the official apparel provider, effective July 1 of 2026. The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that GTech is getting from current adidas deal. pic.twitter.com/MeZfbDkuTU — Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) October 3, 2025

The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that Georgia Tech is getting from the current Adidas deal, according to Thamel and Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Chad Bishop.

"Tech was receiving an average of $3.11 million annually from Adidas in cash and product over its original six-year contract that was signed in 2018," Bishop said. This figure puts the reported value of Georgia Tech's new deal with UA at $186.6 million over ten years.

Georgia Tech’s previous deal with Adidas was set to expire in the summer of 2024, but the two sides put together a new two-year deal. However, the short-term fix wasn't enough to keep the Yellow Jackets from looking elsewhere.

“We’re thrilled to partner with Under Armour, an organization that shares our commitment to excellence, innovation, amplifying the Georgia Tech brand across the globe and enhancing the student-athlete experience, including through innovative NIL opportunities," GT's Vice president and director of athletics Ryan Alpert said in a statement. "Our partnership with Under Armour will play a big part in Georgia Tech continuing to move forward in the new era of collegiate athletics and reaching our ambitions of competing for championships at the highest levels of collegiate athletics.”

For Under Armour, this deal puts the outfitter back on the map in the new era of college athletics.

“As we mark our 30th anniversary next year, we’re thrilled to team back up with Georgia Tech, our first collegiate client, to experience our commitment to enhancing athletic performance." Under Armour's VP of the Team Division Craig Cummings said in a statement. "We are energized by the momentum in Atlanta and look forward to amplifying our presence in the community through meaningful activations and shared purpose.”

Georgia Tech had worn Russell Athletic for over two decades before switching to Under Armour in 1996. They migrated to Adidas and now the two brands will be reunited after thirty years apart.

The Yellow Jacket's first time officially back in the UA branding will come against Deion Sanders and Colorado in Atlanta on Sept. 5, 2026.
