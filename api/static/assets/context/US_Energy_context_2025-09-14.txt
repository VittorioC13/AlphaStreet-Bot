[TITLE]Strathcona Files Amended Offer to Acquire MEG Energy:
[TEXT]
Strathcona's amended offer reflects a 10 percent increase to its original offer and equates to an 11 percent premium to the Cenovus-MEG agreement, the company said.

Strathcona Resources Ltd. said Thursday it filed an amended offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of MEG Energy Corp. for 0.80 Strathcona shares per MEG share, in its latest move to win the takeover battle with Cenovus Energy Inc.

Cenovus on Aug. 22 said it entered into a definitive arrangement agreement to acquire MEG in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at $7.9 billion, inclusive of assumed debt. Since then, Strathcona said it has been approached by “a substantial portion of the MEG shareholder base” giving feedback that the deal “meaningfully undervalues MEG and allows Cenovus to keep the vast majority of future upside for itself due to its cash-heavy consideration structure”.

Strathcona’s amended offer reflects a 10 percent increase to its original offer and equates to an 11 percent premium to the Cenovus-MEG agreement, the company said, adding that feedback on it from MEG shareholders has been “overwhelmingly positive” to date.

Strathcona said it “remains ready and willing to engage constructively and in good faith with the MEG board of directors to enter into a supported transaction”.

Strathcona also reaffirmed Waterous Energy Fund's (WEF) willingness to enter into a mutually acceptable lock-up agreement to “assuage any unfounded concerns around future selling of Strathcona shares by WEF,” according to the statement.

Under the terms of the Cenovus-MEG agreement, Cenovus will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of MEG for $27.25 per share, which will be paid 75 percent in cash and 25 percent in Cenovus common shares. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter.

Last week, Strathcona confirmed its purchase of around 6 million MEG shares for approximately $172.7 million, bringing its total ownership to 14.2% of the issued and outstanding shares.

Strathcona said it intends to vote against the resolution to approve the acquisition of MEG by Cenovus, which requires approval by at least 66 and two-thirds percent of the votes cast by shareholders at the special meeting scheduled on Oct. 9.

Cenovus and MEG did not immediately reply to requests for comment from Rigzone.

Cenovus to Divest WRB Refining Stake

On Tuesday, Cenovus said it reached an agreement for the sale of its 50 percent interest in WRB Refining LP to its joint venture partner Phillips 66, indirectly through Cenovus’ subsidiaries, for $1.4 billion in cash.

The WRB joint venture includes the Wood River Refinery in Illinois and the Borger Refinery in Texas, which have combined crude throughput capacity of 495,000 barrels per day (bpd), or 247,500 bpd net to Cenovus, the company said in a statement.

The transaction is expected to close around the end of the third quarter, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, Cenovus said.

After divesting its interest in WRB, Cenovus' downstream business will consist of the Lloydminster Upgrader, Lloydminster Refinery, Lima Refinery, Toledo Refinery and Superior Refinery. Total crude throughput capacity of the business will be 472,800 bpd consisting of approximately 55 percent heavy oil, according to the statement.

“This transaction aligns with our strategy of owning and operating the assets that are core to our business. After the sale of WRB, our downstream business will be more focused, comprised of assets we control, which provide physical integration and egress for our leading upstream heavy oil business,” Cenovus President and CEO Jon McKenzie said. “The proceeds from this transaction will allow us to accelerate shareholder returns over the near term”.

Proceeds from the transaction will be used to reduce the company’s net debt and to accelerate returns to shareholders in the form of increased share repurchases, Cenovus said.

[TITLE]India Trade Deal To Be Sorted Out When Russian Oil Purchase Ends: US Commerce Secretary:
[TEXT]
The trade deal with India will be "sorted out" once New Delhi stops its purchase of Russian crude oil, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Thursday.

Lutnick, while speaking to CNBC, said India has to "stop buying Russian oil". The remarks come days after the top US official told Bloomberg that India will say "sorry" and return to the negotiating table "in a month or two".

Lutnick had told Bloomberg that Washington is "always willing to talk" and it was "wrong for India" to increase purchases of Russian oil.

Notable, the India-US ties plunged following the publicly issued remarks by US President Donald Trump and his officials, accusing India of supporting the "Russian war machine" by buying crude from Moscow amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.

From Aug. 27 onwards, Indian goods entering the US are subjected to an additional 25% levy. This takes the cumulative tariff on India to 50%, which is at par with Brazil and highest among all major US trading partners.

[TITLE]US electric grids under pressure from energy-hungry data centers are changing strategy:
[TEXT]
This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

"We're going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere," said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. "Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is."

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs—likely for the biggest power users—to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast—twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data—and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

"Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that," said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

Construction continues at Entergy's Orange County Advanced Power Station, a 1,215-megawatt facility, Monday, Feb. 24, 2025, in Orange, Texas. Credit: AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation's largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

"This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM's footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment," the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a "bring your own generation" requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.
