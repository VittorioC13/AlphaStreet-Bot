[TITLE]HSBC Slashes Oil and Gas Financing:
[TEXT]
Financing and deals with oil and gas companies will have a materially lower share in the energy portfolio of HSBC as new energy opportunities arise, the banking giant’s chief sustainability officer, Julian Wentzel, told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday.

The UK-based banking group unveiled today its updated Net Zero Transition Plan, in which it eased the interim emissions targets for its oil and gas portfolio. The 2030 emission reduction target is now to reduce emissions in its business with the oil and gas sector by 14% to 30% from a 2019 baseline. The previous target was cutting absolute financed emissions by 34% by 2030.

HSBC reaffirmed its 2050 net-zero target for its financed portfolio, but noted that it is updating the interim targets as “Our customers are navigating complex and dynamic market conditions with the transition playing out at different speeds and from different starting points across sectors and geographies.”

“In some sectors and regions there has been significant progress; in others, the transition is proving harder and slower than anticipated,” HSBC said.

Wentzel told Bloomberg that financing for fossil fuels will likely increase in HSBC’s portfolio, but the finance will “decline materially” relative to HSBC’s total capital allocation to the energy sector.

HSBC is not considering further restrictions, according to Wentzel, who became the bank’s chief sustainability officer in February.

“We have to acknowledge that the removal of capital from the oil and gas sector doesn’t support the transition, because if they’re seeking to transition, we want to be party to and support that transition,” Wentzel told Bloomberg.

The world’s biggest banks raised their combined financing for fossil fuels by more than one-fifth last year, bucking a falling trend since 2021 amid a backlash against net-zero policies, especially in the United States.

After years of scrutiny and blacklisting from Republican states in the U.S. and lawsuits from Republican attorney generals, North American banks and asset managers began quitting net-zero alliances en masse following President Donald Trump’s election victory.

Some 20 kilometers out from the port of Tianjin, in the jade waters of the Bohai Sea, a vast metal structure rises above the surface. This hulking offshore platform, 11-1 CEPJ, is the beating heart of the Caofeidian oil and gas field — and a monument to China’s multibillion-dollar efforts to insulate itself from the whims of its rivals.China has long sought to reduce the risk that comes with being both the world’s top consumer and its largest importer of energy. But the urgency and scale of that ambition have increased dramatically in recent years and months, along with geopolitical tension and the ascent of a mercurial Donald Trump to helm a US administration unafraid to use trade as a weapon. Last month, Washington also blacklisted Russia’s top two oil producers, prompting Chinese refiners to cancel some cargoes.Since 2019, when the latest output expansion drive began in earnest, China’s majors have spent $468 billion on drilling and exploration — that’s up by almost a quarter from the previous six years, and enough to make PetroChina Co. the world’s biggest spender during that period, outpacing even heavyweights like Saudi Aramco. Production is already rebounding, and with Beijing likely to double down on self-reliance, there is no indication that pace of investment will slow in the coming years.“In the last few years, we have seen an energy crunch all around the world,” Huang Yingchao, vice president of natural gas at PetroChina International (Singapore) Pte, the energy giant’s trading arm, said at a conference last week. “Gas and LNG are like tap water and bottled water. Tap water is cheaper and is more reliable, and the logistics are easier. So we push for domestic production.”All of this is becoming a huge, unspoken headache for the world’s largest oil and gas producers. From Exxon Mobil Corp. to BP Plc, sprawling corporations have grown used to having China as the engine for the world’s fossil-fuel demand. Indeed, for much of the last decade, it accounted for more than 60% of global oil demand growth.Take Shell Plc, one of the world's largest liquefied natural gas suppliers. It is investing billions into new LNG supply on the expectation that global demand will expand 60% by 2040, driven largely by China. Its boss, Wael Sawan, told a conference in June that gas could make up 20% of China's energy mix, compared with single digits today."We believe China is a huge market,” Hassan Alyami, vice president of Aramco’s Ras Tanura refinery said at an industry gathering last month. “Demand is increasing. Maybe now it is stable, but in 2027 and beyond, demand is going to increase.”But the past may no longer be a good way of predicting the future. Domestic output is increasing just as demand growth slows, with the economy sputtering and cleaner cars beginning to rule the roads. This year has already seen competition from other fuels, and Sanford C. Bernstein analysts expect domestic gas production to begin outpacing demand growth by the end of this decade, a moment when China may also be taking more pipeline gas from Russia, further cooling appetite for imported LNG.Nevertheless, from January to October global companies have greenlit nearly 100 billion cubic meters of new LNG export capacity, already the second-most for any year on record. In the US alone, $100 billion could be invested in new LNG export infrastructure this decade, according to Wood Mackenzie Ltd.Trump has said China will buy more US energy and even potentially invest in Alaska as part of a wider trade truce. But, as with other key areas, like agriculture, it will not be for lack of alternative options.“China is coming in with increased production. With oil demand falling or plateauing, that serves to neutralize — or to provide China with a buffer against — the Trump administration’s push for energy dominance,” said Erica Downs, senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “They’re in a completely different world and an even better position than during Trump 1.0.”China still consumes far more than it produces, and that is unlikely to change any time soon. But today it ranks No. 7 in crude production, ahead of many members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and in natural gas it is No. 4.That clout speaks to the evolution of China’s oil majors, all of which have expanded dramatically in size and sophistication this millennium. PetroChina, Cnooc Ltd and Sinopec , have become giants in terms of output, refining and oil trading, alongside rivals Chevron Corp and Shell Plc. PetroChina’s annual production has risen by nearly a quarter in the past decade to 1.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent.“The Chinese oil majors have surprised not just the market, but they’ve surprised themselves by exceeding production targets,” said Michal Meidan, director of China research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “It gives China a sense of control, especially as oil demand is declining.”Under the first Trump administration and during the first trade war, President Xi Jinping called for a renewed effort to boost domestic output. Since, oil production has risen 13% and gas has climbed by more than half. Both are on track to set all-time records this year — the equivalent of adding nearly an Indonesia worth of oil and an Algeria worth of gas to the balance of global supplies.Government officials haven’t made specific future targets public — at best, an indication could come early next year, when the 15th Five-Year Plan is approved by China’s annual parliament. But they’ve made it clear they want the drilling boom to continue. That new economic blueprint is expected to make upstream expansion a priority, according to a person familiar with the government’s thinking. The person asked not to be named as the goals have not been published.Beijing’s focus on hydrocarbon security arguably dates back to the late 1950s, to a period around China’s split with the Soviet Union — and with its engineers — that ingrained in officials the need to avoid leaning too heavily on others. The country’s very first oilfield, Daqing, was already a model of self-reliance, expanding rapidly as technology, engineers and construction equipment were funneled toward it.Those concerns resurfaced in earnest a decade ago, when OPEC launched a price war to halt the growth of US shale oil and combat a plunge in value. China was caught in the crossfire, saddled with costly, aging fields that the head of PetroChina in 2016 said had “no hope” of making a profit, even as prices recovered. Output tumbled 12% over the following three years.Under Xi, Beijing has set out to change that. In the midst of a trade war with the US, he underlined in 2018 the need to boost domestic oil and gas exploration and production — at any cost. He reinforced the message during a 2021 visit to the Lai 113 block at the Shengli oil field in the eastern province of Shandong.“Oil development is of great significance to our country,” Xi told a crowd of workers clad in bright red, flame-retardant jumpsuits. “As a major manufacturing nation, China must develop its real economy. The rice bowl of energy must be firmly held in our own hands.”Four years later, on a cool and wet September afternoon in Shengli, Zhang Chuanbao, a senior geologist for operator Sinopec, shows visitors everything the company has done to revive production at a field that was first discovered in 1961.He stops alongside two giant metal tanks filled with liquefied carbon dioxide captured from a nearby refinery. Pumps housed in sheds next to them are injecting that CO2 deep underground into the reservoirs. Sinopec is keen to underline the environmental benefits of storing 1 million tons of CO2 a year underground, but it’s also helping to squeeze out extra oil and gas, boosting the recovery rate by 15%.The carbon capture project is expected to lift oil output by 3 million tons total over the next 15 years, and Sinopec is seeking other ways to maintain the 24 million tons of annual production at the aging field, including tapping shale rock beneath it.All of these advances are possible thanks to vast sums spent in recent years. After Xi called for a renewed emphasis on domestic drilling, the following year China’s three oil majors adopted an action plan for oil and gas development through 2025.PetroChina, the top spender, boosted its capital expenditure by 16% in 2019 to $42 billion, while Cnooc and Sinopec both increased spending by more than a fifth that same year. By comparison, that year Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP taken together increased spending by just over 5%.Success was not a foregone conclusion. Six or seven years ago, China’s giants were announcing plans to boost production at a time of abundant global supplies. Analysts questioned whether they were prioritizing shareholder returns or national service.But the move proved prescient. Companies began to actually produce more barrels just as oil and gas prices surged, especially from 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Cnooc hit record profits that year; PetroChina did the same in 2024.“The companies got kind of lucky,” said Lin Chen, vice president of oil and gas research at Rystad Energy. “The oil price rose higher than their break-even costs, so the more they produced, the more money they earned.”Today, China is going beyond supporting aging fields to sustain fuel output. It’s putting funds into shale, and firms including Ningxia Baofeng Energy Group Co. have built massive refineries that convert coal into oil products, chemicals and natural gas — a process that is even more polluting than the traditional petroleum industry.The biggest success has been at sea. Cnooc has lifted its domestic output — all of it offshore — by 60% between the end of 2018 and 2024.And the emblem of this victory is the Bohai Sea in northeast China, which has supplanted onshore fields to become the largest oil-producing region in the country. Protected by peninsulas jutting out from Shandong on the west and Liaoning to the north, it is home to 60 fields and more than 200 platforms pumping up oil and gas from under the sea floor.One of those is the Caofeidian 11-1 CEPJ. Named after a nearby coastal town, the Caofeidian field is part of a network in Bohai that together produces more than 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day —

[TEXT]
We signed a new carbon dioxide (CO2) removal deal with Mombak, a Brazil-based company that is restoring degraded land in the Amazon by planting native, biodiverse forests. We’re purchasing 200,000 tons of CO2 removal from Mombak — 4x the size of our first deal with them last year.

Mombak’s approach balances scientific rigor with industrial-scale operations to maximize climate benefit and ecosystem restoration. Our expanded support will help Mombak grow their impact, and we’ll also use Google DeepMind’s Perch AI to quantify the biodiversity benefits of reforestation.

Mombak is the first project selected by the Symbiosis Coalition, and it has been endorsed by independent experts for its credible approach to measuring CO2 removal. As with our other purchases, we’ll report transparently on the impact of this project — and where needed, plan to replace credits as their impact expires.

[TITLE]Short answer: Beef tendon and tripe are not “natural steroids.” They don’t directly raise testosterone. What they do offer: collagen (tendon) for connective‑tissue resilience and a modest hit of prote:
[TEXT]
The receipts (what tendon + tripe

actually

do)

Tripe (cooked, simmered): per 100 g it’s ~11.8 g protein, ~4.1 g fat, very low carb; a serving (~85 g) gives meaningful B‑12 (~26% DV), zinc (~13% DV), and selenium (~18% DV). It’s also relatively high in cholesterol (~133 mg per 85 g).

Beef tendon: predominantly collagen—amino‑acid profile is heavy on glycine, proline, hydroxyproline; great for connective tissue, but collagen is incomplete protein (no tryptophan) and low in leucine, so it’s weaker for muscle protein synthesis by itself.

Why athletes still use collagen: In small human trials, taking vitamin‑C–enriched gelatin/collagen (≈15 g) ~1 hour pre‑training boosted biomarkers of collagen synthesis—think tendons/ligaments—after jump‑rope bouts. That’s durability, not testosterone.

Body‑comp edge (specific populations): Several RCTs show collagen peptides + resistance training improved fat‑free mass and strength more than placebo in older or untrained men; mechanism is likely connective‑tissue remodeling and better training tolerance—not a testosterone surge.

Testosterone: what actually moves the needle (and where tendon/tripe fit)

Fix deficiencies (esp. zinc): Controlled studies show zinc restriction slashes testosterone, while supplementing zinc in deficient men brings levels back up. Tripe gives you a dietary zinc bump; if you’re already sufficient, don’t expect supra‑physiological gains. Don’t go ultra‑low‑fat: A 2021 meta‑analysis found low‑fat diets tended to lower testosterone versus higher‑fat diets (though later analyses are mixed). Point: eat enough fat; you don’t need to drown in it. Remember the raw material: Testosterone is literally synthesized from cholesterol inside Leydig cells (under LH signaling). Dietary cholesterol’s direct impact on T is murky, but you do need adequate energy and fats for normal steroidogenesis. Sleep like a champion: One week of 5 h/night cut daytime testosterone

ReNew Energy Global Plc, India's leading renewable energy company and a preferred decarbonisation partner, on Friday announced that it has secured USD 331 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the statement said.The project integrates 837 MWp of wind and solar capacity with a 415 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery energy storage system (BESS).

Designed to deliver 300 MW of peak power along with a dependable baseload supply, the project will significantly enhance grid reliability and accelerate India's transition to a low-carbon energy future.The USD 331-million debt from ADB comprises up to USD 291 million in local currency financing from ADB's ordinary capital resources and up to USD 40 million from the ADB-administered Leading Asia's Private Infrastructure Fund 2 (LEAP 2), with ADB arranging the remainder.

The signing of financing agreements was presided over by Bhargav Dasgupta, Vice President for Market Solutions at ADB, and Sumant Sinha, Founder, Chairman and CEO of ReNew."This project demonstrates that renewable energy can now be delivered competitively at the grid scale as per peak power demand requirements," Sumant Sinha, Founder, Chairman and CEO of ReNew, said.

It also builds on the strategic cooperation outlined under a Memorandum of Understanding signed at UNFCCC COP28 to accelerate clean energy deployment and grid transformation."This is the first peak power renewable energy project to be financed by ADB and is expected to generate about 1,641 gigawatt-hours of clean energy per year," Bhargav Dasgupta, Vice-President for Market Solutions at ADB, said.

[TITLE]COP30 Must Confront Financial and Structural Divide Holding Back Emerging Economies:
[TEXT]
As COP30 convenes in Belém, Brazil, in 2025, the global climate conversation returns to a familiar paradox: clean energy has never been cheaper, yet the pace of deployment remains painfully uneven.

In Europe and North America, renewables dominate new capacity additions. In much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America—regions that will determine the planet’s carbon trajectory—the investment flow is trickling when it should be roaring.

The reason is not technological inertia; it is economic geography. Disparities in capital costs, policy stability, and grid readiness continue to lock emerging markets out of affordable clean energy finance.

COP30, hosted for the first time in the Amazon basin, must be the moment the world moves beyond pledges and confronts the architecture of inequity that shapes the cost of the energy transition itself.

The cost-of-capital divide is where the transition is won or lost. Every solar farm or wind project is essentially a financing instrument attached to physical infrastructure. Because there is no fuel cost, up to 90% of lifetime expenditure occurs upfront.

The decisive factor is therefore the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)—and this is where the global playing field is deeply tilted.

In OECD countries, clean energy projects can secure debt at 3–6%, with 20-year tenors and predictable policy frameworks. In parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, those same projects face WACCs exceeding 10–15%, with loan terms often capped at seven years. The physical technology is identical; the price of money is not.

The host nation, Brazil, offers a fitting example. Its recent experience integrating biofuels, hydro, and emerging solar sectors into coherent national planning shows that industrial ambition and deployment scale can coexist—if guided by transparency and credible sequencing.

Why the gap? Currency risk, political uncertainty, and underdeveloped domestic capital markets. Most renewable equipment is imported and denominated in dollars or euros, while revenues are earned in local currency from state utilities that often struggle with solvency.

Devaluation risk alone can wipe out returns overnight. Without deep hedging markets, investors either demand higher premiums or retreat altogether.

The outcome is self-perpetuating. High capital costs slow deployment, which limits the build-out of supply chains and grids, which in turn keeps risk perceptions high.

At COP30, negotiators cannot ignore this arithmetic. Discussions of a “New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance” (NCQG)—the successor to the $100 billion promise—must explicitly include cost-of-capital equalization as a metric of success. The climate transition isn’t just

[TITLE]Google, Meta, Amazon: India’s data centre boom confronts a water challenge:
[TEXT]
India's data centre boom confronts a looming water challenge

1 day ago Share Save Nikhil Inamdar BBC News, Mumbai Share Save

Bloomberg via Getty Images India's data centre capacity is projected to surge 77% by 2027

The extraordinary rise of artificial intelligence has turbocharged data centre growth in India, Asia's third largest economy. Data centres - the centralised physical facilities that enable our growing digital existence by hosting computer servers, IT infrastructure and network equipment - power everything from ChatGPT queries to electric vehicles and streaming services. Last month, Google made an eye-popping $15bn (£11.49bn) investment in an AI data centre in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh - its biggest in India. It was the latest among a string of investments from companies - including global giants like Amazon Web Services and Meta and local players such as Reliance Industries - that are pumping billions of dollars into India's data centre market. Even luxury real-estate developers have joined the bandwagon to build these computing facilities. The sector is poised for "explosive growth", according to global real estate advisory JLL, with India's data centre capacity projected to surge 77% by 2027 to reach 1.8GW. Some $25-30bn is expected to be spent in capacity expansion by 2030, according to various estimates. While vital for India's developmental needs, the growth of such energy hungry, water-guzzling infrastructure has profound implications for the country's decarbonisation plans.

India has no option but to attract big data centre investments, some experts say. While the country is said to account for 20% of global data generation, it has only 3% of global data centre capacity. And demand for such infrastructure is soaring, with India expected to consume the most data in the world by 2028 - higher than developed markets like the US, Europe and even China. This consumption is being driven by massive growth in internet and mobile use, the government's regulatory thrust on hosting user data locally and rapid adoption of AI, which has greater computing needs. AI chatbots like ChatGPT have their second largest user base in India. There's also a strong business case for Indian policymakers to push for such investments and for global firms to commit the money. According to Kotak Research, "data centre development cost is one of the lowest in India with only China's cost being lower", and India's electricity cost is a fraction of the US, UK and Japan. The country also has world-class tech talent suited for the industry's growth. "Just like we exploited the IT services boom through the 90s and 2000s, this is another opportunity that we can use to our advantage," Vibhuti Garg, director for South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told the BBC.

This boom has, however, presented policymakers with difficult trade-offs. From Chile and Mexico to Georgia in the US and Scotland, serious concerns have been raised around data centres guzzling excess water for their cooling systems and consuming vast amounts of energy at the cost of local communities. In an energy starved, water-scarce India, these challenges are even more accentuated. According to the World Bank, India has 18% of the world's population, but only 4% of its water resources, making it among the most water-stressed countries in the world. India's data centre water consumption, meanwhile, is expected to more than double from 150 billion litres in 2025 to 358 billion litres by 2030, putting further pressure on its water table. Moreover, most of India's data centres are concentrated in urban clusters like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru which have strong competing water needs. A potential pushback from locals or a loss of licences to build and operate such centres as a result of growing water stress could hit the industry hard over the long term, experts say. There are already some murmurs of discontent. Advocacy groups like the Human Rights Forum have raised "alarm" over the Andhra Pradesh state government's "public resource diversion" for Google's proposed data centre, saying that Visakhapatnam city where it is slated to come up is already facing acute water stress which could intensify as a result of this investment. Google directed the BBC to a document which says that the company uses a "peer-reviewed context-based water-risk framework" to evaluate local watershed risk at new sites to guide decision-making on whether to use a freshwater source. While India has explicit policies and regulations that govern data protection and data centre development, zoning, energy use etc, "water use does not figure prominently in any of these policy groups, and is a significant blind spot that places high risk on the long-term functioning of these centres", Sahana Goswami of WRI India, a water research organisation, told the BBC. An S&P Global study predicts that 60-80% of India's data centres will face high water stress in this decade itself as a result of limited resource availability. This, in turn, could have a cascading impact on other industries. "Imagine shutdowns of data centres in peak summer due to lack of water for cooling - how might this impact banking services, medical systems in hospitals using cloud services, transit system operations and more," says Ms Goswami. Companies need to bring greater innovation and explore mechanisms to use treated domestic and industrial waste water instead of fighting for this limited resource, experts say. "India itself has examples of such innovation in the data centre space in Navi Mumbai. Further, various power and textile industries are much ahead in partnering with municipal authorities and water utilities," says Ms Goswami. Praveen Ramamurthy, a water recycling expert from the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru city, agrees. "Non-potable or treated water must be made mandatory for cooling needs," he told the BBC, adding that India must also select "low-stress water basins for new projects". He also advocates for the use of zero-water cooling technologies that are advancing globally, but "inconsistently deployed across Indian and legacy facilities".

[TITLE]New U.S. nuclear power boom begins with old, still-unsolved problem: What to do with radioactive waste:

Nuclear power is back, largely due to the skyrocketing demand for electricity, including big tech's hundreds of artificial intelligence data centers across the country and the reshoring of manufacturing. But it returns with an old and still-unsolved problem: storing all of the radioactive waste created as a byproduct of nuclear power generation. In May, President Trump issued executive orders aimed at quadrupling the current nuclear output over the next 25 years by accelerating construction of both large conventional reactors and next-gen small modular reactors. Last week, the U.S. signed a deal with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the country that could result in Westinghouse attempting to spinoff and IPO a stand-alone nuclear power company with the federal government as a shareholder. There's a growing consensus among governments, businesses and the public that the time is right for a nuclear power renaissance, and even if the ambitious build-out could take a decade or more and cost hundreds of billion of dollars, it will be an eventual boon to legacy and start-up nuclear energy companies, the AI-fixated wing of the tech industry and investors banking on their success. But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. Only two nuclear power plants have been built since 1990 — more than $15 billion over budget and years behind schedule — and they went online in just the last two years. Almost all of the 94 reactors currently operating in 28 states, generating

[TITLE]Coal: Still powering America and worth defending * WorldNetDaily * by Chris Hamilton, Real Clear Wire:
[TEXT]
For more than a century, America’s coal industry has powered our homes, forged our steel, and fueled our prosperity. It has been the backbone of industrial growth and a symbol of American strength, self-reliance, and hard work. Even today—after nearly two decades of relentless political and regulatory assault—coal remains one of this nation’s most valuable resources, sustaining hundreds of thousands of jobs and keeping electricity affordable and reliable for millions of families.

Coal mining and the industries that depend directly on it employ more than 400,000 Americans. That figure includes approximately 130,000 miners, technicians, engineers, and plant operators working in extraction, preparation, and transport—and more than 270,000 additional workers in sectors that rely on coal as their lifeblood: railroads, barge lines, equipment manufacturers, utilities, steelmakers, and the communities that serve them. Together, they form one of the most productive, disciplined, and technically advanced workforces in the nation.

The economic reach of this workforce is immense. When you combine wages, benefits, and tax contributions, America’s coal industry generates more than $300 billion in annual economic impact. Coal miners themselves earn average wages exceeding $90,000 per year—nearly double the national average. Those paychecks sustain rural counties, small towns, and entire regions from Appalachia to the Powder River Basin. The taxes paid by coal companies and their employees—federal, state, and local—contribute an estimated $12 billion each year, funding schools, highways, and essential public services across multiple states. In places like West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming, coal doesn’t just provide jobs—it provides the foundation for life itself.

And that foundation extends far beyond the communities where coal is mined. Nearly one-third of America’s electricity still comes from coal, providing the baseload generation that keeps the grid stable when wind and solar can’t meet demand. Without coal, our energy system would be far more expensive, far less reliable, and far more dependent on foreign imports. At a time when families are struggling under inflation and high utility bills, coal remains the most abundant, reliable, and affordable source of energy ever discovered—and the only one capable of sustaining industrial-scale steel production.

Steel, the backbone of modern civilization, cannot be produced without metallurgical coal. Every skyscraper, bridge, railcar, and ship in America depends on it. Our nation’s defense systems rely on it. Our ability to rebuild infrastructure, strengthen supply chains, and reindustrialize the nation all hinge on one truth: without coal, America stops building.

Despite its essential role, our industry has endured nearly twenty years of political persecution. Beginning under the Obama administration and continuing under President Biden, federal regulators have weaponized the rulemaking process to wage an ideological war against coal. The Clean Power Plan, Waters of the U.S. rule, endless permitting delays, and duplicative environmental reviews have been used not to improve safety or reduce emissions, but to deliberately dismantle the coal sector and the communities that depend upon it.

These weren’t policy differences—they were acts of economic sabotage aimed squarely at working-class Americans. Yet through it all, our miners and companies adapted, innovated, and persevered. We modernized our operations, improved environmental performance, and maintained the highest safety standards in the world. The result is an industry that is leaner, cleaner, and more efficient than at any point in its history—and still irreplaceable.

Today, under the leadership of the President who declared America must once again achieve “energy dominance,” there is new hope. His administration has recognized what others denied—that energy security is national security, and that reliable baseload power is not a luxury, but a necessity. Through executive orders supporting domestic production, regulatory reform, and infrastructure investment, this President has reaffirmed coal’s rightful place as part of America’s energy future. He understands that we cannot remain a free and prosperous nation if we surrender our energy independence to the whims of global markets or the control of foreign adversaries.

But executive orders alone are not enough. For this revival to last, Congress must act. Lawmakers must codify the President’s energy and regulatory reforms into permanent law—ensuring that no future administration can again use the regulatory system as a political weapon. They must reaffirm coal’s vital role in America’s energy mix, support investment in advanced coal technologies, and defend the workers and communities that have given this country more than a century of service.

That’s why the coal industry is organizing for the future. The formation of America’s Coal Associations, an alliance of the nation’s state-level coal organizations, represents a new era of cooperation and collective strength. Working together, this coalition will serve as a united voice for the coal industry and the millions of Americans who depend on it. Partnering with the Friends of Coal, a grassroots movement that has energized support across coalfield communities, this alliance will ensure that the message of coal’s importance is heard—in every statehouse, every newsroom, and every congressional office in the nation.

Our mission is simple: to preserve and strengthen America’s coal industry so that our nation can remain strong, self-sufficient, and free. We know what happens when energy becomes a weapon—when power grids fail, when factories close, when nations become dependent on others for their most basic needs. America cannot afford that fate.

The stakes are nothing less than our economic future. Without coal, energy prices rise, manufacturing declines, and the dream of energy independence collapses. With coal, America leads. We maintain balance in the marketplace, stability in our grid, and prosperity in our communities. We can—and must—build an energy future rooted not in ideology, but in reality.

To our miners and their families, to our communities and our allies across the nation, I say this: the fight for coal’s future is the fight for America’s future. Our industry has stood the test of time, and with unity and purpose, it will continue to stand. But we must speak with one voice, act with one will, and demand that our leaders in Washington do their part. Codify the President’s actions. Reinforce the laws that protect American energy. And never again allow foreign dependence or political fashion to dictate the course of our energy destiny.

Coal built this nation. It powered its rise, armed its defenders, and fueled its freedom. And if we have the wisdom to stand together—to lead together—it will power its renewal.

Chris Hamilton is President and Chief Executive Officer of the West Virginia Coal Association. He is a leading voice for America’s energy and manufacturing industries and a lifelong advocate for the nation’s coal miners and coalfield communities.
