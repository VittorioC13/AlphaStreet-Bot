MONROE, Mich., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- La-Z-Boy Incorporated (NYSE: LZB), a global leader in the retail and manufacture of residential furniture, today reported second quarter results for the period ended October 25, 2025. For the quarter, sales totaled $522 million, up slightly against the prior year comparable period, reflecting growth in Retail and Wholesale segments, offset by a decline in Joybird sales. Operating margin was 6.9% for the quarter on a GAAP basis and 7.1% on an adjusted(1) basis. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.70 on a GAAP basis and $0.71 on an adjusted(1) basis.

Second quarter total written sales for the Retail segment (company-owned La-Z-Boy stores) grew 4% versus a year ago and written same-store sales (which exclude the impact of both newly opened stores and newly acquired stores) were down 2%. This represents a continued sequential improvement in written same-store sales trends over the last two quarters against a challenging consumer and macroeconomic environment.

Melinda D. Whittington, Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We were pleased to deliver modest sales growth, particularly in our Wholesale segment where we also again delivered margin expansion, continuing to create our own momentum in what remains a choppy landscape. We are investing in the business for the long term, as highlighted by the opening of 15 new company-owned stores in the last 12 months and the advancement of our distribution and home delivery transformation project. Furthermore, in the beginning of our third quarter, we completed the previously announced acquisition of a 15-store network in the southeast U.S. region. Our Century Vision strategy to grow our Retail store footprint and expand brand reach is working and positions us to disproportionately benefit when overall industry volumes rebound.”

Whittington added, “In addition to investing in our core, vertically integrated North American upholstery business, we are proactively taking steps to optimize our portfolio. We have announced plans to exit our non-core wholesale casegoods and upholstery businesses in the back half of the fiscal year, announced the proposed closure of our U.K. manufacturing facility, and strategically realigned our commercial leadership and corporate staffing to enhance operating efficiency. On top of this, leveraging our North American manufacturing base with ~90% of finished goods produced in the U.S., we are successfully navigating the current trade and tariff volatility. Our iconic brand, well positioned manufacturing base, strong balance sheet, and talented team provide the foundation for continued growth and margin expansion.”

Third Quarter Outlook :

Taylor Luebke, SVP and Chief Financial Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We expect fiscal third quarter sales to be in the range of $525-545 million (growth of 1-4% year-over-year) and adjusted operating margin(2) to be in the range of 5.0-6.5%, reflecting advancement of our Century Vision initiatives, friction costs related to portfolio and supply chain optimizations, and a measured view on the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.”

Fiscal 2026 Second Quarter Results versus Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter :

Consolidated GAAP operating margin was 6.9% versus 7.4% Consolidated adjusted (1) operating margin was 7.1% versus 7.5% last year, with change due to deleverage in Retail delivered same-store sales and investment in new stores, partially offset by 110 basis point benefit of lower warranty expense due to a change in our dealer warranty arrangements during the quarter

Sales: Written sales for the Retail segment (company-owned La-Z-Boy stores) increased 4% compared to the year ago period driven by new and acquired stores Written same-store sales decreased 2%, a sequential improvement versus the last two quarters, as lower traffic and conversion were partially offset by higher average ticket and design sales Delivered sales increased slightly to $222 million

Sales: Sales increased 2% to $369 million versus last year, driven by growth in our core North America La-Z-Boy branded wholesale business

Operating Margin: GAAP operating margin was 7.9% versus 6.7% Adjusted (1) operating margin was 8.1% versus 6.8%, with improvement driven by 160 basis point benefit of lower warranty expense due to a change in our dealer warranty arrangements during the quarter, partially offset by incremental expenses related to our distribution and home delivery transformation and increased advertising expenses

Corporate & Other:

Joybird written sales increased 1%, improving sequentially from last two quarters, and driven by strength in retail store performance

Joybird delivered sales decreased 10% to $35 million primarily due to lower delivered volume

[TITLE]Neobanks Push Beyond Interchange to Build Full-Service Platforms:
[TEXT]
Owning banks or partnering with them is becoming central to scaling diversified and compliant financial models.

Earnings season has made one trend abundantly clear: the neobank is evolving.

What began as a digitally native model built on debit cards and simple spending apps has become something more complex, more regulated, and, increasingly, more sustainable. The models, underpinned by platforms, are enabling broad suites of products that include deposits, lending, premium subscriptions, balance sheet banking, and full retail payments networks.

What a Neobank Is Today

At its essence, the neobank is a digital-only financial institution that offers consumer or business banking services without physical branches, often through a partner bank that provides insured deposits and regulatory footing. PYMNTS’ long-running coverage of digital banking has emphasized that neobanks grew quickly because they delivered intuitive apps, instant payments, fee-free accounts, and card-driven spending experiences.

But as the industry matured, interchange alone could not support the cost of customer acquisition, compliance and ongoing product innovation. That pressure pushed neobanks toward more diversified revenue streams.

In Europe, Monzo and Revolut show how the earliest neobanks built scale, then expanded beyond interchange because card economics were capped. Both firms grew by offering fee-free accounts and instant spending alerts. But EU interchange limits restricted how much they could earn per transaction.

That is why both shifted early into broader product suites. Monzo expanded into overdrafts, savings and subscription accounts such as Monzo Plus and Monzo Premium, which PYMNTS has covered even as far back before the pandemic as key contributors to recurring revenue. Revolut built out foreign exchange, wealth, business banking, and a tiered subscription model that PYMNTS reported has become one of its most important revenue (and profit) engines.

Diversification is not optional. It is structural.

Klarna’s New Neobank Ambition

Klarna’s Q3 2025 earnings reinforced that shift. The company reported strong results driven by U.S. revenue, fair financing growth and expanding product lines, as we reported on Tuesday in the wake of the announcement. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski used the call to describe Klarna’s evolution into a full neobank supported by a global retail payments network. His language underscored a model rooted in customer trust and data-rich experiences. He also highlighted Klarna’s ambition to “give people back time,” “give people back money” and “give back them control.”

Klarna’s revenue mix now spans merchant fees from its checkout network, interest income from fair financing, card economics via the Klarna Card, and value-added services such as price comparison and package tracking. Its network scale also gives it SKU-level data across a majority of transactions, a differentiator highlighted in earnings. This puts Klarna at the intersection of payments, banking, credit and commerce.

SoFi’s Hybrid Model

In the U.S., SoFi represents a different but equally important direction: the neobank with an owned bank at its core. After acquiring Golden Pacific Bank, SoFi gained the ability to gather low-cost deposits, issue loans directly, and earn net interest income. PYMNTS has reported that SoFi’s deposit-led funding model now supports lending economics closer to those of a traditional bank even amid the branching out. Payments and checking accounts draw users in, but lending and investing generate margin and deepen relationships. That dynamic shows how a charter can convert a spending app into a full-service financial institution. In its latest quarter, and as reported here, management noted that SoFi card and deposit spend totaled nearly $20 billion in annualized transactions, up 55% year over year.

LendingClub and the Bank Ownership Playbook

LendingClub shows another path: buying a bank outright. Its acquisition of Radius Bank created a fully regulated structure allowing it to hold deposits, fund loans internally, and blend marketplace revenue with balance sheet interest income. This shift stabilized revenue and allowed LendingClub to reduce dependency on external loan buyers. In LendingClub’s third quarter, management stated that the LevelUp savings product had logged $3 billion in balances, and represented the bulk of deposit growth thus far into 2025.

Across several of these players, a common pattern emerges. Payments remain the gateway product: users

[TITLE]Home Depot Says Focus on B2B Fails to Boost Results:
[TEXT]
Home Depot was forced to revise its full fiscal 2025 outlook, signaling severe pressure on profitability despite a shift toward B2B and wholesale audiences.

The company’s modest top-line growth was largely masked by the GMS Inc. acquisition, indicating core organic sales growth is near-stalling and well below expectations.

When it comes to consumer and corporate confidence, the bellwethers are increasingly ringing the alarm.

[TITLE]EU Moves to End Duty-free Small Parcels, Targeting Ultra-fast Fashion Players Shein and Temu:
[TEXT]
PARIS – The European Union is moving up its timeline to close the loophole that has fueled the rapid rise of ultra-fast fashion Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Shein and Temu.

European finance ministers from the 27 countries that comprise the EU approved an agreement to abolish the exemption on packages valued at less than 150 euros, to be implemented as early as the first quarter of 2026 — two years ahead of schedule.

The new rules will also see packages subject to additional handling and import charges, though the amount of the additional fees has not been determined.

The move comes as France has been pushing for stronger action against the platforms, and against the backdrop of a furor over Shein opening its first physical retail store in Paris.

It echoes the U.S. move to roll back its own de minimis allowance, aimed at curbing the flow of ultra-cheap Chinese imports, which went into effect in May.

More than 12 million packages a day flowed into Europe in 2024, with 90 percent originating in China. The number of Chinese imports to Europe has jumped 7.3 percent in the first nine months of 2025 alone.

France pushed to speed up the implementation of import fees, arguing that the flood of goods was overwhelming customs systems, resulting in undervaluation of products and widespread noncompliance with European safety rules.

Other countries had also pressed to move up the timetable, as the flood of goods has caused unfair competition and destabilized several industries.

“Recent events have shown that the issue of e-commerce platforms is an important issue of competitiveness and consumer protection,” French finance minister Roland Lescure told AFP ahead of the vote.

The EU had previously planned to eliminate the exemption and enforce additional measures on Chinese packages in mid-2028 as part of an overall reform and harmonization of customs across the board. But growing political pressure, particularly from the retail, fashion and consumer goods sectors, pushed lawmakers to speed up that deadline.

Once implemented, every low-value package entering the bloc would be subject to a customs charge. The European Commission has proposed a flat-rate duty, while France is lobbying for a fixed fee of around 5 euros per parcel, arguing that Chinese exporters frequently declare inaccurately low values. A separate EU-wide 2 euro handling fee is also under discussion.

Shein and Temu, both of which rely on high-volume, low-value shipments dispatched directly from Chinese factories to European consumers, would be impacted. Shein in particular has been under fire in France since announcing it would open its first physical store inside the legacy department store BHV.

Last week’s opening drew protestors and politicians speaking out against the company, in part for its high-volume, low-cost model, as well as a scandal in which sex dolls resembling children were being sold on its marketplace. BHV has seen an exodus of brands, including Agnès B., Rivedroite and the SMCP stable of brands, from its aisles as upmarket labels do not want to be associated with Shein’s pricing and model.

However, consumers don’t seem to mind, with BHV reporting more than 50,000 customers in the first five days. Still, BHV parent company Société des Grands Magasins has pushed back Shein’s planned openings in five regional stores by several days or weeks.

SGM said the delay is intended to refine the concept rather than cancel it, and unrelated to the controversy. The company said that due to demand, it is working with Shein on larger, more suitable spaces to avoid disappointing customers and ensure stronger execution when Shein rolls out in additional cities.

Following the uproar, French authorities launched proceedings to suspend Shein’s online sales over product-safety concerns, and to open and inspect every package coming into the country.

Representatives for Shein did not comment on the EU proposal.

There are other national laws proposed in Italy and Romania. The EU-wide measure is expected to be submitted for approval at the next finance ministers’ council on Dec. 12.

[TITLE]Why Bigger Isn't Necessarily Better For India’s Public Sector Banks — In This Economy:
[TEXT]
India saw its retail inflation drop to an all-time low of 0.25% in October. This was supported by sharp deflation in vegetable prices, weak prices of cereals and pulses, and a large base effect coming into play. Economists believe that a large uptick in gold prices aside, India was already seeing trends of price rise turning negative. Wholesale-price indexed inflation too was in the negative zone at -1.2%, compared with 0.1% in September. The next logical question is if the central bank will take the lead and cut rates next month. Economists say the call is not so easy to predict. Gross domestic product growth is expected to continue to push 7% levels, which go against the case for a rapid rate cut. Soumyakanti Ghosh of SBI Research believes that an inflation-targeting central bank's job is to first cut when inflation dips. We'll keep a close watch over what happens in December.

On to this week's newsletter!

Do Public Sector Banks Need Consolidation?

While addressing the audience at an event in Mumbai on Nov. 6, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government is in talks with the RBI and banks to create large, world-class banks. The FM's comments came amidst a lot of source-based reporting which suggested that a plan was being put in place to merge state-owned banks in India.

If materialised, this would be the second major consolidation exercise in recent years, with the last one being concluded in 2020. At that time, 26 public sector banks were cut to 11, with large mergers such as Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank. Other mergers included Punjab National Bank, United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce; Union Bank of India, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank and Indian Bank with Allahabad Bank.

One could argue that these banks have actually had a decent run since the massive merger spree. The Covid-19 period gave them a major liquidity boost and the resultant retail finance boom put these lenders on an even stronger footing. The RBI's timely intervention on unsecured credit further boosted the case for public sector banks, as their private peers had to quickly pivot to a secured credit model.

But the question is if they need that same treatment now. The main argument in favour of it is that India needs large, world-class banks. This is yet to truly materialise. State Bank of India, the largest of all banks in India, reached the Rs 100 trillion business-mark only in the September quarter of this fiscal. The next two large banks in line are both private sector lenders, which are significantly smaller.

Public sector banks are still in their growth phase, with cleaner balance sheets and more effective strategies. Burdening the management with merger work may not be the most effective use of resources for now.

For all the talk of India's massive credit market potential, the one fact that banks have realised is that the addressable market might be much smaller. Yes, more people are now in organised work, there is more digital data available now than at any point in the last decade, we also have incredibly better digital finance options now. But still, most of India's prestigious lenders lend to the same set of borrowers. The pie has definitely grown, but mostly in the crusty bits where the biggest lenders don't really want to splurge.

The other major issue with this merger strategy is controls.

Are India's banking laws and regulations ready to handle multiple super-banks? Currently, India's systemically important banks list has remained unchanged with only the top three featuring in it. With the creation of these world class, supersized banks, that list may need to change. With them comes the need for tighter supervision and improved monitoring.

Food for thought.

Feature Five

- First tranche of the India-US trade deal is nearing closure now, Rishabh reports.

- Noida-based Signodrive to deploy 4,000 Gensol EVs across Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru — Agnidev's newsbreak confirmed.

- Since Sunday, Mumbai has seen severe disruption in the supply of compressed natural gas owing to damage to a key gas pipeline

- Mahanagar Gas Ltd's Ashu Singhal tells Soumeet Sarkar that the disrupted CNG supply would be restored by Tuesday.

- Anil Ambani has skipped summons from the Enforcement Directorate a second time. The first time around, the ED had rejected his plea to appear through video conferencing, Shrimi reports

Caught My Eye

SS Rajamouli has found himself at the receiving end of the ire of his more god-fearing audiences. A self-professed atheist himself, Rajamouli was annoyed with the tech glitches at a teaser launch event for his next mega movie, Varanasi. While talking to the people at the event, he made some references to Hanuman, which eventually irked a lot of people on the internet. And as expected, this went very poorly for the ace director.

[TITLE]Sustainable Business and Finance: Finance heads urge maturity on ‘woke banking’ debate:
[TEXT]
The committee is due to report back on New Zealand First’s Financial Markets (Conduct of Institutions) Amendment (Duty to Provide) Amendment Bill, dubbed the “woke banking” bill, on November 21.

The bill targets banking policies around ESG – environmental, social and governance policies - which guide how banks manage risks and opportunities beyond basic profit and loss.

The legislation seeks to ensure no New Zealand business is denied bank services unless the decision is based in law. Its supporters say it will prevent ESG standards from drawing on “woke ideology” in the banking sector.

Coalition Government partner Act has also called for the end of “banking wokery” and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is reported to support the bill’s aims, saying it was unacceptable for petrol businesses and mines to be denied banking services due to banks’ citing climate change goals.

Critics of the bill note that internationally, financial institutions are increasingly aligning lending with ESG criteria. Globally, more than US$2 trillion was deployed into green and transition finance in 2024 alone.

They argue that making banks invest in carbon-emitting industries introduces financial risk. If those assets lose value, it is irresponsible lending.

Meanwhile in Brazil, the UN climate conference is meeting without the United States - the world’s top oil producer and second biggest greenhouse gas emitter - whose climate-sceptic president supports the fossil fuels industry and derides renewable energy.

It’s all regrettable “noise” for the Centre for Sustainable Finance (CSF), an independent charitable trust that works across the financial system to align financial markets’ settings and initiatives with long-term resilience.

“It’s actually been a pretty hostile environment, and what we’re seeing is that it’s driving a bit of wariness among financial institutions

[TITLE]Fashion prepares for challenging year ahead: BoF, McKinsey:
[TEXT]
Research

Despite the challenges, one in four leaders anticipate improvement, up from last year’s 20 percent. Image courtesy of Business of Fashion

The global fashion industry is bracing for a difficult 2026.

Delivered on Nov. 17, new research from consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and The Business of Fashion (BoF) confirms that trade disruptions, geopolitical tensions and sliding consumer sentiment are the biggest challenges for the industry, according to the State of Fashion 2026, the tenth annual report from the duo. Nearly half of industry leaders expect conditions to deteriorate next year, a sharp rise from a year ago, and 78 percent view declining consumer confidence as the sector’s most significant challenge.

“Fashion’s old playbook no longer applies,” said Imran Amed, founder and chief executive officer of The Business of Fashion, in a statement.

“Tariffs, technology and new consumer priorities are forcing a fundamental reset,” Mr. Amed said. “The State of Fashion 2026 challenges leaders to act with urgency — to rewire their organisations for agility, embed AI at the core of how they operate and reconnect with customers who are redefining what value really means.”

Global overview

With a decade marked by constant change, fashion executives have accepted the volatility and have come to replace the usage of the word “uncertainty” with “challenging.”

With global fashion markets expected to grow only in the low single digits, competition for market share will intensify. Europe is forecasted to expand by 1 to 2 percent, while the United States and China are projected to grow between 1 to 3 percent.

The slew of recent creative director appointments (see story) may bolster luxury brands, though mid-market brands have overtaken luxury as the industry’s “main value creator in 2024.”

However, brands across all price points are feeling the pressure from consumers who are scaling back their spending. Yet, 31 percent of shoppers admit to a willingness to “splurge on fashion if it is the right product.”

Despite the challenges, one in four leaders anticipate improvement, up from last year’s 20 percent. Areas generating optimism include jewelry, wearable tech in the form of eyewear and the resale market.

“In this context, jewelry becomes a medium for everyday expression, even when the economy is troubled,” said Alexis Nasard, CEO of Swarovski, in a statement.

“Jewelry is ultimate discretionary spending, but in markets like the U.S., as long as consumers have some money to spare and the value proposition resonates, they will spend.”

With the implementation of the U.S. tariffs in 2025, 76 percent of executives expect increased trade friction and rising duties to heavily influence the industry next year. Price increases are planned across markets, especially in North America, where nearly half of all leaders expect to raise prices by more than 5 percent.

“We are taking some surgical and targeted pricing [increases], as probably most apparel or retailers are,” said Michelle Gass, CEO of Levi’s, in a statement.

“There’s only so much you can absorb from the tariffs, because they’re just very high.”

Harnessing tech

Technology, particularly generative artificial intelligence, is emerging as the industry’s most significant opportunity, as consumers develop trust for the tools, with 23 percent admitting to utilizing AI to discover new products.

With the increase in consumer search, companies are implementing software such as geneartive engine optimization (GEO).

GEO optimizes online content for AI, making products and content easier for AI to read and will work alongside SEO. The acceleration of AI-discovery is enhanced by consumers' reported trust of generative AI search results, with 41 percent saying they prefer AI search to traditional advertising.

Smart glasses are poised for breakout growth, with analysts expecting sales to quadruple in 2026 and for the category to exceed $30 billion by 2030.

Most recently, French luxury conglomerate Kering announced a partnership with Google for the development of smart frames (see story). Meanwhile, Italian eyewear conglomerate EssilorLuxottica acquired Belgium-based Automation & Robotics to aid in its production capabilities this summer (see story) after extending its smart frame development deal with Meta last year (see story).

The broader wearable market is expected to grow

[TITLE]Govt withdraws BIS norms on polyester chain, polymers; user industry cites relief on costs for MSMEs:
[TEXT]
The Centre has withdrawn quality control orders (QCOs) on a wide range of polyester and petrochemical inputs, in a move that spells relief for user industries such as apparel and footwear, while raising competition from imports for local manufacturers of these key inputs.

QCOs issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) subject manufacturers and importers of specific goods to certain standards. While they ensure greater quality, they also raise costs, which cascade down to industries which use these raw materials.

The order from the department of chemicals and petrochemicals comes after a Niti Aayog committee led by former cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba recommended relaxing QCOs. These orders raise costs for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which import them in large quantities.

While the withdrawal will make raw materials accessible for makers of textiles and PVC products, it may impact manufacturers such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and the Aditya Birla Group companies Grasim and Thai Acrylic Fibre.

Queries sent to Indian Oil and the Aditya Birla Group remained unanswered till press time.

Reliance has always priced its products keeping the long-term growth of textile industry in mind, a company spokesperson said in an email. "This has been our philosophy from the from the day we started manufacturing products & polyester and integrated backwards. We welcome the decision of the government, and we will continue to stay competitive offering the best quality products to the downstream industry for domestic and value-added export market."

The withdrawal of QCOs fulfils an MSME industry wish, significantly benefiting textile makers, said Rahul Mehta, chief mentor of the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India. However, it also goes against the government's original plan to expand the ambit of QCOs to cover more products.

The raw materials now free of QCOs are used to make man-made fibres, plastics, packaging, footwear, consumer goods, appliances and automotive components. Several of them such as PTA, MEG, polypropylene, PVC and ABS are among India’s most critical chemical imports, sourced from China, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Thailand and Singapore. Products like polyester staple fibre, POY and FDY also rely on imports during periods of domestic shortage, particularly from China and Indonesia.

Welcome decision

Just last week, the Chemicals and Petrochemicals Manufacturers Association had written to the government, making a strong case for QCOs. While industries abroad benefitted from state subsidies, India's QCOs helped counter them, the association had said. On Thursday, the association did not respond to a query

[TITLE]Australia $2.25 Bn Athletic Footwear Market Trends, Competitive Landscape, Forecasts & Opportunities, 2020-2024 & 2025-2030F:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Australia Athletic Footwear Market by Region, Competition, Forecast & Opportunities, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Australia Athletic Footwear Market was valued at USD 1.61 Billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 2.25 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 5.80%.

The Australian athletic footwear market is experiencing robust growth, driven by increasing health consciousness, rising participation in sports and fitness activities, and the growing influence of athleisure trends. Consumers are prioritizing comfort, performance, and sustainability, with eco-friendly footwear gaining significant traction as brands like Adidas (Primegreen) and Nike (Space Hippie) introduce shoes made from recycled materials.

The market is also witnessing a surge in demand for specialized footwear, such as maximalist running shoes (e.g., Hoka One One) and versatile cross-trainers, catering to diverse fitness routines. E-commerce expansion and direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales channels are reshaping purchasing behaviors, with brands leveraging digital platforms for personalized shopping experiences.

Additionally, collaborations between athletic brands and celebrities or designers (e.g., Puma x Rihanna) are fueling fashion-driven demand. The children's segment is growing due to heightened focus on youth sports, while women's athletic footwear is benefiting from inclusive designs and style innovations. Technological advancements, including 3D printing and smart footwear with embedded sensors, are emerging as key differentiators.

Despite the dominance of global players like Nike and Adidas, local brands such as Frankie4 are carving niches in comfort and orthopedic segments. Inflation and supply chain disruptions pose challenges, but the market remains resilient, supported by Australia's strong fitness culture and the rising popularity of outdoor activities like hiking and trail running. Overall, the industry is poised for sustained growth, blending performance, sustainability, and lifestyle appeal to meet evolving consumer preferences.

Key Market Drivers

Rising Health and Fitness Awareness

The growing emphasis on health and wellness is a major driver of the Australian athletic footwear market. 70% of Australians aged 15+ participate in sports or physical activity at least once a week (Australian Sports Commission, 2024). With increasing obesity rates and government initiatives promoting active lifestyles, more Australians are engaging in sports, gym workouts, and outdoor activities.

Running, in particular, has seen a surge in popularity, supported by events like the Sydney Marathon and parkrun communities. The demand for performance-oriented footwear - such as cushioned running shoes (e.g., ASICS Gel-Kayano), cross-training shoes (e.g., Nike Metcon), and hiking boots - has risen significantly. Additionally, the post-pandemic shift toward home fitness has boosted sales of versatile athletic shoes suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Brands are capitalizing on this trend by offering technologically advanced footwear with features like enhanced shock absorption, breathability, and lightweight designs, catering to both amateur and professional athletes.

Key Market Challenges

Intense Competition and Market Saturation

The Australian athletic footwear market is highly competitive, dominated by global giants like Nike, Adidas, and Puma, alongside emerging local brands. This saturation makes it difficult for smaller players to gain market share, as consumers often favor established brands with strong marketing budgets and celebrity endorsements. Price wars and frequent discounting further squeeze profit margins, particularly for mid-tier and niche brands. Additionally, the rise of direct-to-consumer (DTC) models and e-commerce platforms has lowered barriers to entry, flooding the market with options and making brand differentiation increasingly challenging. Companies must continuously innovate in design, technology, and sustainability to stand out, which raises R&D costs and operational pressures.

Key Market Trends

Personalization and Customization

The demand for personalized athletic footwear is surging in Australia, driven by consumers seeking unique products tailored to their preferences. Brands like Nike and Adidas now offer customization platforms (e.g., Nike By You) that allow buyers to select colors, materials, and even performance features like cushioning levels. This trend extends beyond aesthetics - 3D foot scanning technology in retail stores enables precise fitting, reducing discomfort and injury risks.

Local startups are also entering the space, offering bespoke orthotic-friendly designs for niche segments like runners with specific gait needs. The rise of digital design tools and on-demand manufacturing further supports this shift, enabling brands to deliver one-of-a-kind products while minimizing overproduction waste. As consumers increasingly value individuality and performance optimization, personalization is becoming a key differentiator in the competitive athletic footwear market.

[TITLE]Longevity-Focused Health Fueling U.S. Anti-Aging Products Market Projected to Reach $27 Billion By 2033:
[TEXT]
MarketNewsUpdates News Commentary

NEW YORK, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The advance anti-aging therapies market is expanding quickly fueled by a larger senior population and increased consumer focus on preventive and longevity-focused health. A report from Grand View Research said that the U.S. anti-aging products market size was USD 14.05 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 27.44 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 8.0% from 2025 to 2033. Globally, the anti-aging market is forecasted to surpass $421.4 billion in revenue by 2030 with a compound annual growth rate of 8.1%, per data from a report by P&S Intelligence. The market is driven by an increasing demand for high-performance skincare solutions that offer visible, long-term results. Consumers are particularly focused on products that target fine lines, wrinkles, and skin elasticity, with a growing interest in advanced formulations that combine anti-aging benefits with overall skin health.

The license agreement, effective immediately, grants Klothonova exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize Klothea Bio’s proprietary Klotho producing cells, encapsulated using Austrianova’s proprietary Cell-in-a-Box® technology, for the treatment of diseases and conditions in humans and animals.

Under the agreement, Klothonova will leverage this technology in conjunction with Austrianova’s proprietary Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation platform to encapsulate Klothea’s genetically modified cell line that overexpresses Klotho proteins. This aims to create encapsulated, implantable therapies capable of sustained, localized delivery, enhancing safety and efficacy for applications in regenerative medicine and disease prevention.

“This license represents a pivotal milestone for Klothonova and underscores Avant’s commitment to transforming biotech innovation into real-world impact,” said Avant Technologies CEO, Chris Winter. “By combining Klothea’s cutting-edge Klotho expertise with our joint venture’s advanced cell encapsulation technology, we’re poised to pioneer therapies that could redefine healthy aging and extend quality of life for millions.”

The Field of Use encompasses the treatment of a wide array of diseases and conditions, enabling Klothonova to pursue comprehensive development programs from preclinical research through commercialization. Key terms in the agreement include milestone payments tied to development and regulatory achievements, as well as royalties on net sales, ensuring aligned incentives for rapid advancement.

This agreement builds on the September 2025 formation of Klothonova as a joint venture between Avant Technologies and Austrianova, which was established to focus on Klotho-based cell therapies. Since its launch in October 2025, Klothonova has initiated the preparatory work needed for GMP-manufacturing of the encapsulated Klotho-overexpressing cell line, with plans to advance into IND-enabling studies in the coming year.

Results were shared in a late-breaking oral presentation at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

“These longer-term data showed a consistent and durable reduction in TTR and stability or improvement in multiple markers of cardiomyopathy following a single dose of nex-z,” said Intellia President and Chief Executive Officer John Leonard, M.D. “It’s remarkable that even in patients with advanced heart failure, a population that declines rapidly, disease stabilization or improvement was observed out to 24 months in a majority of participants. We look forward to seeing how these data mature in longer-term follow up. In addition, we are working diligently to address the ongoing clinical hold the FDA placed on our MAGNITUDE and MAGNITUDE-2 Phase 3 clinical trials.”

Zymeworks Inc. (NASDAQ: ZYME), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a diverse pipeline of novel, multifunctional biotherapeutics to improve the standard of care for difficult-to-treat diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune disease, recently announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 HERIZON-GEA-01 trial evaluating Ziihera® (zanidatamab-hrii) in combination with chemotherapy, with or without the PD-1 inhibitor Tevimbra® (tislelizumab), as a first-line treatment for HER2-positive (HER2+) locally advanced or metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, including cancers of the stomach, gastroesophageal junction, and esophagus. The results were announced today by Zymeworks’ development and commercialization partners, Jazz Pharmaceuticals (Jazz) and BeOne Medicines (BeOne).

The safety profile of Ziihera in combination with chemotherapy, with or without Tevimbra, was generally consistent with the known safety profile of each agent with no new safety signals observed in the two investigational combination arms, and supports the overall benefit-risk of Ziihera for use in this indication.

[TITLE]Europe Tea Market Analysis Report 2025-2033: Trends, Shares, Value Chain, SWOT, Pricing Benchmark, and Key Players:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Europe Tea Market Analysis and Growth Forecast 2025-2033" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Europe Tea Market is anticipated to grow from US$ 20 billion in 2024 to US$ 33.71 billion by 2033 at a CAGR of 5.97% from 2025 to 2033. Growing health consciousness, demand for specialty and herbal teas, and changing consumer tastes towards organic products are fueling market expansion throughout the region, complemented by robust retail and e-commerce distribution networks.

Growth Drivers in the Europe Tea Market

Increased Health and Wellness Awareness

European consumers are increasingly substituting tea for sugary drinks and coffee as a healthier option. Green tea, herbal teas, and functional teas (which contain ingredients such as turmeric or ginger) are becoming sought after for their antioxidant, cleansing, and soothing virtues. As interest grows in immune well-being and mental health, demand for organic and wellness-focused tea products has accelerated, particularly since COVID-19, transforming consumption behaviors throughout the region. March 2024, Twinings launched a line of functional tea blends specially crafted for the European market, featuring distinctive botanical ingredients and wellbeing benefits.

Growth in Specialty and Premium Tea

The tea market in Europe is being driven by growth in specialty blends, luxury teas, and artisanal products. Consumers are trying new tastes, single-origin teas, and responsibly sourced varieties, stimulating innovation among companies. Boutique tea houses, experience-based store formats, and edited subscription boxes are raising tea from an ordinary drink to an aspirational product. The premiumization movement has widened appeal across younger, more upscale audiences. January 2024, Unilever PLC introduced a new range of premium organic teas appealing to health-focused consumers, with innovative eco-friendly packaging.

Development of E-commerce and Digital Retail Channels

Online tea sales have seen high growth in Europe as a result of convenience, wider product range, and social media. Internet platforms enable access to niche and international brands that might be lacking in physical retail. Subscription models and wellness influencers also play a part in product finding and interaction, enabling tea businesses to create direct customer relationships and tailor offers. For instance, in the UK, tea sales online became extremely popular, with investment increasing by 70% in 2022, according to the British E-commerce Association. One of the main forces driving this sector's high growth is the increasing focus on digital accessibility and subscription services.

Challenges in the Europe Tea Market

Market Saturation and Intense Competition

The European tea industry is mature and competitive, especially in Western Europe. There are many local and international brands competing for consumers' attention, triggering price pressure and constrained shelf space. Innovation assists but is challenging for new brands to make headway without massive marketing spend. Mature tea-consuming nations such as the UK experience levelling-off growth, with brands needing to differentiate via health messages, taste, or ethical origin.

Fluctuating Raw Material Costs and Climate Impact

Tea production is greatly dependent on climatic factors. Erratic weather conditions, floods, and droughts in key tea-producing countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Kenya may impact supply chains and raise costs. These uncertainties impact price and supply in Europe. Also, increased transportation and energy costs, along with sustainability issues, pose difficulties for producers and importers in keeping the producers profitable without sacrificing quality or ethical sourcing practices.
