[TEXT]
South Korea's Kospi hit a record high for the third straight day Friday, as trade talks continued with the U.S., bucking wider losses in Asia.

The Kospi touched an intraday high of 3,794.87 before giving up its gains to trade around the flatline. The index closed marginally up, at 3,748.89.

Meanwhile, the small-cap Kosdaq fell 0.68% to end at 859.54.

Other Asia-Pacific markets traded weaker, tracking losses on Wall Street as fears over the banking sector and trade tensions intensified.

Shares of regional banks and investment bank Jefferies tumbled Thursday stateside as fears mounted around some bad loans lurking in the U.S.

[TITLE]CNBC's The China Connection newsletter: Beijing gears up for a big strategy meeting as tensions with Washington deepen:

While tensions flare with the U.S., China is charting its course for the next five years.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and the country's top leaders, known as the Central Committee, will meet next week from Monday to Thursday for a planning meeting called the "Fourth Plenum."

The gathering reminds the U.S. government, on the verge of possibly its longest shutdown in history, that China is a big believer in planning. Beijing has held the strategy-setting meeting twice every decade since the 1950s to rally the country around specific social and economic goals.

This year, China has promoted its achievements under the "14th five-year plan" despite U.S. pressure on tech and trade.

The upcoming "15th five-year plan" is particularly critical as China has laid out even longer-term ambitions for 2035, said Zong Liang, former chief researcher at the Bank of China. By then, China aims to boost per capita gross domestic product to the mid-range of developed countries, while achieving "major breakthroughs" in core technologies.

But that's getting ahead of the immediate challenges that policymakers will discuss next week: navigating increased U.S. tech restrictions, the possibility of a 100% tariff hike and lackluster domestic demand.

Rather than announce sweeping changes, Beijing is likely to double down on "reforms" to boost domestic demand — from reducing regional business barriers within China to expanding visa access, Zong said.

Following a recent ramp-up of support for high-tech industries, Beijing will likely pledge more support for homegrown semiconductors, artificial intelligence and humanoid robots. Full details aren't expected until the annual parliamentary meeting in March 2026, although a readout of next week's meeting should offer an early look at the exact priorities.

"The technology part of the [plan] should focus on two things: AI, where the adoption rate in key areas is required to reach 90% by 2030; and basic scientific research, which remains some way off the official target," Tianchen Xu, senior economist for Asia for the Economist Intelligence Unit, said in a note.

At a time when the U.S. is scaling back on its climate commitments, China has the next five years to make good on its pledge to start reducing carbon emissions after 2030.

So far, China is falling behind in its aim to reduce its emissions rate, Xu said. "We think that achieving this goal is still possible, but would require more concerted efforts on power market reform, and the weeding out of emission-intensive industries."
