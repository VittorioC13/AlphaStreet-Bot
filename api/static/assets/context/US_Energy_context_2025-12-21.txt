[TITLE]Ontario, New York announce nuclear energy agreement:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by AI-based technology. Mispronunciations can occur. We are working with our partners to continually review and improve the results.

Ontario has signed a memorandum of understanding with New York to help the state develop nuclear technologies to meet growing energy demand and strengthen reliability and decarbonization in both jurisdictions.

The new memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishes a deal between New York Power Authority (NYPA) and Ontario Power Generation (OPG) to collaborate on advancing nuclear energy technologies, including small modular reactors (SMRs) — which Ontario is currently building — and large-scale nuclear facilities, the province said in a release.

Announcing the agreement with New York Governor Kathy Hochul at a news conference in Buffalo Friday, Ford said Ontario currently has enough nuclear electricity to power 16 million homes, and more will be coming online in the coming years.

“Ontario is building the first small modular reactors in the G7 and we're leading the way at [the] Darlington site,” he said. “We invite you to share the technology.”

WATCH | The hype behind Canada's investment in nuclear SMRs: Small nuclear reactors: Why Canada is investing billions | Duration 7:06 Small modular nuclear reactors are being touted as a key piece of the future of clean energy and construction is now underway in Ontario on the first of its kind in the G7. For The National, CBC’s Susan Ormiston breaks down what’s behind the hype and why some say Canada should proceed with caution.

Under the new MOU, NYPA and OPG will share expertise and resources on technological innovation, financing and developing facilities, and training a workforce to build and operate nuclear infrastructure on both sides of the border, according to the provincial release.

New York and Ontario will also look at trade opportunities for electricity to improve power reliability and reduce emissions.

Ford praised nuclear energy as a positive method of future electricity production for both neighbours.

“It's safe, number one, it's clean, it's green, it's reliable, and it's cost-affordable for especially the ratepayers here [in New York] and over in Ontario,” he said.

While nuclear-generated electricity doesn't emit carbon, environmental concerns persist around the storage of toxic, nuclear waste, and the potential radiological hazards that have come with past accidents at facilities around the world.

WATCH | Storing nuclear waste in northern Ontario: Why this Ontario town agreed to take Canada’s nuclear waste | Duration 10:03 The northern Ontario community of Ignace has agreed to be the future home of Canada’s nuclear waste. The National’s Nick Purdon went to the region to find out why the majority of people were in favour of the move and see how the toxic materials will be stored deep underground.

Ontario has been investing heavily in nuclear technology recently, refurbishing old facilities and developing new ones.

The province and the Canadian federal government committed earlier this year to spending a collective $3 billion to build Canada’s first SMRs next to Darlington power plant. Construction started this year and the reactors are scheduled to start coming online in 2030. When completed, the four SMRs will produce 1,200 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power 1.2 million homes, Prime Minister Mark Carney said in the fall.

The new cross-border agreement comes as Canada continues to face trade hostility from the United States, something both Hochul and Ford expressed concern over at Friday’s conference. Along with the MOU, the pair also signed a declaration of intent to pledge continued co-operation between Ontario and New York.

“As these threats out of Washington come, we're going to stand firm and let people know who our friends are,” Hochul said.

“Our partnership between New York and Ontario is rock solid, and as long as I'm governor, it's going to stay that way.”

[TITLE]Energy Transfer Suspends LNG Project:
[TEXT]
Energy Transfer LP suspended development of a Louisiana liquefied natural gas export project to concentrate on building and expanding pipelines.

Billionaire Kelcy Warren’s Energy Transfer LP suspended development of a Louisiana liquefied natural gas export project to concentrate on building and expanding pipelines.

The abrupt halt to an LNG complex whose committed customers included energy giants Chevron Corp. and Shell Plc caps a years-long effort to flip an unused gas-import terminal constructed before the advent of the US shale boom.

The decision announced in a statement Thursday signals a shift in the race to secure financing for gas-export projects in the US, already the world’s largest exporter of the fuel. In a separate statement, Energy Transfer announced plans to boost the size of a planned US Southwest gas pipeline to cope with stronger-than-expected demand.

The Dallas-based pipeline company had previously shifted a formal investment decision on the LNG project to next year.

(With contributions from various sources)

Parliament on Thursday passed the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, a landmark law that opens the country's tightly controlled civil nuclear sector to private and foreign investment for the first time since Independence.The Rajya Sabha approved the bill by voice vote, defeating opposition demands to refer it to a standing committee. The Lok Sabha passed it a day earlier. Once the President gives assent, the bill becomes law."It marks a transformational moment for our technology landscape," said Prime Minister Narendra Modi , linking the bill to India’s clean energy ambitions and global leadership in AI and green manufacturing.PM Modi added in his post on X: "My gratitude to MPs who have supported its passage. From safely powering AI to enabling green manufacturing, it delivers a decisive boost to a clean-energy future for the country and the world. It also opens numerous opportunities for the private sector and our youth. This is the ideal time to invest, innovate and build in India!"The SHANTI Bill aims to supercharge India’s clean energy transition. It also enables India to scale from 8.9 GW of nuclear capacity to 100 GW by 2047, requiring investments worth Rs 19.3 trillion ($214 billion), as Bloomberg reported.“This (nuclear energy) will be the most reliable, steady 24x7 source of energy, unlike some other renewable sources,” said Jitendra Singh, minister of state for Atomic Energy, defending the bill in Parliament.At a time when power demand is exploding-driven by industrial growth, data centers, and urban expansion-the bill aims to ensure a firm, carbon-free power source, unlike solar or wind, which are intermittent.This isn’t just

[TITLE]$60 Oil Is No Longer a Floor:
[TEXT]
Brent is clinging to $60 per barrel, but markets have become even less sensitive to geopolitical risk.

Friday, December 19, 2025

Things are not looking good for oil, with Trump’s belligerent rhetoric vis-à-vis Venezuela only pushing ICE Brent futures to $60 per barrel after a slide below that psychological threshold earlier in the week. Sanctions against Russia or threats thereof have by now desensitized the market towards Russian supply risks, once again demonstrated by the lack of price movements after Ukraine targeted another shadow fleet tanker in the Mediterranean. Against this background, oil could easily end the year below $60.

Trump Launches Full Blockade of Venezuela. US President Trump has ordered a 'complete blockade' of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, ratcheting up pressure after the seizure of the Skipper VLCC, even though PDVSA loadings remain around 800,000 b/d so far in December.

Ukraine Strikes Russia’s Shadow Fleet Tanker. Ukrainian drones have struck an Oman-flagged shadow fleet tanker used in Russia’s oil exports in the southern part of the Mediterranean Sea, some 1,250 miles from Ukraine, with the Baltic Sea-bound vessel sustaining critical damage, according to media reports.

Brazil's Upstream Roiled by Petrobras Strike. Brazil's trade union FUP has been gradually extending its strike over retirement fund payments and wage demands, now impacting Petrobras' (NYSE:PBR) offshore oil platforms just as the country's output posted an all-time high of 4.03 million b/d in October.

Pemex Fails to Attract Oil Majors. Mexico's state oil firm Pemex has awarded five of the 11 JV contracts it anticipated to sign, attracting private companies to bolster production at mature oil fields; however, weak bidding and the lack of foreign participation will only allow for an output lift of 75,000 b/d.

Israel Approves Giant Egypt Gas Deal (At Last). The Israeli government has approved a $35 billion natural gas supply deal with Egypt from the Leviathan gas field, initially signed in September, however, held up by Tel Aviv for more than three months over alleged 1979 peace treaty violations by Egypt.

IEA Sees Coal Demand Plateauing in 2025. The International Energy Agency stated that global coal demand has reached a plateau as they expect supply to trend flat around 9.1 billion tonnes, claiming China will curb its consumption of coal from 2026 onwards as it already started to cut back on imports.

US Allows Sakhalin Sales for the Next 6 Months. The US Treasury Department has extended a waiver allowing oil sales from Russia's Sakhalin-2 project through 18 June 2026, a critical move for its Northeast Asian ally Japan as it sources 9% of its LNG needs from the Gazprom-operated project.

BP CEO Resigns as the Major's Succession Collapses. UK oil major BP (NYSE:BP) has announced the abrupt departure of its CEO Murray Auchincloss and the hiring of Meg O'Neill from Woodside Energy as their next chief executive, the first external hire for the post of BP CEO in more than a century.

Mali's Gold Supply Returns to Normal. Canadian miner Barrick Mining has officially resumed operational control over the Loulo-Gounkoto mine in Mali, ending two years of negotiations that saw several arrests and led to Barrick agreeing to a settlement of $430 million under Mali's new mining code.

Lake Charles LNG Hits the Emergency Brake. US midstream giant Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) has suspended the development of its 16.5 mtpa Lake Charles LNG project in Louisiana, saying it would rather 'focus on allocating capital to its backlog of natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects'.

US Passes Bill to Expedite Huge Energy Projects. The US House of Representatives approved a bill this week that would speed up environmental reviews and government permitting for large energy infrastructure projects and data centers, the first notable amendment to the 1969 Nixon-era NEPA Act.

Trump Tightens the Noose Around Iranian Oil. The US Department of Treasury sanctioned another 29 tankers and their management firms for alleged transportation of Iranian petroleum products, taking the total of sanctioned ships to more than 180 since Trump returned to office in January 2025.

Libya's Oil Firms Sell Oil in Defiance of State. Libyan upstream companies have started to sell their crude directly to Western buyers, bypassing the central government and state oil firm NOC, using a Gaddafi-era legal clause that allows ad hoc sales in case they're used to cover 'special funding needs'.

[TITLE]Green Rain Energy Holdings, Inc. (OTC: GREH) Announces Share Reduction, Capital Structure Optimization, Reg A Re-qualification, and Auditor Engagement to Strengthen Long-Term Shareholder Value:
[TEXT]
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Green Rain Energy Holdings, Inc. (“Green Rain” or the “Company”) (OTC: GREH), a clean-energy and EV infrastructure company, today announced a series of strategic corporate actions designed to significantly improve its capital structure, enhance transparency, and position the Company for disciplined growth and long-term shareholder value creation.

Share Cancellation and Authorized Share Reduction

The Company has submitted formal documentation to Pacific Stock Transfer, its transfer agent, requesting the cancellation of 310,000,000 shares of common stock currently held by Maddy’s Legacy LLC, an entity controlled by Company CEO Alfredo Papadakis.

In parallel, Green Rain has submitted documentation to its registered agent, Registered Agents of Wyoming, LLC, to reduce the Company’s authorized common shares to 1.5 billion.

Strategic Rationale

Reducing outstanding and authorized shares directly addresses dilution concerns common among emerging growth companies. Industry data consistently shows that companies with disciplined share structures tend to benefit from:

Improved market perception and credibility

Lower long-term dilution risk

Stronger alignment between management and shareholders

Greater flexibility in future financings

By proactively cancelling insider-held shares and reducing authorized capital, Green Rain is signaling a clear commitment to capital discipline and shareholder alignment.

Regulation A Requalification and Debt Optimization

Green Rain is also working with its securities counsel to re-qualify its Regulation A offering. Upon requalification, the Company intends to use Reg A shares strategically to settle existing debt obligations, reducing balance-sheet pressure without excessive dilution.

As part of this process, the Company plans to adjust the Reg A fixed share price upward from $0.0055 to $0.015 per share.

Strategic Rationale

Requalifying the Reg A at a higher fixed price reflects improved corporate governance, a more disciplined capital strategy, and evolving market conditions. From an industry perspective:

Using equity at higher valuation levels to retire debt improves solvency ratios

Reducing cash debt obligations preserves capital for operations and growth

A higher Reg A price helps protect existing shareholders from unnecessary dilution

This approach aligns Green Rain with best practices used by growth-stage infrastructure and energy companies transitioning toward revenue scalability.

Independent Audit Engagement

To further strengthen transparency and compliance, Green Rain has retained Barton CPA to conduct audits of its December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 financial statements.

Strategic Rationale

Independent audits are a critical milestone for companies preparing for broader capital market participation. Audited financials support:

Enhanced investor confidence

Improved access to institutional and strategic capital

Greater flexibility for future financings, uplisting considerations, and partnerships

Stronger regulatory and disclosure posture

This engagement reflects Green Rain’s commitment to operating with the rigor expected of maturing public companies.

Positioning for the Future

Collectively, these actions represent a coordinated effort to transition Green Rain into a more strategically positioned, investor-aligned, and financially disciplined company. By reducing share overhang, optimizing debt, improving disclosure quality, and strengthening governance, the Company believes it is laying the groundwork for sustainable growth across its EV infrastructure and clean-energy initiatives.

Management Commentary

“Each of these steps is deliberate and shareholder-focused,” said Alfredo Papadakis, CEO of Green Rain Energy Holdings. “We are cleaning up our capital structure, reducing dilution risk, strengthening transparency, and positioning the Company to pursue growth from a position of financial and operational discipline.”

[TITLE]VCI Global Expands Upstream into Energy Infrastructure With Up to 250MW Solar Initiative Positioned to Supply AI Data Centres in Malaysia:
[TEXT]
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VCI Energy Sdn Bhd (“VCI Energy” or the “Company”), a renewable energy platform managed and controlled by VCI Global Limited (NASDAQ: VCIG) (“VCI Global”), today announced a major strategic expansion into infrastructure-scale energy following the execution of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with DPS Energy Sdn Bhd (“DPS Energy”), a wholly owned subsidiary of DPS Resources Berhad (“DPS Resources”) (KLSE: DPS), a public listed company listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia to develop a utility-scale solar photovoltaic platform of up to 250 megawatts on approximately 600 acres of long-tenure land at Lipat Kajang, Bukit Apit II, Mukim Sungai Siput, Malacca, Malaysia.

This initiative marks a significant milestone for VCI Global in collaboration with DPS Resources, a Malaysian-listed engineering and energy company with established capabilities in renewable development and project execution. The project positions VCI Global deeper within the energy layer of the AI and data centre value chain, supporting the accelerating build-out of hyperscale data centres and AI-driven digital infrastructure across Malaysia.

Built for Data Centres, AI & Long-Term Power Demand

The project is being structured as an infrastructure-grade renewable energy platform capable of supporting up to 250 MW of installed solar capacity, with estimated annual generation of approximately 350 to 450 gigawatt-hours (GWh), subject to final design and grid conditions. The platform is intended to support long-term power purchase agreements with utilities, industrial users, and data centre operators, while remaining future-ready for battery energy storage system integration.

Demand for data centre power offtake is increasing, driven by the rapid growth of AI and cloud workloads. VCI Global has confirmed that data centre offtake arrangements and adjacent AI infrastructure development are under active evaluation, reflecting strong commercial interest and aligning with the Company’s strategy to support the digital economy through energy and platform-based assets.

Long-Term Infrastructure Value and Revenue Visibility

At full scale, utility-grade solar assets of this size are typically valued at approximately US$0.8 to 1.2 million per megawatt, implying an indicative gross project value of US$200 to 300 million upon full development and commissioning.

Based on industry-standard assumptions for solar irradiation, capacity utilisation, and long-term power purchase agreements with tenors of up to 20 years, the project is designed to generate approximately 350 to 450 (GWh) annually. This equates to an indicative annual gross revenue of US$18 to 24 million and potential cumulative contracted revenue of US$360 to 480 million over a 20-year operating life, subject to final tariff structures, grid connection approvals, and offtake arrangements.

Aligned With Malaysia’s AI, Data Center & Energy Policy Tailwinds

Malaysia is rapidly emerging as a regional hub for hyperscale data centers and artificial intelligence infrastructure, supported by strong government policy, expanding semiconductor manufacturing, and increasing commitments by global technology leaders. The country has set national targets to raise renewable energy capacity to 31% by 2025 and 40% by 2035, reinforcing long-term structural demand for large-scale renewable energy platforms. VCI Global believes renewable energy availability is becoming a critical gating factor for data center expansion, and this project positions the Company as a key enabler of Malaysia’s AI-driven digital economy.

“This is not just a solar project; it is an infrastructure platform. As AI, cloud computing, and hyperscale data centres expand across Malaysia, access to large, reliable, and renewable power is becoming mission critical.

[TITLE]3 Nuclear Power Stocks Set to Flourish in 2026 on AI Data Center Boom:
[TEXT]
Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered data centers are now booming. The AI infrastructure space remains rock solid, supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. Research firm McKinsey & Co. has estimated that global AI-powered data center infrastructure capex will reach around $7 trillion by 2030.

The energy-hungry AI space has made nuclear energy one of the hottest industries on Wall Street over the past year. Nuclear energy is increasingly recognized as a key solution to meeting rising global electricity demand and shifting toward cleaner energy sources. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reported that the U.S. data center electricity demand is expected to climb to 35 gigawatts (GW) in 2030 from 19 GW in 2023.

To strengthen the nation’s nuclear sector, President Donald Trump has issued four executive orders aimed at modernizing regulatory frameworks, expediting reactor testing and approvals, leveraging nuclear technology for national security, and expanding the domestic nuclear industrial base. These measures target an increase in U.S. nuclear capacity from

[TITLE]US wind growth picks up speed as power demand surges:

After a sluggish stretch, US wind is heading into a pivotal moment, with a near-term rebound colliding with rising power demand, tariffs, and stubborn permitting bottlenecks.

US wind power: the next five years

The US is expected to add more than 7 gigawatts (GW) of new wind capacity in 2025, a 36% increase from this year, according to the latest US Wind Energy Monitor report from Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

That matters now because the US power grid is under mounting pressure, just as new generation has become harder to build. Electricity demand is rising for the first time in years, mainly driven by data centers and other large loads, while wind developers are navigating higher turbine costs, tariff uncertainty, and permitting delays. How quickly projects can move from the pipeline to completion over the next few years will shape whether wind can help keep the lights on and power prices in check.

Over the longer term, the outlook is steady but increasingly back‑loaded. The report still sees 46 GW of new wind capacity coming online between 2025 and 2029. What has changed is timing. More projects are now expected to reach completion in the middle of the decade, with 2026 and 2027 shaping up to be especially busy years at 10.7 GW and 12.7 GW, respectively, as projects move through the development pipeline.

That shift helps explain why installations lagged earlier this year. Wind additions in Q3 came in at 932 megawatts (MW),
