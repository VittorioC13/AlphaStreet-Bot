TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that anti-Aβ protofibril* antibody “LEQEMBI®” (brand name in China: “乐意保®”, generic name: lecanemab), has been included in the “Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List” (Chinese: 商业健康保险创新药品目录), recently introduced by the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) of China. The inclusion of LEQEMBI in this list marks a meaningful step toward expanding access to early Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) treatment in China.

The Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List is based on new policies of the Chinese government to support the development and access of innovative medicines. The list aims to help narrow the coverage gap between the basic reimbursement system under the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) and innovative medicines that address areas of significant unmet need. Based on the Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List, Commercial insurance companies will discuss and reach the agreement with pharmaceutical companies regarding coverage details, and develop insurance products focusing on the listed medicines. The Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026.

Eisai estimates that there were 17 million patients with MCI or mild dementia due to AD in China in 2024, which is expected to increase with the aging of the population.

Eisai launched LEQEMBI in China in June 2024 and has delivered the product in the private market.

Eisai serves as the lead of LEQEMBI development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. Eisai will distribute the product in China and will conduct information provision activities through specialized Medical Representatives.

*Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.1 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction.2

[TITLE]Roche presents Lunsumio data showing potential across earlier treatment lines in indolent and aggressive lymphomas:
[TEXT]
Lunsumio in combination with lenalidomide may offer an effective treatment in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma based on first data from single-arm US cohort of phase III CELESTIMO study 1

Data from subcutaneous Lunsumio plus Polivy reinforce its outpatient, chemotherapy-free potential in people with R/R large B-cell lymphoma 2,3

Results highlight the potential of innovative Lunsumio combination regimens to offer improved outcomes for more people with lymphoma earlier in their disease

Basel, 8 December 2025 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today new data highlighting the potential of Lunsumio® (mosunetuzumab) in earlier treatment lines for people living with different types of lymphoma, presented at the 67th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition, 6-9 December 2025 in Orlando, Florida, US.

“These data underscore the potential of Lunsumio to support more people living with lymphoma, building on the clinical benefit observed in later-stage follicular lymphoma,” said Levi Garraway, MD, PhD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Moreover, the combinatorial potential of Lunsumio is evident in the two-drug regimens presented, which may enable outpatient treatment while preserving deep and durable efficacy.”

Preliminary data support the potential for Lunsumio in combination with lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL)1

First data from the single-arm US extension of the phase III CELESTIMO study, in 54 patients, demonstrated promising efficacy with this two-drug regimen in people with second-line or later (2L+) FL, including a complete response (CR) rate of 87.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 75.1–94.6).1 Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) events were reported in 27.8% of patients, and were predominantly low grade (Grade (Gr) 1: 22.2%; Gr 2: 3.7%; Gr 3: 1.9%), with all CRS events resolved.1 Neutropenia occurred in 40.7% of patients, and infections occurred in 57.4% of patients.1 These results indicate the potential of this combination to deliver meaningful outcomes earlier in the disease course.1 Primary analysis of the pivotal phase III CELESTIMO study is anticipated in 2026.

Lunsumio plus Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin) data demonstrate meaningful improvements for people with R/R large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL)2,3

Long term follow-up data from the phase Ib/II GO40516 study demonstrated sustained improvements in patients treated with Lunsumio subcutaneous (SC) in combination with Polivy compared to those treated with MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab) and Polivy in people with 2L+ LBCL.2 The overall response rate (ORR) was 77.5% (95% CI: 61.6–89.2) vs 50.0% (95% CI: 33.8–66.2) and median progression-free survival was 25.4 (95% CI: 9.2– not evaluable ) vs 6.4 months (95% CI:4.7–18.6).2 No new safety signals were identified. AEs included neutrophil count decreased/neutropenia (40%), febrile neutropenia (2.5%), infections (45%), and peripheral neuropathy (10%).2 Patient-reported outcomes from the phase III SUNMO study investigating the same combination, demonstrated benefits across multiple aspects of health-related quality of life measures in comparison to MabThera/Rituxan with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin particularly in maintaining or improving physical functioning, fatigue, lymphoma symptoms and peripheral neuropathy.3

Results from these studies highlight the potential of this outpatient combination to prolong remission and improve outcomes for people living with this aggressive disease, without the need for conventional chemotherapy.2,3

Long-term follow-up data show sustained responses with fixed-duration Lunsumio SC and intravenous (IV) in third line or later (3L+) FL4,5

Five-year follow-up data from the pivotal phase II GO29781 study, the longest reported follow-up for a CD20xCD3 bispecific in R/R FL, showed durable remissions with Lunsumio IV, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 78.5% (95% CI: 69.6–87.4) and 54-month duration of CR rate (DOCR) of 52.0% (95% CI: 36.1-67.9).4 Furthermore, three-year follow-up data demonstrated durable responses with Lunsumio SC with an ORR of 74.5%, CR rate of 62.8%, and 30-month DOCR of 53.0% (95% CI: 38.7-67.4).5 No new safety signals were observed in either study.

Lunsumio monotherapy is approved in over 60 countries for people with FL who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, with ongoing discussions with additional health authorities worldwide. Lunsumio SC was recently approved by the European Commission for FL after two or more lines of systemic therapy. A decision from the US Food and Drug Administration is expected soon.

Lunsumio, along with Columvi® (glofitamab), is part of Roche’s industry-leading CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody portfolio. Continuing to explore new formulations and combinations of these medicines across different disease areas and lines of treatment is part of Roche’s commitment to improve the patient experience and provide more choice to suit diverse patient and healthcare system needs.

[TITLE]Autolus Therapeutics Presents Updated Clinical Data from the CARLYSLE Trial in Patients with Severe Refractory Systemic Lupus Erythematosus at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting 2:
[TEXT]
Data show deep, durable responses in the 50 million cell dose level cohort; initial data suggest substantial early improvement in three patients dosed with 100 million cells

All patients show deep B-cell depletion after infusion, suggesting an immune reset

Nine patients were evaluable for safety, no ICANS or high-grade CRS were observed

LONDON and GAITHERSBURG, Md., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Autolus Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: AUTL), an early commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing, manufacturing and delivering next-generation programmed T cell therapies, announces presentation of preliminary data from the ongoing Phase 1 CARLYSLE trial in patients with severe refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (srSLE) in an oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.

Dr. Matthias Will, Chief Development Officer of Autolus, said: “Patients with srSLE have limited remaining treatment options and represent a difficult to treat population with a critical unmet need. Data reported from the CARLYSLE trial show an encouraging high rate of DORIS responses and a deep reset in the B cell compartment induced by obe-cel, suggesting the possibility for an immune reset. Based on this positive initial experience with obe-cel in the CARLSYLE trial we have initiated the LUMINA trial, a Phase 2 trial in lupus nephritis with registrational intent.”

Abstract 302

Title: Obecabtagene autoleucel (obe-cel), a CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, in patients with severe, refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the Phase I CARLYSLE study: initial safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and biomarker results

Session Name: Cellular Immunotherapies: Early Phase Clinical Trials and Toxicities: Emerging CAR-T Cell Therapies for Acute Leukemias and Autoimmune Diseases

Session Date and Time: December 8, 2025; 11:30 – 11:45am ET

Session Room: Orange County Convention Center; Valencia Room W415D

Publication Number: 815

Presenting Author: Claire Roddie, MD, PhD, FRCPath, Associate Professor Haematology and Honorary Consultant Haematologist, Cancer Institute, University College London (UCL)

Summary: Updated Phase 1 data with longer follow-up, and data in patients who received both 50×106 (50M) and 100×106 (100M) CAR T-cells were presented. Nine adult patients were infused with obe-cel, including six at the 50M dose and three at the 100M dose.

Obe-cel was well tolerated in all patients. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) or cases of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were observed at the 50M dose. Grade one cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in three patients at the 50M dose and three patients at the 100M dose. Hypertension was observed in five patients at the 50M dose, with three of those patients having pre-existing history of hypertension. A case of transient Grade three liver toxicity was observed in one patient of the 100M cohort.

At the 50M dose, three patients (50%) achieved CRR and five patients (83%) achieved DORIS with a median onset of 5.1 months (range: 4.9–8.9), without evidence of new disease activity at a median of 12 months of follow up (range: 8.5–16.3). All non-renal manifestations of the disease resolved by month four. Urinary protein creatinine (UPC) ratio levels decreased over time, demonstrating significant decline or absence of disease activity. Data show high peak expansion and deep B cell aplasia consistent with known obe-cel characteristics in oncology indications. Peak expansion was reached at a median of 10 days (range: 9–13). The median time to loss of CAR T-cell persistence based on Kaplan-Meier analysis was 3.0 months. The B-cell reconstitution profiles suggest that obe-cel may induce a reset of pathologic autoimmunity.

Emerging data in the 100M cohort is consistent with the 50M adult cohort, and evaluation is ongoing.

Data support progressing obe-cel as a treatment for srSLE and 50M has been selected as the recommended Phase 2 dose. Autolus has aligned with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on a Phase 2 trial design in LN and potential registrational path to approval. The LUMINA trial is now enrolling.

Dr. Christian Itin, Autolus Chief Executive Officer, said: “Obe-cel's safety profile is based on a robust database spanning several clinical trials in B-ALL and B-NHL indications. Data presented today now also show the ability to induce deep depletion of B-cell lineages in patients with srSLE. Obe-cel successfully underwent the regulatory approval process with the FDA, EMA and MHRA in adult r/r B-ALL and launched commercially in the US and UK in 2025. Building on this strong foundation of clinical data, and demonstrated commercial and manufacturing capabilities, we believe Autolus is well positioned for a successful and efficient path into the autoimmune setting.”

What is Eczema?

Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is the most common type of dermatitis. Both genetic and environmental factors influence its development. While eczema is most frequently observed in children, it can also affect adults. Individuals with eczema typically experience dry, itchy skin that is susceptible to infections. The condition is often referred to as the “itch that rashes” because scratching or rubbing the dry skin can trigger a rash. The cornerstone of eczema management is maintaining skin hydration, with topical steroids used to control flare-ups. The lifetime prevalence of atopic dermatitis is estimated at 15–30% in children and 2–10% in adults, with around 60% of cases appearing within the first year of life. Eczema occurs more often in rural than urban settings, highlighting the role of lifestyle and environmental factors in its development.

[TITLE]“LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease Included in China’s Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that anti-Aβ protofibril* antibody “LEQEMBI®” (brand name in China: “乐意保®”, generic name: lecanemab), has been included in the “Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List” (Chinese: 商业健康保险创新药品目录), recently introduced by the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) of China. The inclusion of LEQEMBI in this list marks a meaningful step toward expanding access to early Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) treatment in China.

The Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List is based on new policies of the Chinese government to support the development and access of innovative medicines. The list aims to help narrow the coverage gap between the basic reimbursement system under the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) and innovative medicines that address areas of significant unmet need. Based on the Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List, Commercial insurance companies will discuss and reach the agreement with pharmaceutical companies regarding coverage details, and develop insurance products focusing on the listed medicines. The Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026.

Eisai estimates that there were 17 million patients with MCI or mild dementia due to AD in China in 2024, which is expected to increase with the aging of the population.

Eisai launched LEQEMBI in China in June 2024 and has delivered the product in the private market.

Eisai serves as the lead of LEQEMBI development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. Eisai will distribute the product in China and will conduct information provision activities through specialized Medical Representatives.

*Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.1 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction.2

[TITLE]Exicure Presents Positive Topline Phase 2 Data for Burixafor in Multiple Myeloma at 2025 ASH Annual Meeting:
[TEXT]
REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Exicure, Inc. (Nasdaq: XCUR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics for hematologic diseases, today announced positive results from its completed Phase 2 trial evaluating burixafor (GPC-100) in combination with propranolol and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT). The data, which showed that approximately 90% of study participants achieved the primary endpoint, were presented today in an oral session at the 67th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida.

Burixafor is an investigational small molecule that blocks CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 receptors on HPCs, rapidly mobilizing these cells from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood. In preclinical studies, propranolol enhanced burixafor-induced mobilization by inhibiting the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR).

In the open-label, multicenter Phase 2 trial (NCT05561751), 17 of 19 participants (89.5%) achieved the primary endpoint of collecting ≥2 × 10⁶ CD34+ cells/kg within two leukapheresis sessions. Two required another session to achieve 2x106 CD34+ cells/kg. Among participants who proceeded to transplant, the median time to neutrophil engraftment was 13 days, and the median time to platelet engraftment was 17.5 days. Burixafor has a differentiated and rapid mobilization kinetics, with peak peripheral levels of CD34+ cells observed within one hour of administration. This distinguishes it from other CXCR4 inhibitors and allows for same day burixafor administration and apheresis.

Notably, 16 of 19 participants (84.2%) had prior exposure to daratumumab, a therapy associated with reduced mobilization, yet 14 of those 16 participants (87.5%) achieved the primary endpoint, including 12 of 14 participants (85.7%) who had received both daratumumab and lenalidomide. Longer intervals between the last dose of daratumumab and leukapheresis were associated with higher CD34+ cell yields.

Burixafor administered in combination with propranolol and G-CSF was well tolerated and demonstrated an excellent safety profile. There were no burixafor-related adverse events higher than Grade 2.

“In this Phase 2 study, the combination of burixafor, G-CSF and propranolol showed an excellent safety profile and supported reliable mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells, allowing all participants who elected to proceed with transplant to undergo AHCT and successfully engraft,” said Jack Khouri, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University and the study’s lead investigator. “We’re encouraged by these results, particularly given the high proportion of participants previously treated with daratumumab, an agent which may reduce stem cell yield. The ability to achieve peak circulating HPC levels rapidly after burixafor administration for immediate leukapheresis also has the potential to meaningfully improve the patient experience by reducing the burden of the mobilization process.”

[TITLE]Caregiver smartphone use can affect a baby’s development. New parents should get more guidance:
[TEXT]
We already know excessive smartphone use affects people’s mental health and their relationships.

But when new parents use digital technologies during care giving, they might also compromise their baby’s development.

Smartphone use in the presence of infants is associated with a range of negative developmental outcomes, including threats to the formation of a secure attachment.

The transition into parenthood is an ideal time for healthy behaviour change. Expectant parents see a range of professionals, but as we found in our new study, they don’t receive any co-ordinated support or advice on managing digital devices in babies’ presence.

One of the new mums we interviewed said:

Literally nothing has come up around […] screen time, or especially breastfeeding and things like that […] it’s interesting because it’s such a big part of our lives.

Another participant said:

I haven’t had anyone talk to me about tech use, at all.

Adult smartphone use is not mentioned in well-child checks. We argue this is a missed public health opportunity.

Secure attachment is important for a baby’s development. They need hours of gazing at their families’ faces to optimally wire their brains. This is more likely when the parent is sensitive to a baby’s cues and emotionally available.

But ubiquitous smartphone use by caregivers has the potential to disrupt attachment by interrupting this sensitivity and availability.

Babies’ central nervous system and senses are immature. But they are born into a rapidly moving world, filled with voices and faces from digital sources. This places a burden on caregivers to act as a human filter between a newborn’s neurobiology and digital distractions.

Disrupting relationships

Psychologists have described the phenomenon of frequent disruptions and distractions during parenting – and the disconnection of the in-person relationship – as “technoference”.

A caregiver’s eyes are no longer on the infant but on the device. Their attention is gone, in a state described as “absent presence”, and the phone becomes a “social pollution”.

It’s unpleasant for anyone on the other side of this imbalance. But for babies, whose connection to their significant adults is the only thing that can make them feel safe enough to learn and grow optimally, it causes disproportionate harm because of their vulnerable developmental stage.

During the rapid phase of brain growth in infancy, babies are wired to seek messages of safety from their caregiver’s face. Smartphone use blanks caregivers’ facial expressions in ways that cause physiological stress to babies.

When a caregiver uses their phone while feeding an infant, babies are more likely to be overfed. The number of audible notifications on a parent’s device relates to a child’s language development, with more alerts associated with fewer words at 18 months.

If that’s not reason enough to reign in phone use, evidence also shows that smartphone use can be a source of stress and guilt for parents. This suggests parents themselves would benefit from more purposeful and reduced smartphone habits.

Some public health researchers are urging healthcare workers to consider the parent-infant relationship in addition to the respective health of the baby and caregiver themselves.

This relational space between people is suffering as a result of the social pollution of smartphone-distracted care. Babies’ brains grow so fast, we mustn’t let this process be compromised by the distraction of the attention economy.

Our research shows new parents could use information and support around the use of digital devices. We also recommend that other family members modify their smartphone habits around a new baby. Whānau can create a family media plan and make sure they have someone to talk to about this issue.

Health policies should focus on early investment in parents and children, by prioritising education and action on smartphone use around babies. This would benefit the wellbeing of new parents and the lifelong development of infants.

[TITLE]Roche presents Lunsumio data showing potential across earlier treatment lines in indolent and aggressive lymphomas:
[TEXT]
Lunsumio in combination with lenalidomide may offer an effective treatment in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma based on first data from single-arm US cohort of phase III CELESTIMO study 1

Data from subcutaneous Lunsumio plus Polivy reinforce its outpatient, chemotherapy-free potential in people with R/R large B-cell lymphoma 2,3

Results highlight the potential of innovative Lunsumio combination regimens to offer improved outcomes for more people with lymphoma earlier in their disease

Basel, 8 December 2025 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today new data highlighting the potential of Lunsumio® (mosunetuzumab) in earlier treatment lines for people living with different types of lymphoma, presented at the 67th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition, 6-9 December 2025 in Orlando, Florida, US.

“These data underscore the potential of Lunsumio to support more people living with lymphoma, building on the clinical benefit observed in later-stage follicular lymphoma,” said Levi Garraway, MD, PhD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Moreover, the combinatorial potential of Lunsumio is evident in the two-drug regimens presented, which may enable outpatient treatment while preserving deep and durable efficacy.”

Preliminary data support the potential for Lunsumio in combination with lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL)1

First data from the single-arm US extension of the phase III CELESTIMO study, in 54 patients, demonstrated promising efficacy with this two-drug regimen in people with second-line or later (2L+) FL, including a complete response (CR) rate of 87.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 75.1–94.6).1 Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) events were reported in 27.8% of patients, and were predominantly low grade (Grade (Gr) 1: 22.2%; Gr 2: 3.7%; Gr 3: 1.9%), with all CRS events resolved.1 Neutropenia occurred in 40.7% of patients, and infections occurred in 57.4% of patients.1 These results indicate the potential of this combination to deliver meaningful outcomes earlier in the disease course.1 Primary analysis of the pivotal phase III CELESTIMO study is anticipated in 2026.

Lunsumio plus Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin) data demonstrate meaningful improvements for people with R/R large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL)2,3

Long term follow-up data from the phase Ib/II GO40516 study demonstrated sustained improvements in patients treated with Lunsumio subcutaneous (SC) in combination with Polivy compared to those treated with MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab) and Polivy in people with 2L+ LBCL.2 The overall response rate (ORR) was 77.5% (95% CI: 61.6–89.2) vs 50.0% (95% CI: 33.8–66.2) and median progression-free survival was 25.4 (95% CI: 9.2– not evaluable ) vs 6.4 months (95% CI:4.7–18.6).2 No new safety signals were identified. AEs included neutrophil count decreased/neutropenia (40%), febrile neutropenia (2.5%), infections (45%), and peripheral neuropathy (10%).2 Patient-reported outcomes from the phase III SUNMO study investigating the same combination, demonstrated benefits across multiple aspects of health-related quality of life measures in comparison to MabThera/Rituxan with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin particularly in maintaining or improving physical functioning, fatigue, lymphoma symptoms and peripheral neuropathy.3

Results from these studies highlight the potential of this outpatient combination to prolong remission and improve outcomes for people living with this aggressive disease, without the need for conventional chemotherapy.2,3

Long-term follow-up data show sustained responses with fixed-duration Lunsumio SC and intravenous (IV) in third line or later (3L+) FL4,5

Five-year follow-up data from the pivotal phase II GO29781 study, the longest reported follow-up for a CD20xCD3 bispecific in R/R FL, showed durable remissions with Lunsumio IV, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 78.5% (95% CI: 69.6–87.4) and 54-month duration of CR rate (DOCR) of 52.0% (95% CI: 36.1-67.9).4 Furthermore, three-year follow-up data demonstrated durable responses with Lunsumio SC with an ORR of 74.5%, CR rate of 62.8%, and 30-month DOCR of 53.0% (95% CI: 38.7-67.4).5 No new safety signals were observed in either study.

Lunsumio monotherapy is approved in over 60 countries for people with FL who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, with ongoing discussions with additional health authorities worldwide. Lunsumio SC was recently approved by the European Commission for FL after two or more lines of systemic therapy. A decision from the US Food and Drug Administration is expected soon.

Lunsumio, along with Columvi® (glofitamab), is part of Roche’s industry-leading CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody portfolio. Continuing to explore new formulations and combinations of these medicines across different disease areas and lines of treatment is part of Roche’s commitment to improve the patient experience and provide more choice to suit diverse patient and healthcare system needs.
