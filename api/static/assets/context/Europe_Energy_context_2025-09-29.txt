Mars Inc. announced Tuesday that its ten Mars Snacking factories across Europe are now operating entirely on renewable energy sources. The move is a significant step in the company's broader sustainability and decarbonization efforts, which aim for net-zero emissions by 2050.

The shift to renewable power follows a decade of investments in the company's European manufacturing facilities. According to the company, these investments include over $1.6 billion (€1.5 billion) spent over the past five years. The company's strategy involved both direct investments in energy reduction and conversion, as well as the purchase of Guarantees of Origin (GO) certificates to cover remaining electricity and natural gas consumption.

The ten factories are located in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom. These facilities collectively produce approximately 900,000 metric tons of popular confectionery brands annually, including SNICKERS, TWIX, and M&M'S. Around 85% of this production is distributed for consumption within the European region.

This transition comes amid a wider push across the food and beverage industry to reduce its carbon footprint and address consumer demand for more sustainable practices. Many companies are facing pressure from investors and regulators to align their operations with global climate goals. The sourcing of renewable energy, either through direct investment in projects like wind farms or through the purchase of energy certificates, has become a common strategy for corporations to lower their operational emissions.

"At Mars, we believe that the world we want tomorrow starts with how we do business today," said Marc Carena, Regional President for Mars Wrigley. "Therefore, we measure our success not only by financial results, but also by the positive impact we have on people, the planet, and society. Sustainability makes good business sense and is at the heart of our strategy."

The company stated that this development is a key part of its global strategy to achieve its net-zero target by 2050. Mars plans to invest an additional $1.1 billion (€1 billion) in its European manufacturing operations by the end of 2026. This investment is aimed at supporting innovation, economic growth, and the development of modern, energy-efficient infrastructure.

[TITLE]Indonesia: Palm oil sellers fear new barriers after EU deal – DW – 09:
[TEXT]
After nearly a decade of negotiations between Jakarta and Brussels, a new free trade pact will let Indonesia sell its palm oil in the EU with zero tariffs. But other obstacles are looming.

The European Union and Indonesia opened "an exciting new chapter" in trade this week, with the Indonesia-EU Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IEU-CEPA) being signed in Bali following years of diplomatic wrangling.

Palm oil exports have proven to be the most contentious issue during the talks. EU officials point out that producing palm oil is a major driver of deforestation and pollution. The trade dispute spilled into the arena of diplomacy and chilled ties between Jakarta and Brussels.

Recent global trade uncertainty, combined with US tariffs on countries in Europe and Asia, seem to have finally pushed the talks across the finish line. Brussels and Jakarta now hope to see the accord go into effect by 2027, allowing around 80% of Indonesia's exports to enter the EU tariff-free.

Although the new IEU-CEPA framework allows the European Union to buy Indonesia's palm oil at zero tariffs, this deal alone is not enough to guarantee smooth exports to Europe.

What's next after Indonesia's zero-tariffs deal with EU?

Starting in December, the European Union will demand palm oil imports to comply with the bloc's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), a new legal framework aimed at fighting deforestation worldwide.

Exporters, including those in Indonesia, will be required to carry out due diligence and provide documentation proving that their palm oil did not come from recently deforested areas.

Though major companies may be able to deliver the necessary export certificates, smallholders — who control over 42% of Indonesia's palm oil plantations — are likely to struggle, risking exclusion from supply chains. Without proper support, this imbalance could leave independent farmers marginalized and likely weakened in any land conflicts with big corporations.

Small palm farmers likely to bear the brunt

Eddy Martono, chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI), praised the IEU-CEPA deal as a vital gateway to global markets, but told DW that there would be further obstacles related to the EUDR.

"For large companies, especially GAPKI members, EUDR is not a major problem. The real challenge lies with smallholders, as the government has yet to provide clear rules regarding their land cultivation," Eddy said.

Eddy also called for a national traceability system in Indonesia, which would also be recognized by the EU, as a tool to minimize export rejection.

"When tariff barriers are gone but nontariff rules like EUDR are unmet, the zero-tariff facility becomes meaningless," he said.

Global markets 'wide open' with IEU-CEPA

Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), also warned that the EUDR could emerge as a significant barrier.

"What companies see as additional costs, European consumers view as necessities," Bhima told DW Indonesia.

"In tariff terms, Indonesia can now compete more strongly with other vegetable oil producers. But environmental standards must not be seen as obstacles. With IEU-CEPA, the door to global markets is already wide open — certification and due diligence must follow quickly," he said.

EU tracks Indonesia's environmental protection

Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto has told the Antara News Agency that Indonesian palm oil would enjoy zero-tariff access as soon as the agreement takes effect, with no long transition period.

The minister said the deal could lead to greater acceptance for crude palm oil and its derivatives in the European Union, despite lingering stigma over deforestation and regulatory barriers.

The European Union is keeping a close watch on environmental protections in Indonesia. This means exports will face tighter scrutiny, including traceability of plantation origins, and pressure on European importers to prove due diligence.

Danger of 'greenwashing' to hide deforestation

Civil society groups in Indonesia have concerns of their own. WALHI (Friends of the Earth Indonesia) — the country's largest and oldest environmental advocacy organization — and Indonesia for Global Justice (IGJ) have both warned that sustainability certification schemes could simply turn into tools of greenwashing, allowing companies to project a "green" image without making meaningful changes on the ground.

The danger is that Indonesian palm oil may pass administrative checks while still leaving behind deforestation, destroying biodiversity, and violating the rights of Indigenous peoples. In other words: palm oil could pass on paper, but continue to damage ecosystems in practice.

IEU-CEPA is more than a trade deal: It is also seen as a test of Indonesia's overall narrative on palm oil.

"If EUDR standards are not met, Indonesia risks being trapped in the negative stigma of palm oil as cheap but environmentally destructive," said Bhima, from the CELIOS think-thank.

Failure, he added, could mean losing access to premium markets, which would in turn force Indonesia to rely on more price-sensitive, lower-value destinations outside the European Union.

Indonesia far behind Malaysia on palm yields

Even with these challenges, the new EU deal gives Indonesia an edge over other ASEAN palm oil exporters, especially Malaysia, which is still negotiating a free-trade deal of its own.

This edge in trade does not automatically translate into market dominance. The Indonesian Ombudsman, an independent state institution that oversees public services, reported that average national palm oil productivity is just 12.8 tons of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) per hectare (around 2.5 acres). This is far below Malaysia's 19 tons per hectare under its Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification, mounting to billions of dollars in loses for Indonesia.

Malaysia also leads in certification standards and logistics efficiency. Yet Bhima pointed out that all ASEAN producers face the same EUDR hurdle.

"Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines must all prove their palm oil is deforestation-free — but, unlike Indonesia, they don't have the incentive of zero tariffs," he said.

Moving beyond palm oil

Expanding Indonesia's exports of crude palm oil will likely provide opportunities for exports of related products such as biodiesel, palm-based cosmetics and chemicals derived from palm oil. However, experts like Bhima warn that the benefits of the EU deal would only be maximized if Jakarta steps up regarding regulation.

"EUDR remains the ultimate test: Without credible sustainability compliance and a trusted traceability system, zero tariffs will be difficult to utilize," Bhima said.

In the end, IEU-CEPA could be a global springboard for Indonesia's palm oil — or a trap that exposes the industry's unresolved environmental and social weaknesses.

[TITLE]Regulators weigh billion-dollar utility takeovers as bills rise for consumers:
[TEXT]
Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

RELATED STORY | As electric bills rise, evidence mounts that data centers share blame

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.
