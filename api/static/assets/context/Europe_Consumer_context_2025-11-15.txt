[TITLE]A Beloved Tokyo Penguin’s End Presages a Payments Giant:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Japan is a country where everything has a recognizable mascot, from tourist sites to the Tokyo police force.

But one of the most beloved is soon to be no more. East Japan Railway Co., better known as JR East, announced Tuesday that it’s retiring the iconic penguin that has long adorned Suica, the contactless payment platform for trains in the capital and beyond.

Since Suica’s introduction in 2001, the penguin (simply known as “the Suica penguin”) has featured on transit cards and apps that are used daily by the tens of millions who traverse the world’s largest metropolis and the east of the country. The company officially says the character is “graduating.” On social media, it was treated like the death of a beloved celebrity.

The change is not just cosmetic. It’s part of a business rebrand to shift JR East from an old-school firm dependent on train revenue to a fintech powerhouse. In what it calls a “Suica Renaissance,” the firm aims to change the transit card into a modern mobile payments platform — a super-app offering peer-to-peer transactions and a banking back-end, along with futuristic tech that will eliminate the need for station turnstiles.

The penguin is not just a corporate icon — it’s more akin to the likes of Hello Kitty. Multiple stores sell goods featuring the character; there’s even a bronze statue of it in Shinjuku, the world’s busiest train station used by some 3 million people a day (memes showing it being torn down like those of Lenin after the fall of the Soviet Union circulated online). A yet-to-be-announced new character will take the flightless bird’s place — one that, presumably, will highlight how Suica is evolving.

JR East is acting because it faces stiff competition if it wants to be a payment giant. Cashless transactions are increasingly dominated by QR code systems, with the overwhelming market leader SoftBank Group Corp.’s PayPay Corp., which has accumulated 71 million users since launching seven years ago.

PayPay’s blitzkrieg strategy offered huge cashback programs for users who downloaded the app, while encouraging merchants with years of zero transaction fees. The firm innovated quickly, aided by the technological know-how of then-fellow SoftBank investee Paytm, and as a QR code-based service, it doesn’t require stores to operate finicky (and costly) terminals.

The app already offers many of the fintech services Suica aims to provide. It’s the country’s leading platform for peer-to-peer payments, and offers bank accounts, credit cards, and investment services. You can even receive part of your salary in PayPay points. Despite its business being almost exclusively in Japan, SoftBank aims to list the firm in the US, with some reports saying its valuation could exceed $20 billion — or two-thirds of JR East’s entire market capitalization.

It’s not hard to think the railway operator missed a chance to become the market leader. Suica was a technological marvel when it launched. Based on Sony Group Corp.’s contactless Felica technology, it was built to handle the throughput of Tokyo’s train stations at rush hour, facilitating a passenger every second and quickly displacing paper and prepaid magnetic cards. It stayed ahead by quickly expanding to mobile devices — first on local handsets, and then becoming the first transit card offered on iPhone. As a method of paying, it’s simpler to use than QR codes, and predated tap-to-pay credit cards by years.

But while it didn’t take JR East long to see the potential for use in retail, the technology was initially limited to kiosks and other stores within train stations. It was also hobbled by the nature of Japan’s railway industry, with different firms offering competing standards. JR East had to focus on cooperation rather than nationwide expansion.

The biggest blocker to Suica as a cashless platform has been its design as a charge card with a small upper limit. Meanwhile, QR code systems were free to move more flexibly — and supercharged by a boom in cashless payments during Covid, they became fully fledged digital wallets while Suica still focused on transit and daily needs.

JR East needs to fix the mess of its multiple apps and logins for various services. But at least it looks to be on the right track and getting serious about monetizing this product. (While the penguin will be missed, one reason for its retirement might be that it was not created for the railway firm, and the rights partially belong to its illustrator, Chiharu Sakazaki.)

With millions of users locked into its ecosystem, Suica isn’t going anywhere. The operator last year set up a bank, and is pledging to spend nearly $17 billion on M&A by 2032. And more than anything, the news of the mascot’s demise has already created intense word-of-mouth and awareness of the platform’s coming rebirth. The penguin will be mourned. But it’s more important that JR East doesn’t miss this opportunity.

[TITLE]Verizon layoffs: American telecommunications company to cut 15,000 jobs amid restructuring — Who will get affected?:
[TEXT]
Verizon layoffs: Verizon, the leading American telecommunications company, is set to reduce thousands of roles as part of a restructuring under its new CEO Dan Schulman, reported Reuters.

The company is planning to cut about 15,000 jobs, 15% of its workforce, said the report, citing person familiar with the matter.

However, a Verizon spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.

The new CEO's first commitment was to stop the bleeding from subscriber churn, which would require subsidizing expensive handsets for a huge number of Verizon's subscribers to keep them from leaving, Craig Moffett, senior analyst at Moffett Nathanson, told Reuters.

When will layoffs start? The layoffs are set to take place as soon as next week.

Who will get affected? The job cuts are aimed at Verizon's non-union management ranks and are expected to affect more than 20% of that workforce, a source told Reuters.

He added that Verizon also plans to transition around 180 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations.

Slowdown in growth As subscriber growth slows and cautious consumers are unwilling to buy premium wireless plans, Verizon is battling rising competition. The coompany is also facing mounting pressure from rivals AT&T and T-Mobile US.

How many employees does Verizon have? At the end of 2024, Verizon had about 1,00,000 US employees.

Last year it announced a reduction of 4,800 employees through a voluntary program and took a nearly $2 billion charge.

Verizon acquisitions — Verizon spent $52 billion to acquire key wireless C-Band spectrum in a 2021 auction.

— The telecommunication company struck a $20 billion deal to acquire Frontier Communications last year.

— Verizon also spent $6 billion to acquire prepaid mobile phone provider TracFone Wireless.

Recent tech layoffs Amazon, TCS, Microsoft, IBM and several other companies have announced layoffs.

Earlier this month, tech giant IBM said that it would cut thousands of roles amid focus on software growth.

“In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” said the company's spokesperson.

According to Layoffs.fyi - a platform that tracks global tech industry layoffs — over 110,502 tech workers have been laid off across 226 tech companies in 2025 alone.

Amazon has announced that it will reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 people.

[TITLE]It’s one of Starbucks’ busiest days of the year, and workers just kicked off a 65-store U.S. strike:
[TEXT]
More than 1,000 unionized Starbucks workers went on strike at 65 U.S. stores Thursday to protest a lack of progress in labor negotiations with the company.

The strike was intended to disrupt Starbucks’ Red Cup Day, which is typically one of the company’s busiest days of the year. Since 2018, Starbucks has given out free, reusable cups on that day to customers who buy a holiday drink. Starbucks Workers United, the union organizing baristas, said Thursday morning that the strike had already closed some stores and was expected to force more to close later in the day.

Starbucks Workers United said stores in 45 cities would be impacted, including New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, San Diego, St. Louis, Dallas, Columbus, Ohio, and Starbucks’ home city of Seattle. There is no date set for the strike to end, and more stores are prepared to join if Starbucks doesn’t reach a contract agreement with the union, organizers said.

Starbucks emphasized that the vast majority of its U.S. stores would be open and operating as usual Thursday. The coffee giant has 10,000 company-owned stores in the U.S., as well as 7,000 licensed locations in places like grocery stores and airports.

Around 550 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores are currently unionized. More have voted to unionize, but Starbucks closed 59 unionized stores in September as part of a larger reorganization campaign.

Here’s what’s behind the strike.

A stalled contract agreement

Striking workers say they’re protesting because Starbucks has yet to reach a contract agreement with the union. Starbucks workers first voted to unionize at a store in Buffalo in 2021. In December 2023, Starbucks vowed to finalize an agreement by the end of 2024. But in August of last year, the company ousted Laxman Narasimhan, the CEO who made that promise. The union said progress has stalled under Brian Niccol, the company’s current chairman and CEO. The two sides haven’t been at the bargaining table since April.

Workers want higher pay, better hours

Workers say they’re seeking better hours and improved staffing in stores, where they say long customer wait times are routine. They also want higher pay, pointing out that executives like Niccol are making millions and the company spent $81 million in June on a conference in Las Vegas for 14,000 store managers and regional leaders.

READ MORE: Thousands of Starbucks workers expected to join one-day strike in protest of understaffing

Dochi Spoltore, a barista from Pittsburgh, said in a union conference call Thursday that it’s hard for workers to be assigned more than 19 hours per week, which leaves them short of the 20 hours they would need to be eligible for Starbucks’ benefits. Spoltore said she makes $16 per hour.

“I want Starbucks to succeed. My livelihood depends on it,” Spoltore said. “We’re proud of our work, but we’re tired of being treated like we’re disposable.”

The union also wants the company to resolve hundreds of unfair labor practice charges filed by workers, who say the company has fired baristas in retaliation for unionizing and has failed to bargain over changes in policy that workers must enforce, like its decision earlier this year to limit restroom use to paying customers.

Starbucks stands by its wages and benefits

Starbucks says it offers the best wage and benefit package in retail, worth an average of $30 per hour. Among the company’s benefits are up to 18 weeks of paid family leave and 100% tuition coverage for a four-year college degree. In a letter to employees last week, Starbucks’ Chief Partner Officer Sara Kelly said the union walked away from the bargaining table in the spring.

Kelly said some of the union’s proposals would significantly alter Starbucks’ operations, such as giving workers the ability to shut down mobile ordering if a store has more than five orders in the queue.

Kelly said Starbucks remained ready to talk and “believes we can move quickly to a reasonable deal.” Kelly also said surveys showed that most employees like working for the company, and its barista turnover rates are half the industry average.

Limited locations with high visibility

Unionized workers have gone on strike at Starbucks before. In 2022 and 2023, workers walked off the job on Red Cup Day. Last year, a five-day strike ahead of Christmas closed 59 U.S. stores. Each time, Starbucks said the disruption to its operations was minimal. Starbucks Workers United said the new strike is open-ended and could spread to many more unionized locations.

The number of non-union Starbucks locations dwarfs the number of unionized ones. But Todd Vachon, a union expert at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said any strike could be highly visible and educate the public on baristas’ concerns.

Unlike manufacturers, Vachon said, retail industries depend on the connection between their employees and their customers. That makes shaming a potentially powerful weapon in the union’s arsenal, he said.

Improving sales

Starbucks’ same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, rose 1% in the July-September period. It was the first time in nearly two years that the company had posted an increase. In his first year at the company, Niccol set new hospitality standards, redesigned stores to be cozier and more welcoming, and adjusted staffing levels to better handle peak hours.

Starbucks also is trying to prioritize in-store orders over mobile ones. Last week, the company’s holiday drink rollout in the U.S. was so successful that it almost immediately sold out of its glass Bearista cup. Starbucks said demand for the cup exceeded its expectations, but it wouldn’t say if the Bearista will return before the holidays are over.

[TITLE]Senate CCC reform bill also doubles marijuana possession limit:
[TEXT]
There’s buy-in across the branches now on the topic of overhauling the Cannabis Control Commission, and increasing the amount of marijuana that a person can legally possess.

The Senate budget committee on Thursday advanced a bill (S 2722) that would reorganize and shrink the regulatory commission, update limits on retail licenses, and double the amount of marijuana adults can legally possess. In doing so, Senate leaders are showing then intend to join the House in reshaping the agency.

The bill cleared the committee on a 16-0 vote, indicating it is poised for full Senate passage next week. The House in June voted 153-0 vote for a bill (H 4187) backed by House Speaker Ron Mariano of Quincy.

The Senate plans to consider the bill on Wednesday, Nov. 19, the last day for scheduled formal sessions this year under joint legislative rules.

The bill would shrink the Cannabis Control Commission from five members to three — the same size as the House proposed — but with a different power structure. Two members, including the chair, would be appointed by the governor, and one would be appointed by the attorney general. The chair’s term would match the governor’s, while the other two members would serve four-year terms.

The House bill would give the governor full control over the agency, allowing the executive to appoint all three commissioners and the chair. Senate leaders said their proposed structure “solidifies the commission’s public accountability.”

The reorganization effort comes after years of turmoil at the CCC. The commission has been dogged by public infighting, long delays in rulemaking, and the high-profile suspension and legal battle involving Chair Shannon O’Brien and Treasurer Deborah Goldberg. O’Brien won that battle with Goldberg and serves as chair again.

Under the Senate Ways and Means plan, the CCC chair would directly appoint the agency’s executive director, who would wield “independent authority over the agency’s enforcement and operational units.”

Both chambers are responding to the same root problem: a Cannabis Control Commission that’s been mired in confusion about who’s in charge.

Inspector General Jeffrey Shapiro warned last year that the agency’s structure was “unclear and self-contradictory,” a legacy of the 2016 ballot law that legalized marijuana and the 2017 legislative rewrite that expanded the CCC’s membership and divided appointment power among three constitutional officers.

The Senate Ways and Means bill also makes several changes aimed at strengthening the business side of the industry. It would allow cannabis retailers to hold up to four store licenses — one more than the current cap. The House bill goes further, proposing to raise the cap to six over three years.

The Senate version also tightens financial accountability in the marketplace.

It creates a “delinquent list” for licensees that fail to pay debts to other operators within 60 days, blocking those companies from buying new products or transferring ownership until their debts are cleared. Lawmakers say the goal is to curb instability and protect smaller businesses that have struggled to stay solvent in a crowded market.

Adults would be allowed to possess up to two ounces of marijuana — double the current limit — “in response to the fact that recreational cannabis use has been a common practice for more than seven years,” the Ways and Means fact sheet says.

The House bill also doubles the possession limit from one ounce to two ounces.

Medical marijuana rules would also loosen. The Senate committee’s proposal would end the requirement that medical licensees grow, process and sell their own product — a long-criticized vertical integration mandate that has squeezed out smaller operators. The House bill has similar language.

It would also allow patients with valid medical marijuana cards from other states to purchase cannabis in Massachusetts dispensaries.

Where the House bill sprawls into other areas — such as regulating hemp-derived beverages — the Senate version stays more narrowly focused.

The Senate committee’s proposal also directs the CCC to study the mental health outcomes of cannabis use, an acknowledgement of growing concerns about the impacts of long-term use. The report would be due by January 2027.

The Trump administration is preparing broad exemptions to certain tariffs in an effort to ease elevated food prices that have provoked anxiety for American consumers, according to three people briefed on the actions.The change would apply to certain reciprocal tariffs the president announced in April, including on products coming from countries that have not struck trade deals with the administration, the people said, discussing a pending announcement on the condition of anonymity.The exemptions are expected to include beef and citrus products, although the people cautioned that President Donald Trump has not made a final decision. The issue of foreign countries increasing beef imports has been a source of contention among U.S. ranchers, who say it runs counter to Trump's philosophy of boosting domestic production.If the proposal goes forward, it would be the latest rollback of one of the president's key economic policies over growing concerns

[TITLE]Online Design Platforms Are Charting New Revenue Streams:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Design websites have been on an upward swing since the COVID-19 pandemic ignited an appetite for all things home. And while the personal luxury goods market is expected to show a drop in revenues this year, luxury home websites are expanding their reach to a broad spectrum of clients in search of curated solutions for residential and hospitality spaces.

That sort of edge starts with offline branded and luxury residential and hospitality projects, from the deserts of the United Arab Emirates to the streets of New York City. These bespoke commissions are providing a strong new revenue stream for e-commerce players on and offline.

A prime example of how this relationship is burgeoning is The Greenwich in New York City, with which Italian design platform Artemest took a deep dive into the luxury real estate world, unveiling its first model residence concept in a penthouse valued at $13.5 million in 2024. The project’s main partners said the idea behind inviting Italian brands and designers to imbue select spaces with their signature flair was part of a broader effort to build the residence as a strong brand. This sort of strategy is echoing worldwide. It also highlights a broader effort to create a narrative within new spaces and distinguish properties with hard-to-find, rare pieces.

Earlier in November, Artemest also unveiled a fully furnished penthouse in London, located at Embassy Gardens. Inside the property, every detail — from sculptural lighting to bespoke furniture — was sourced from Artemest.

Artemest’s chief executive officer Marco Credendino said emerging markets in the Middle East, where contract business is booming, are a major driver of sales. “The business has evolved from being focused purely on residential projects to a balanced mix that includes hospitality and food and beverage. Bespoke contract work is becoming a significant part of our business,” he said.

Overall, Artemest said it expects 35 percent year-on-year growth in 2025, reaching roughly $40 million in revenue. The first half of the year has already reflected that positive trajectory, he said. “This confirms that our model — blending Italian craftsmanship with a global digital and offline presence — continues to resonate strongly with clients around the world,” Credendino said.

A Leg-up

Online operations are also able to execute projects in a way interior design firms alone cannot. An added edge for an operation like Artemest is its roster of 1,000 artisans and designers at its fingertips to choose from. The firm also has an in-house team that guides clients through every step of the project, from creative concept to delivery, working with trusted partners to bridge the gap between consumer and producer.

“What makes the difference for us is the way we approach it — every project is treated as a one-of-a-kind collaboration, where the goal is to deliver something truly exceptional and tailored. Clients today are looking for warmth, character, and a sense of identity in their public spaces, and that’s exactly what Italian craftsmanship brings: authenticity, quality, and the unmistakable touch of Made in Italy,” he said.

Competition Is Growing

In December, London-based platform Invisible Collection revealed the completion of its first bespoke interior design project for The Surrey’s private residences in New York City. Like Artemest, Invisible Collection has a similar network edge and was able to provide one-of-a-kind interior design services, affording prospective buyers access to a bespoke curation of contemporary furniture from the platform’s roster of well-known talents.

Architectural designer Laura Gonzalez, architect and interior decorator Charles Zana and architect and furniture designer Thierry Lemaire are among those who fit in with the platform’s enriched contemporary French aesthetic.

On Tuesday, Invisible Collection unveiled its exclusive partnership with luxury and branded residential development operator Rhodium, a leading adviser and operator of ultra-luxury and branded residential developments. Going forward, the two companies will offer developers and homeowners an integrated service that combines operational expertise with made-to-order interior design by some of the world’s most respected designers and artisans.

“We launched Invisible Collection with design connoisseurs and collectors in mind, thinking of all the sophisticated residential projects that call for bespoke, made-to-order creations. I think we are succeeding, as our worldwide sales are largely driven by this clientele.” Invisible Collection cofounder Isabelle Dubern-Mallevays told WWD.

Game-changing Terrain

When Milan-based Dexelance, which owns upscale furniture and lighting firms Meridiani, Davide Groppi and Gervasoni, bought Mohd, a historic furniture business and early pioneer of the online luxury design business, showrooms in the U.S. saw this as a possible game changer for Dexelance, which only recently established showrooms in New York City and Boston.

Higher Demand for Clean-Label Options Is Helpful for the Growth of the Clean-Label Products Industry

Higher demand for transparent, healthier, and organic food options is a major factor driving the growth of the clean-label products market. Products made from cleaner, organic, sustainable, and natural ingredients are in high demand among consumers lately due to their multiple health benefits. Hence, clean-label food and beverages, personal care and cosmetic products, and products from other domains are highly demanded by consumers compared to those made from artificial ingredients. Such factors help to fuel the growth of the market and allow consumers to maintain their nutritional profile and consume only natural and organic options.

Impact of AI in the Clean Label Products Market

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the clean label products market by accelerating innovation, improving transparency, and enhancing operational efficiency across the food and beverages industry. AI-powered algorithms analyze large datasets on ingredient functionality, nutritional value, and consumer preferences to identify natural alternatives to synthetic additives, preservatives, and flavorings. Machine learning models simulate ingredient interactions to optimize texture, taste, and shelf life in clean label formulations, reducing the need for chemical stabilizers while maintaining product quality. This allows manufacturers to create natural, minimally processed products that align with rising consumer demand for authenticity and health-conscious choices.

AI-driven predictive analytics optimize mixing, processing, and packaging conditions, ensuring consistency, reducing waste, and improving energy efficiency. Computer vision systems monitor ingredient purity, detect contamination, and ensure accurate labeling in real time, supporting compliance with food safety and transparency standards. AI also plays a critical role in supply chain traceability, helping track ingredient origins, sustainability certifications, and production practices to build consumer trust and meet regulatory requirements.

Trade Analysis of the Clean Label Products Market

North America: United States and Canada

The United States remains the largest market for clean label products, driven by consumers seeking transparency, natural ingredients, and minimal processing. According to NielsenIQ and Innova Market Insights, over 60 percent of U.S. consumers actively check product ingredient lists before purchase.

The clean label movement has integrated deeply into packaged food, snacks, and beverages, creating demand for imported natural colors, stabilizers, and sweeteners from Asia and Latin America. The U.S. food retail and consumer packaged goods market, valued at over 2 trillion dollars, offers strong growth for clean label claims.

For trade players: focus on compliant ingredient documentation such as non-GMO and natural origin certifications, clean label reformulation consultancy, and small-batch import models that cater to artisanal and health-focused brands.

Europe: Western and Northern Europe

Europe remains the global benchmark for clean label standards, with the EU’s Food Information to Consumers (FIC) regulation enforcing detailed ingredient transparency. Western Europe shows strong maturity in clean label categories, while Northern Europe drives innovation in organic and additive-free products.

Growth in the region is steady but driven more by product reformulation than new launches. Local ingredient suppliers in France, Germany, and the Netherlands have started exporting clean label starches, plant-based texturizers, and natural preservatives globally.

Trade advice: all import consignments should carry complete traceability records, allergen information, and third-party certifications such as BRCGS or IFS to facilitate entry into EU distribution networks. Multilingual packaging remains essential for retail integration.

Asia Pacific: China, India, Japan, ASEAN

Asia Pacific has become both a production hub and an emerging consumer base for clean label products. Rising middle-class incomes and growing health awareness have accelerated the shift toward minimally processed, additive-free foods in countries like China and India.

China’s e-commerce-driven food trade and Japan’s regulatory support for natural additives make the region a growing importer and exporter simultaneously. India and ASEAN nations serve as suppliers of natural ingredients such as herbal extracts, native starches, and fruit concentrates to North American and European manufacturers.

Trade focus: invest in clean label ingredient processing zones with export certification, strengthen quality traceability, and adapt packaging for both bulk B2B exports and retail-ready SKUs tailored to regional e-commerce growth.

Latin America: Brazil, Mexico, Others

Latin America’s clean label market is still developing but shows notable progress in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. Consumers are shifting toward natural sweeteners and preservative-free foods, particularly in beverages and bakery applications.

Regional supply advantages, such as tropical fruit bases, cocoa, and natural flavoring sources, support exports of raw materials for clean label formulation. However, higher logistics costs and fragmented distribution remain constraints.

Strategy: exporters should position offerings through regional distributors with established retail and foodservice networks. Pricing flexibility and localized labeling in Portuguese and Spanish can improve penetration in mid-market product tiers.

Middle East and Africa

Clean label adoption in the GCC region is growing within premium product categories, particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where consumers associate natural and organic claims with product quality and safety. Imports mainly consist of packaged foods and beverages from Europe and North America.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, the clean label trend is nascent but gradually building, supported by urban retail expansion and rising disposable incomes among younger consumers.

Logistic recommendation: consolidate shipments through GCC trade hubs to serve broader MEA markets, utilize bonded warehousing for re-export flexibility, and partner with local distributors to navigate halal certification and label translation requirements.

[TITLE]Reviva Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results and Recent Business Highlights:
[TEXT]
– Pre-NDA meeting with FDA to discuss brilaroxazine’s path to approval for schizophrenia planned in Q4 2025 –

– Potential NDA submission for schizophrenia indication targeted for Q2 2026 –

– European patent granted covering use of brilaroxazine for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis adds to existing patent protection in key global markets –

CUPERTINO, Calif., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reviva Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: RVPH) (“Reviva” or the “Company”), a late-stage pharmaceutical company developing therapies that seek to address unmet medical needs in the areas of central nervous system (CNS), inflammatory and cardiometabolic diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025 and summarized recent business highlights.

“With the comprehensive clinical and non-clinical data package in hand, we believe brilaroxazine is strongly positioned to meet New Drug Application (NDA) filing requirements and advance toward potential registration for schizophrenia,” said Laxminarayan Bhat, Ph.D., Founder, President, and CEO of Reviva. “The consistent body of evidence for brilaroxazine, from early clinical studies through long-term extension studies, continues to demonstrate broad-spectrum, durable efficacy, a favorable safety profile, and strong long-term adherence with once-daily dosing. We are preparing for a pre-NDA meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the fourth quarter of the year and continue to target a potential NDA submission in the second quarter of 2026. We believe brilaroxazine’s differentiated clinical profile has the potential to redefine treatment expectations in schizophrenia and significantly improve patient outcomes worldwide.”

Clinical Program and Business Highlights

European Patent (EP3749324) granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) covering use of brilaroxazine for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), adding to Reviva’s existing patent protection in key markets around the world including the United States, China and Japan. Brilaroxazine previously received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of IPF in July 2024.

Announced a positive full dataset and successful completion of the Company’s Phase 3 RECOVER open-label extension (OLE) 1-year study evaluating the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of brilaroxazine in patients with schizophrenia (N=446) in June 2025 and additional analyses in October 2025. A summary of the OLE results is provided here:

Once daily brilaroxazine (pooled 15, 30, and 50 mg, N=159) in patient population completed one year treatment, led to robust broad-spectrum efficacy that was sustained over 1-year including PANSS total score (–18.1), positive symptoms (–5.0), negative symptoms (–4.4), negative symptoms Marder factor (-4.4), general psychopathology (-8.7), personal & social performance (11.3) and CGI-S (-0.8, a ≥1 point improvement in 78% of patients) No clinically meaningful changes in movement disorder scales used for evaluating motor side effects such as akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms. Benign weight gain (~1.5 kg) compared to baseline over 52 weeks (1 year treatment). The weight gain is not dose-dependent and possibly related to lifestyle or diet Favorable and consistent improvement in lipid profile, and blood sugar levels were comparable to baseline over 52 weeks (1 year) across all 3 dose groups Not associated with hormonal imbalance and sexual side effects. Elevated prolactin levels reported at the beginning of the study were significantly reduced to normal or near normal in all three dose groups. Improvement in thyroid hormone levels and sexual function reported No incidence of clinically significant cardiac or gastrointestinal side effects. No incidence of drug induced liver injury (DILI) Generally well tolerated with a discontinuation rate of 35% after 1-year for pooled doses of brilaroxazine

Continuing efforts have aimed at expansion of strong diversified patent portfolio comprising composition of matter and lifecycle management strategies for innovative formulations and method of treatment for different major indications.

Completed public equity offering raising gross proceeds of $9.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses.

Presented a poster presentation on negative symptom data for brilaroxazine from the Phase 3 RECOVER double-blind trial in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia, and from the long-term open-label extension trial in clinically stable schizophrenia patients at the Central Nervous System (CNS) Summit in Boston, MA, November 2-5, 2025

Scheduled to present a late-breaking poster presentation on the anti-inflammatory biomarker data for brilaroxazine from the Phase 3 RECOVER double-blind trial in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia, and from the long-term open-label extension trial in clinically stable schizophrenia patients at the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA, November 15-19, 2025

Anticipated Milestones and Events

Planned meeting with FDA to discuss brilaroxazine’s path to approval in Q4 2025

Potential NDA submission for brilaroxazine in schizophrenia targeted in Q2 2026

[TITLE]RenovoRx Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results, Including Approximately $900,000 in Year-to-Date Revenue, and Provides Business Update:
[TEXT]
September 30, 2025 Cash and Cash Equivalents at $10 million

Revenue Expected to Grow in 2026 and Continue to Offset Cash Burn

Management to Host Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. ET

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RenovoRx, Inc . (Nasdaq: RNXT) (“RenovoRx” or the “Company”), a life sciences company developing innovative targeted oncology therapies and commercializing RenovoCath®, a novel, FDA-cleared drug-delivery device, today announced its financial results and provided a business update to shareholders for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

“We continue to make strong progress both in our commercial and clinical activities,” said Shaun Bagai, CEO of RenovoRx. “On the commercial side, we are encouraged by the continued RenovoCath clinical adoption we are seeing in the field. Year-to-date revenue, through the end of the third quarter, was approximately $900,000, reflecting the growing clinical need and market demand for targeted drug-delivery solutions. Since organically launching commercial sales less than a year ago, we have expanded from five centers at the start of 2025 to 14 leading cancer centers now approved to purchase RenovoCath, including several that have already made repeat orders.”

“With the recent hiring of Philip Stocton as Senior Director of Sales & Market Development and two regional sales managers, we are building the foundation for sustained growth while maintaining a lean operating structure and prudent capital deployment philosophy,” continued Mr. Bagai. “Our team remains laser-focused on strategic, data-driven expansion and is encouraged by the increasing physician-to-physician advocacy for our TAMP™ (Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion) platform as we continue to position RenovoRx for long-term success. Our mission continues with the goal of integrating an approach to therapeutic drug-delivery into the standard of care and ultimately improving patient outcomes by offering a more targeted and tolerable treatment path.”

“On the clinical side, we continue to advance our Phase III TIGeR-PaC trial towards enrollment completion in early 2026 and final data readout in 2027, and we’ve successfully launched a new post-marketing registry study from which we expect to garner real-world evidence on the use of the RenovoCath device. We look forward to continuing our progress in the Phase III trial and post-market registry study as we seek to drive value for our shareholders,” concluded Mr. Bagai.

Commercialization Update

RenovoRx continued to execute on its RenovoCath commercialization strategy in the third quarter of 2025, demonstrating progress as year-to-date revenue grew to approximately $900,000. Although small revenue fluctuations can be expected quarter-by-quarter at this early stage of commercialization, the positive trends of expanding approved cancer center customers and increasing clinical adoption are very promising.

As of November 7, 2025, RenovoRx has expanded from five cancer center customers approved to purchase RenovoCath at the start of the year to 14 customers. These include additional high-volume National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated cancer centers and community hospitals. The growth in patient procedures using RenovoCath at five active centers has led to an increase in repeat purchase orders, underscoring both physician satisfaction and growing demand. In addition to these 14 centers now approved to purchase RenovoCath, the Company has delivered product quotes to 10 additional leading centers across the nation, bringing the total to 24 centers who have formally requested quotes for RenovoCath. In addition, RenovoRx has engaged with dozens of physicians, both at various medical conferences and within their institutions, who have expressed commercial interest in utilizing RenovoCath for their patients.

Since organically launching commercial sales less than a year ago without a dedicated sales and marketing team, RenovoRx has achieved early commercial traction that reflects the strong clinical need for targeted drug-delivery solutions designed to reduce systemic toxicity and improve quality of life. The Company’s small but growing team has established a diverse domestic geographic network of academic institutions, NCI-designated cancer centers, and high-volume community hospitals, both successfully implementing and interested in utilizing RenovoCath-enabled TAMP technology.

RenovoRx continues to collect valuable market insights, including sales cycle trends, activation timelines, customer preferences, and other commercial data, as the Company seeks to grow its customer base, fulfill repeat RenovoCath orders, and build a strong foundation for long-term commercial growth. These insights from the first year of commercialization will inform the Company’s strategy and execution plans heading into 2026.

To strengthen and expand the Company’s commercial efforts, in August 2025, RenovoRx announced the hiring of Philip Stocton as Senior Director of Sales and Market Development. Mr. Stocton brings more than 25 years of MedTech leadership, including a decade focused on interventional oncology. His expertise has been invaluable as the Company continues to broaden its footprint across the U.S., while maintaining a lean operating structure. In alignment with the existing budget and to respond to growing demand, the Company has added two regional sales managers and plans to add a marketing director to drive additional physician engagement by the end of the year.

RenovoRx continues to estimate that the initial total addressable market (TAM) for RenovoCath as a stand-alone device represents an approximately $400 million peak annual U.S. sales opportunity, with long-term, several-billion-dollar potential as the platform expands into additional solid tumor indications.

RenovoRx recently launched a commercial website for clinicians and staff to learn more

Recent Business Highlights

COVID-19 Vaccine Developments

In November 2025, entered into an exclusive, worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Dynavax Technologies Corporation, for the rights to the Company’s COVID-19 oral vaccine candidate. Received an upfront license fee of $25 million plus a $5 million equity investment at a per share price premium to market pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement.

Vaxart will retain full operational and financial responsibility for the oral COVID-19 vaccine program through the completion of the ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial and the subsequent End of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); In addition, after receiving the results of the Phase 2b clinical trial, Dynavax will pay an additional fee of $50 million to Vaxart, unless Dynavax elects not to assume responsibility for continued clinical development of the oral COVID-19 vaccine program (in which case, the license agreement will terminate); and In addition, if Dynavax elects to assume responsibility for the continued development of the oral COVID-19 program, Vaxart may be entitled to receive up to $195 million in potential future regulatory milestone payments, up to $425 million in potential future net sales milestone payments, and tiered royalties at rates in the low-to-mid teens on potential future net sales of oral COVID-19 vaccines.

Vaxart completed enrollment of approximately 5,400 participants for the COVID-19 Phase 2b trial. Vaxart continues all work as planned with the per protocol follow-up of all participants dosed. Participants are being monitored for up to 12 months post-vaccination to assess safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Topline data is anticipated in late 2026. Data from the 400-person sentinel cohort is anticipated in the first quarter of 2026. As of September 30, 2025, the Company has received $125.9 million of cash payments associated with this award.

Norovirus Vaccine Developments

In September 2025, Vaxart announced additional Phase 1 data supporting the potential efficacy of its second-generation norovirus oral pill vaccine candidate. Research demonstrated that second-generation constructs induce robust increases in fecal IgA, which was shown to be correlated with protection against infection in the company’s previous Phase 2b challenge study. Vaxart intends to publish the complete results of this study in a peer-reviewed journal. Data was presented at the 9th International Calicivirus Conference, World Vaccine Congress and IDWeek 2025.

Financial Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2025

Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $28.8 million as of September 30, 2025.

The increase is primarily due to an increase in clinical trial expenses related to Vaxart’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, partially offset by a decrease in preclinical, manufacturing expenses and personnel costs.

General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2024.

Vaxart reported a net loss of $8.1 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $14.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. Net loss per share for the third quarter of 2025 was $0.04, compared to a net loss of $0.06 per share for the third quarter of 2024.

[TITLE]Govt withdraws BIS norms on polyester chain, polymers; user industry cites relief on costs for MSMEs:
[TEXT]
The Centre has withdrawn quality control orders (QCOs) on a wide range of polyester and petrochemical inputs, in a move that spells relief for user industries such as apparel and footwear, while raising competition from imports for local manufacturers of these key inputs.

QCOs issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) subject manufacturers and importers of specific goods to certain standards. While they ensure greater quality, they also raise costs, which cascade down to industries which use these raw materials.

The order from the department of chemicals and petrochemicals comes after a Niti Aayog committee led by former cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba recommended relaxing QCOs. These orders raise costs for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which import them in large quantities.

While the withdrawal will make raw materials accessible for makers of textiles and PVC products, it may impact manufacturers such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and the Aditya Birla Group companies Grasim and Thai Acrylic Fibre.

Queries sent to Indian Oil and the Aditya Birla Group remained unanswered till press time.

Reliance has always priced its products keeping the long-term growth of textile industry in mind, a company spokesperson said in an email. "This has been our philosophy from the from the day we started manufacturing products & polyester and integrated backwards. We welcome the decision of the government, and we will continue to stay competitive offering the best quality products to the downstream industry for domestic and value-added export market."

The withdrawal of QCOs fulfils an MSME industry wish, significantly benefiting textile makers, said Rahul Mehta, chief mentor of the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India. However, it also goes against the government's original plan to expand the ambit of QCOs to cover more products.

The raw materials now free of QCOs are used to make man-made fibres, plastics, packaging, footwear, consumer goods, appliances and automotive components. Several of them such as PTA, MEG, polypropylene, PVC and ABS are among India’s most critical chemical imports, sourced from China, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Thailand and Singapore. Products like polyester staple fibre, POY and FDY also rely on imports during periods of domestic shortage, particularly from China and Indonesia.

Welcome decision

Just last week, the Chemicals and Petrochemicals Manufacturers Association had written to the government, making a strong case for QCOs. While industries abroad benefitted from state subsidies, India's QCOs helped counter them, the association had said. On Thursday, the association did not respond to a query

[TITLE]Global retail rebound lifts outlook for Indian apparel exporters:
[TEXT]
Global retail demand is showing signs of recovery, signaling a potential turnaround for Indian garment exporters. Leading players such as Gokaldas Exports and Pearl Global Industries are reworking their strategies, diversifying markets, expanding production bases outside India, and positioning for trade advantages under proposed free trade agreements (FTAs).

The companies, in post-Q2 investor calls, indicated that order inflows from key markets such as the US and Europe have begun to stabilise, with new business emerging from regions like Japan and Australia. This, combined with the ongoing sourcing diversification by global retailers, is expected to set the stage for a steadier growth cycle for Indian exporters.

“In the longer term, sourcing diversification is a key theme for all customers. With likely tariff rationalisation, India will remain one of the top contenders among Asian peers,” said Sivaramakrishnan Ganapathi, Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of Gokaldas Exports.

“The recently announced India-UK FTA offers a 12 per cent duty advantage over China and puts India on par with Bangladesh, creating strong export potential. A trade deal with the EU could open significant opportunities as well,” he added.

Gokaldas, which has been expanding its footprint in the UK and EU, is witnessing growing visibility from its Africa operations, leveraging the low-tariff regime and potential renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Currently, Africa contributes

[TITLE]Global companies are still committing to protect the climate – and they’re investing big money in clean tech:
[TEXT]
The Trump administration has given corporations plenty of convenient excuses to retreat from their climate commitments, with its moves to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, roll back emissions regulations, and scale back clean energy incentives.

But will the world’s largest corporations follow its lead?

Some multinational companies have indeed scaled back. For instance, Wells Fargo dropped its goal for the companies the bank finances to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, saying the conditions necessary for meeting that goal, such as policy certainty, consumer behavior and the pace of clean technology development, hadn’t fully materialized. Oil giant BP told investors that earlier optimism

[TITLE]Online Design Platforms Are Charting New Revenue Streams:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Design websites have been on an upward swing since the COVID-19 pandemic ignited an appetite for all things home. And while the personal luxury goods market is expected to show a drop in revenues this year, luxury home websites are expanding their reach to a broad spectrum of clients in search of curated solutions for residential and hospitality spaces.

That sort of edge starts with offline branded and luxury residential and hospitality projects, from the deserts of the United Arab Emirates to the streets of New York City. These bespoke commissions are providing a strong new revenue stream for e-commerce players on and offline.

A prime example of how this relationship is burgeoning is The Greenwich in New York City, with which Italian design platform Artemest took a deep dive into the luxury real estate world, unveiling its first model residence concept in a penthouse valued at $13.5 million in 2024. The project’s main partners said the idea behind inviting Italian brands and designers to imbue select spaces with their signature flair was part of a broader effort to build the residence as a strong brand. This sort of strategy is echoing worldwide. It also highlights a broader effort to create a narrative within new spaces and distinguish properties with hard-to-find, rare pieces.

Earlier in November, Artemest also unveiled a fully furnished penthouse in London, located at Embassy Gardens. Inside the property, every detail — from sculptural lighting to bespoke furniture — was sourced from Artemest.

Artemest’s chief executive officer Marco Credendino said emerging markets in the Middle East, where contract business is booming, are a major driver of sales. “The business has evolved from being focused purely on residential projects to a balanced mix that includes hospitality and food and beverage. Bespoke contract work is becoming a significant part of our business,” he said.

Overall, Artemest said it expects 35 percent year-on-year growth in 2025, reaching roughly $40 million in revenue. The first half of the year has already reflected that positive trajectory, he said. “This confirms that our model — blending Italian craftsmanship with a global digital and offline presence — continues to resonate strongly with clients around the world,” Credendino said.

A Leg-up

Online operations are also able to execute projects in a way interior design firms alone cannot. An added edge for an operation like Artemest is its roster of 1,000 artisans and designers at its fingertips to choose from. The firm also has an in-house team that guides clients through every step of the project, from creative concept to delivery, working with trusted partners to bridge the gap between consumer and producer.

“What makes the difference for us is the way we approach it — every project is treated as a one-of-a-kind collaboration, where the goal is to deliver something truly exceptional and tailored. Clients today are looking for warmth, character, and a sense of identity in their public spaces, and that’s exactly what Italian craftsmanship brings: authenticity, quality, and the unmistakable touch of Made in Italy,” he said.

Competition Is Growing

In December, London-based platform Invisible Collection revealed the completion of its first bespoke interior design project for The Surrey’s private residences in New York City. Like Artemest, Invisible Collection has a similar network edge and was able to provide one-of-a-kind interior design services, affording prospective buyers access to a bespoke curation of contemporary furniture from the platform’s roster of well-known talents.

Architectural designer Laura Gonzalez, architect and interior decorator Charles Zana and architect and furniture designer Thierry Lemaire are among those who fit in with the platform’s enriched contemporary French aesthetic.

On Tuesday, Invisible Collection unveiled its exclusive partnership with luxury and branded residential development operator Rhodium, a leading adviser and operator of ultra-luxury and branded residential developments. Going forward, the two companies will offer developers and homeowners an integrated service that combines operational expertise with made-to-order interior design by some of the world’s most respected designers and artisans.

“We launched Invisible Collection with design connoisseurs and collectors in mind, thinking of all the sophisticated residential projects that call for bespoke, made-to-order creations. I think we are succeeding, as our worldwide sales are largely driven by this clientele.” Invisible Collection cofounder Isabelle Dubern-Mallevays told WWD.

Game-changing Terrain

When Milan-based Dexelance, which owns upscale furniture and lighting firms Meridiani, Davide Groppi and Gervasoni, bought Mohd, a historic furniture business and early pioneer of the online luxury design business, showrooms in the U.S. saw this as a possible game changer for Dexelance, which only recently established showrooms in New York City and Boston.
