[TITLE]Enugu, EU deepen partnership to boost education, energy, infrastructure:
[TEXT]
The Enugu State Government and the European Union have renewed commitments to deepen cooperation across key sectors of the state’s economy, including education, energy, infrastructure, and youth development.

This followed a courtesy visit to Governor Peter Mbah at Government House, Enugu, by a high-powered EU delegation led by the EU Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Mr Gautier Mignot, according to a statement released by the governor’s media office on Saturday.

The team also included the Belgian Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Pieter Leenknegt; the Portuguese Ambassador, Mr Paulos Martins dos Santos; and several senior European diplomats.

Speaking during the meeting, Ambassador Mignot said the EU was eager to expand a partnership that aligns directly with the transformational policies of the Mbah administration.

“The purpose of our visit is to meet you, pay our respects, and discuss how to strengthen the partnership between the European Union and Enugu State. We are very interested in areas where our projects meet your administration’s expectations and long-term vision,” he said.

Mignot highlighted ongoing collaborations in the education and energy sectors, describing Enugu as one of the EU’s key beneficiary states.

“In the energy sector, the Solar for Health project is already under implementation. Under this programme, Enugu will receive technical assistance and funding for 20 solar microgrids to power 20 primary healthcare centres and 124 small and medium-sized enterprises,” he explained.

He also noted that the Small Hydro Power for Agro-industrial Sectors Project, implemented by UNIDO, and the Nigeria Energy Support Programme of GIZ were supporting electrification efforts, investment advisory services, and capacity building.

“Three interconnected minigrids of up to 1 MW capacity will also be funded to electrify at least 1,000 beneficiaries,” Mignot added.

On education, he announced that Enugu had been selected as one of the states to benefit from the Education and Youth Empowerment in Nigeria (EISS) programme implemented by UNESCO.

“The programme will train teachers in Smart Green Schools until June 2028. Building resilience and capacity among teachers is central to our goals,” the EU envoy said.

He also referenced the EU’s support for the Eastern Nigeria International Film Festival (ENIFF), describing it as a key platform for creative and cultural exchange.

“The 2025 edition in Enugu provided training for aspiring filmmakers and awarded grants for short film projects. We value this growing partnership with the creative industry,” Mignot noted.

Belgian Ambassador Pieter Leenknegt pointed to Belgium’s long-standing economic footprint in Enugu, particularly through Emenite Limited — a joint venture established in 1961.

“Emenite has over 300 employees from this region. It remains a shining example of Belgian–Nigerian cooperation. We want to continue strengthening this relationship,” he said.

Portuguese Ambassador Paulos Martins dos Santos emphasised Portugal’s wide-ranging interest in Nigeria’s energy, agricultural, and infrastructure sectors.

“The footprint of the European Union in this country is huge and multidimensional. Portugal looks forward to enhancing its contribution to this partnership, especially in areas that complement Enugu’s development plans,” he stressed.

In his remarks, Governor Mbah praised the EU for aligning its programmes with his administration’s development priorities.

“I see a strong synergy between our vision in Enugu and the EU’s programmes across Africa. Our investment of over 33 per cent of our total budget in education is deliberate. If we fail to equip our children today, we will pay ten times more in the future,” he said.

He also invited EU member states to explore emerging investment opportunities in Enugu’s aviation, natural gas, and energy sectors.

“We have launched Enugu Air, and the international wing of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport will soon become operational. We encourage you to speak to your home carriers to begin to consider direct flights to Enugu,” the governor announced.

On the state’s gas infrastructure ambitions, Mbah added: “We are working with the Federal Government to expand the gas pipeline infrastructure. This will unlock enormous economic opportunities in the gas subsector. Enugu is open for business, and we will do everything necessary to ensure investments succeed.”

The visit ended with both parties reaffirming their commitment to sustained collaboration aimed at accelerating development and improving livelihoods across Enugu State.

[TITLE]From Nigeria to Namibia, Africa’s Energy Revival Draws a Flood of New Capital:
[TEXT]
Many of the resource-rich countries in Africa have intensified efforts to become more attractive for exploration and production (E&P) investment. Reforms in licensing rounds, production sharing contracts, and fiscal policy are improving investor returns and are set to drive $41 billion in upstream investment in 2026, the African Energy Chamber’s State of African Energy 2026 Outlook shows.

From legacy oil producers Nigeria and Angola to emerging exploration hotspots such as Namibia, African resource holders are looking to compete with other regions for the billions of U.S. dollars that foreign investors could pour into their energy and minerals sectors.

Long-time producers, including the biggest oil producers Nigeria, Libya, and Angola, have made their licensing and fiscal policy more attractive, and emerging wannabe producers are offering incentives. All African countries are betting on boosting natural gas exploration, production, and development amid growing demand for gas and LNG for domestic use and for exports to Europe and Asia.

“The continent offers compelling opportunities for investors who are prepared to engage in a transparent, regulated, and increasingly competitive E&P landscape,” AEC executive chairman NJ Ayuk said in a statement.

“Governments and operators must continue to balance national priorities with investor confidence to unlock Africa’s vast hydrocarbon potential.”

Reforms in recent years have allowed Angola to improve its above-ground risk score since 2017, reflecting extensive regulatory and institutional reforms. Angola’s fiscal incentives, including terms for gas, marginal fields, and incremental production, have successfully attracted upstream investment, consolidating its status as a continental leader, AEC’s report said.

Related: Global Supply Woes Push Copper Past $11,400 Per Ton

While Angola is trying to reverse years of falling oil production, it bets big on standalone gas development and has just launched its first plant to process non-associated natural gas.

Angola also looks to accelerate the permitting phase of new minerals projects to attract investment. In October, Angola launched production at its first major copper mine, Tetelo, as the country looks to diversify into critical minerals.

Nigeria, the top oil producer in Africa, is auctioning 50 oil and gas blocks, eyeing $10 billion in new investments over the next ten years and 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in additional production capacity.

Nigeria’s licensing program with updated terms and incentives targeting specific terrains and resource types has renewed interest in projects in the country and has boosted investor confidence in the upstream potential, evidenced in recent project approvals by Shell and TotalEnergies, AEC said.

Senegal and Cote d’Ivoire in West Africa have also attracted the interest and investment of the international majors.

Cote d’Ivoire has seen majors expand offshore development, and its huge oil and gas field Baleine started up production two years after discovery, thanks to Italy’s Eni.

According to the African Energy Chamber, Cote d’Ivoire maintains a pragmatic approach to foreign investment and regardless of the outcome of the 2025 presidential election, authorities are expected to continue supporting upstream investors while emphasizing adherence to local content requirements, particularly for offshore developments.

[TITLE]‘Drill, Baby, Drill’: Europe Aims To Reduce Reliance on US LNG:
[TEXT]
Notions of renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gases are nice, but costly energy prices are forcing a shift in Europe’s priorities.

Reuters reported this week that two members of the European Union — Greece and Italy — and the UK are loosening their opposition to new oil and gas drilling, even as the continent builds out renewables to slash greenhouse gas emissions and meet climate targets.

Greece in November issued its first offshore oil and gas exploration license in more than 40 years to a trio of companies including Exxon Mobil. The Block 2 license in the Ionian Sea could hold up to 200 billion cubic meters of gas; drilling is expected to begin in late 2026 or 2027.

The country also awarded Chevron and Helleniq Energy exploration rights in the blocks south of the Peloponnese peninsula, Reuters said.

The Italian government too is considering reviving offshore oil and gas exploration, which it shelved in 2019.

And in Britain, the UK government last week loosened its ban on new exploration activity in the North Sea; companies will be allowed to expand production in existing fields. Reuters said the government is expected to give the green light to two major new fields in the coming months.

Meanwhile, a major discovery in Poland earlier this year has sparked interest in the country’s offshore prospects, while in Norway, state-owned Equinor plans to drill 250 exploration wells over the next decade.

Related: Saudi Arabia Starts Natural Gas Production at Giant Jafurah Project

EU member countries bucking the trend include Denmark, which banned all new exploration in 2020; and the Netherlands, which nixed new onshore fields in 2023 but still allows offshore exploration.

The change in tack caused by the 2022 energy shock when Russia invaded Ukraine means that natural gas will likely be part of Europe’s energy paradigm for decades.

Reuters said the European Union depends on gas imports for 85% of its consumption, according to Eurostat, compared with a peak domestic production of 50% of demand in the 1990s.

The top importing country is the United States by far. An October Reuters article said the United States will supply around 70% of Europe's LNG in 2026-2029, up from 58% so far this year, as the EU plans to ban Russian LNG from 2027 and Russian gas from 2028, Energy Aspects analysts said.

The US today accounts for 16.5% of the EU’s total gas consumption.

(It’s important to note that, despite Western sanctions on Russia, the EU still buys plenty of gas from there. In fact, it was the bloc’s second-largest importer of LNG in 2024. The EU has imposed several sanctions on Russian energy products since the war started, but not on natural gas delivered for direct use by member states (neither piped nor LNG), states Cipher News.

Europe’s dependency on US LNG is increasing due to lower storage and a decline in pipeline flows from Russia and Algeria. The continent will need to import up to 160 additional LNG cargoes this winter. LNG imports will jump from 820 tankers this year from 660 last year, representing 48% of all EU gas supply, Reuters said.

Developing domestic energy sources could reduce Europe’s reliance on gas imports and potentially lower the costs of foreign fuel. According to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), The EU paid

Oil, defence and geopolitics: Why Putin is visiting Modi in Delhi

Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived for a two-day visit to India, where he was embraced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of an annual summit held by both countries. Delhi and Moscow are expected to sign a number of deals during the visit, which comes months after the US increased pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil. It also comes as US President Donald Trump's administration holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to end the war. India and Russia have been close allies for decades and Putin and Modi share a warm relationship. Here's a look at why they both need each other - and what to watch for as they meet.

Watch: What do India, Russia want from Putin's visit? BBC reporters discuss

A special friendship, trade deals and geopolitics

By Steve Rosenberg Why are relations with India key for the Kremlin? Well, for a start, look at the numbers: a population of nearly a billion and a half. economic growth exceeding 8%. India is the world's fastest growing major economy. That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil. India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian. That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market. India was happy. Washington less so. Earlier this year, the Trump administration slapped an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying. For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems. Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers. But there's geopolitics at play, too. The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed. Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that. So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders smiling and chatting together sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a "multi-polar world". Russia lauds its "no limits partnership" with China. It is just as vocal

[TITLE]Europe strikes a deal to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027:
[TEXT]
Brussels Reuters —

The European Union agreed Wednesday to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decade-long dependency on Russian energy.

Representatives for EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement in the early hours of Wednesday on proposals set out by the European Commission in June to end shipments from the EU’s former top gas supplier following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move toward a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.

“Today, we are stopping these imports permanently,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement. “By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

For short-term contracts concluded before June 17 this year, the prohibition will apply from April 25, 2026, for LNG and from June 17, 2026, for pipeline gas.

For long-term contracts concluded before June 17, the cut-off dates will be the start of 2027 and the start of October 2026, with a possible one-month extension for EU members facing difficulties reaching required storage levels.

As of October, Russia accounted for 12% of EU gas imports, down from 45% before its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Hungary, France and Belgium among the countries still receiving supplies.

The European Commission is also committed to phasing out remaining oil imports from Russia by the end of 2027, with a legislative proposal to be presented early next year.

Under Wednesday’s agreement, EU members will submit “national diversification plans” regarding oil and gas supplies to the commission by March 1, and will be required to notify the EU executive whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national bans in place.

The commission will issue recommendations based on this feedback.

Vulcan Energy Resources has received a financing package of €2.2bn ($2.57bn) to completely fund the construction and development of phase one of the Lionheart lithium and renewable energy project in the Upper Rhine Valley, Germany.

With this financing in place, the Vulcan board has approved the final investment decision (FID) for phase one of the Lionheart project.

Execution of the project is set to begin in the coming days.

Vulcan stated that phase one of the Lionheart project is expected to position the company as a “key enabler” of Europe’s battery and electric vehicle (EV) supply chain, and as a “climate champion” by delivering low-cost lithium and renewable energy for Europe.

Phase one of Lionheart features the development of an integrated lithium and renewable energy facility. The project aims to achieve an annual production capacity of 24,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM), which is sufficient to supply approximately 500,000 EV batteries each year.

In addition to lithium production, the project is designed to generate 275 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of renewable power and 560GWh of heat annually for local consumers, with an expected operational lifespan of around 30 years.

[TITLE]Rosslare Europort to seek planning permission for €220m offshore renewable energy hub:
[TEXT]
ROSSLARE EUROPORT ARE to submit a planning application to build the country’s largest offshore renewable energy hub at the harbour in Co Wexford.

The plans for the Rosslare Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Hub will be submitted to An Coimisiún Pleanála next week.

Iarnród Éireann, the port authority for Rosslare, said the €220m development would create 2,000 long-term jobs for the region in port construction, offshore wind construction and long-term operation and maintenance phases of offshore wind development.

It will also support Ireland’s growing offshore wind industry and energy targets and make Rosslare Harbour into Ireland’s primary base for the construction, operation and maintenance of offshore wind farms in the Irish and Celtic Seas, it said.

The Programme for Government has committed to delivering at least 5GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030.

The Rosslare hub will have the potential to support the installation of approximately 0.5GW to 1GW of offshore wind capacity each year.

Spanning 80 hectares, the hub would include two new heavy‑lift berths specifically designed for offshore renewable energy components, extensive areas for storage, marshalling and assembly and a new 64-berth, small boat harbour.

It would also include new access roads, utilities, environmental enhancements and facilities for local marine users, including the Rosslare Sea Scouts.

The planned works involve 50 hectares of dredging, 32 hectares of land reclamation, including the creation of 19.7 hectares of new port lands capable of handling the largest wind turbine components.

Iarnród Éireann said these will enable Rosslare to serve multiple offshore wind projects underway in the Irish and Celtic Seas and “deliver long-term economic and employment benefits” to Co Wexford and the southeast.

It said it aims to commence construction in early 2027 subject to planning being granted and funding allocated, with the delivery target set for early 2029.

CEO Mary Considine said the project marks “a once in a generation investment in Ireland’s clean energy future, integrating national transport and maritime infrastructure”.

Glenn Carr, director of commercial business units with Iarnród Éireann, said delivering the project “will support the continued expansion Rosslare Europort, strengthen the local economy, support local employment and deliver on national and EU policy priorities”.

The project has been co-funded to planning stage by the EU Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).

[TITLE]TVA, Holtec to Get Up To $800MM in DOE Funding for SMR Development:
[TEXT]
The funding will help 'advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan and help expand the nation's capacity while facilitating additional follow-on projects and associated supply chains'.

The United States Department of Energy (DOE) on Tuesday announced funding for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Holtec Government Services to support the development of light-water small modular reactors (SMRs).

"The project teams will receive up to $800 million in federal cost-shared funding to advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan and help expand the nation's capacity while facilitating additional follow-on projects and associated supply chains", DOE said in an online statement.

"The selections announced today will help deliver new nuclear generation in the early 2030s, strengthen domestic supply chains and advance President Trump's executive orders to usher in a nuclear renaissance and expand America’s energy dominance agenda".

TVA has been allotted up to $400 million to advance the deployment of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee and additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl, DOE said.

"TVA is the first utility in the U.S. to have a construction permit application for a BWRX-300 SMR accepted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission", TVA said separately. "The Clinch River project will serve as a national model for how to deploy SMRs safely, efficiently and affordably - laying the groundwork for a new era of American nuclear energy leadership".

TVA president and chief executive Don Moul said, "As AI, data centers and digital infrastructure drive unprecedented energy demand, we're building our nation’s nuclear energy foundation right here in the Tennessee Valley".

Holtec is also getting up to $400 million to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan. "Holtec is pursuing an innovative one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator and electricity merchant selling the power to nearby utilities and end-users", DOE said.

Holtec said separately, "As part of the program, DOE will provide milestone-based cost-share support that is intended to advance licensing, pre-construction and supply-chain mobilization for the Palisades SMR-300 project".

"Holtec's proposal includes a multi-site deployment pathway that establishes a repeatable, fleet-scale model - a core requirement of the Tier 1 program [under the Generation III+ SMR Program] intended to drive down costs and shorten construction durations through standardization and manufacturing efficiency", Holtec said.

The selections resulted from the DOE's $900-million offer last March to derisk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs.

"[T]he remaining $100 million will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain and site readiness", DOE said.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said, "Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the president’s manufacturing boom, support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid".

[TITLE]A solar glut is building in India. Can the industry withstand China-style pain?:
[TEXT]
From the industrial belts of Gujarat to the outskirts of Bengaluru, factories are churning out solar panels by the millions, their glassy surfaces stacked and shipped across the country. Utility developers, homeowners and farmers are lapping them up, feeding the surge in India’s clean energy push.

For years, India has been hailed as the world’s most credible challenger to China’s command over the solar supply chain. Backed by government incentives and trade protections, Indian solar equipment makers such as Adani Enterprises, Tata Power, Renew Photovoltaics, Waaree Energies and Premier Energies have raced to expand solar module capacity to help meet the country’s ambitious target of installing

[TITLE]Disney, Big Tech Take Up Energy Trading As Power Costs Soar:
[TEXT]
Previously, we reported that U.S. electricity prices have been surging, thanks in large part to the proliferation of AI, high-performance computing (HPC) data centers and clean energy manufacturing. U.S. residential electricity prices have surged nearly 40% since 2021, with states with the highest concentration of data centers recording the biggest increase. To wit, Virginia--the state with the biggest number of data centers at 666--saw electricity prices jump 13% in the current year from 2024 levels, the second highest clip nationwide after Illinois’ 15.8%. Illinois has 244 data centers, the fourth highest amongst the 50 states. Not surprisingly, there’s growing techlash, with various politicians criticizing the Trump administration for cutting sweetheart deals with Big Tech companies and forcing consumers to subsidize the cost of data centers.

And now Big Tech is deploying a novel tool to rein in surging power costs: energy trading. A new job posting has revealed that Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is looking to hire a full-time energy trader that will be based in Orlando, Florida, home to the famous Walt Disney World Resort. The trader will be responsible for securing favorable pricing by buying power on an hourly and daily basis. But Disney is only the latest in a growing trend whereby big corporations, especially Big Tech, are taking up power trading as a proactive measure to manage their energy costs. Major corporations are beginning to operate more like energy companies, quietly building in-house trading, hedging, and procurement teams to manage soaring power costs and volatile electricity markets instead of going the traditional route of using brokers to lock in multiyear fixed-price contracts. Together, these companies are creating a new class of corporate energy players--large buyers that trade, hedge, and procure electricity with a level of sophistication once limited to utilities and commodity houses.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) recently filed an application with U.S. federal regulators (via a subsidiary called Atem Energy) for authorization to become a power marketer and enter the wholesale electricity trading business. By becoming a direct participant in the market, Meta can sign long-term "take-or-pay" contracts with new power plant developers, including wind, solar, and natural gas. Entering the trading business gives Meta the flexibility to manage an unpredictable supply. If a data center consumes less power than expected, or if market prices are favorable, Meta can resell the surplus electricity back into the wholesale market, managing costs and risks.

Other tech giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) now run full-scale energy-market desks to hedge exposure across deregulated grids, while retailers like Walmart and Target manage structured power contracts across thousands of sites. Hospitality and theme-park operators, including Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR), Hilton (NYSE:HLT) and Universal theme parks, operated under Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), have developed similar capabilities to stabilize costs tied to 24/7 operations.

Renewable Energy PPAs

That said, the AI boom and surging power demand are likely to become a major tailwind for the renewable energy sector. According to a recent report by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA), corporate buyers procured over 100 Gigawatts of clean energy deals from 2014-2024, good for 41% of all renewable energy capacity added to the grid over the period. CEBA says these corporate buyers are not only trying to secure stable electricity prices for 20 years or longer but are also driven by goals of reporting lower carbon emissions.

Microsoft really pushed its renewable energy bets to a new level in 2024 after the tech giant signed on for more than 10.5 GW of clean energy capacity in the U.S. and Europe, the largest-ever corporate renewable energy power purchase agreement (PPA). Bloomberg NEF estimates Microsoft’s clean energy portfolio will take close to $12 billion to build, with construction slated to begin in 2026.

Last year, Amazon signed three agreements for nuclear energy to power its operations. Then in September, Amazon Web Services and Gentari signed a PPA to deliver an 80-megawatt wind power project in Tamil Nadu, India. Through the project, the companies expect to generate 300,000 megawatt-hours of renewable energy annually, with the plant expected to come online from mid-2027.

Corporate offtake agreements are great for the clean energy sector because they greatly improve revenue visibility and the financial health of renewable energy projects. According to CEBA, virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) for corporate renewable procurement lower the number of projects facing financial distress by 90% in regions served by MISO (Midcontinent Independent Systen Operator) and PJM and 80% in ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas). This is important under the current Trump administration, with the U.S. set to lose 100 GW of planned solar and wind energy projects after the passing of the OBBBA.
