[TITLE]U.S. Healthcare System Seriously Threatened by Private Equity Takeover:
[TEXT]
The health of many Americans is seriously under threat because private equity firms are taking over hospitals. These private equity firms have taken over some 450 hospitals across the United States.

Private equity firm Steward had acquired over 37 hospitals in the United States alone.

Besides hospitals, reports state that the takeover has extended into the acquisitions of 750 nursing homes, 200 emergency set-ups, 5,779 doctor’s practices and two-thirds of the country’s air ambulances.

In this growing takeover trend, over the last 10 years, these private equity investors have paid out around $1 trillion in the last 10 years.

Succinctly put by Massachusetts State Senator Cindy Friedman:

“Private equity is the complete opposite of the delivery of healthcare…” She goes on to say “… make money, leave, make it however you want, make it for people who are interested in making money, and then you have got healthcare, which is all

Last year, Amazon workers at seven U.S. facilities had walked off the job during the holiday shopping rush, after union officials said the retailer had failed to come to the bargaining table to negotiate contracts. Employees were protesting what they said was Amazon's unfair treatment of its workers.

In December, Amazon also agreed to implement safety measures at all of its U.S. facilities to settle a federal agency's claims that it failed to prevent workers from developing back problems and other ergonomic injuries.

[TITLE]Biogen to Acquire Alcyone Therapeutics, Expanding Drug Delivery Solution Portfolio for Key Product and Pipeline Candidates:
[TEXT]
Biogen to drive end-to-end development and commercialization of ThecaFlex DRx™, an investigational implantable device for intrathecal delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)

ThecaFlex DRx™ has the potential to be a new, convenient way to administer medicines to patients living with neurological disorders.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) announced the company has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Massachusetts-based Alcyone Therapeutics. As part of an existing partnership with Alcyone Therapeutics, the companies are advancing ThecaFlex DRx™, an implantable subcutaneous port and catheter device being investigated for the intrathecal delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). ThecaFlex DRx™ is designed to provide an alternative to repeat lumbar punctures in chronic intrathecal administration of medicines, which could ease both patient experience and accessibility for a broader population of people living with neurologic disorders.

Biogen will drive end-to-end development, manufacturing and commercialization of ThecaFlex DRx™. Upon closing, Alcyone employees who will join Biogen will be integrated into the company’s product delivery solutions team, building upon the existing portfolio and expertise in drug-device combination products. The ThecaFlex DRx™ System is initially being evaluated with SPINRAZA® (nusinersen) in patients with spinal muscular atrophy, which will inform pathways for Biogen's broader portfolio of investigational therapies.

“For nearly three decades, Biogen has pioneered ASO development, and we are committed to continuing to improve patient experience and ease of administration," said Nicole Murphy, Head of Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology at Biogen. "We believe the acquisition of Alcyone Therapeutics offers a strategic opportunity to both expand the company’s capabilities and enhance the value proposition of our medicines by offering a meaningful, patient-centered solution.”

“Alcyone has been a pioneer in precision CNS delivery. With ThecaFlex DRx™, following our productive partnership with Biogen, we now have the opportunity to further deliver what could be the first truly patient-centered, chronic intrathecal delivery option for these important therapies,” said PJ Anand, Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Alcyone Therapeutics. “We believe Biogen’s deep expertise in ASOs and its proven track record in advancing drug delivery innovations make it the ideal partner to bring this technology forward.”

Biogen and Alcyone Therapeutics have collaborated since 2023 on the development of ThecaFlex DRx™, with the PIERRE and PIERRE-PK clinical studies for nusinersen currently underway. Nusinersen is currently marketed under the brand name SPINRAZA® and is indicated for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in pediatric and adult patients. Biogen plans to introduce the new drug delivery system for SPINRAZA in early 2028, contingent upon the successful completion of clinical trials and regulatory approval.

Alcyone Therapeutics is based in Lowell, Massachusetts. ThecaFlex DRx™ has been in development since 2019 and is manufactured locally.

[TITLE]Minovia Therapeutics Receives FDA Fast Track Designation for MNV-201 in Myelodysplastic Syndrome:
[TEXT]
HAIFA, Israel, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Minovia Therapeutics Ltd. (“Minovia” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel therapies to treat mitochondrial diseases and combat age-related decline, announces that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation (FTD) to the Company’s lead investigational compound, MNV-201 for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), a serious age-related hematopoietic disease. This designation is in addition to the existing FDA Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations for MNV-201 in the treatment of Pearson Syndrome, an ultra-rare and life-threatening mitochondrial disorder affecting children and for which the Company is currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial.

“The Fast Track Designation in MDS is further validation of the urgency and potential for our science, which targets the mitochondria, a critical multi-functional organelle. FDA designations such as the FTD help us to decrease the potential time to market and provide additional benefits across the FDA process that, we expect, will prove both medically and financially valuable,” said Minovia Co-founder and CEO, Natalie Yivgi-Ohana, Ph.D.

FDA’s Fast Track Designation is designed to accelerate the development and review of therapies for serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical need. The designation provides Minovia with the opportunity for increased FDA interactions, potential eligibility for priority review, and the opportunity for a rolling submission of a future Biologics License Application (BLA) for MNV-201.

The Company also recently announced entry into a definitive business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with Launch One Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: LPAA, “Launch One”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company. Following the expected closing of the transaction contemplated by this Business Combination Agreement (the "Business Combination"), projected for late 2025, the combined company will operate as Minovia Therapeutics and trade on Nasdaq under a new ticker symbol.

[TITLE]U.S. Healthcare System Seriously Threatened by Private Equity Takeover:
[TEXT]
The health of many Americans is seriously under threat because private equity firms are taking over hospitals. These private equity firms have taken over some 450 hospitals across the United States.

Private equity firm Steward had acquired over 37 hospitals in the United States alone.

Besides hospitals, reports state that the takeover has extended into the acquisitions of 750 nursing homes, 200 emergency set-ups, 5,779 doctor’s practices and two-thirds of the country’s air ambulances.

In this growing takeover trend, over the last 10 years, these private equity investors have paid out around $1 trillion in the last 10 years.

Succinctly put by Massachusetts State Senator Cindy Friedman:

“Private equity is the complete opposite of the delivery of healthcare…” She goes on to say “… make money, leave, make it however you want, make it for people who are interested in making money, and then you have got healthcare, which is all

[TITLE]Amazon invests over $1 billion to raise employee pay, lower healthcare costs:
[TEXT]
Amazon.com said on Wednesday it is investing more than $1 billion to raise pay and lower healthcare costs for U.S. fulfillment and transportation employees, pushing up the average total compensation to over $30 an hour including benefits.

The technology giant said the average pay would increase to more than $23 per hour, adding that full-time employees will see their pay increase by $1,600 per year, on average.

The company is lowering the cost of its entry-level health care plan to $5 per week and $5 for co-pays, starting in 2026, representing a 34 per cent drop in weekly contributions from employees.

Amazon had more than 1.5 million full-time and part-time employees at the end of last year. The company also hires temporary workers and independent contractors seasonally, particularly around the crucial holiday season.

Last year, Amazon workers at seven U.S. facilities had walked off the job during the holiday shopping rush, after union officials said the retailer had failed to come to the bargaining table to negotiate contracts. Employees were protesting what they said was Amazon's unfair treatment of its workers.

In December, Amazon also agreed to implement safety measures at all of its U.S. facilities to settle a federal agency's claims that it failed to prevent workers from developing back problems and other ergonomic injuries.
