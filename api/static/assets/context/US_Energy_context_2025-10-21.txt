The Infratil Ltd (ASX: IFT) share price is in focus after the company announced an agreement to acquire an additional 4.92% stake in Contact Energy, lifting its total holding to 14.3%. The $437.7 million deal will be funded through both debt and new Infratil shares issued to TECT Holdings.

What did Infratil report?

Acquisition of TECT Holdings' 4.92% stake in Contact Energy for $437.7 million ($8.95 per share)

Funding split evenly between existing debt and issuance of new Infratil shares ($12.43 per share, 17,605,277 shares)

Infratil's total holding in Contact Energy to increase from 9.4% to 14.3%

Follows July sale of Manawa Energy stake for NZ$186 million in cash and Contact shares

New shares issued to be escrowed until 22 October 2026

What else do investors need to know?

The transaction will see TECT Holdings, formerly Tauranga Energy Consumer Trust, become a shareholder in Infratil as part of the payment consideration. This approach allows Infratil to maintain funding flexibility for future growth without significantly increasing balance sheet leverage.

Infratil's increased investment in Contact comes after the merger of Contact and Manawa Energy, where Infratil exchanged its Manawa stake for cash and shares in Contact. The group says it continues to focus on acquiring and supporting quality infrastructure assets in robust market environments.

What did Infratil management say?

Commenting on the news, Chief Executive Jason Boyes said:

Increasing our investment in Contact is a win-win. Part-funding with new shares preserves flexibility for future growth, while increasing ownership of a strong cashflow-generating business. We know the sector well and look forward to supporting Contact's leadership going forward.

What's next for Infratil?

Looking ahead, Infratil plans to remain an active investor in the Australasian infrastructure sector, with an emphasis on energy assets. By utilising both debt and equity to fund this transaction, management is signalling its intent to pursue further growth opportunities while maintaining prudent capital management.

The company also notes that the new shares issued under this deal will be subject to voluntary escrow restrictions until October 2026, reinforcing a disciplined and long-term approach.

Infratil share price snapshot

Infratil shares have declined 2% over the past year, trailing the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) which has increased around 9% over the same period.

[TITLE]Energy Transfer Delays Lake Charles LNG Project Decision to 2026:
[TEXT]
Energy Transfer LP has pushed back its targeted final investment decision for the proposed Lake Charles liquefied natural gas export project in Louisiana to the first quarter of 2026 from the end of this year, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company cited rising costs and the need for more time to finalize contracts as reasons for the delay, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions about the timeline were private. The pipeline operator has planned for years to expand the existing LNG import terminal at Lake Charles into an export plant.

Energy Transfer didn’t respond to requests for comment via phone and email.

US LNG developers are rushing to line up financing and start construction on projects before the next global supply wave potentially overtakes demand, with BloombergNEF predicting that a glut will emerge by 2027. Qatar is progressing with its own years-long LNG buildout and a massive pipeline expansion by Gazprom PJSC could begin funneling more Russian gas to China by 2031.

Earlier this month, Bloomberg News reported that Energy Transfer was nearing an agreement to sell LNG from Lake Charles to MidOcean Energy, a subsidiary of investment firm EIG Global Energy Partners.

Chevron Corp., China’s ENN Energy Holdings Ltd. and South Korea’s SK Gas Trading LLC are among the companies that have inked long-term deals to buy LNG from Lake Charles. The Louisiana project would have a total capacity of 16.5 million metric tons of per year.

[TITLE]OPEC Chief: The World Needs $18.2 Trillion in Oil and Gas Investment:
[TEXT]
OPEC highlights the International Energy Agency's (IEA) shift in narrative regarding new oil and gas investments, while consistently advocating for timely investments to meet growing demand and offset decline rates.

Primary energy demand is expected to increase by 23% by 2050, with oil still accounting for 30% of total global energy consumption, necessitating $18.2 trillion in oil industry investment.

OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais emphasizes the critical need for continued investment in oil and gas, projecting their substantial role in the global energy mix until 2050.

The world needs more investment in oil and gas as they will continue to account for a large part of the global energy mix in 2050, OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais said on Wednesday, reiterating the cartel’s view that investment in new supply will be needed in the foreseeable future.

Primary energy demand will jump by 23% by 2050, Al Ghais said in remarks to the Russian Energy Week conference in Moscow, as carried by Reuters.

And oil will still represent 30% of total global energy consumption in 2050, OPEC’s Secretary General said.

Growing economies, urbanization, and rising population numbers lead “to one clear signal that the world will need much more energy than it is consuming today,” Al Ghais added.

Earlier this year, OPEC said in its annual World Oil Outlook (WOO) that oil demand is set to continue rising through 2050, with consumption expected at 123 million barrels per day (bpd) then, up from about 104 million bpd this year.

The world needs global oil industry investment of $18.2 trillion out to 2050, Al Ghais wrote in a foreword to the outlook.

“It is vital that these investments are made for consumers and producers everywhere, as well as for the effective functioning of the global economy at large,” he added.

Last month, OPEC noted the “cautionary tale” of the International Energy Agency (IEA). The agency said in a new report that the world needs to develop new oil and gas resources just to keep output flat amid faster declining rates at existing fields, in a major shift in its narrative from 2021 that ‘no new investment’ is needed in a net-zero by 2050 scenario.

Acknowledging the IEA’s U-turn, OPEC said that “However, the IEA has not referenced how its own advocacy of its Net Zero Emissions Scenario or its own prognosis of peak oil demand have discouraged investments and contributed to uncertainty about long-term oil demand.”

“In contrast to the IEA’s U-turning on this important issue, OPEC has consistently advocated for timely investments in the oil industry to account for decline rates and meet growing demand,” OPEC said, commenting on the IEA’s new stance.

“It is vital that all stakeholders are consistent in recognizing this and do not return to rhetoric that there should be no investment in new oil projects.”

Indian refiners bought ₹2.5 billion (₹25,597 crore) worth of Russian crude in September, trailing China 's ₹3.2 billion, according to Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).India was also the second-largest buyer of Russian coal and refined fuels, with total fossil imports of ₹3.6 billion, behind China's ₹5.5 billion. Overall, China ranked first among Russian fossil fuel buyers, followed by India, Turkiye, the EU and South Korea.China was the largest importer of Russian crude, LNG, and coal, while Turkiye led in refined oil products and pipeline gas.The Trump administration has been pressuring New Delhi to curb Russian oil imports, arguing they fund Moscow's war in Ukraine. Washington even imposed a 25% additional tariff on Indian exports to the US as a penalty for Russian oil purchases , though no similar action was taken against other buyers.India's crude imports from Russia fell 9% sequentially in September to their lowest since February due to a 38% drop in purchases by state-run refiners - the lowest since May 2022.In addition to crude, India also bought ₹452 million worth of coal and ₹344 million of refined oil products, while China imported ₹784 million of coal, ₹658 million of pipeline gas, and ₹487 million of LNG. India did not buy any gas from Russia that month.Turkiye was the third-largest importer, with ₹2.6 billion of Russian fossil fuel imports including ₹1 billion in pipeline gas and ₹542 million in crude. Its imports of oil products fell 27% sequentially, mainly due to reduced Russian diesel exports after Ukraine's attacks disrupted product output.The EU imported ₹743 million of LNG and pipeline gas and ₹311 million of crude oil from Russia.With total purchases of ₹283 million, South Korea ranked fifth among Russian fossil fuel buyers.

Kingdom Capital Advisors stated the following regarding United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) in its third quarter 2025 investor letter:

"United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) exemplifies our approach to developing edge through misunderstood situations. Despite a cyber-attack that paralyzed their distribution network for over 10% of the most recent quarter, management still exceeded sales guidance — demonstrating exceptional execution under pressure. The cyber event appears mostly covered by insurance and has deepened customer relationships rather than strained them. Management's September 30th guidance for the upcoming year shows continued execution well ahead of Wall Street expectations. With $300m of free cash flow expected from operations in FY26, another $150m from cyber insurance proceeds and asset sales, UNFI trades below 6x EV/EBITDA—a persistent discount to peers."

Is United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI) the Best Food Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?

United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. According to our database, 27 hedge fund portfolios held United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) at the end of the second quarter, up from 26 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Giant Transport Airplane to be Developed for Wind Turbine Components:
[TEXT]
Essay by Eric Worrall

Humans might face future air travel restrictions, but wind turbines could get a free pass if inventor Mark Lundstrom has his way.

How a Giant Aircraft could Ease Clean Energy Supply Chains By Charlie King

October 17, 2025 Radia’s WindRunner aircraft could redesign how wind turbine blades and oversized cargo reach remote areas, bypassing outdated road infrastructure limits

The infrastructure supporting global ground transport serves daily traffic but struggles with oversized cargo. Supply chains across the world face increasing pressure as the scale of renewable energy components expands. Wind turbines in particular present a challenge due to their sheer size and the limitations of existing logistics networks. Radia, founded in 2016 by aerospace engineer Mark Lundstrom, sets out to change this with its WindRunner aircraft. Designed to transport the world’s largest wind turbine blades, WindRunner reaches areas that roads and railways cannot access. Traditional infrastructure can move blades around 70 metres long, but the next generation of turbines requires blades exceeding 100 metres. This creates a need to rethink how energy projects move their largest parts. … “Big Western wind turbine makers need direct financial support to make the investments needed to aid decarbonisation,” says Tim Dawidowsky, Chief Operating Officer of Siemens Gamesa. “The supply chain is facing substantial challenges that could limit production capacity and increase turbine prices.”

A promo video of the new aircraft;

As far as I can tell the aircraft hasn’t been built yet, they’re looking for funding.

Building an aircraft that size which can land on rough runways shall be, how can I put it, challenging.

I’m no aircraft engineer but I’ve flown light aircraft before. Hitting even a small bump at speed can flex the entire airframe. Large aircraft can have big fluffy wheels and long shock absorber assemblies which can help reduce the peak force inflicted by impacts on bumps, but large and long airframe structures are also more vulnerable to stress. If the front wheels of a 70m+ aircraft hit a bump which isn’t fully absorbed by the wheels and shock absorber assembly, 70m is a lot of leverage. Any slight flaw in the design and even a small bump could result in thousands of tons of force being exerted on components which aren’t designed to take such punishment.

It is just barely possible to build aircraft this large. Ukraine owned the world’s only Antonov An-225 Mriya until it was destroyed during the Russian invasion. The Antonov could carry a 70m cargo. But Ukraine’s ex-soviet airplane required a paved runway over two miles long to get airborne.

The ex-Soviet Antonov An-225 Mriya aircraft cost around $300 million to build. I find it difficult to imagine anyone landing a commercial aircraft which costs a third of a billion dollars on a dirt track.

Who still believes wind is the cheapest form of energy? Now all the easy wind locations have been taken, wind now apparently needs financial support to expand, for developing $300 million airplanes intended to be landed on dirt tracks in the middle of nowhere. The cost of wind power just got even more absurd than before.

[TITLE]Europe’s Aging Grids Buckle Under Renewable Energy Demands:
[TEXT]
The world’s power grids need a major upgrade to keep pace with growing rates of electrification and the ever-increasing energy demands of big data. A cleaner energy landscape means a whole lot more electricity demand, as we switch from gas-powered vehicles and appliances to newer, cleaner models that need to plug into the grid to charge. This means that expanding grid capacity and making our aging grids smarter and more flexible will be essential to maintaining energy security for the future – but grid infrastructure remains woefully neglected, and we’re already starting to see some of the fallout.

“To achieve countries’ national energy and climate goals, the world’s electricity use needs to grow 20% faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one,” states a 2023 report from the International Energy Agency. As a result, grids need to expand at an unprecedented rate. “Reaching national goals also means adding or refurbishing a total of over 80 million kilometres of grids by 2040, the equivalent of the entire existing global grid,” the report goes on to say.

Failure to prioritize investing in grid modernization and expansion poses a major threat to the clean energy transition and to energy security as grids become increasingly reliant on renewable energy sources. Solar and wind energy are variable, meaning that their production levels wax and wane according to factors that have nothing to do with demand trends. Plus, energy production is increasingly dispersed, especially so thanks to the proliferation of residential solar panels. These factors introduce an extra level of complexity for grids that were designed with just a few major utilities in mind, and with only one direction of energy flow.

All of this is already leading to some hiccups for grid stability. In Europe, where renewable expansion and EV adoption have soared, critical grid congestion and catastrophic blackouts have become an increasing issue. At the end of April, cascading grid failures in Spain and Portugal resulted in the worst blackout in European history, and highlighted how woefully insufficient grid investment has been to date. At the time, Eurelectric reported that the “extraordinary event” in Iberia served as “a stark reminder that the grid is the backbone of our society. With electricity playing an increasingly important role in our society, we need to create all the conditions to enable a secure electricity supply.”

Unfortunately, many countries are now facing the consequences of failing to create all of those conditions. In the Netherlands, massive success with clean energy capacity installation and EV adoption without commensurate grid infrastructure expansion has resulted in a new norm of power cuts and energy consumption austerity measures. And it’s going to take a lot of money and time to fix the issue.

"They have a grid crisis because they haven't invested enough in their distribution networks, in their transmission networks, so they are facing bottlenecks everywhere, and it will take years and billions of dollars to solve this," Damien Ernst, professor of electrical engineering at Belgium's Liege University, recently told the BBC. The problem is causing ripples throughout the Netherlands economy. New housing, for example, is now facing long waiting lists in order to connect to grids that are already operating over maximum capacity.

But the issue is not limited to the Netherlands. Much of Europe has neglected to properly invest in grid infrastructure as a part of national clean energy planning. "We have an enormous amount of solar panels being installed, and they are installed at a rate that is much, much too high for the grid to be able to accommodate," Ernst went on to say.
