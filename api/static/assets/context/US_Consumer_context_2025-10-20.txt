[TITLE]Federal Realty Buys Maryland Retail Plaza for $187M:
[TEXT]
One of the nation’s oldest real estate investment trusts has acquired an open-air retail plaza in eastern Maryland, the latest firm to snag a substantial property amid the retail’s resurgence.

North Bethesda, Md.-based Federal Realty Investment Trust, founded in 1962, has paid $187 million for the retail portion of the mixed-use Annapolis Town Center, a 480,000-square-foot shopping center in Annapolis. PGIM Real Estate sold the complex, which is anchored by Whole Foods alongside fellow tenants such as Anthropologie, Sephora, Restoration Hardware, and Williams Sonoma.

“This is exactly the kind of opportunity we target: a dominant asset with strong fundamentals, competitive positioning, and the potential to unlock further value under our ownership,” Don Wood, Federal Realty president and CEO, said in a statement.

Federal Realty’s new property is just a portion of the 2 million-square-foot Annapolis Town Center, developed in 2008 at 1906 Towne Centre Boulevard by Greenberg Gibbons. PGIM acquired the mixed-use complex in 2018, though earlier this year it opted to sell the property’s multifamily component — two buildings totaling more than 400 units — to Peterson Companies for $160 million.

Federal Realty joins other investment firms acquiring Maryland malls in the past 12 months, though under widely varying circumstances.

In November, Spinoso Real Estate Group paid $190 million for the 1.2 million-square-foot White Marsh Mall near Baltimore. Spinoso had been the mall’s court-appointed receiver for about a year at the time, owing to financial distress from former owner Brookfield.

European mall giant Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (URW) meanwhile has faced its own distress with Westfield Wheaton, a 1.7 million-square-foot plaza on the northern outskirts of Washington, D.C. The mall was transferred to special servicing in April after URW failed to meet its March debt maturity, and the company has reportedly opted to sell following a meager $166 million appraisal in August, Bisnow reported at the time.

By product, the supplements segment captured the maximum share of 48% in 2024, whereas the emerging formats segment is expected to grow in the foreseen period.

By end user, the weight loss segment captured the maximum share of 55% in 2024, whereas the emerging users segment is expected to grow in the expected timeframe.

Increasing Obese Population Fueling the Demand for Ketogenic Diet Food

The ketogenic diet food market is observing growth lately due to increasing health consciousness, increasing diabetes and obesity rates, and the availability of different types of keto-friendly products in the market. A keto-friendly diet involves the consumption of food options that are high in fats and low in carbs to promote weight loss and manage health issues such as diabetes and obesity. Hence, such diets are followed by obese and diabetic people on a larger scale.

Different types of keto-friendly snacks are available in supermarkets and online platforms, allowing consumers to shop for them easily and also carry them outdoors to maintain their diet. The market is also observing growth due to the availability of products such as keto-friendly packaged foods, snacks, meal options low in carbs and high in fats, and related supplements.

New Trends in the Ketogenic Diet Food Market

Higher demand for convenient meal options due to the hectic lifestyles of consumers is a major factor in the growth of the ketogenic diet food market.

Availability of keto-friendly supplements, helpful to manage health issues and manage weight, is another major factor for the growth of the market.

Availability of plant-based keto options also helps to fuel the market’s growth by fulfilling the demands of the vegetarian population.

Availability of keto-friendly beverages on offline and online distribution channels to motivate consumers to follow their diet even while outdoors or while traveling is another growth-fueling factor for the ketogenic diet food market.

Impact of AI in the Ketogenic Diet Food Market

AI is increasingly making inroads into the ketogenic diet food market, enabling more precise product development, personalization, quality assurance, and market responsiveness. In formulation and R&D, AI models assist in designing foods that align with keto requirements (very low carbs, high healthy fats, and moderate protein) by predicting how alternative ingredients, fibers, and fats will behave under processing, how they influence texture, flavor, and shelf life, and how they interact with other components. On the consumer front, AI-driven nutrition platforms generate highly personalized keto meal plans, track macro balance in real time, and predict adherence trends, encouraging tailored food launches and ingredient adjustments. In manufacturing, AI systems monitor process parameters (mixing, drying, cooling, encapsulation) to ensure consistent macro ratios, prevent unwanted sugar formation or moisture anomalies, and maintain quality across batches.

AI also optimizes supply chains and demand forecasting for keto food SKUs, helping minimize perishables’ losses and aligning production with consumer seasonal or regional trends. Finally, in marketing and consumer analytics, AI segments keto followers by lifestyle, goals, and behavioral data, enabling brands to launch niche variants such as keto snacks for diabetics and keto dessert lines, and to target promotional campaigns more effectively. As a result, AI is pushing the keto-food space toward faster innovation cycles, greater consistency, and stronger alignment with individual dietary needs.

Indonesia and the Philippines regularly feature among the top global coconut-oil exporters, while Malaysia and some regional processors supply refined MCT fractions and derivatives. Strong plantation scale and competitive pricing make this region the backbone of global MCT / coconut-derived ingredient exports.

What Are the Growth Drivers of the Ketogenic Diet Food Market?

The growing population of health-conscious consumers, diabetics, and obese people is one of the major factors for the growth of the market. A keto-friendly diet is high in fat and low in carbs, which is helpful for weight management and managing other health issues.

[TITLE]Gold glitters online as festive shoppers turn to e-commerce, quick commerce platforms for auspicious buys:
[TEXT]
Luxury and prosperity are shining bright this festive season, with online platforms like Amazon and BigBasket witnessing record demand for gold, silver, and fine jewellery purchases ahead of Diwali and Dhanteras.

Premium fashion on Amazon Fashion and Beauty has seen a sharp uptick, led by fine jewellery and luxury watches.

“This festive season, premium fashion is seeing remarkable growth, with luxury watches and gold and diamond jewellery — including lab-grown diamonds — driving demand,” said Siddharth Bhagat, Director, Amazon Fashion and Beauty, India.

Amazon reported a 96% year-on-year surge in gold jewellery sales, driven by brands such as CaratLane, PN Gadgil Jewellers, Joyalukkas, PC Chandra, KISNA, and Malabar Gold & Diamonds. The platform now offers more than five lakh styles across silver, gold, and diamond jewellery, making it the largest fine jewellery destination among online marketplaces.

Bhagat said the company is also seeing strong traction in affordable fine jewellery — with customers buying pieces starting at ₹2,000 for silver and up to ₹40,000 for gold and diamond. Demand for 14K daily-wear jewellery has grown 50 per cent year-on-year, while 18K styles are also gaining popularity.

In line with global trends, Amazon has expanded into lab-grown diamonds, offering jewellery starting at ₹1,699 across more than 50,000 styles. “Amazon is the first and only online marketplace focusing on this whitespace,” Bhagat said.

Gold coins remain a festive favourite, with the most purchased denomination being 2 grams. “Customers continue to prefer Amazon for their auspicious purchases of gold and silver coins during Akshaya Tritiya, Dhanteras and more,” Bhagat added.

Complementing this, Tata-owned bigbasket also recorded a strong Dhanteras, with gold coin sales rising 146 per cent and silver coins up 234 per cent from last year. Demand for pooja essentials — including diyas, flowers, and festive décor — grew 54 per cent year-on-year.

“Dhanteras is a time for prosperity, devotion, and togetherness. This year, bigbasket ensured our customers could celebrate without compromise, whether it was purchasing auspicious coins or getting the perfect gifts and pooja items in minutes,” said Seshu Kumar, Chief Buying and Merchandising Officer, bigbasket.

With 10-minute delivery and curated festive assortments, bigbasket blended technology and tradition, meeting last-minute festive needs — from auspicious buys to celebratory gifting.

Both platforms are capitalising on India’s accelerating shift toward online festive shopping, where authenticity, convenience, and trust are emerging as the new hallmarks of prosperity.
