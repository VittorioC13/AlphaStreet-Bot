[TITLE]Georgia Tech reportedly inks massive nine-figure apparel deal to ditch Adidas:
[TEXT]
Georgia Tech is going to have a new apparel partner and it comes with a big time price tag. According to ESPN’s Pete Thamel, the Yellow Jackets have agreed to a 10-year deal with Under Armour to become the school’s official apparel provider, starting July 1, 2026.

Source: Georgia Tech and Under Armour have agreed to a new 10-year deal for UA to become the official apparel provider, effective July 1 of 2026. The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that GTech is getting from current adidas deal. pic.twitter.com/MeZfbDkuTU — Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) October 3, 2025

The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that Georgia Tech is getting from the current Adidas deal, according to Thamel and Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Chad Bishop.

"Tech was receiving an average of $3.11 million annually from Adidas in cash and product over its original six-year contract that was signed in 2018," Bishop said. This figure puts the reported value of Georgia Tech's new deal with UA at $186.6 million over ten years.

Georgia Tech’s previous deal with Adidas was set to expire in the summer of 2024, but the two sides put together a new two-year deal. However, the short-term fix wasn't enough to keep the Yellow Jackets from looking elsewhere.

“We’re thrilled to partner with Under Armour, an organization that shares our commitment to excellence, innovation, amplifying the Georgia Tech brand across the globe and enhancing the student-athlete experience, including through innovative NIL opportunities," GT's Vice president and director of athletics Ryan Alpert said in a statement. "Our partnership with Under Armour will play a big part in Georgia Tech continuing to move forward in the new era of collegiate athletics and reaching our ambitions of competing for championships at the highest levels of collegiate athletics.”

For Under Armour, this deal puts the outfitter back on the map in the new era of college athletics.

“As we mark our 30th anniversary next year, we’re thrilled to team back up with Georgia Tech, our first collegiate client, to experience our commitment to enhancing athletic performance." Under Armour's VP of the Team Division Craig Cummings said in a statement. "We are energized by the momentum in Atlanta and look forward to amplifying our presence in the community through meaningful activations and shared purpose.”

Georgia Tech had worn Russell Athletic for over two decades before switching to Under Armour in 1996. They migrated to Adidas and now the two brands will be reunited after thirty years apart.

The Yellow Jacket's first time officially back in the UA branding will come against Deion Sanders and Colorado in Atlanta on Sept. 5, 2026.

[TITLE]We Hand-Picked 271+ of the Best Amazon Prime Day Deals — Sale Ends Tonight:

We’ve officially reached the final hours of Prime Day — seriously, this time. Amazon isn’t hosting another sale for Prime members in 2025, making today your last chance to shop exclusive discounts on products across tech, beauty, kitchen, household essentials and more. Prime Big Deal Days technically end at 11:59 p.m. PST, so you still have some time. But we’re already seeing some of the best discounts sell out, so if you’ve been thinking

[TITLE]Amazon Prime Big Deal Days 2025: Top Sales on Viral Beauty Products:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

Amazon’s fall Prime Day, happening until 11:59 p.m. PT today, is the best chance to stock your makeup bag with the beauty goodies you’ve used to the last drop and can’t function without — as well as hot-right-now sunscreens, serums, hair care, face oils, and styling tools that have long resided in your bookmarks tab, waiting for a good enough deal to hit so as to finally make them investment-worthy.

Well, dear reader, that time has come, as we’re seeing prices slashed by close to 50 percent off on TikTok-approved beauty bestsellers from brands like Dyson, Shark, Sol de Janeiro, Supergoop, Virtue, and beyond.

Need to level up your hair game for the fall season with a styling system that curls, smooths, dries, and volumizes? Look no further than the Shark FlexStyle, which our editors said was “in a league of its own” — officially selling for its lowest price ever. On the hunt for an SPF formula you can easily layer under makeup to stay sun-safe all winter long? Supergoop’s Unseen Clear Face Sunscreen, along with many of the brand’s other celeb-loved offerings, is part of the sale this year. And if it’s the benefits of red light therapy that you’re after, seriously consider grabbing HigherDose’s Red Light Therapy Face Mask — a cordless gadget that promotes cellular renewal, wrinkle reduction, and a more youthful complexion (our editors are big fans of the HigherDose Infrared Sauna Blanket, which is also seeing its biggest deal yet).

Last year for Amazon’s Big Deal Days event, we saw markdowns on everything from Clinique’s Cleansing Balm and Briogeo’s Don’t Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Mask (which won a spot on WWD’s 2025 list of the Greatest Hair Care Products of All Time) to the Neutrogena Night Calming Makeup Remover Face Wipes that Kim Kardashian once raved about. Many of these same picks are once again on sale, and, similarly to what happened in 2024, the second-day discounts on Amazon beauty favorites are even juicier than the ones that were available to shop yesterday.

The savings extravaganza’s lowest prices are reserved for Amazon Prime members. Not part of the club? A subscription to Amazon Prime normally costs $14.99/month, but you can score a 30-day free trial here and use it to shop the last day of the Prime Big Deal Days without commitment.

Without further ado, the best Prime Day beauty deals our editors have already cleared space for on our bathroom counters. Drop everything and shop before the dreamy discounts are retired until next year.
