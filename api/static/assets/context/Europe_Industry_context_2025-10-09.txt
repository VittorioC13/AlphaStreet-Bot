[TITLE]Notion Capital raises $130 million for European growth fund:
[TEXT]
Notion Capital, a London-based venture capital firm, has announced the close of a new $130 million growth fund. The fund will focus on supporting growth-stage startups across Europe in sectors like AI, defense, and supply chain logistics. Stephen Chandler, managing partner at Notion Capital, emphasized the importance of the new fund in addressing the shortage of growth-stage capital in Europe.

“This opens up a chance for firms like ourselves to become real European champions,” Chandler said. The fund, called Growth Opps III, will target areas of rising demand such as sovereignty, resilience, and artificial intelligence. Chandler described AI as a “super cycle” that is reshaping the industry.

Notion Capital will concentrate on applications of AI to multiply its market reach. Notion Capital has already begun deploying funds into ventures like Upvest, a stock trading API, Kraken, a builder of unmanned surface vessels, and Nelly, a developer of financial products for the medical sector. A dedicated team of fund partners will handle these growth deals and source new opportunities outside the existing portfolio.

Notion Capital secures new funding

The firm has also introduced new leadership with Growth Opps III. Partner Stephanie Opdam will drive the growth strategy alongside Jessica “Jess” Bartos, who joined from Salesforce Ventures as Notion’s first external partner hire.

Europe has historically struggled with a shortage of institutional capital, particularly from pension schemes. However, reforms like France’s Tibi initiative and the UK’s Mansion House Accord are starting to create incentives for long-term capital mobilisation. Reflecting its pan-European ambitions, the fund is denominated in euros and domiciled in Luxembourg, making it less dependent on UK regulation.

Around 85% of its capital came from institutional investors across Europe, the UK, MENA, and the United States. Since its founding, Notion Capital has invested in over 150 companies, including notable names like Currencycloud, GoCardless, Mews, Paddle, and Quantum Systems. Their established relationships with founders serve as a competitive advantage, particularly at the growth stage.

With Growth Opps III, Notion Capital is positioning itself as a key player in Europe’s evolving venture landscape. The firm plans to make about a dozen investments from the new fund, continuing to support ambitious European founders as they scale to global prominence.

MOSCOW: Russia, which recently announced progress in talks with Beijing over a new pipeline, will need at least a decade to significantly raise natural gas exports to China as a result of that deal, industry sources said. Alexei Miller , CEO of Russian gas corporation Gazprom , said a "legally binding memorandum" had been signed on the construction of the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline during President Vladimir Putin 's visit to China last month.The development underscores Moscow's efforts to reorient its vast gas reserves toward Asia after the collapse of its energy trade with Europe - once its largest market - because of Western sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The timeline for the pipeline has not been previously reported.The proposed pipeline, which would run through Mongolia, is expected to deliver up to 50 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas from the Arctic Yamal region annually, comparable to the damaged Nord Stream pipeline to Germany. However, key elements of the deal-including pricing, investment terms, and the timing for the start of deliveries-remain unresolved after years of negotiations.Two industry sources said that even if the deal was finalised next year, it would take
