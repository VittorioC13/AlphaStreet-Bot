Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday informed that India has developed its first indigenously discovered antibiotic " Nafithromycin ", which is effective against resistant respiratory infections , particularly useful for cancer patients and poorly controlled diabetics.He said this antibiotic is the first molecule entirely conceptualised, developed and clinically validated in India, representing a significant leap toward self-reliance in the pharmaceutical sector.According to an official release from the Ministry of Science and Technology , the antibiotic Naphithromycin has been developed by the Government of India's Department of Biotechnology in collaboration with the well-known private pharma house Wockhardt Citing this as an example of a successful industry-academia partnership driving India's biopharmaceutical growth , the Union Minister emphasised the need to build a self-sustainable innovation ecosystem, so that India could reduce its dependence on government funding and create a culture of private sector participation and philanthropic support to achieve global recognition in research and innovation.Inaugurating the 3-day Medical Workshop on "Harnessing Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Omics Data Integration and Analysis", Jitendra Singh said that India must develop a self-sustainable ecosystem to drive its scientific and research growth. He stated that most nations that have achieved global recognition in science and innovation have done so through self-sustaining, innovation-driven models with extensive engagement of the private sector.Citing another successful story of government-non-government collaboration, the Minister also announced that India has achieved a major breakthrough in gene therapy, marking the first successful indigenous clinical trial for Haemophilia treatment, the trial for which was supported by the Government of India's Department of Biotechnology and done in a non-government sector hospital, Christian Medical College, Vellore.Singh further mentioned that India has already sequenced over 10,000 human genomes and aims to scale this up to one million. The gene therapy trial, he added, recorded a 60-70% correction rate with zero bleeding episodes, representing a milestone in India's medical research landscape. The findings have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, underscoring India's growing leadership in advanced biomedical innovation.Speaking at the occasion, Jitendra Singh said the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) is a major step in this direction, with a total outlay of Rs 50,000 crore over five years, of which Rs 36,000 crore will come from non-government sources. This model, he added, reflects a paradigm shift in India's approach to research and development, aligning it with global standards and emphasising greater participation of academia and industry.Jitendra Singh highlighted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most transformative tools of the modern era, reshaping healthcare accessibility, governance efficiency, and decision-making. He mentioned that AI-based hybrid mobile clinics are already serving rural and remote regions, ensuring quality healthcare for all. He also referred to the AI-driven grievance redressal system developed by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG), which has achieved a weekly disposal rate of 97-98%, significantly improving citizen satisfaction and service delivery.The Minister lauded institutions like Sir Ganga Ram Hospital for pioneering interdisciplinary approaches by integrating AI, biotechnology and genomics to improve healthcare outcomes. He urged greater collaboration between government departments, private hospitals, and research institutes to realise the vision of Viksit Bharat @2047.Jitendra Singh said that India is entering a new era of self-reliance in biotechnology, AI and genomic medicine. The convergence of innovation, collaboration and compassion, he said, will define India's journey toward a developed nation and establish its leadership in the global science and technology landscape.The event was also attended by Shiv Kumar Kalyanaraman, CEO of Anusandhan National Research Foundation, NK Ganguly, DS Rana, and Ajay Swaroop.

[TITLE]Domvanalimab and zimberelimab in advanced gastric, gastroesophageal junction or esophageal cancer: a phase 2 trial:
[TEXT]
Study design

EDGE-Gastric (NCT05329766) is an ongoing, phase 2, open-label, multicenter clinical study with three cohorts, one in the first-line setting (cohort A) and two in the second-line or greater setting (cohorts B and C) (Extended Data Fig. 2). Cohort A comprises two nonrandomized (A1 and A2) and two randomized arms (A3 and A4). In arm A1, presented here, patients with no prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic GC/GEJC/EAC received intravenously administered domvanalimab 1,600 mg and zimberelimab 480 mg once every 4 weeks with FOLFOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg m−2, leucovorin 400 mg m−2, fluorouracil 400 mg m−2 on day 1 and fluorouracil 2,400 mg m−2 on days 1 and 2 (continuous 46–48-h infusion)) once every 2 weeks. The study is open label, so investigators were not blinded to the allocation of enrolled patients. EDGE-Gastric (NCT05329766) was registered on 8 April 2022 with ClinicalTrials.gov, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05329766. Additional details are provided in the study protocol (online only).

Patients

Eligible patients were aged ≥18 years, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and had not received previous systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients with known HER2-positive status and patients with untreated, symptomatic or actively progressing central nervous system brain metastases were excluded. Complete eligibility criteria are presented in Supplementary Table 3.

Sex was recorded as a binary variable based on self-reported biological characteristics. Gender identity was not collected or analyzed in this study. No analyses stratified by sex were conducted.

Ethics approval and consent

The study was conducted in full conformance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines, institutional review board regulations and all other applicable local regulations. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee at each site (Supplementary Table 4). All patients provided written informed consent before any study procedures; patients were not compensated monetarily for participation in this trial.

Procedures

Lesions were assessed at screening and every 6 weeks thereafter through week 48 or end of treatment (whichever occurred first), then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression, initiation of a subsequent anticancer therapy, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, study termination or death—whichever occurred first. Treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, initiation of a subsequent anticancer therapy, physician or patient decision to withdraw, completion of a maximum treatment duration of 2 years or death—whichever occurred first. With the patient’s agreement, investigators could continue treatment beyond initial disease progression at their discretion based on the patient’s risk–benefit profile. Patients who experienced unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic deterioration due to disease progression or confirmed disease progression were discontinued from study treatment.

Tumor tissue was evaluated for PD-L1 expression at a central laboratory. Tumor samples were stained using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) companion diagnostics assay (Roche Diagnostics). The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay is approved in the USA as a companion diagnostic to determine PD-L1 expression at a ≥1% tumor cell cutoff in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Pathologists assessed PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells using the TAP score. The TAP score is defined as the total percentage of the tumor area (tumor and any desmoplastic stroma) covered by tumor cells with membranous PD-L1 staining at any intensity and tumor-associated immune cells with PD-L1 staining at any intensity, according to visual estimation. As previously published, TAP scores of ≥1% and ≥5% were used as cutoffs31. Patients with TAP score ≥1% were considered PD-L1 positive and <1% were considered PD-L1 negative. Patients with TAP score ≥5% were considered PD-L1 high and <5% were considered PD-L1 low. In the assessment of concordance between the SP263 assay with TAP score and the 28-8 assay with CPS, the 28-8 assay was performed retrospectively on serial sections to minimize effects from tissue heterogeneity.

Endpoints and assessments

The dual primary endpoints of safety and investigator-assessed ORR were evaluated in patients who enrolled and received any study treatment (treated analysis population). ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response or partial response, per RECIST v1.1. Patients who discontinued before completing postbaseline tumor assessments were considered nonresponders.

Secondary endpoints were OS, PFS, DCR and DOR overall and by PD-L1 expression, as well as ORR by PD-L1 expression. OS was defined as the time from first dose until death due to any cause. PFS was defined as the time from first dose until first documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause. DCR was defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed BOR of complete response, partial response or stable disease. DOR was defined as the time from date of initial response (complete response or partial response) until the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause (in confirmed responders only).

Adverse events (AEs) were assessed in the treated analysis population and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs v25.0. Severity was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. Investigators assessed whether an AE was related to study treatment. Infusion-related reactions were defined as AEs that occurred ≤1 day after the end of study drug infusion administration (within 24 h if time was available), were ≤2 days in duration and were in the custom AE preferred term search list (infusion-related reaction, pyrexia, chills, rigors, hypotension, dyspnea, wheezing, urticaria, flushing, back pain, abdominal pain, drug hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity, type 1 hypersensitivity, pruritus or rash). Immune-related AEs were defined as all AEs of any grade in the custom PD-1 immune-related AE search list, except for preferred terms containing “PD-1 skin toxicities”, for which only grade ≥3 AEs were included.

Statistical analysis

The EDGE-Gastric study was prespecified to include three cohorts (A, B and C) and cohort A was prespecified to include four arms (A1–A4) (Extended Data Fig. 2). All cohorts and arms have a prespecified enrollment plan and statistical design. The planned enrollment in arm A1 was approximately 40 patients, of which approximately 50% would have PD-L1 high expression. The sample size justification was based on an estimation framework, and the study was designed for descriptive statistical analysis rather than formal statistical hypothesis testing with Type I error and power considerations.

Median OS, median PFS, median DOR, PFS rate at 24 months and OS rate at 24 months were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. For PFS, OS and DOR, the 90% CI was based on the log–log transformation of the corresponding survival function. Exact binomial Clopper–Pearson 90% CIs were constructed for ORR. The median duration of study follow-up was calculated as the time from cycle 1, day 1, until the data cutoff date, regardless of events or dropout. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4.

Reporting summary

Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.
