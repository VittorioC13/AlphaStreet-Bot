[TITLE]NTB secures approval to acquire HSBC Sri Lanka operations:

Nations Trust Bank (NTB) has received the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) approval for its previously announced acquisition of the Retail Banking operations of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Sri Lanka (HSBC Sri Lanka).

In September this year, HSBC Sri Lanka signed a binding agreement to transfer its Retail Banking operations to NTB.

The acquisition would provide NTB with around 200,000 HSBC Sri Lanka customer accounts, including premium banking clients, retail loans and credit cards.

It is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026.

Upon closing, HSBC’s corporate and institutional banking operations in Sri Lanka will remain unchanged, continuing to serve international corporate clients and offering cross-border trade and investment services.

NTB said that the acquisition would strengthen its position in the premium retail banking segment and support its long-term growth objectives.

Nations Trust Bank director and CEO Hemantha Gunetilleke said “The approval from CBSL gives us the go-ahead to move forward with the acquisition process, which is currently progressing very well. We are now able to move into the next phase of the project with confidence.”

The sale of its retail banking business is part of HSBC Group’s simplification plan announced in October last year.

The decision follows a strategic review that determined divestment of the retail unit was the preferred course for the group and its stakeholders.

HSBC, at that time, said the reorganisation allows it to concentrate on areas where it has a competitive focus and growth prospects.

HSBC Sri Lanka CEO Mark Surgenor said: “Our priority during this period is to uphold the highest service levels for our customers and ensure that our colleagues are well supported during the transition into NTB.

“We are working closely with NTB towards a seamless transfer of banking services upon completion of the transaction.”

[TITLE]JP Morgan Chase Buys Miami Beach Retail Branch:
[TEXT]
J.P. Morgan Chase bought back its retail banking branch in Miami Beach, paying a threefold premium since its sale 11 years ago.

The finance giant paid $23.5 million for the 25,030-square-foot building at 1801 Alton Road in the Sunset Harbour neighborhood, property records show. The two-story property sits on a 1-acre site, facing Dade Boulevard.

J.P. Morgan Chase purchased the property for $4 million in 2010. Four years later, the current sellers, a Coral Gables-based entity managed by Dominic Cavagnuolo, acquired the building for $8 million.

A representative for the sellers could not be reached, while a spokesperson for J.P. Morgan Chase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, J.P. Morgan Chase’s competitor, Wells Fargo, sold its 6,654-square-foot retail branch next door at 1901 Alton Road for $15 million to the family office of developer Russell Galbut. The developer obtained a $54 million construction loan for a Whole Foods-anchored development, where Wells Fargo will operate a 4,000-square-foot retail location.

J.P. Morgan Chase’s acquisition is also another example of retailers buying the properties they lease. Last year, nearby on Lincoln Road, Alo Yoga paid $17 million for a retail condo, where it plans to open a store and private gym. The activewear brand also bought its boutique in the Miami Design District for $22 million the year prior.

Since 2024, grocer Publix has spent about $345 million buying seven retail centers it anchors in South Florida.

Food Processing Secretary A P Das Joshi on Thursday asked corporates to invest more in the sector to enhance the processing level from the current low of 12 per cent and also boost exports of processed food items.Addressing a CII event here, the secretary emphasised the need to dispel the myth that processed food is inherently bad.He also highlighted that the labour codes would benefit the sector.Joshi said that the issues related to the HFSS (High fat, sugar, salt) and FOPNL (Front-of-pack nutrition labelling) are under "very, very active consideration of the government" and there could be some decision in the near future.He was addressing a session on 'Scaling Food Processing for Rural Prosperity and Jobs' organised as part of the CII IndiaEdge 2025."We have 24 lakh units across the country, and only 2 per cent are organised. I look forward to a higher level of investment from the captains of the industry," Joshi said, adding that there is a huge scope for FDI and private domestic investment.He also emphasised the need for formalisation of the informal."Whatever you process ultimately comes from lakhs of farmers. So whenever we are doing the value addition, a part of it goes to the farmers. So rural prosperity, it is necessary that we increase the processing level. We process hardly 12 per cent of our food.

[TITLE]‘When I’m young and going out a lot, I don’t want to worry about putting on weight’:
[TEXT]
Everyone knows that alcohol can cause weight gain, particularly beer, sugary cocktails and creamy liqueurs. But while the most likely action for anyone trying to lose a few pounds would be to cut down on the amount of alcoholic drinks they consume, some people are doing the opposite and are cutting down their food intake in order to increase their “alcohol allowance”. This practice appears to be particularly prevalent among students and young adults.

Two students, Sarah and Aisling, are no strangers to food restricted alcohol consumption (FRAC), and say most of their friends do it as a means of staying slim and “not having to worry

[TITLE]Trump's trade war shift away from Chinese manufacturing has reached tipping point:
[TEXT]
A container is offloaded from the Wanhai 175 cargo ship at the Tan Vu Terminal, operated by Vietnam Maritime Corp., at Haiphong Port in Haiphong, Vietnam, on Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2025.

The proportion of volume from suppliers in China, Hong Kong, and Korea has declined from 90% to 50% over the past decade, reflecting a long-term diversification of supply chains that picked up steam during the first Trump administration and trade war, according to an analysis from Wells Fargo Supply Chain Finance.

"From 2018 to 2020, the supplier diversification away from China nearly doubled after the first tariff actions," said Jeremy Jansen, head of global originations at Wells Fargo Supply Chain Finance.

He said since the first trade war, the gradual increase in supply chain diversification away from China to the South Asia Pacific region has steadily grown.

"Based on our supplier counts, diversification is now 50/50 between the northern Asia Pacific region and the Southern," Jansen said. "The migration of midsize suppliers can be tracked into Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, India, and Malaysia," he added.

Imports from China to the U.S. have dropped by 26 percent year-over-year, according to data from freight intelligence firm SONAR, but trade volumes from China to the South Asia Pacific region have significantly increased.

According to Project 44, which tracks supply chain shifts, China's trade in 2025 has increased to Indonesia by 29.2 percent, Vietnam by 23 percent, India by 19.4 percent and Thailand by 4.3 percent. In turn, year-over-year container trade volume to the U.S. is up 23 percent for Vietnam, 9.3 percent for Thailand, and 5.4 percent for Indonesia.

Data released by China on Monday showed that as its exports to the U.S. continued to decline in November, exports to ASEAN and EU nations rose over 8% and nearly 15%, respectively. Through the first 11 months of the year, China's overall exports grew 5.4% compared to the previous annual period, leading to a trade surplus over $ trillion.

[TITLE]As Nike Shakes Up Its C-Suite, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold NKE Stock?:
[TEXT]
NIKE (NKE), the global icon of sport and streetwear, is hitting the reset button at the very top. With news that the company is dramatically reshuffling its C-suite under CEO Elliott Hill’s “Win Now” plan , senior leaders are being replaced, new roles created, and decision-making streamlined as the brand pivots toward speed, efficiency, and digital-first execution.

Nike is restructuring its senior leadership team as part of its turnaround strategy, aiming to cut unnecessary management layers, strengthen consumer connections, and accelerate its “sport offense.” At the heart of the shake-up, l ongtime supply-chain head Venkatesh Alagirisamy is elevated to a newly minted Chief Operating Officer role, while absorbing not just logistics and manufacturing, but also technology leadership. As a result, Nike has eliminated the Chief Technology Officer position, leading to the departure of Dr. Muge Dogan.

In a broader shift, the heads of Nike’s four major geographies: Greater China, EMEA, North America, and APLA, will now join the senior leadership team and report directly to CEO Elliott Hill. The company is also removing the Chief Commercial Officer role, while Global Sales and Nike Direct will now report to CFO Matt Friend, positioning him to closely align marketplace strategy with Nike’s broader priorities.

In light of these sweeping changes, is now the time to buy, sell, or hold NKE stock?

[TITLE]Kenya seeks fresh US trade deal amidst AGOA extension:
[TEXT]
Kenya is seeking for a new bilateral trade and investment agreement with the United States to replace earlier initiatives that ran aground, even as Washington proposes a one-year extension of the soon-to-expire African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a top Kenyan official said on Friday.

Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, who also serves as Cabinet secretary for foreign and diaspora affairs, said talks during a high-level visit to Washington this week centred on crafting a fresh reciprocal pact that would secure better market access and eventually remove tariffs hurting Kenyan exporters.

“The US wants AGOA extended for one year – that is the position of the administration,” Mudavadi told The EastAfrican. “But in the meantime, we are pursuing a bilateral agreement. The free trade agreement and the US-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership are no longer in place.”

AGOA expires after 25 years

The African Growth and Opportunity Act, the landmark 2000 law granting duty-free access to the US market for thousands of African products, officially expired on 30 September 2025 after repeated attempts at long-term renewal stalled in Congress. For Kenya the programme has been vital, sustaining tens of thousands of jobs in textiles and agriculture and generating more than KSh60 billion (USD460 million) in exports last year alone.

President William Ruto, leading the Kenyan delegation in Washington, met United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to map out the next steps. Mudavadi, who accompanied Ruto, said the proposed one-year bridge would prevent an abrupt end for African exporters while both sides design “a stronger, more comprehensive programme that advances the interests of both nations”.

Earlier negotiations abandoned

Previous efforts have repeatedly faltered. During Donald Trump’s first term, the two countries explored a full free trade agreement, but negotiations never concluded. Under Joe Biden the focus shifted to the Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership, launched in July 2022 to tackle non-tariff barriers in areas such as digital trade, labour rights, agriculture and anti-corruption measures. That initiative has now been shelved.

“Even the Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership that was being negotiated is no longer in place,” Mudavadi confirmed. “They have been talking of bilateral trade agreements.”

Trump tariffs add pressure

The urgency has been sharpened by Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy. Since 9 April 2025, most Kenyan goods entering the United States have faced a 10% duty – the lowest band but still painful for exporters, according to Nairobi.

“Kenya is at the lowest band of tariffs, but we did discuss that even the 10% is hurting some of our exporters,” Mudavadi said. “The whole idea of the bilateral trade agreement is to eventually resolve this in totality.”

Kenyan officials are targeting growth in apparel and textiles, agriculture, leather and footwear, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and information communication technology and digital services – sectors they believe can create thousands of jobs and attract new investment if barriers are lowered.

Other gains during Washington visit

The Washington trip produced other visible results. Ruto witnessed the signing of a new US-Kenya health cooperation framework alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and shook hands with Trump after the US-brokered Democratic Republic of Congo-Rwanda peace accord was signed at the United States Institute of Peace on 5 December.

China factor looms large

The fate of AGOA carries implications far beyond Kenya. Bipartisan lawmakers in Washington see the programme as a strategic counterweight to China’s expanding footprint in Africa. Beijing announced in June that it would remove tariffs on goods from 53 of 54 African countries, intensifying the rivalry for influence.

Republican congressman Adrian Smith, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee that oversees AGOA, has called the law a “pillar of US diplomatic relations” and a demonstration of “America’s commitment to Africa’s young, growing population”. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who co-sponsored a 2024 bill for a 16-year extension, warned that failure to renew the pact would allow China to fill the vacuum.

An International Trade Centre study estimates that without AGOA, exports from the 32 eligible African countries to the United States would fall 8.7% by 2029, even after accounting for recent US tariff measures. A renewed programme would limit the damage to around 8%.

For now, the one-year extension awaits congressional approval. Kenyan officials say they are working flat out to turn the temporary reprieve into a broader, more predictable partnership.

“Our discussions went further, focusing on the development of a new bilateral trade arrangement that will elevate Kenya-US economic cooperation to the next level,” Mudavadi said. “We are working on a joint framework that will open new trade opportunities, strengthen predictability for investors, and build a modern partnership that reflects the ambitions of our two countries.”

With thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in trade hanging in the balance, Nairobi and Washington have a narrow window to transform a stop-gap measure into a lasting deal.

[TITLE]BasicNet Plans to Relocate Woolrich Corporate Employees to Turin, Trade Unions Push Back:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Less than a month after BasicNet acquired Woolrich from Luxembourg-based fund L-Gam in a deal that valued the storied outerwear player at 90 million euros, the new owner is facing a dispute with trade unions.

The latter are claiming that the company has decided to shut corporate operations in Bologna and Milan, where Woolrich employs 109 and 30 workers, respectively, leaving them with no other option than accept a relocation to the BasicNet headquarters in Turin to avoid being laid off.

The move would not affect retail employees in those cities, where Woolrich operates two of its 25 flagships in Europe.

BasicNet’s portfolio of brands also comprises Kappa, Robe di Kappa, K-Way, Superga, Sebago and Briko, in addition to Woolrich and beachwear specialist Sundek. The latter’s acquisition was revealed Thursday.

On Friday, BasicNet issued a statement clarifying its position, saying that “this is not a closure, but rather a strategic move aimed at revitalizing the brand and ensuring job continuity. The decision to move the headquarters and its employees to Turin is designed to strengthen Woolrich’s brand value by investing in a central hub that can support future growth and create beneficial synergies.”

The company said it is committed to safeguarding jobs and will resort to any available welfare measure to ensure a smooth transition for employees unable to relocate to Turin.

“People are the heart of the company, and we are excited to welcome all employees into the big BasicNet family,” said Alessandro Boglione, co-chief executive officer of BasicNet, in the statement. “We are committed to following all the right procedures, which is why we are working closely with trade unions to provide clear and timely answers to employees who have sought clarity.”

“We hope to find shared solutions quickly so we can provide certainty and ensure the transition respects everyone involved,” added Lorenzo Boglione, co-CEO of the company.

The BasicNet transaction, revealed in November, involved the acquisition through a wholly owned subsidiary of the rights to the Woolrich brand for Europe and 100 percent of Woolrich Europe SpA, the company managing its distribution and retail activities. Its revenues for fiscal year 2025 are expected to be around 90 million euros.

Through the deal L-Gam exited Woolrich seven years after acquiring the brand in 2018 from its former owner, WP Lavori in Corso. Last December L-Gam forged a deal with Chinese apparel group Baoxiniao Holding Co. Ltd., which acquired Woolrich’s intellectual property rights for all territories outside Europe.

Woolrich was founded in 1830 by John Rich in Pennsylvania, and is one of the oldest American producers of wool fabrics and outdoor clothing. The company was created to provide durable and functional garments for hunters, lumberjacks and railway workers.

In 1850, Woolrich introduced its signature Buffalo red and black check pattern. In 1940, responding to the needs of workers building oil pipelines in Alaska, the Arctic Parka was born — designed to withstand extreme temperatures and another signature garment for the brand.

The Woolrich Arctic Parka. courtesy image

BasicNet was founded by Lorenzo and Alessandro Boglione’s father, Marco Boglione, who created the group in 1994 as a marketplace and publicly listed it on the Milan Stock Exchange in 1999.

Stemming from the storied traditional clothing company Maglificio Calzificio Torinese, which was founded in 1916, BasicNet doesn’t produce or distribute the collections of its brands. Billing itself as a “fully web-integrated company” through a digitally advanced platform, it acts as a marketplace where manufacturers and distributors meet to do business.

In particular, BasicNet designs and develops its labels’ collections, signs licensing agreements with international producers and distributors, which receive from BasicNet all they need to manufacture and sell the products, from research and development to global marketing.

[TITLE]India’s e-commerce growth continues to outpace global market: Elara Capital:
[TEXT]
India’s e-commerce continued to outperform global markets in the September quarter, according to analysis by Elara Capital. It noted that while US online sales grew by about 5-6 per cent year-on-year while Indian online sales continued to grow double-digit.

Karan Taurani, Executive Vice-President, Elara Capital noted in a sector update report, “India’s digital commerce flywheel continues to outperform global markets, with e-commerce and quick commerce growing faster than in the US. While US online sales rose ~5-6 per cent YoY, India continues in double digits with robust trajectory fuelled by quick commerce channel driving user expansion and regional penetration.

He added that advertising is also shifting in India to digital mediums as brands chase high-ROI performance channels, directly benefiting ad-tech players such as Affle, with direct customer relations.

“Despite solid momentum, India’s category penetration is far below US levels, offering one of the largest multi-year growth runways globally across apparel, electronics, GM and beauty,” he added.

Taurani added that India’s e-commerce maturity curve trails the US and China by 10–12 years. “ This offers a compelling long-term growth as these mature markets growth plateaus. In the near term, India’s e-commerce expansion will be driven by the rise of quick commerce and mass-commerce,” he added.

Global e-commerce was steady in the third quarter of CY25, with US online sales being 5 per cent year-on-year with penetration at about 16-17 per cent, the report noted.
