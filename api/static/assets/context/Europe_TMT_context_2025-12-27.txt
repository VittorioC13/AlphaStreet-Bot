[TITLE]Emerge's 2025 Story of the Year: How the AI Race Fractured the Global Tech Order:
[TEXT]
In brief DeepSeek’s ultra-low-cost AI model shattered the assumption that U.S. chip dominance would indefinitely suppress China’s AI ambitions, triggering a global tech realignment.

By late 2025, the U.S. and China had severely decoupled their AI ecosystems—splitting hardware, software, standards, and supply chains—while embedding civilian AI advances into military doctrine.

The rivalry extended beyond bilateral conflict, forcing allies and emerging economies to choose between American-led proprietary control and China’s open-source influence, all while rare earths, data centers, and defense contracts became frontline assets in a new cold war over intelligence itself.

The great unraveling began with a single number: $256,000. DeepSeek, a year-old Chinese startup, claimed it spent that relatively small sum training an AI model that matched the capabilities of OpenAI—which spent over a hundred million dollars to get to the same place. When the app hit Apple's store in January, Nvidia lost $600 billion in a single trading day, which was the largest one-day wipeout in market history.

The technical feat aside, DeepSeek’s efficiency breakthrough quickly ignited a global contest far beyond benchmarks or code. Nvidia's China market share had collapsed from 95% to zero. Beijing banned all foreign AI chips from government data centers. The Pentagon signed $10 billion in AI defense contracts. And the world's two largest economies had split the technology stack into warring camps, from silicon to software to standards.

The AI war of 2025 was redrawing the map of global power.

DeepSeek's breakthrough exposed a strategic miscalculation that had defined American AI policy for years: the belief that controlling advanced chips would permanently cripple China's ambitions. The company trained its R1 model using older H800 GPUs—chips that fell below export control thresholds—proving that algorithmic efficiency could compensate for hardware disadvantages.

"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen—and as open source, a profound gift to the world," venture capitalist Marc Andreessen posted on X after testing it.

The AI market entered panic mode. Stocks tanked, politicians started polishing their patriotic speeches, analysis exposed the intricacies of what could end up in a bubble, and enthusiasts mocked American models that cost orders of magnitude more than the Chinese counterparts, which were free, cheap and required a fraction of the money and resources to train.

Washington's response was swift and punishing. The Trump administration expanded export controls throughout the year, banning even downgraded chips designed specifically for the Chinese market. By April, Trump restricted Nvidia from shipping its H20 chips.

“While the Nvidia news is concerning, it’s not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides,” Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Secruities, told CNN.

The tit-for-tat escalated into full decoupling. A new China's directive issued in September banned Nvidia, AMD, and Intel chips from any data center receiving government money—a market worth over $100 billion since 2021. Jensen Huang revealed the company's market share in China had hit "zero, compared to 95% in 2022."

﻿

“At the moment, we are 100% out of China,” Huang said. “I can’t imagine any policymaker thinking that’s a good idea—that whatever policy we implemented caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world to zero.” He called U.S. policy "a mistake" that would backfire by accelerating Chinese chip independence.

He was right. Huawei and domestic players like Cambricon now dominate China's AI infrastructure. By year's end, analysts projected Chinese chipmakers would capture 40% of the domestic AI server market—a stunning reversal from near-total American dominance just three years earlier.

But the semiconductor war was only the surface. Beneath it, America deployed its most potent weapon: control over the economics of the global market, setting up an "AI Action Plan" in July and a policy of tariffs and sanctions aimed at cementing its political and financial dominance.

In response, China began to exert control over the physical elements that make modern technology possible. In October, Beijing announced the strictest rare earth export controls in its history. The new restrictions didn't just limit sales—they applied the Foreign Direct Product Rule to rare earths for the first time, meaning even products made outside China using Chinese rare earth technology would require export licenses. Companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries would be automatically denied.

The target was unmistakable: America's defense industrial base. China controls 94% of permanent magnet production and 90% of rare earth refining—the elements essential for F-35 fighter jets, Tomahawk missiles, and the AI chips that power autonomous weapons. The expanded controls covered holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, each critical to defense systems.

The U.S. wasn’t caught flat-footed. In July, the Pentagon had invested $400 million in MP Materials, America's only rare earth miner, becoming its largest shareholder. The deal included a 10-year price floor of $110 per kilogram—nearly double the market rate—to protect domestic production from Chinese price dumping. But even with this investment, MP Materials would produce just 1,000 tons of neodymium-boron-iron magnets by year's end—less than 1% of China's 138,000-ton output.

"It's scandalous that we don't have a rare earths strategic reserve," University of Pennsylvania finance professor Jeremy Siegel told CNBC. The supply chain warfare had exposed a vulnerability more fundamental than chip design: America's military depended on adversary-controlled minerals to function.

The AI battle of the titans is continuing. In late November, Trump signed an executive order launching the Genesis Mission—a Department of Energy-led AI initiative the White House compared in "urgency and ambition" to the Manhattan Project.

The Genesis Mission aims to build an integrated AI platform that would harness decades of federal scientific datasets to train "scientific foundation models" and deploy AI agents for autonomous research and discovery. Its goals range from nuclear fusion to advanced manufacturing to semiconductor development, with the platform designed to give American researchers access to supercomputing resources and proprietary datasets no Chinese lab could match.

But whether the $400 million already invested in rare earth mining or the Genesis Mission's national laboratory network can offset China's manufacturing dominance remains unclear—but Washington is now treating AI supremacy as a matter of wartime urgency.

From trade war to actual war?

It turns out that China's advancements were the product of a Military-Civil Fusion Strategy, as the Marine Corps call it. Under Xi Jinping's oversight, China started to create an integrated ecosystem where nearly every technological advance can also serve military purposes.

PLA strategists envision AI transforming not just weapons but warfare itself. Large language models would conduct cognitive operations, manipulating adversary perceptions and decision-making. Swarms of obsolete fighters converted to autonomous drones would overwhelm defenses through sheer scale. The goal: transition to "intelligentized warfare" where speed of decision-making—measured in milliseconds—determines victory.

In the west, Silicon Valley's relationship with the Pentagon also underwent its own revolution. Tech giants that once banned military work now competed for defense contracts worth hundreds of billions. The whole trend started back in December 2024, when Palantir and Anduril announced a consortium to build AI infrastructure for the military.

OpenAI, which had prohibited weapons applications, reversed course and signed defense partnerships with the Pentagon. Google, which abandoned Project Maven in 2018 after employee protests, quietly returned with a $200 million Pentagon contract in July. Anthropic also started to adopt a more anti-China political stance, urging governments to intervene to hinder China's advances and securing a western dominance of the industry.

The battle for the consumer

While hardware wars raged and militaries mobilized, American companies staged a comeback in AI's most visible consumer domain: video generation. OpenAI's Sora 2, released in September, set new standards with synchronized audio, 4K resolution, and multi-shot storytelling. Google's Veo 3 and its 3.1 update followed, leveraging unrestricted access to H100 and H200 chips that Chinese competitors couldn't obtain.

Just a few months earlier, China's Kuaishou and other firms had led text-to-video development. Now American firms dominated, proving that in compute-intensive domains, hardware access remained decisive.

The American resurgence extended beyond video to the foundational models themselves. In November, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5—what the company called "the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use." The model became the first to break 80% on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark measuring real-world software engineering capabilities, outperforming both OpenAI's GPT-5.1 and Google's Gemini 3 Pro. Anthropic claimed the model scored higher on its internal engineering tests than any human job candidate ever had. For an industry that had spent January panicking over DeepSeek's efficiency breakthrough, Claude Opus 4.5 served as a reminder that American labs still held the performance crown—at least for now.

China vs. world: Open-source models fight it out

2025 was also a great year for open-source models. In fact, one could argue that this was the year open-source AI caught up—and, again, it involved its own dose of the good old China vs America drama.

Image: NBC

Alibaba's Qwen family alone accounted for 40% of new language models uploaded monthly to Hugging Face, spawning over 100,000 derivatives and 600 million downloads. The open approach built soft power that export controls couldn't touch—developers worldwide could run Chinese models without restriction, creating a parallel ecosystem independent of American infrastructure.

And how can you prevent a global adoption of free open source models? With regulations.

China's DeepSeek faced bans across dozens of countries. Italy moved first in January, blocking the app over data privacy violations. Taiwan, Australia, South Korea, and multiple U.S. states and agencies followed. By July, NATO allies including the Czech Republic branded DeepSeek a "Trojan horse" for Beijing's intelligence services.

Meta's Llama used to be the most popular LLM in the community; the fourth generation was released this year. OpenAI also released GPT-oss, its only open source model in years. Besides that, the open-source LLM community didn't see much hype in America. Ai2 released a family of models trained in America from scratch, and other companies, including Perplexity, fine-tuned DeepSeek to make it more pro-US and anti-China in its responses.

Not everything is rivalry, though, when developers leave geopolitical fights aside and work towards common goals, they come up with nice products. The models developed by Nous Research—a research team from America, China, Europe and the UAE—is a good example of that.

Besides the China-US Cold-War 2.0, other governments also started to get more involved in AI, setting it as a key element of their public agendas.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE pledged $2 trillion in AI investments during Trump's May visit—money dwarfing American hyperscaler spending. Saudi Arabia's $600 billion commitment included partnerships with Nvidia, AMD, Google Cloud, and AWS to build 2,200 megawatts of data center capacity—more than four times the UAE's 500 megawatts.

Both nations walked a tightrope, wanting American chips and expertise while maintaining deep China ties through Huawei-built telecommunications infrastructure. Washington demanded they choose sides, imposing strict controls to ensure AI hardware didn't reach Beijing or Moscow.

Europe too mounted its own sovereignty bid. The European Commission unveiled a €200 billion InvestAI initiative in April, targeting AI gigafactories and data infrastructure to reduce dependence on American and Chinese technology. But by year's end, the €200 billion remained largely aspirational. Europe allocated just 18% of its €252 billion in venture capital to AI between 2020-2025, compared to America's 34% of $1.33 trillion.

The fracturing carries profound implications. Trade patterns are realigning. Military doctrines are being rewritten around AI-enabled warfare. Developing nations face pressure to choose between eastern and western standards—decisions that will shape their digital governance for decades.

China's bet on open-source democratization versus America's proprietary model represents competing visions of technological power. Beijing seeks influence through freely available tools that create dependencies subtler than export controls. Washington relies on maintaining leads in frontier capabilities and controlling access to the most powerful systems.

Neither strategy guarantees victory. China's open models gain adoption but sacrifice economic returns that fund development. America's closed systems generate revenue but risk irrelevance if developers migrate to unrestricted alternatives. Europe… is being Europe.

What began as a trade dispute over AI chips has metastasized into full-spectrum competition encompassing technology, ideology, resources, and military doctrine. China weaponized its rare earth monopoly. America mobilized its defense industrial base. Both nations fused civilian innovation with military applications in a race toward AI-enabled warfare that has no precedent in history.

The silicon iron curtain that descended in 2025 may prove as consequential as the one that divided Europe for half a century. Only this time, the fault line runs through every smartphone, data center, autonomous system, and permanent magnet that powers modern civilization. The great divide has begun.

From an uncertain geopolitical environment that created an atmosphere of fear and fragility to the constantly evolving belligerent posture of the world’s two largest economies—the US and China—Indian businesses had to navigate a complex global landscape not only to stay resilient but also to find avenues for growth amid mounting challenges.India Inc had moments of caution, but it also made the most of the situation by recalibrating strategy and approach, choosing to invest time and energy in long-term growth rather than short-term gains. Many of these moves may not appear significant at the moment, as they are unlikely to yield immediate results, but over the longer run, they are expected to prove effective and bear fruit.One of the foremost challenges for India in 2025 was managing its approach towards China. In April, when China halted the supply of critical rare earth metals, essential for chips, weapons, electric vehicles and several other applications — India Inc, particularly automobile giants, knocked on the government’s door to secure supplies. Without intervention, the disruption threatened to derail India’s ambitious electric vehicle adoption plans.As industry flagged concerns, the government swiftly doubled down on diplomatic channels while simultaneously fast-tracking domestic measures. This included accelerated execution of the National Critical Mineral Mission , aimed at reducing regulatory bottlenecks and opening doors for private firms to scale up exploration and processing of rare earths. India also partnered with countries such as Australia, Japan and the US to explore alternative supply-chain routes.Although China partially eased the curbs later, the episode delivered a sharp jolt. It pushed India to prepare for future shocks, and crucial groundwork was laid to strengthen long-term resilience.Despite geopolitical headwinds and global uncertainty, India emerged as the world’s fourth-largest economy in 2025 in terms of GDP. India’s resilience stemmed largely from strong domestic consumption. As a consumption-driven economy, India was less vulnerable to the damage caused by Trump’s tariff war, which hit export-dependent economies like China harder. Manufacturing expansion — particularly in defence exports and a robust digital services sector also boosted investor confidence.GDP growth remained mostly in the 6–7% range, supported by public capital expenditure, services exports and sustained government spending on roads, transport and renewable energy. While corporate capex stayed relatively muted, India Inc’s balance sheets remained healthy.The 2025 Budget marked a decisive shift in India’s tax architecture, with a clear focus on simplifying compliance and boosting consumption. The government recalibrated income-tax slabs under the new regime to broaden the base, simplify compliance and put more disposable income in consumers’ hands.At the same time, the GST framework was streamlined, reducing multiple slabs to just two key rates — 5% and 18%. This not only eased the compliance burden for businesses but also strengthened digitisation and helped sustain business momentum across sectors.Investor confidence in India’s growth story was clearly reflected in a steady pipeline of IPOs on Dalal Street in 2025. From ICICI Prudential AMC — the country’s largest asset management company — to JSW Cement , manufacturing-linked firms such as Saatvik Green Energy and Manas Polymers, and niche industrial SME listings like Bai Kakaji Polymers and Admach, the market saw wide participation.Several marquee IPOs were oversubscribed multiple times, while many delivered healthy listing gains, reinforcing confidence in India’s long-term growth narrative.India witnessed a flurry of announcements and policy action aimed at building a manufacturing ecosystem focused on value addition and supply-chain resilience. Semiconductors gained priority, and incentives expanded under the PLI framework. Auto and EV companies scrambled to secure rare earth supplies from alternative sources, while defence manufacturing received a major boost as export order books swelled.India also sharpened its positioning from ‘Make in India’ to ‘Make in India, for the World’, projecting itself as a credible manufacturing hub capable of challenging China’s dominance. Manufacturing currently contributes about 17% to India’s GDP, but the government has set an ambitious target of raising this share to 25% by 2047. Decisions taken in 2025 — through initiatives such as PLI schemes, Make in India and support for sunrise sectors — are expected to be critical stepping stones.In 2025, trade policy emerged as a core economic tool. India concluded multiple trade agreements to diversify markets and counter tariff pressures. A landmark Free Trade Agreement with the UK was signed mid-year, followed by the finalisation of an FTA with New Zealand in December. India also concluded negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman in August, improving access to Gulf markets.Simultaneously, talks continued with the US, the EU and key Indo-Pacific partners, while ensuring protection for sensitive domestic sectors.As India heads into 2026, the questions are no longer about growth potential but about execution — whether the country can build deep manufacturing ecosystems, secure critical minerals, and strengthen technological capabilities for the long haul.

[TITLE]How Trump's 'crony capitalism' has shaken up U.S. business:
[TEXT]
How Trump's 'crony capitalism' has shaken up U.S. business

toggle caption Pool/Getty Images North America

State capitalism. MAGA Marxism. Crony capitalism.

Those are just some of the terms business and political commentators have used this year to describe how President Trump's policies are reshaping U.S. free-market capitalism. There are some differences in definition — but all of these terms underline how dramatically Trump has blurred the boundaries between business and government, to an extent that could have long-term consequences for the U.S. economy and the country's global standing.

"When the American government appears to favor a company over rival companies, that distorts the marketplace," says Ann Lipton, a veteran business law expert and professor at University of Colorado's law school.

"It means that other firms have less incentive to compete on innovation, which is sort of the opposite of how a free market is supposed to operate," she adds. "It's just bad for the economy."

There's ample evidence this year of Trump actively favoring some U.S. companies and investors, while threatening others. In August, he publicly called for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan — until Tan came to the White House to meet with him, and agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in the tech company.

Several other tech CEOs also spent the year appearing to personally court Trump. Take Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who runs the world's most valuable company and is among the donors funding Trump's controversial plans to build a White House ballroom. This month, Trump said the U.S. would grant Nvidia permission to sell one of its more advanced semiconductor chips in China — as long as the U.S. government gets a 25% cut of sales.

Lipton calls this capitalism by "schmoozing," and warns that it could seriously damage the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, thus hurting the overall economy in the long term.

"We're not going to get the best innovations. We're not going to get the best products," she says. "If [businesses] are competing on their ability to schmooze, then that's bad for everybody."

Intel did not respond to an NPR request for comment. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Nvidia said, "In our discussions, President Trump focuses on his desire for America to win as a nation and his efforts to protect national security, American prosperity and technology leadership."

China-style 'state capitalism'

Business leaders have always spent some amount of time trying to cozy up to the White House, no matter its occupant. But Lipton and business insiders across the political spectrum say that Trump's direct influence over private companies this year — and the degree to which some of those companies and their leaders have sought to appeal to him personally — is pushing the U.S. economy away from free-market or "rules-based" capitalism.

Sponsor Message

This system, traditionally embraced by both businesses and Republicans, has helped make the United States into the dominant global economy.

But now, these business insiders say, Trump's policies are creating a government-controlled style of "state capitalism," in which the government — rather than competition between private businesses — shapes the economy. Some go so far as to call it "crony capitalism," meaning that the U.S. government picks winners and losers based on the president's personal relationships.

"We are seeing a shift away from the type of rules-based capitalism that has made America's economy so robust for so long. And there's a lot of risk in that," says Daniella Ballou-Aares, who co-founded the consulting firm Dalberg and served in President Obama's State Department. She now runs the Leadership Now Project, a coalition of business leaders that has endorsed candidates from both political parties.

In October, her group and The Harris Poll surveyed business leaders across the political spectrum — and found that 84% are worried "

[TITLE]AI-linked IPOs in China are exploding. But it's not easy for foreigners to join the party:
[TEXT]
China's hottest artificial-intelligence listings are delivering eye-popping gains.

Shares of chipmaker MetaX Integrated Circuits skyrocketed almost 700% in their Shanghai market debut last week, while Moore Threads soared over 400% on its first day of trading earlier this month.

While domestic investors scramble for exposure to promising Chinese tech listings, overseas investors are largely left out from partaking in such blockbuster offerings.

Foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs: "It's not even possible. Unless they open up an account with a Chinese broker," said Chris Zhang, executive director at Chinese financial services firm China Fortune Securities Company.

Opening an onshore brokerage account with a Chinese securities firm requires a linked Chinese bank account, which generally requires a proof of residence in China, or a Chinese visa with sufficient validity. Foreigners also need to already hold other mainland-listed shares before being eligible to participate in an IPO lottery.

Most foreign banks do not have the necessary arrangements with Chinese brokers to support account openings, Zhang said, making the process unworkable for the vast majority of overseas retail investors.

Official guidance from Shanghai's city government states that only a narrow set of foreign individuals can directly open brokerage accounts for A-shares — stocks listed in mainland China. For example, foreigners with permanent resident status, workers in China, or foreigners working abroad with equity incentive plans in A-share listed companies.

For many global investors, Stock Connect, a program that allows Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges mutual access to each other's stocks, is the most convenient way to gain exposure to Chinese equities.

It allows overseas investors to buy A-shares through their Hong Kong brokers without needing an onshore account, or special licenses— but the scheme offers little help when it comes to IPOs, or even freshly listed stocks. Access also depends on Hong Kong brokers' eligibility requirements, such as minimum account balances and risk disclosures.

"Stock Connect does not work because newly listed stocks are not included in Stock Connect as yet. Usually it takes a few weeks to months should the stocks qualify," said Theodore Shou, chief investment officer at Skybound Capital.

Inclusion of companies in the Stock Connect scheme depends on whether a stock meets the eligibility rules such as sufficient trading activity and market value, which often requires a period of trading and data history for qualifying.

“While the Nvidia news is concerning, it’s not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides,” Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Secruities, told CNN.

The tit-for-tat escalated into full decoupling. A new China's directive issued in September banned Nvidia, AMD, and Intel chips from any data center receiving government money—a market worth over $100 billion since 2021. Jensen Huang revealed the company's market share in China had hit "zero, compared to 95% in 2022."

﻿

“At the moment, we are 100% out of China,” Huang said. “I can’t imagine any policymaker thinking that’s a good idea—that whatever policy we implemented caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world to zero.” He called U.S. policy "a mistake" that would backfire by accelerating Chinese chip independence.

He was right. Huawei and domestic players like Cambricon now dominate China's AI infrastructure. By year's end, analysts projected Chinese chipmakers would capture 40% of the domestic AI server market—a stunning reversal from near-total American dominance just three years earlier.

But the semiconductor war was only the surface. Beneath it, America deployed its most potent weapon: control over the economics of the global market, setting up an "AI Action Plan" in July and a policy of tariffs and sanctions aimed at cementing its political and financial dominance.

In response, China began to exert control over the physical elements that make modern technology possible. In October, Beijing announced the strictest rare earth export controls in its history. The new restrictions didn't just limit sales—they applied the Foreign Direct Product Rule to rare earths for the first time, meaning even products made outside China using Chinese rare earth technology would require export licenses. Companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries would be automatically denied.

The target was unmistakable: America's defense industrial base. China controls 94% of permanent magnet production and 90% of rare earth refining—the elements essential for F-35 fighter jets, Tomahawk missiles, and the AI chips that power autonomous weapons. The expanded controls covered holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, each critical to defense systems.

The U.S. wasn’t caught flat-footed. In July, the Pentagon had invested $400 million in MP Materials, America's only rare earth miner, becoming its largest shareholder. The deal included a 10-year price floor of $110 per kilogram—nearly double the market rate—to protect domestic production from Chinese price dumping. But even with this investment, MP Materials would produce just 1,000 tons of neodymium-boron-iron magnets by year's end—less than 1% of China's 138,000-ton output.

"It's scandalous that we don't have a rare earths strategic reserve," University of Pennsylvania finance professor Jeremy Siegel told CNBC. The supply chain warfare had exposed a vulnerability more fundamental than chip design: America's military depended on adversary-controlled minerals to function.

The AI battle of the titans is continuing. In late November, Trump signed an executive order launching the Genesis Mission—a Department of Energy-led AI initiative the White House compared in "urgency and ambition" to the Manhattan Project.

The Genesis Mission aims to build an integrated AI platform that would harness decades of federal scientific datasets to train "scientific foundation models" and deploy AI agents for autonomous research and discovery. Its goals range from nuclear fusion to advanced manufacturing to semiconductor development, with the platform designed to give American researchers access to supercomputing resources and proprietary datasets no Chinese lab could match.

But whether the $400 million already invested in rare earth mining or the Genesis Mission's national laboratory network can offset China's manufacturing dominance remains unclear—but Washington is now treating AI supremacy as a matter of wartime urgency.

From trade war to actual war?

It turns out that China's advancements were the product of a Military-Civil Fusion Strategy, as the Marine Corps call it. Under Xi Jinping's oversight, China started to create an integrated ecosystem where nearly every technological advance can also serve military purposes.

PLA strategists envision AI transforming not just weapons but warfare itself. Large language models would conduct cognitive operations, manipulating adversary perceptions and decision-making. Swarms of obsolete fighters converted to autonomous drones would overwhelm defenses through sheer scale. The goal: transition to "intelligentized warfare" where speed of decision-making—measured in milliseconds—determines victory.

In the west, Silicon Valley's relationship with the Pentagon also underwent its own revolution. Tech giants that once banned military work now competed for defense contracts worth hundreds of billions. The whole trend started back in December 2024, when Palantir and Anduril announced a consortium to build AI infrastructure for the military.

OpenAI, which had prohibited weapons applications, reversed course and signed defense partnerships with the Pentagon. Google, which abandoned Project Maven in 2018 after employee protests, quietly returned with a $200 million Pentagon contract in July. Anthropic also started to adopt a more anti-China political stance, urging governments to intervene to hinder China's advances and securing a western dominance of the industry.

The battle for the consumer

While hardware wars raged and militaries mobilized, American companies staged a comeback in AI's most visible consumer domain: video generation. OpenAI's Sora 2, released in September, set new standards with synchronized audio, 4K resolution, and multi-shot storytelling. Google's Veo 3 and its 3.1 update followed, leveraging unrestricted access to H100 and H200 chips that Chinese competitors couldn't obtain.

Just a few months earlier, China's Kuaishou and other firms had led text-to-video development. Now American firms dominated, proving that in compute-intensive domains, hardware access remained decisive.

The American resurgence extended beyond video to the foundational models themselves. In November, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5—what the company called "the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use." The model became the first to break 80% on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark measuring real-world software engineering capabilities, outperforming both OpenAI's GPT-5.1 and Google's Gemini 3 Pro. Anthropic claimed the model scored higher on its internal engineering tests than any human job candidate ever had. For an industry that had spent January panicking over DeepSeek's efficiency breakthrough, Claude Opus 4.5 served as a reminder that American labs still held the performance crown—at least for now.

China vs. world: Open-source models fight it out

2025 was also a great year for open-source models. In fact, one could argue that this was the year open-source AI caught up—and, again, it involved its own dose of the good old China vs America drama.

Image: NBC

Alibaba's Qwen family alone accounted for 40% of new language models uploaded monthly to Hugging Face, spawning over 100,000 derivatives and 600 million downloads. The open approach built soft power that export controls couldn't touch—developers worldwide could run Chinese models without restriction, creating a parallel ecosystem independent of American infrastructure.

And how can you prevent a global adoption of free open source models? With regulations.

China's DeepSeek faced bans across dozens of countries. Italy moved first in January, blocking the app over data privacy violations. Taiwan, Australia, South Korea, and multiple U.S. states and agencies followed. By July, NATO allies including the Czech Republic branded DeepSeek a "Trojan horse" for Beijing's intelligence services.

Meta's Llama used to be the most popular LLM in the community; the fourth generation was released this year. OpenAI also released GPT-oss, its only open source model in years. Besides that, the open-source LLM community didn't see much hype in America. Ai2 released a family of models trained in America from scratch, and other companies, including Perplexity, fine-tuned DeepSeek to make it more pro-US and anti-China in its responses.

Not everything is rivalry, though, when developers leave geopolitical fights aside and work towards common goals, they come up with nice products. The models developed by Nous Research—a research team from America, China, Europe and the UAE—is a good example of that.

Besides the China-US Cold-War 2.0, other governments also started to get more involved in AI, setting it as a key element of their public agendas.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE pledged $2 trillion in AI investments during Trump's May visit—money dwarfing American hyperscaler spending. Saudi Arabia's $600 billion commitment included partnerships with Nvidia, AMD, Google Cloud, and AWS to build 2,200 megawatts of data center capacity—more than four times the UAE's 500 megawatts.

Both nations walked a tightrope, wanting American chips and expertise while maintaining deep China ties through Huawei-built telecommunications infrastructure. Washington demanded they choose sides, imposing strict controls to ensure AI hardware didn't reach Beijing or Moscow.

Europe too mounted its own sovereignty bid. The European Commission unveiled a €200 billion InvestAI initiative in April, targeting AI gigafactories and data infrastructure to reduce dependence on American and Chinese technology. But by year's end, the €200 billion remained largely aspirational. Europe allocated just 18% of its €252 billion in venture capital to AI between 2020-2025, compared to America's 34% of $1.33 trillion.

The fracturing carries profound implications. Trade patterns are realigning. Military doctrines are being rewritten around AI-enabled warfare. Developing nations face pressure to choose between eastern and western standards—decisions that will shape their digital governance for decades.

China's bet on open-source democratization versus America's proprietary model represents competing visions of technological power. Beijing seeks influence through freely available tools that create dependencies subtler than export controls. Washington relies on maintaining leads in frontier capabilities and controlling access to the most powerful systems.

Neither strategy guarantees victory. China's open models gain adoption but sacrifice economic returns that fund development. America's closed systems generate revenue but risk irrelevance if developers migrate to unrestricted alternatives. Europe… is being Europe.

What began as a trade dispute over AI chips has metastasized into full-spectrum competition encompassing technology, ideology, resources, and military doctrine. China weaponized its rare earth monopoly. America mobilized its defense industrial base. Both nations fused civilian innovation with military applications in a race toward AI-enabled warfare that has no precedent in history.

The silicon iron curtain that descended in 2025 may prove as consequential as the one that divided Europe for half a century. Only this time, the fault line runs through every smartphone, data center, autonomous system, and permanent magnet that powers modern civilization. The great divide has begun.

[TITLE]Britain’s Top CEOs Predict the Biggest Challenges of 2026:
[TEXT]
The bosses of some of Britain’s biggest companies predict a fresh wave of challenges next year, as they absorb the impact Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves’ tax-raising budget in November.

Chief executive officers in sectors including finance, housing, gambling and hospitality told Bloomberg they’re bracing for artificial intelligence trust issues, more cyberattacks and pressure to build on Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government. Cost cuts will also be on the agenda, according to one.

“The cyberattacks that crippled companies like Marks & Spencer Group Plc and Jaguar Land Rover in 2025 will ‘inspire cyber criminals to go even further in the coming year,'” according to Adrian Cox, CEO of Beazley Plc.

Having contended with a year of higher taxes, a stagnating domestic economy, US tariffs and fears of an AI bubble, here’s what they think 2026 has in store:

Richard Oldfield, Schroders Plc

Next year will be when people stop talking and start doing when it comes to adopting artificial intelligence to boost businesses, the asset management firm’s CEO said. “If we don’t see increasing productivity and increasing profits because of that change, then you’ve really got to question actually whether it’s enabling the transformation that everyone’s talking about.”

Oldfield called for the UK to invest in itself and support the stock exchange so it can attract more foreign capital. While more listings next year — following a disappointing 2025 — would be “phenomenal,” investors need to actively allocate in those initial public offerings.

“We can give up or we can come out fighting and we, great British companies, are going to come out fighting,” he said.

Tim Martin, JD Wetherspoon Plc

“Survival” will be a key theme next year, according to the pub chain’s chairman, as hospitality companies grapple with increased costs including from a rise in employer taxes. “Any hiccup in sales will lead to real problems,” said Martin, who is a regular critic of the government in his stock exchange statements.

Given “there is a lot of disenchantment” around the government’s approach to business, Martin predicted a push in 2026 to persuade Labour to “change tack and to understand the benefits of a pro-enterprise philosophy.”

Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone Group Plc

Next year will see AI make “real impacts to customer experience,” the telecommunications group’s CEO predicted. With chatbots becoming fully-fledged customer agents, human staff will then be left to resolve more complex or delicate issues.

“The most successful UK companies will be those that not only invest in high-quality AI technology, but at the same time focus on their ability to deliver excellent human, personalized care when it matters most,” she said.

Adrian Blair, Trustpilot Group Plc

Sticking with that theme, the rise of AI means “trust will be harder to earn” in 2026, the head of the reviews site predicted.

Still, after two decades working in the internet sector, he’s confident AI isn’t a bubble and will bring “far-reaching and generally positive consequences.”

“The elements of the AI jigsaw puzzle, they’re all going to get better at once: chips, data models, the tooling,” he said. “People underestimate how much impact it’s going to have if you put all of this together.”

Adrian Cox, Beazley Plc

The cyberattacks that crippled companies like Marks & Spencer Group Plc and Jaguar Land Rover in 2025 will “inspire cyber criminals to go even further in the coming year,” according to the boss of the insurer.

Businesses need a “mindset shift from panic to resilience,” making them better prepared to respond to what has morphed from a basic IT challenge to a “board-level imperative,” Cox said.

Stella David, Entain Plc

Less than a year into David’s role as boss of Ladbrokes’ parent company, betting companies were hit with higher taxes in Reeves’ budget.

This poses “real risks which threaten high-street jobs and investment, and create conditions where the black market will thrive at the expense of responsible operators,” she said. Operators have already warned of job cuts and store closures, while William Hill owner Evoke Plc is considering a potential sale.

Still, David is optimistic, in part because of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Gambling companies will likely reap benefits from the football tournament in Mexico, Canada and the US, where operators have grown in recent years.

Eduardo Landin, Hochschild Mining Plc

The CEO of the gold and silver miner expects a continued rally in precious metals prices, which was spurred by supply shortages and growing demand as investors sought safe-haven assets in a geopolitically turbulent year.

For the mining sector, companies will focus on boosting margins to capitalize on this as much as possible. “It’s very good in terms of prices, but it gives us a lot of pressure in terms of reducing costs,” Landin said. “Otherwise, you’re not taking the opportunity the prices are giving you.”

Richard Houston, Deloitte UK

Cost cuts will continue to dominate businesses’ attention in the new year, according to the UK CEO of the professional services company. The emergence of steady economic growth and policy stability should revive confidence in the second half of 2026, he said.

Volatility in global trade will however persist, Houston said. He urged the UK to forge stronger links with Europe to spur growth and create jobs, as the country marks a decade from its vote to exit the EU.

Jennie Daly, Taylor Wimpey Plc

The housebuilder’s boss predicted continued momentum in planning reform, kickstarted this year by Labour. But she’d like to see see better support for first-time buyers.

“The cumulative regulatory burden and the deposit barrier remain key blockers to housing delivery and demand,” Daly said.

New Delhi: As the year 2025 comes to a wrap, the insurance industry leaders bid farewell to the eventful year, calling it an inflection point mirroring broader resilience with the wider economy and are set to welcome the New Year 2026 with a bullish outlook.In 2025, India's insurance sector saw major shifts with the Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha (Amendment of Insurance Laws) Bill, 2025 enabling 100% FDI, fostering competition, alongside tech booms in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) for underwriting & claims, a surge in digital policy issuance, new products like usage-based & embedded insurance, and a significant push for enhanced regulatory governance and financial inclusion, driving massive capital inflow and market growth.Mayank Bathwal, CEO, Aditya Birla Health Insurance, said, "The year 2025 marked a clear inflection point for India's insurance ecosystem, with policy reform and digital progress beginning to translate into real consumer impact. The removal of GST improved affordability and access, while continued advancement on platforms such as the National Health Claims Exchange and Bima Sugam helped reduce friction from purchase, servicing to claims. Together, these developments strengthened confidence in the system and supported broader adoption."As announced by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, effective September 22, individual life and health insurance premiums are exempt from Goods and Services Tax (GST), meaning the rate is 0%."Looking ahead to 2026, the direction is clear. Growth will be driven less by just expanding coverage and more by improving quality, consistency and trust. The next phase will focus on simpler products, faster and more predictable claims, and deeper engagement across the customer lifecycle. Insurers that prioritise transparency and long-term outcomes are poised to shape the future of the sector," he added.Sumit Rai, MD & CEO, Edelweiss Life Insurance, said, "2025 was an eventful year by all measures. India was tested on multiple fronts - a tariff war with the US, a brief yet tense military standoff with its neighbour (Operation Sindoor), and a rupee under persistent pressure. Yet, the economy remained buoyant, with consumption staying robust, growth accelerating, and inflation falling to record lows - a credit to India's concerted policy efforts. It was also the year of the common man, as a cumulative 125-bps rate cut by the RBI, personal tax reforms in Budget FY26, and GST 2.0 reforms significantly improved the disposal income across households.""The life insurance industry mirrored this broader resilience, maintaining a strong growth trajectory amid a changing regulatory, and customer landscape. The GST exemption on life insurance products, which signalled the category as essential, boosted demand. Protection and non-participating products remained in favour as customers increasingly prioritised longer-term financial planning. The industry continued its customer awareness efforts under IRDAI's State Insurance Plan while also expanding distribution capabilities across the country," he said."The longer-term outlook for life insurance remains bullish, and the industry has been making significant strides year after year. Here are some trends likely to unfold in 2026 that continue this journey forward," he added.Krishnan Ramachandran, MD & CEO, Niva Bupa Health Insurance, highlighting the surge in insurance premiums, said, "Standalone health insurers recorded a robust 10.4% year-on-year growth in premiums, reaching Rs 3,622 crore (USD 422.7 million), underscoring rising consumer demand and broader adoption of health insurance coverage. Total premium income is expected to reach Rs 3.21-3.24 lakh crore (USD 37.6-37.9 billion), followed by a further growth of 10.9% in FY27. Despite prevailing macroeconomic headwinds and cost pressures, steady improvements in insurance penetration and density indicate that the sector remains firmly aligned with the long-term vision of achieving Insurance for All by 2047."He also said the digital transformation moved into a more mature phase in 2025 for the insurance sector."Over 90% of retail policies are now estimated to be issued digitally across insurers. A growing share of health claims, 60-70% in urban markets, are processed through digital or cashless modes. AI-led claims triaging and fraud detection helped insurers reduce turnaround times and improve operational efficiency," he added.Ramachandran also highlighted that distribution remained a key focus area as insurers worked to deepen penetration beyond metros. "The industry today engages over 30 lakh licensed insurance intermediaries, with 2025 seeing heightened investments in advisor training, digital enablement and capability-building initiatives," he said.
