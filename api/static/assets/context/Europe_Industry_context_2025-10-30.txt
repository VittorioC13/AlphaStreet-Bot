[TITLE]Chipmaker GlobalFoundries to expand German facility with 1.1 billion euro investment:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) -U.S. chipmaker GlobalFoundries on Tuesday said it will invest 1.1 billion euros ($1.28 billion) to expand manufacturing capabilities at its German facility as it looks to increase production.

The Dresden site investment will expand the production capacity to exceed one million wafers annually by the end of 2028, the chipmaker said in a statement.

"As a part of the project, the facility will be upgraded to offer end-to-end European processes and data flows for critical semiconductor security requirements," GlobalFoundries said.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz hailed the project as an important investment in Europe's future amid geopolitical tensions impacting the semiconductor market.

"We are bearing witness to a tectonic shift in political and economic centres of power in the world," he said, adding that Germany wanted to be a key player in microelectronics in order to secure the country's prosperity and security.

The expansion project, named SPRINT, is expected to be supported by the German federal government and the State of Saxony under the framework of the European Chips Act.

European Union approval for the full program is expected later this year, GlobalFoundries added.

The German government is expected to support the expansion of the production site with several hundred million euros, Handelsblatt had reported in June.

The chipmaker has invested more than 10 billion euros in the Dresden site since 2009.

[TITLE]Mobility startup Tsuyo Manufacturing raises $4.5 million in round led by Avaana Capital:
[TEXT]
Mobility startup Tsuyo Manufacturing has raised $4.5 million in a funding round led by early-stage investment firm Avaana Capital The company will utilise the funds to build a new greenfield manufacturing facility, set up a research and development (R&D) centre, and expand its export operations and partnerships with automakers across Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea, and Europe.“EV is a relatively new domain, and the industry has only recently evolved. In fact, (only) over the last four to five years, people have started taking it seriously. Government incentives, schemes, and policies are also being introduced in a big way,” founder and chief executive Vijay Kumar told ET.Founded in 2020, the New Delhi-based company designs and manufactures core systems that power electric vehicles (EVs) — including motors and controllers used in three- and four-wheelers, trucks, buses, and off-road vehicles, such as mining dump trucks, forklifts, and electric tractors. It supplies these components to automakers, like Mahindra , Volvo, Eicher , and Sonalika.Currently, it has two operational units in Greater Noida.The company has supplied 1.5 lakh powertrain units so far. It has filed four patents, and 25 more are in the pipeline, including for motors that use hybrid magnets and do not rely on rare-earth materials.According to Kumar, the company does not cater to the two-wheeler segment because 99% of scooters and their components are imported by China. “These are traders’ markets, and the technology is largely commodity-based, so there isn’t much scope for differentiation.”The company’s revenue has grown by 10x in five years, he said.“In terms of production capacity as well, compared to when we started, the annual production we achieved last year was almost seven to eight times higher,” he added.Currently, India accounts for 95% of its revenue.Commenting on the investment, Vikas Verma, venture partner at Avaana Capital, said, “Their vertically integrated powertrain, critical for electrification across automotive and industrial applications, exemplifies indigenous, scalable innovation that will define India’s role in building globally resilient supply chains and reducing reliance on rare earth mineral-based technologies.”

Financial Results

Income Statement

Net interest income totaled $13.0 million for the third quarter of 2025, reflecting an increase of $610 thousand, or 4.9%, compared to $12.4 million for the second quarter of 2025, and an increase of $739 thousand, or 6.0%, compared to the third quarter of 2024.

The increase in net interest income when compared to the second quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by higher average balances of interest earning assets partially offset by volume-driven increases in deposit interest expense, as the growth in earning assets was primarily funded by interest bearing demand and certificates of deposit growth. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities continued to trend downward from 4.07% during the second quarter of 2025 to 4.02% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

The increase in net interest income during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily volume driven, as higher interest income from growth in average loan and interest-bearing cash balances more than offset increases in interest expense resulting from higher average balances of interest-bearing deposits.

The yield on investment securities was 4.62% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 4.73% for the second quarter of 2025 and 5.06% for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in the yield when compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter of 2024 was the result of a reduction in yield on certain variable rate securities due to lower long-term interest rates.

The Company’s net interest margin for the third quarter of 2025 was 4.35%, compared to 4.31% for the second quarter of 2025 and 5.00% for the third quarter of 2024. The increase in net interest margin during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the previous quarter was attributable to both (i) slightly higher loan yields, and (ii) a favorable decrease in the cost of funds. The decrease in net interest margin when compared to the third quarter of 2024 is reflective of the 100 basis point decrease in the target federal funds rate during the second half of 2024 by the Federal Reserve.

The Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $1.1 million compared to $1.1 million during the second quarter of 2025, and an increase of $1.6 million when compared to the third quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses on loans recorded in the third quarter of 2025 reflects quarterly organic growth in non-guaranteed loans of $58.7 million, $707 thousand of specific reserves assigned to credit card balances, and the replenishment of reserves to offset $836 thousand of net charge-offs during the period.

Non-interest income was $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $5.4 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2024. The $1.8 million increase in non-interest income during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the second quarter of 2025 was primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in gain on loan sale revenue and an $871 thousand increase in net interchange fees. The $3.3 million increase in non-interest income during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the third quarter of 2024 was driven by favorable increases across all categories of other income, including (i) an increase in credit card net interchange fees of $2.1 million as credit card transaction volume increased from $22 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to $321 million for the same period in 2025, (ii) an increase in gain on sale of loans of $754 thousand , and (iii) a $196 thousand increase in loan servicing income.

Net revenue totaled $20.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of $2.4 million, or 13.5%, compared to $17.8 million for the second quarter of 2025. Net revenue for the third quarter of 2025 increased $4.0 million, or 24.8%, when compared to $16.2 million for the third quarter of 2024.

Non-interest expense was $12.3 million during the third quarter of 2025, compared to $10.4 million for the second quarter of 2025 and $9.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. The quarter-over-quarter increase in non-interest expense was due to the previously mentioned unusual expenses incurred during the quarter of salaries and employee benefits expense and other expenses. The Company’s efficiency ratio was 61.1% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 58.5% for the second quarter of 2025 and 56.0% for the third quarter of 2024.

Income tax expense was $1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared to $1.5 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024. The Company’s effective tax rate was 22.7% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared to 19.1% for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and 23.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The fluctuations in the effective tax rate are largely driven by the timing and volume of certain stock-based compensation transactions resulting in tax benefits to the Company, as well as the timing and volume of state tax adjustments.

Net income was $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $447 thousand from $4.8 million for the second quarter of 2025, and a decrease of $707 thousand from $5.0 million during the third quarter of 2024. Diluted earnings per share were $0.30 for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.33 for the second quarter of 2025 and $0.38 for the third quarter of 2024. Earnings per share and other share-based metrics have been impacted by the shares issued in the previously disclosed private placement of shares of common stock completed in October 2024.

The Company had 187 full-time equivalent employees as of September 30, 2025, compared to 188 full-time equivalent employees as of June 30, 2025, and 159 full-time equivalent employees as of September 30, 2024.

Total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, were $940.6 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $871.6 million as of June 30, 2025, and $781.0 million as of September 30, 2024. Loans, net of deferred fees and costs increased $69.0 million during the third quarter of 2025 primarily due to increases in commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and consumer loans, primarily due to credit cards, and partially offset by decreases in construction, multifamily and residential loans. The increase in loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $159.6 million from September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by increases of $145.8 million in commercial real estate loans.

By deposit type, the increase from the prior quarter was driven by an increase of $82.3 million in certificates of deposit and a $6.5 million increase in interest bearing demand deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $227.9 million as of September 30, 2025, a decrease of $992 thousand from $228.9 million as of June 30, 2025, and a decrease of $2.0 million from $229.9 million as of September 30, 2024.

The increase in stockholders’ equity from June 30, 2025 is attributable to increases in retained earnings resulting from net income earned during the quarter. The increase in stockholders’ equity since September 30, 2024 was the result of the previously disclosed private placement of shares of common stock completed in October 2024 and net income earned over the previous twelve months.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total assets was 12.2% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 12.3% as of June 30, 2025, and 11.1% as of September 30, 2024. The Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 13.7% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 13.8% as of June 30, 2025, and 13.1% as of September 30, 2024. The increase in the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio since September 30, 2024 was impacted by the downstream of $15.0 million in additional capital from the Company to the Bank during the first quarter of 2025. The Company’s book value per share was $11.07 as of September 30, 2025, an increase of 4.1% from $10.63 as of June 30, 2025, and an increase of 24.3% from $8.91 as of September 30, 2024.

Asset Quality

The provision for credit losses for loans totaled $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2025 and $570 thousand for the third quarter of 2024. Net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2025 totaled $836 thousand, or 0.35% of average net loans (annualized), compared to net loan charge-offs of $870 thousand, or 0.38% of average net loans (annualized) in the second quarter of 2025 and $22 thousand of net loan recoveries, or 0.01% of average net loans (annualized) during the third quarter of 2024. Net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2025 were attributable to certain commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and credit card relationships.

Nonaccrual loans increased $16.4 million during the quarter to $34.6 million as of September 30, 2025, and increased $29.2 million from $5.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The guaranteed portion of nonaccrual loans totaled $27.1 million as of June 30, 2025. Loans past due 90 days and accruing interest totaled $184 thousand as of September 30, 2025, compared to $146 thousand as of June 30, 2025, and $27 thousand as of September 30, 2024. The balance of loans past due 90 days and accruing of $184 thousand at September 30, 2025 was comprised entirely of credit card balances which are non-guaranteed.

The Company held $2.7 million of other real estate owned as of September 30, 2025. The Company held no other real estate owned as of June 30, 2025 or September 30, 2024.

Non-performing assets totaled $37.5 million as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $19.1 million from $18.4 million as of June 30, 2025, and an increase of $32.1 million from $5.4 million as of September 30, 2024. Non-performing assets, excluding guaranteed portions, totaled $10.4 million as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $5.8 million from $4.6 million as of June 30, 2025 and an increase of $8.8 million from $1.6 million as of September 30, 2024. The increase in non-performing assets during the third quarter of 2025 was the result of both (i) the transfer of $16.6 million of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans from accrual to nonaccrual status during the quarter, and (ii) $2.7 million of other real estate properties assumed during the quarter.

While the quarter over quarter percentage increase in non-performing assets seems significant when viewed alone, the financial risk is seen to be well contained with a reasonable non-performing asset risk ratio to total assets of 0.80% when removing the guaranteed portion of each non-performing asset. Further, it is important to consider the process we undertake when a collateralized SBA non-performing asset requires collection efforts. We repurchase the sold portion of the guaranteed loan to affect the foreclosure and resale of the property. This process immediately increases the non-performing asset balance on our balance sheet to include the guaranteed portion – thus the importance of always adjusting for the guaranteed portion of the non-performing assets as well as considering our “off balance sheet” assets consisting of the sold portion of SBA guaranteed loans of $970 million that increase our total assets under management to $2.3 billion.

Loans past due between 30 and 89 days and accruing interest totaled $3.6 million as of September 30, 2025, a decrease of $4.6 million from $8.2 million as of June 30, 2025, and a decrease of $8.8 million from $12.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The guaranteed portion of loans past due between 30 and 89 days and accruing interest was $2.4 million as of September 30, 2025.

The ratio of total non-performing assets to total assets was 2.88% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 1.49% as of June 30, 2025, and 0.52% as of September 30, 2024. The ratio of non-performing assets, excluding guaranteed portions, to total assets(1) was 0.80% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 0.37% as of June 30, 2025, and 0.15% as of September 30, 2024.

The Company continues to closely monitor credit quality in light of the ongoing economic uncertainty caused by, among other factors, continued uncertainty regarding U.S. trade and tariff policy and the lingering inflationary pressures, and the risk of the resurgence of elevated levels of inflation, in the United States and our market areas. Accordingly, additional provisions for credit losses may be necessary in future periods.

Other Financial Highlights

SBA Lending and Commercial Banking

SBA lending and commercial banking loan originations totaled $242.1 million during the third quarter of 2025, including a record of $92 million in the month of September, compared to $160.5 million for the second quarter of 2025 and $156.4 million for the third quarter of 2024. Loan sale volume increased to $110.8 million during the third quarter of 2025, compared to $82.1 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $71.4 million for the third quarter of 2024. Gain on sale of loans increased 38.5% to $3.6 million, compared to $2.6 million for the second quarter of 2025, and increased 26.6% from $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. The average pretax gain on sale of loans margin was 3.24% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 3.16% for the second quarter of 2025 and 3.98% for the third quarter of 2024.

Gaming FinTech

Our Gaming Payments Operations in the third quarter of 2025 focused upon redirecting all credit card marketing to our gaming consumers; concluding and subsequently terminating a third party non-gaming direct mail market agreement; onboarding BoltBetz with Distill and Terrible Gaming slots; enhancing our influencer marketing with the engagement of Champ Mike Tyson; and, concluding the development and launch of our digital credit card application platform with the most advanced KYC and fraud protections. This new application platform will enable our influencers to support the growth of GBank's credit card gaming customers.

Our initial efforts to “patch” the existing application platform were not successful and required that we halt applications when we were faced with identification fraud. This pause stopped the fraud applications but also resulted in limiting the growth in the number of gaming cardholders. Despite this, credit card transaction volumes increased almost 60% sequentially to more than $131 million during the third quarter of 2025.

The Prepaid Access/Slot program involving BoltBetz is continuing to make significant progress with Distill Taverns and Terribles Gaming onboarding over 2,500 slot machines. BoltBetz is in the final process of Gaming Laboratories International (“GLI”) testing by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. This is the final process required to launch which is now anticipated in November 2025.

The Pooled Player (“PPA™”) pipeline continues to develop new payments agreements with both the Prepaid Access accounts and virtual ATM providers which are expected to launch in the coming quarters following the receipt of final regulatory approvals.

Including BoltBetz, BankCard Services LLC (“BCS”) and GBank now have sixteen active payment and PPA™ and Pooled Consumer (“PCA™”) Program clients. Currently, BCS and GBank are conducting due diligence for five new clients, with anticipated onboarding in future quarters. Gaming FinTech deposits averaged $37.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $39.5 million for the second quarter of 2025. We anticipate deposit growth from BoltBetz Casino clients to commence in the second quarter of 2026.

See definitions and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures elsewhere in this release.

Contract revenues were $225.1 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared with $226.7 million in the third quarter last year and up 10% sequentially from $205.3 million in the second quarter of 2025, driven by increased volume in our Marine and Concrete segments.

Gross profit was $29.8 million, up 10% from $27.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 and up 16% from $25.8 million in the second quarter of 2025. The increases in gross profit were driven by strong project execution primarily in our Marine business.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $25.1 million for the quarter, up from $20.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to increased investment to support business growth.

GAAP net income for the third quarter was $3.3 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $13.1 million, compared to $15.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and up 19% from $11.0 million in the second quarter of 2025. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to favorable project close outs in 2024 that did not reoccur in 2025. The sequential increase was driven by revenue growth and strong execution.

Marine $ 477 $ 537 Concrete 202 154 Total $ 679 $ 691

Third quarter 2025 backlog included over $160 million in new awards and were evenly balanced between Orion’s Marine and Concrete segments. Recent Marine awards included maintenance dredging for the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, repair work on a marine transportation facility, and installation of a crane trestle for a major transportation project. Recent Concrete awards included multiple data centers, a cold storage facility and several manufacturing and healthcare projects.

Balance Sheet Update

As of September 30, 2025, current assets were $269.7 million, including unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 million. Total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2025 was $23.6 million and the Company had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility.

Recent Developments

In September 2025, the Company announced the appointment of Robert Ledford to its Board of Directors, effective November 19, 2025. Mr. Ledford’s decades of experience leading complex global businesses in the construction industry and driving strategic growth through mergers and acquisitions will provide valuable insight for our Board and executive team as Orion executes its growth strategy.

In October 2025, the Company increased its aggregate bonding capacity by $400 million, which enables the Company to bid on and capture larger projects to accelerate Orion’s long-term growth.

In October 2025, the Company closed on the sale of its East and West Jones property for an aggregate purchase price of $23.5 million. Proceeds are expected to be used to reduce debt and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the sale of the property, the Company entered into an Exclusive Dredge Spoils Agreement with the purchaser. Under the Agreement, the Company has the right to deliver dredge spoils to the property for ten years, which is expected to decrease the Company’s disposal costs.

[TITLE]Some Louisiana residents bristle at rising energy costs and unwelcome construction for massive Meta AI data center:
[TEXT]
Lisa Hopkins bought her house in Louisiana's Richland Parish two years ago, but lately, her family only finds peace and quiet on their front porch at night, after construction stops for the day.

That's because Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, is now building its largest artificial intelligence data center in the country right across the street.

"It's always noise, all the time," Hopkins told CBS News, adding, "We honestly didn't know how big of a scale it was gonna be... Some mornings it's hard to get out of our driveway, just because of all the dump trucks."

Louisiana approved the $10 billion project in August, saying it would bring "hope" for economic growth.

But some experts say the center's power demands will raise customers' power bills statewide. The state's main utility company — Entergy — agreed to pay for a $550 million transmission line to the center, a cost that experts say will be passed on to the 1.1 million customers under Entergy Louisiana's umbrella. This, in a parish where nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, according to the state's utility commission.

That's not the only reason people in Louisiana could see higher utility bills — state officials who approved the plan admit the increased energy demand from the site could, in turn, increase gas prices.

"This single data center is set to span an amount of land that is

[TITLE]Panama Canal Opens Search for Partners in $2.6B Dual-Terminal Project:
[TEXT]
As the Panama Canal’s operator turns its focus to developing new port terminals on both sides of the trade conduit, it has launched a “consultation process” designed to identify possible partners that would control the gateways.

The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) made the announcement Monday after holding an invite-only meeting including members of both major container shipping lines and global port and terminal operators.

In August, the ACP indicated it planned to sell rights to two plots of land reserved for the construction of two new ports near the canal.

These two ports would be individual transshipment terminals—Corozal on the Pacific Ocean and Telfers serving the Atlantic Ocean. Combined, the two terminals are expected to boost the country’s overall container-handling capacity from 9.5 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) to 15 million TEUs annually.

The construction of the terminals is expected to cost $2.6 billion, with both scheduled to begin operations in 2029 upon completion.

As part of the process, the authority will conduct a market and feasibility study for both terminals. Following this stage, a general project plan will be developed which will lead to the initiation of a special process to select a concessionaire for each terminal.

The selection will include a pre-qualification phase, a one-on-one dialogue stage with pre-qualified participants, and finally, the awarding of the concession contracts.

The final phase of the selection is expected to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2026.

Approximately 8,100 direct and indirect jobs are expected to be generated during construction, the ACP says, with that number jumping to 9,000 once operations begin. The project is forecast to provide an economic impact of between 0.4 percent and 0.8 percent of Panama’s gross domestic product (GDP).

Representatives from terminal operators included Maersk-owned APM Terminals, Cosco Shipping Ports, CMA Terminals, DP World, Port Houston, PSA International and Mediterranean Shipping Company’s (MSC) Terminal Investment Limited.

The ocean carriers consisted of CMA CGM, Cosco Shipping, Evergreen, Hapag Lloyd, Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM), Maersk, MSC, Ocean Network Express (ONE), Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), Yang Ming and ZIM.

“We think that if it isn’t done here in Panama, it will happen elsewhere in the region, and we have to decide whether we want to stay competitive,” said Víctor Vial, vice president of finance at the ACP, at the Monday press conference.

For the ACP, and for Panama in general, the desire to foster more competition at the canal comes as geopolitical tensions have put the waterway and the country under the microscope from both American and Chinese interests.

A proposed $23 billion mega-deal which would see Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison sell off the Balboa and Cristóbal ports, as well as more than 40 others worldwide, to a consortium of MSC and BlackRock, has been in limbo since the summer.

That acquisition occurred weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office, and was considered a massive win for his administration as it aims to curb Chinese influence in the region.

Conversely, Beijing and China’s President Xi Jinping were unhappy with the deal, with China’s antitrust regulator opening a probe into that transaction, and later pushing for state-owned Cosco’s inclusion.

The acquisition is under scrutiny from some in Panama’s government as well, with the country’s Supreme Court currently presiding over a lawsuit that alleges Hutchison’s recent 25-year extension to operate the Balboa and Cristóbal ports is illegal. If the high court rules in the favor of the comptroller general who filed the suit, the port sale would be annulled.

If the contract is voided, it would take between 12 and 18 months to get a new concession tender ready, said José Ramón Icaza, Panama’s minister of canal affairs.

“We don’t control the scenarios, but what I can say is that President [José Raúl] Mulino and a few members of his cabinet, including myself, are working on a plan for any of those scenarios and that if we have to take control of Balboa and Cristóbal we don’t create a disruption of the supply chain in the region,” Icaza said.

The constant tug-of-war among the parties has driven concerns among ACP leadership that a concentration of terminal operators at the canal-adjacent ports would pose risks to the waterway’s neutrality.

Panama’s $2.6 billion port project is one tranche of a wider 10-year, $8.5 billion plan to modernize the canal by 2023.

The plan includes the $1.6 billion construction of the Indio Rio reservoir, which will be built to supplement the canal’s main supply of water from Lake Gatún and add capacity for an additional 11 to 13 daily transits.

Additionally, the other major project within the 10-year blueprint is a 76-kilometer (47-mile) liquefied gas pipeline that could transfer up to 2.5 million barrels per day between the Corozal and Telfers terminals without sailing them through the canal.
