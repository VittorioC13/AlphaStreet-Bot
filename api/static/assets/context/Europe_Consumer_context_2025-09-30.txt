Kerry-based financial services and advisory firm continues international expansion

Operating profits at Kerry-based financial services firm Fexco were unchanged last year at €22.4m, even as its income rose 8pc to €193m.

The company recently acquired Sainsbury’s Travel Money unit to strengthen its position in the UK. It will assume control of the business early next year. Travel Money operates through 220 in-store locations and also online.

Founded in 1981 by Brian McCarthy, Fexco provides foreign exchange and payment services. It also provides business and advisory services, property management services, financial services and sustainability technology.

Releasing results on Monday, Fexco said that it has also continues to expand into other markets, including in Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East, Africa and Southern Asia during 2024.

It said it has secured new business wins for its dynamic currency conversion businesses in those regions. They include a partnership with digital payments provider Maya in the Philippines. That will see Fexco’s dynamic currency conversion tool installed across 112,000 merchant terminals.

In Brazil, Fexco inked a deal last year that will see its dynamic currency conversion tools deployed across the country’s ATM network.

Fexco chief executive Neil Hosty said that the company had made “important strategic progress” last year.

“As we look ahead, we’re focused on innovating and expanding into new markets to create long-term value for our customers and stakeholders,” he said.

The group said that it has invested in cloud technologies, enabling greater flexibility and operational efficiency. It added that it has “significantly upgraded” its network infrastructure across key location and invested further in threat protection, cybersecurity compliance and business continuity measures.

Fexco has a presence in about 30 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, North America and Latin America and employs more than 2,500 people.

When it announced its takeover of Sainsbury’s Travel Money during the summer, Fexco said it will expand the Irish firm’s retail footprint in the UK to more than 460 locations. It also makes it a top five players in the UK’s retail foreign exchange market.

Sainsbury’s has been offloading its financial services businesses, having sold its personal loans, credit cards and deposits business in 2023 to NatWest.

In 2023, Fexco bought Irish firm Owens McCarthy, which is a public loss assessor, loss adjuster, insurance surveyor and claims advocate. That year, Fexco also acquired Inspired Property Management in the UK. It manages more than 15,000 units across more than 500 buildings.

[TITLE]Beyond Meat Launches Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation Intended to Eliminate Over $800 Million of Debt with Existing Noteholder Support:
[TEXT]
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND) (the “Company”), a leader in plant-based meat, today announced that it has commenced an exchange offer (the “Exchange Offer”) to exchange any and all of its 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Existing Convertible Notes”) for a pro rata portion of (i) up to $202.5 million in aggregate principal amount of its new 7.00% Convertible Senior Secured Second Lien PIK Toggle Notes due 2030 (the “New Convertible Notes”) and (ii) up to 326,190,370 shares of its common stock.

Beyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown commented, “As we continue our business transformation, we have simultaneously worked to strengthen our balance sheet and are today pleased to announce that we are launching an Exchange Offer for our Existing Convertible Notes. The Exchange Offer is intended to significantly reduce leverage and extend maturity, two outcomes that meaningfully support our long-term vision of being the global plant protein company.”

Simultaneously with the Exchange Offer, the Company is soliciting consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) from holders of the Existing Convertible Notes to adopt certain proposed amendments (the “Proposed Amendments”) to the indenture governing the Existing Convertible Notes (the “Existing Convertible Notes Indenture”). The Proposed Amendments would eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants in the Existing Convertible Notes Indenture as well as certain events of default and related provisions applicable to the Existing Convertible Notes.

On the date hereof, holders of approximately 47% (the “Supporting Noteholders”) of the Existing Convertible Notes have entered into a transaction support agreement with the Company (the “Transaction Support Agreement”) to support the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, including by tendering all of their Existing Convertible Notes in the Exchange Offer. The Transaction Support Agreement is subject to certain customary conditions, including a condition that the Company will not consummate the Exchange Offer unless the holders of 85% of the aggregate principal amount of Existing Convertible Notes tender their Existing Convertible Notes in the Exchange Offer. In addition, the Company agreed in the Transaction Support Agreement to pay or cause to be paid to the parties to the Transaction Support Agreement, on a pro rata basis, a non-refundable amount equal to $12.5 million principal amount of New Convertible Notes on the initial settlement date of the New Convertible Notes.

The New Convertible Notes will be secured, second lien obligations of the Company. The New Convertible Notes will mature on the fifth anniversary of the initial settlement date of the New Convertible Notes, unless earlier redeemed, converted, equitized or repurchased in accordance with the terms of the New Convertible Notes. The New Convertible Notes will bear interest at a rate of 7.00% per annum from the initial settlement date of such New Convertible Notes, which interest may be paid in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of common stock. At the option of the Company, interest on the New Convertible Notes may be accrued and compounded in whole or in part for any interest period as “payment-in-kind” interest at a rate of 9.50% per annum from the initial settlement date of such New Convertible Notes. Initially, the New Convertible Notes will not be guaranteed; however, the Company will agree to cause its future wholly-owned subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions, to guarantee the New Convertible Notes, and will also agree to take commercially reasonable efforts, including seeking advice and consultation procedures with the works council, to cause its subsidiary, Beyond Meat EU B.V., a private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, to guarantee the New Convertible Notes following the closing of the Exchange Offer.

The conversion rate for the New Convertible Notes will initially be the number of shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of New Convertible Notes equal to the lesser of (i) 1,029.2716 and (ii) an amount calculated based on a 10% premium to a reference price determined over an observation period consisting of 20 consecutive trading days following the initial settlement date of the New Convertible Notes, with such rate subject to customary adjustments. The conversion rate will be increased for conversions occurring prior to the date that is three years from the initial settlement date to reflect a “make-whole” premium, payable in the form of shares of common stock, to compensate holders for interest that would have been payable to such date.

Prior to obtaining stockholder approval of certain proposals that will allow the issuance of common stock pursuant to the terms of the New Convertible Notes, the Company will be permitted to satisfy its obligations upon conversion of the New Convertible Notes only in the form of cash settlement. Following such stockholder approval, the Company will be permitted to satisfy its obligations under the New Convertible Notes with any settlement method it is otherwise permitted to elect, including by physical settlement of shares of common stock. A holder of New Convertible Notes will not be permitted to convert its New Convertible Notes at any time prior to the earlier of (a) the date of the first special meeting at which the Company seeks stockholder approval of such proposals, whether or not such approvals are obtained, and (b) the date that is 61 calendar days following the initial settlement date of the New Convertible Notes. The New Convertible Notes will be convertible at any time following such date and prior to the close of business on the second trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.

The Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 28, 2025 (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the “Expiration Deadline”), unless extended or earlier terminated. Rights to withdraw tendered Existing Convertible Notes and revoke consents terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 10, 2025 (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the “Withdrawal Deadline”), unless extended. The Company may, subject to the terms of the Transaction Support Agreement, accept for exchange (the “Early Settlement”) any Existing Convertible Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Exchange Offer at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 10, 2025 (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the “Early Tender Date”) if all conditions to the Exchange Offer have been or are concurrently satisfied or waived prior to the Early Tender Date. Whether or not the Early Settlement occurs, if, at or prior to the Expiration Deadline, unless extended, all conditions to the Exchange Offer have been or are concurrently satisfied or waived, the Company will accept for exchange all Existing Convertible Notes validly tendered in the Exchange Offer at or prior to the Expiration Deadline, and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Withdrawal Deadline (the date of such exchange, the “Final Settlement Date”). The Final Settlement Date will be promptly after the Expiration Deadline and is currently expected to occur on October 30, 2025, the second business day immediately following the Expiration Deadline. The Company’s ability to amend, extend, terminate, or waive the conditions of the Exchange Offer are subject to the terms of the Transaction Support Agreement.

The Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation may each be amended or extended at any time prior to the Expiration Deadline and for any reason, and may be terminated or withdrawn if any of the conditions of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation are not satisfied or waived by the Expiration Deadline (as it may be extended), subject to applicable law and the terms of the Transaction Support Agreement. Tenders of Existing Convertible Notes tendered in the Exchange Offer may be validly withdrawn at any time at or prior to the Withdrawal Deadline, unless extended by the Company, but will thereafter be irrevocable. Subject to applicable law and the terms of the Transaction Support Agreement, the Company may extend the Expiration Deadline at any time, which may or may not have the effect of extending the Withdrawal Deadline. The Company’s obligation to accept for exchange Existing Convertible Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Exchange Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including without limitation, that a minimum of 85% of the aggregate principal amount of Existing Convertible Notes shall have been validly tendered (and, if applicable, not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Exchange Offer.

The New Convertible Notes and shares of common stock offered in the Exchange Offer are being offered only to holders of Existing Convertible Notes that are (i) “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (ii) “accredited investors” (within the meaning of Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act) that beneficially own a minimum of $200,000 in aggregate principal amount of Existing Convertible Notes (“Eligible Holders”).

Eligible Holders who validly tender (and do not validly withdraw) their Existing Convertible Notes and deliver their related consents at or prior to the Early Tender Date will be eligible to receive for each $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Existing Convertible Notes validly tendered for exchange, $176.0870 in aggregate principal amount of New Convertible Notes and 283.6438 shares of common stock.

[TITLE]Industrial Doors Market Industry Report 2025-2030 | Flood-Resistant, Fire-Rated, and IoT-Enabled Doors Set New Benchmarks in Global Industrial Door Innovation:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Industrial Doors Market Research Report 2025-2030" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global industrial door market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.95% from 2024 to 2030.

The global industrial door market is moderately fragmented, with ASSA ABLOY, Hormann Group, Sanwa Holdings, and Clopay at the forefront. These firms dominate the market with a wide product portfolio and a global distribution channel. Furthermore, competition is encouraged by sector-based demands. Examples are temperature-controlled industrial doors in the food industry, high-speed roll-ups in the logistics industry, and explosion-proof doors in the chemical and energy industries. These products embrace FDA, ISO 22000, and ATEX requirements.

Leading manufacturers in the global industrial door market, like Allegion plc and Clopay Corporation, focus on technological innovation, smart automation, and IoT-based access control. They maintain a strong market position by using energy-efficient materials and having a wide global distribution. Local players like Teckentrup in Germany and Nucor in the U.S. are focusing on tailor-made installations, faster deliveries, and low prices. They cater to growing local demand in emerging markets.

Janus International is a leader in rolling steel and self-storage industrial doors. Meanwhile, ASSA ABLOY's automated fire-rated industrial doors with cloud-based monitoring are setting new industry standards for safety and smart integration.

INDUSTRIAL DOOR MARKET TRENDS & ENABLERS

IoT-enabled industrial door systems provide remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, and automated access control. These features improve operational efficiency and reliability for manufacturing and logistics facilities by minimizing disruptions and maintaining a steady workflow.

The increasing demand for high-speed industrial doors in cold-chain logistics, automotive, and pharmaceutical sectors leads to better throughput and contamination control. These doors maintain fast operations and stable environments.

Improvements in door materials, like corrosion-resistant aluminum, reinforced PVC, and antimicrobial coatings, provide greater durability, hygiene compliance, and suitability for demanding food and cleanroom environments.

The growth of industries in Asia-Pacific, particularly with automotive warehousing and e-commerce, supports wider use of automated industrial door systems through local manufacturing and infrastructure upgrades, and supports the industrial door market growth.

Automated and sensor-driven industrial doors in temperature-sensitive environments create smoother workflows and save energy by reducing bottlenecks and limiting unnecessary air exchange.

Stricter safety regulations for fire protection and access control lead to investments in compliant industrial door systems that have advanced sensors, quick-close technology, and integrated security features to improve facility protection.

INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS

High initial investment costs discourage small and medium enterprises from adopting advanced automated or insulated industrial door systems, as many prefer to repair existing installations rather than invest in new technology in cost-sensitive markets.

Unstable prices for steel, aluminum, and composite materials result in higher costs for manufacturers or increased prices for buyers, which in economic downturns often delay replacement and expansion activities and limit market demand.

Fragmented competition and low entry barriers in some regions lead to price-focused products that may not meet durability, safety, or service standards, and the lack of standardized manufacturing deters investment in premium industrial door solutions by large operators.

INDUSTRIAL DOOR MARKET GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS

In 2024, North America and Europe together made up
