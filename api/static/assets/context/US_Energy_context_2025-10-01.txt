[TITLE]BP Invests in New $5 Billion U.S. Gulf Oil Project:
[TEXT]
BP has reached the final investment decision on its estimated $5 billion Tiber-Guadalupe project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as part of its strategy to grow upstream production and boost its U.S. output to more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030.

Tiber-Guadalupe, 100%-owned by the UK-based supermajor, will be BP’s seventh operated oil and gas production hub in the Gulf of America, featuring a new floating production platform with the capacity to produce 80,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

Production from the project is expected to start in 2030 and is one of the 8-10 major projects that BP plans to start up globally between 2028 and 2030.

The estimated $5 billion Tiber-Guadalupe project is fully accommodated within BP prudent financial framework, which the supermajor geared toward the upstream business earlier this year in a major strategy reset to slash investments in renewables and focus on its core business of producing oil and gas.

Under the new strategy, BP will aim for 10 new major upstream projects to start up by the end of 2027, and a further 8–10 projects by the end of 2030. Production is also expected to grow to 2.3–2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in 2030, with capacity to increase to 2035.

In the United States, together with its 100%-owned Kaskida project, BP expects to invest around $10 billion to deliver its Gulf of America Paleogene projects.

Tiber-Guadalupe and Kaskida will help BP to boost its capacity to produce more than 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from the U.S. offshore region by 2030. The major aims to increase its offshore and onshore production in the United States to more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030.

“Along with its sister project Kaskida, Tiber-Guadalupe will play a critical role in bp’s focus on delivering secure and reliable energy the world needs today and tomorrow,” said Andy Krieger, BP’s senior vice president, Gulf of America and Canada.

Just last week, BP said that global oil demand is set to rise through 2030 amid weaker-than-expected efficiency gains. In its 2025 Energy Outlook, BP ditched its forecast from last year that oil demand could peak as soon as this year.

[TITLE]Vistra announces Comanche deal, plan to add 860 MW of natural gas:
[TEXT]
Vistra Corp. has reached a final investment decision to expand gas capacity at its Permian Basin Power Plant, locking in a plan to build two new natural gas power units totaling 860 MW, the company said Monday.

“This expansion more than triples the site's current capacity from 325 MW to 1,185 MW,” Vistra said in a release. The decision to expand was “based on customer demand and to meet West Texas' growing power needs, particularly the state's expanding oil and natural gas industries.”

“As the leading competitive generator in Texas, customers from residential to commercial and industrial are turning to Vistra to help them meet their energy needs,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “We recognize that energy is critical to powering this economic opportunity, and we expect Texas will play an outsized role.”

Vistra also filed an 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, confirming that it “has entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement (with options to extend for up to an additional 20 years) with a large, investment grade company ... pursuant to which the Company has agreed to supply to the Customer 1,200 MW of carbon-free power from the Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant.”

Vistra said it “anticipates power delivery to begin in the fourth quarter of 2027 and ramp to full capacity by 2032.” The company received permission last year from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the operation of Comanche through 2053, an additional 20 years beyond its original licenses.

On Sept. 22, Jefferies downgraded Vistra’s stock to “hold” based on the lack of a deal up to that point and their view that the company’s stock, which rallied based on excitement

[TITLE]Chevron Strikes Deal With Israel To Build Natural Gas Supply Pipeline To Egypt:
[TEXT]
Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) has signed a deal with Israel Natural Gas Lines, Israel’s state-owned pipeline operator, to begin construction of the Nitzana natural gas pipeline that will transport natural gas from the giant Leviathan Gas Field to Egypt. Scheduled to be completed in three years, the $610 million pipeline is expected to ease Egypt’s ongoing energy crisis, which currently spends billions of dollars every year importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet surging domestic energy demand. The Nitzana pipeline will transport ~600 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, bringing Israel's total export capacity to Egypt to more than 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. Israel’s NewMed is the largest shareholder in Leviathan, with a 45.3% working interest; Chevron is the operator with a 39.7% working interest, while Ratio Energies. (TASE: RATI) has 15%. Founded in 1992, Ratio Energy is one of Israel's leading energy partnerships, with a mission to develop and produce natural gas and oil.

Egypt's natural gas production has declined rapidly over the years due to the natural depletion of mature fields, including the Zohr gas field. Coupled with a lack of significant new discoveries since 2015, surging domestic demand for electricity, and past financial issues such as hard currency shortages and payment arrears to foreign companies, Egypt now finds itself in a tenuous position, becoming a net gas importer since 2022, and relying on imported Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as well as pipeline gas from Israel. Last year, Egypt imported a record 981 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from Israel, good for 18.2% year-over-year increase. Egypt imports up to 20% of its gas from Israel. Last month, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced that the $35-billion gas supply agreement signed with Israel’s NewMed Energy was extended until 2040. But the fate of these gas flows now hangs in the balance, with tensions in the Middle East escalating after the Israeli military ordered residents of Gaza City to evacuate.

Last month, Netanyahu declared that he is "deeply committed to the vision of Greater Israel,’’ encompassing parts of Arab countries stretching from the Euphrates to the Nile. According to Israel Hayom, Netanyahu has instructed officials "not to move forward with the massive gas deal with Egypt without his personal approval.”

On its part, Chevron is now moving on three major geopolitical fronts at once: finalizing terms for the Nitzana pipeline to ship Israeli gas into Egypt, bidding for offshore blocks near Crete that Libya claims as its own and preparing a final investment decision (FID) on the Leviathan expansion. Together, the moves put the U.S. major at the center of the East Mediterranean’s most combustible mix of energy ambition and maritime dispute. Chevron has partnered with Greece’s HelleniQ Energy to bid for exploration rights in offshore blocks south of Crete and the Peloponnese. Athens views this development as a major step towards asserting its sovereignty over the contested waters. Waters south of Crete and the Peloponnese are contested due to a 2019 Turkey-Libya maritime agreement that ignores Greece's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims and is a response to potential hydrocarbon reserves in the area. Greece claims these areas based on international law, while Turkey disputes that islands like Crete can generate EEZs and views the situation as a geopolitical power struggle. Libya also claims significant portions of the area, aligning with Turkey's position.

Meanwhile, observers are awaiting Chevron’s final investment decision (FID) on the Leviathan expansion amid security concerns. However, Chevron and its partners, NewMed Energy and Ratio Energies, now expect to take the FID on the Leviathan Phase 1B expansion, which includes drilling, subsea systems, and a potential floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility, in the fourth quarter of 2025. This expansion is projected to significantly increase the field's annual production capacity and is supported by a recent historic gas export deal, a revised development plan approved by Israel in August 2025, and ongoing contract negotiations with potential customers.

Discovered in 2010, the Leviathan is located approximately 130 km off the shores of Haifa. The 330-square kilometer field holds ~22.9 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, making it the largest natural gas reservoir in the Mediterranean, and one of the largest producing assets in the region. Production is facilitated by 4 subsea wells that are connected to an offshore platform via a subsea manifold and two 120 km long pipelines, where all processing of gas takes place. The gas is then piped to shore into the Israeli national grid and distributed to clients in Israel, Egypt, and Jordan.

Rectification note: The original article incorrectly stated that NewMed is the operator of the Leviathan gas field. The current operator is Chevron.

[TITLE]Private equity sees profits in power utilities as electric bills rise and Big Tech seeks more energy:
[TEXT]
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”
