[TITLE]Energy Transfer Shelves Lake Charles LNG to Focus on Pipelines:
[TEXT]
The Dallas, Texas-based company said it 'remains open to discussions with third parties who may have an interest in developing the project'.

Energy Transfer LP has indefinitely paused the under-development Lake Charles LNG project in Louisiana to refocus investment on natural gas pipelines.

The pause allows the Dallas, Texas-based company to "focus on allocating capital to its significant backlog of natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects that Energy Transfer believes provide superior risk/return profiles", it said in a statement on its website.

"Energy Transfer management has determined that its continued development of the project is not warranted by Energy Transfer but remains open to discussions with third parties who may have an interest in developing the project".

Earlier this year the United States Department of Energy (DOE) granted Energy Transfer's request to extend the deadline for Lake Charles LNG to start exports from 2025 to 2031.

Lake Charles LNG is permitted to export a cumulative 851 billion cubic feet a year of natural gas equivalent, under two DOE orders originally issued July 2016 and June 2017.

Energy Transfer says the project, a conversion from an existing regasification site, has all authorizations from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In September 2024, it awarded an engineering, procurement and construction contract to a joint venture between KBR Inc and Technip Energies NV.

Concurrent with the pause announcement, Energy Transfer said it has increased the capacity of the Transwestern Pipeline's planned Desert Southwest expansion project.

"To meet the need for additional capacity identified through a recent open season, the project's mainline pipeline diameter will be upsized from 42 inches to 48 inches, which will increase the project’s capacity to up to 2.3 billion cubic feet per day, depending on final compression configuration", Energy Transfer said in a separate statement.

"There is significant demand growth in the Desert Southwest region, including the potential to retire and or convert coal-fired power plants to natural gas, which could further benefit the project.

"The ultimate capacity of the Desert Southwest expansion project will be based on market demand".

Energy Transfer still expects to put the expansion into service by 2029.

"The upsized project is now expected to cost up to approximately $5.6 billion excluding Allowance for Funds Used During Construction", Energy Transfer said. "As a result, Energy Transfer's total growth capital expenditures for 2026 are expected to increase by approximately $200 million".

[TITLE]Alphabet secures $4.75 billion Intersect deal to make sure its data centers have enough energy:
[TEXT]
Google will buy Intersect Power for $4.75 billion after investing $800 million in 2024

Intersect will continue to operate separately, with its existing "world-class" team

Some California and Texas assets aren't included, will form a new company

Alphabet has announced the acquisition of Intersect Power for $4.75 billion in cash to help support the company's data center strategy by adding more power generation to the company's portfolio.

Alphabet already has a minority stake in the company following around $800 million in funding earlier in 2024, but its full takeover is expected to complete in the first half of 2026.

In an announcement, Google's parent company described Intersect's team as "world-class," adding that the workers would be retained under its new ownership.

Google acquires Intersect Power

Not only do employee contracts look to be retained, but Intersect is set to operate as a wholly separate company from Google. The deal just means that Intersect will get the tech giant's financial backing, and that Google Cloud's data center strategy will get better support.

In the handover, Google will also gain access to "multiple gigawatts of energy and data center projects in development, or under construction."

"Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership," Google CEO Sundair Pichai wrote.

Besides entering into a strategic partnership with Google (before being fully acquired), Intersect also has a noteworthy partnership with Tesla, being one of the company's biggest buyers of its Megapacks, securing 17.7GWh of storage.

[TITLE]What Would A Peace Deal In Ukraine Mean For The Global Oil Market?:
[TEXT]
The prospect of a peace deal in Ukraine has been gaining momentum in the global oil market over the past few days, stripping away part of the geopolitical risk premium that has kept prices elevated since Russia’s invasion on 24 February 2022. Following meetings last week in Berlin with Ukrainian and European officials, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner stated that consensus was reached on around 90% of the issues within a 20-point peace plan. Ukraine has indicated that it may drop its NATO membership bid in exchange for legally binding U.S. and European security assurances, similar to NATO’s Article 5. This states that an attack on one member is an attack on all, obligating other members to assist, potentially with armed force, to restore security. The U.S. has now said that it is offering ‘Article 5-like’ assurances, with President Donald Trump now reportedly willing to submit to the Senate for approval. Meanwhile, Russia has indicated it could accept Ukraine joining the European Union (E.U.) of 27 countries as part of a settlement, a major shift from its earlier stance. However, it continues to demand that Ukraine withdraw from parts of Donetsk still under Kyiv’s control, while Ukraine rejects ceding territory. Talks continue, with Trump saying in the last few days that “we’re closer now [to a peace deal] than we have been,” so what would it mean if such an agreement was reached tomorrow?

Even if a full peace agreement were reached tomorrow – freely agreed by both Ukraine and Russia -- it would likely take months for any significant rolling back of U.S. sanctions on Russia to occur, and years before all such prohibitions were removed. “Literally thousands of sanctions have been imposed on Russia since [24 February] 2022, involving codification through multiple executive orders, Treasury designations, and sometimes congressional legislation, so removing them doesn’t just mean a signature,” a senior Washington-based source who works closely with the U.S. Treasury Department exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “Removing each one will require a formal review process, inter?agency coordination, and sometimes Senate approval if treaty?level commitments are involved,” he noted. “Don’t forget that these sanctions often also feed into similar ones on third-country firms and individuals that are connected to Russia, so getting rid of those would require another level of legal process and negotiations with allies in Europe and Asia, which would be very time consuming,” he underlined. “And on top of that any major rollback could be challenged every step of the way by the lawmakers, which would take it out of the control of the executive,” he told OilPrice.com. Ultimately, sanctions are seen as the tangible sign of U.S. resolve, and any rapid removal – absent a clear milestone achieved by Russia – would risk being read by allies and adversaries alike as a reward for aggression. Given this, any substantive longer-term effects on the global oil market would likely be muted.

Even more so, as it is highly likely that such an initiative would involve a graduated process, as with Iran, according to the Washington source. Indeed, once the U.S. had agreed to the ‘Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action’ (JCPOA, or colloquially ‘the nuclear deal’) on 14 July 2015, sanctions relief for Iran was phased in over years, contingent on verified compliance milestones, with Treasury and State monitoring implementation before easing restrictions, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. “It’s pretty clear that the Europeans would want to see this sort of a rollback, and Ukraine too, with [sanctions] relief charted against benchmarks, not a blanket lifting overnight,” said the Washington source. “In this case [Ukraine], we’d be looking for proof that Russia is not continuing with military support for its occupied territories, or a further build-up of Russian military in those regions, and this would require international monitoring,” he observed. Moreover, as seen in the E.U.’s recent ‘Sanctions Snapback’ on Iran, any relief programme for Russia would almost certainly contain a similar mechanism to re?impose measures if Moscow breached peace terms. Judging from the Snapback on Iran, and the likely terms for Russia of any peace deal, such a snapback for Moscow would involve a quick and broad-based reimposition of sanctions on it and third parties relating to military hardware, dual-use (civilian and military) technology, and finance as monitored through the lens of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF enforces 40 standards against money laundering and nine against terrorist financing, with sweeping powers to sanction individuals, firms, or states that fall short. Its grey? and black?list designations trigger escalating restrictions, making it an aggressive enforcement tool.

In any event, Europe – both the E.U. and other countries, including Great Britain – looks even less likely than the U.S. to start rolling back sanctions on Russia any time soon. After years of effectively bankrolling the Russian war machine through vast imports of the country’s oil and gas, the message finally appears to have sunk in: the rest of Europe is in President Vladimir Putin’s sights after Ukraine. He laid the groundwork for what was to come back in his second state?of?the?nation speech after his 2004 re?election, broadcast live on Russian television, when he said: “The demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century. As for the Russian people, it became a genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory.” Following that, his tentative first military incursion into a sovereign European country – Georgia in 2008 – showed him that he could get away with more, in the classic ‘salami slicing’ strategy of territorial advancement that he has used since. This was because of the ineffectual response from Europe to this aggression – itself a result of the fact that the continent, particularly Germany, was unwilling to jeopardise its cheap Russian gas and oil supplies, as also detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. When the same meek response met his 2014 invasion of Ukraine, and subsequent annexation of Crimea, it was game on for the full invasion of Ukraine in 2022. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte laid it out bare for Europe just over a week ago: “We are Russia’s next target. And we are already in harm’s way.” With this view now widespread among Europe’s top leaders, the meaningful rollback of sanctions on Moscow looks unlikely, with the corollary lack of long-term follow-through in the global oil market.

President Trump has further fuelled Europe’s determination to take its own path on Russia, having made it clear early in this presidency that NATO members who did not dramatically increase their defence spending could not rely on U.S. military support in the event of attack from Russia. The last time NATO met, members agreed to increase their defence spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, up from an average of 2% last year. Against this backdrop, it would be too obscene even for Germany to advocate the resumption of oil and gas imports in size from Russia. Indeed, around two weeks ago, the E.U. fully agreed to implement its ‘REPowerEU Roadmap’, which European Commission (E.C.) President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted as enabling the continent to: “Enter the era of Europe’s full energy independence from Russia [as] Today, we are stopping these imports permanently.” She underlined: “By depleting [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.” E.C. Commissioner, Dan Jørgensen, put it even more plainly: “We [the E.U.] will “never go back to our dangerous dependence on Russia, we will never go back to volatile supplies and market manipulation, and we will never go back to energy blackmail and economic exposure.” As such, the agreement contains bans on E.U. imports of pipelined natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and oil from Russia, as analysed fully by OilPrice.com. As one senior source in the EU’s security complex exclusively told OilPrice.com last week: “Regardless of what the Americans do, and regardless of any peace deal in Ukraine, we’re not rolling back anything on Russia.”

[TITLE]Africa Needs $100 Billion in Refining Investment as Oil Demand Soars:
[TEXT]
Africa’s crude oil demand is set to more than double to 4.5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2050, which will need more than $100 billion in investment in refining over the next decades, according to the African Refiners and Distributors Association (ARDA).

Thanks to population growth, urbanization, and industrialization, Africa’s crude oil consumption is expected to jump from 1.8 million bpd in 2024 to as much as 4.5 million bpd by 2050, ARDA Executive Secretary, Anibor Kragha, has said, as carried by African news outlets including Arise News.

The expected surge in demand positions Africa’s refining industry as one of the world’s biggest untapped investment frontiers, according to the association.

Despite the growth in consumption, Africa remains reliant on fuel imports, which expose many of the countries on the continent to price swings, supply disruptions, and reduction of their foreign exchange (forex) reserves, ARDA’s Kragha said.

“Downstream investment has stagnated even as upstream production grows, leaving Africa stuck in the costly paradox of exporting crude and importing refined products at a premium,” ARDA’s Kragha said.

To boost domestic fuel supply, Africa will need more than $100 billion in upgrades of mothballed or dilapidated refineries, expansion of existing refining capacity, and new greenfield projects to supply fuels, the African refiners’ association reckons.

A key hurdle to Africa-made fuels is the lack of harmonized fuel specifications, Kragha noted, adding that out of 54 countries in Africa, as many as 46 maintain various national fuel standards. All these mean there are 12 different gasoline and 11 diesel varieties being sold across Africa.

“Africa’s downstream sector is one of the world’s last large-scale, high-growth energy investment frontiers. The demand curve is defined by demographics. The supply deficit is structural. The capital requirement exceeds $100 billion. And the economic upside is transformative,” Kragha said.

[TITLE]DNO Agrees Oil Offtakes with ExxonMobil, Shell in Fund Raise:
[TEXT]
DNO signed offtake agreements with ExxonMobil and Shell for the entirety of its North Sea oil production and secured up to $410 million in 'related offtake financing facilities'.

DNO ASA said Thursday it had signed offtake agreements with Exxon Mobil Corp and Shell PLC for the entirety of its North Sea oil production and secured up to $410 million in "related offtake financing facilities".

"The agreement with ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, covering around half of DNO's North Sea oil output, has a tenor of two years and a related revolving credit facility of up to $185 million", the Norwegian oil and gas explorer and producer said in an online statement.

"The agreement with Shell Trading and Shipping Co Ltd, covering the other half of the output, has an initial tenor of one year and a related prepayment facility with a European bank of up to $225 million".

DNO executive chair Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani said, "The offtake agreements with ExxonMobil and Shell unlock considerable financing at very attractive rates, creating opportunities for continued growth in nervous markets".

DNO said it has now "put into place financing facilities of up to $910 million tied to its North Sea oil and gas production".

It earlier secured up to $500 million in financing from a United States bank related to an offtake agreement with French power and gas utility ENGIE SA for 100 percent of its Norwegian production.

"These three-way transactions are made possible because buyers are eager to lock in secure supplies of Norwegian oil and gas and U.S. banks, in particular, have significantly stepped up fossil fuel lending", Mossavar-Rahmani said in a statement July 2.

DNO said of the ENGIE-tied financing, "Proceeds from the offtake financing facility will be used to replace Sval Energi’s similar existing facilities as well as for general corporate purposes".

In the second quarter, DNO completed its $450 million acquisition of Sval Energi Group AS from HitecVision.

"The acquired portfolio comprises 16 producing fields in Norway, quadrupling DNO's North Sea production to 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day", DNO said June 12. "The company's North Sea proven and probable reserves swell to 189 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), also a fourfold increase. Contingent resources total 316 MMboe.

"Following the acquisition, Norway and the United Kingdom represent nearly 60 percent of the company’s global production and about 45 percent of its global reserves, with the balance predominantly in the Kurdistan region of Iraq".

DNO added, "Supported by ongoing field development projects with multiple discoveries currently being matured for project sanction, DNO is well placed to grow North Sea production organically in the years ahead. The combined North Sea 2P reserves and 2C resources equal 15 years of production at the current run rate".

[TITLE]Crude oil prices fall on Russia-Ukraine peace hopes, Venezuela supply cues:
[TEXT]
Crude oil futures traded lower on Friday morning following reports that raised hopes of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

At 9.59 am on Friday, February Brent oil futures were at $59.71, down by 0.18 per cent, and February crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $55.89, down by 0.20 per cent. January crude oil futures were trading at ₹5074 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Friday against the previous close of ₹5114, down by 0.78 per cent, and February futures were trading at ₹5098 against the previous close of ₹5134, down by 0.70 per cent.

Quoting US President Donald Trump, a Reuters report said he believes talks toward ending the war in Ukraine are ‘getting close to something’.

Citing a White House official, the report said the US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are set to meet a Russian delegation in Miami this weekend. Referring to the recent Russian gains on the battlefield, Trump said, “I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there.”

A peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will ease concerns over global crude oil supply disruptions. Russia is one of the world’s major crude oil producers.

Meanwhile, reports said that Venezuela has authorised two unsanctioned very large crude carriers to set sail for China.

Trump had recently announced that the US would impose a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country. This had put at risk around 600,000 barrels of oil per day in exports. China is the major buyer of this crude.

January natural gas futures were trading at ₹329.20 on MCX during the first hour of trading on Friday, down 1.99 per cent from the previous close of ₹335.90.

On the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), January guargum contracts traded at ₹9910 in the first hour of trading on Friday, up 0.22 per cent from the previous close of ₹9888.

January jeera futures were trading at ₹21035 on NCDEX in the initial hour of trading on Friday, down 0.47 per cent from the previous close of ₹21135.

JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he has approved a $35 billion natural gas export deal to Egypt, the biggest gas deal in Israeli history. The agreement could also help repair relations between the two countries strained during the two-year war in the Gaza Strip.The gas will be delivered to Egypt over the next 15 years by U.S. energy giant Chevron, a key owner of the gas field off Israel's coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Half of the proceeds are expected to go to Israel's state coffers.In a recorded video statement, Netanyahu said the deal "greatly strengthens Israel's position as a regional energy power, and it contributes to stability in our region."Egypt, which borders both Israel and Gaza, has served as a key mediator between Israel and the Palestinian militant Hamas group leading up to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that was agreed on in October. Cairo has also has been a vocal critic of Israel's offensive, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction in Gaza.Egypt did not immediately confirm Netanyahu's announcement.Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen, a close Netanyahu ally, previously held up the deal with Egypt, claiming the terms were not favorable to Israel. His delays prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to cancel a trip to Israel in October.But Cohen stood alongside Netanyahu during the Wednesday evening announcement and said he supported the final terms of the deal.Israel discovered sizeable natural gas fields off its Mediterranean coast in the early 2000s and began exporting gas - first to Jordan and later to Egypt - nearly a decade ago.In a separate development, German lawmakers approved an expansion of a defense agreement for Israel's sophisticated Arrow 3 missile defense system, Israel's defense ministry said Wednesday.The expansion brings the value of the deal from $3.5 billion to $6.5 billion, making it the largest Israeli defense export deal ever, according to the ministry. Germany moved to buy Arrow 3 from Israel as it seeks to strengthen its air defenses against Russia.

New Delhi: ACME Solar Holdings on Thursday said it has secured Rs 4,725 crore financing from leading Indian financial institutions to fund renewable energy projects and optimise its capital structure by reducing financing costs.The capital raise includes financing and refinancing arrangements with tenors ranging from 18 to 20 years for the projects, a company statement said.According to the statement, the ACME Solar Holdings Ltd (ACME Solar), through its subsidiaries, has secured debt tie-up of Rs 4,725 crore from leading Indian financial institutions to fund the renewable energy projects and optimise its capital structure by reducing financing costs.Under the New Greenfield Financings, the company has got Rs 2,716 crore from Power Finance Corporation Ltd (PFC Ltd) for the 300 MW ACME Sigma FDRE project, a renewable energy initiative equipped with four hours of battery storage.It has also got its first greenfield project financing for Acme from National Bank for Financing Infrastructure Development (NaBFID) of Rs 800 crore for the 150 MW ACME Platinum Solar + ESS project (with two hours of battery storage with 50% availability).Both these projects have connectivity in place and are in advanced stages of construction.Under refinancing, it has secured Rs 1,209 crore from Yes Bank for the operational 300 MW ACME Sikar Solar project, enabling a reduction in the cost of debt by 170 basis points (bps) initially and by 195 bps eventually.This is the first long-term refinancing from Yes Bank for ACME Solar.With this round of financing, the company has secured Rs 10,590 crore of greenfield financing in the current financial year, taking total debt tie-ups to more than 90 per cent of PPA (power purchase agreement) signed under construction projects.Further, it has refinanced Rs 3,380 crore of debt, achieving a 135 bps reduction in interest cost on the refinanced portion, along with an additional rate reduction of around 60 bps on Rs 4,035 crore of debt for other projects.This includes two operational projects that have moved to a fixed-rate regime with the existing lender.This initiative is consistent with the company's long-term funding strategy to maintain a well-diversified and strategic mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.ACME Solar has also expanded its non-fund based limits with various banks this year, including ICICI Bank , Standard Chartered Bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank, EXIM Bank etc.These limits assist in reducing the cost of debt through trade finance during the construction stage of the project.ACME Solar Holdings Ltd is a leading integrated renewable energy player with a diversified portfolio spanning solar, wind, storage, FDRE and hybrid solutions.

Shares of KPI Green Energy rallied as much as 4.5% to their day’s high of Rs 437.40 on December 18 after KP Group announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of the Republic of Botswana to collaborate on the development of large-scale renewable energy generation, energy storage and transmission infrastructure.The MoU marks an important milestone in KP Group’s international expansion and Botswana’s ambition to become a net-zero country by 2030. The MoU establishes a framework for cooperation on the planning, development, and implementation of renewable energy and associated transmission projects, aimed at strengthening Botswana’s energy security and positioning it as a clean power exporter within the region.“Under the MoU, KP Group and the Government of Botswana will work together to develop a host of renewable energy and infrastructure projects that would require capital investment of around $4 billion or Rs 36,000 crore”, the company said in a regulatory filing. These projects are expected to help increase Botswana’s renewable energy capacity to nearly 5 GW.As part of the understanding, KP Group will lead technical and commercial development activities, including feasibility studies, project design, financing, construction, commissioning, and long-term operation and maintenance of the renewable energy and storage assets.“For KP Group, the collaboration represents a strategic expansion of its renewable energy footprint beyond India, aligned with its focus on utility-scale clean energy projects in emerging markets,” the management said. “Together, we aim not only to support Botswana’s journey towards net-zero by 2030, but also to create long-term economic value through significant investments and enabling regional exports of clean energy,” it added.KPI Green Energy shares have been on a weak run, slipping 24% in 2025. However, over the past 5 years, the stock has given tremendous returns of over 600%.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

[TITLE]Trump’s Embrace of Natural Gas Exports Is Driving Up Energy Bills for Consumers:
[TEXT]
US households paid $124 more on natural gas in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

Despite repeated promises from President Donald Trump on the campaign trail to lower the cost of energy, consumers in the United States collectively paid $12 billion more for natural gas to power their homes over the first nine months of 2025 —

[TITLE]No, AI Data Centers Are Not Driving Up Electricity Costs:
[TEXT]
A simple story has taken hold in American politics: Big Tech is consuming vast amounts of electricity to power artificial intelligence, and ordinary households are paying the price.

It's a tidy narrative with a villain, a victim, and a moral. It also happens to be wrong.

The Conclusion Came First

In Washington, in statehouses, and increasingly in town halls, data-center projects are being stalled or blocked by communities convinced they're

[TITLE]Sweden's Vattenfall Seeks State Funding for New Nuclear Reactors:
[TEXT]
Sweden’s power giant Vattenfall announced on Tuesday it is applying for state aid for an investment in small modular reactors (SMRs) as part of a plan by industrial giants to bet on new nuclear power in the country.

Last month Sweden’s biggest industrial firms signed an agreement with Vattenfall to become shareholders in the power giant’s new company, Videberg Kraft AB, which plans to build SMRs in the country.

One of Europe’s top electric utilities, Vattenfall, created Videberg Kraft AB in April this year as a separate entity to be able to apply for government support.

Now the company and the industry organization, Industrikraft, plan joint investment and collaboration enabling the development of new nuclear power in Sweden.

Industrikraft, whose members include Volvo Group, Saab, Alfa Laval, and Hitachi Energy, will become a shareholder in Videberg Kraft with a 20-percent stake.

The government has previously announced that the state also intends to become a shareholder in the new company.

The Swedish government moved to phase out nuclear power completely in 1980, but that decision was reversed by Parliament in 2010. Five years later, four aging reactors were shut down. Six of 12 reactors remain in operation in Sweden today.

The country is now betting on SMRs to expand its nuclear fleet as Stockholm seeks to further reduce emissions with low-carbon 24/7 energy.

Sweden has tweaked its renewable energy policy, which had called for 100% renewable electricity by 2040, changing the terminology to “100% fossil-free” electricity, paving the way for the construction of more nuclear power plants.

Now Videberg Kraft’s CEO Desirée Comstedt has submitted an application for financing and risk-sharing to the Swedish Government.

When an agreement between the state and Videberg Kraft has been reached, the government may initiate a formal state aid process with the European Commission, Vattenfall said.

Videberg Kraft is planning a project with either five BWRX-300 reactors from GE Vernova Hitachi or three reactors from Rolls-Royce SMR, which will provide a total nuclear power output of about 1,500 MW. There is currently an intensive evaluation process of the two remaining suppliers, and a decision on the final supplier is planned for 2026.

[TITLE]Michigan Regulators Approve State’s First Hyperscale Data Center:
[TEXT]
Despite criticism that they were acting too fast, state utility regulators last week approved DTE Energy’s proposal to supply power for Michigan’s first hyperscale data center — while tacking on a host of conditions that aim to protect ratepayers from subsidizing the facility.

The approval, made over shouts of disapproval from onlookers gathered in a Lansing conference room, drew cheers from business interests and ire from skeptics who had called for a deeper public review of the 19-year deal.

Defending the decision, Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps told the gathered crowd that after reviewing them in detail, “I would put the contracts that are in front of us today on par or better with any that have been approved in the country.”

He and other commissioners said they had concluded the deal would save ratepayers money and would not sacrifice energy reliability.

But a wave of public speakers lined up to condemn the vote, raising concerns
