CPS Energy signed an agreement to acquire four natural gas power plants operated by ProEnergy in the ERCOT area for $1.387 billion.

CPS Energy has signed an agreement to acquire four natural gas power plants operated by ProEnergy in the ERCOT area for $1.387 billion.

The facilities have an aggregate capacity of 1.632 gigawatts, according to a joint statement.

"The acquired assets are dual-fuel capable, providing CPS Energy future optionality to transition to a hydrogen fuel blend that would enable reduced carbon emissions".

San Antonio, Texas-based CPS Energy has a prior agreement with Modern Hydrogen, announced July 22, to use the latter's technology to convert natural gas into hydrogen.

Garza said of the agreement with ProEnergy, “By acquiring recently constructed, currently operating modern power plants that utilize proven technology already in use by CPS Energy, we avoid higher construction costs, inflationary risk, and long timelines associated with building new facilities - while also enhancing the reliability and affordability of the CPS Energy generation portfolio".
