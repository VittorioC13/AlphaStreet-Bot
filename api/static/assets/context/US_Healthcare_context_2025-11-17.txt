[TITLE]Salarius Pharmaceuticals and Decoy Therapeutics Complete Merger:
[TEXT]
Strategic transaction supports the advancement of Decoy’s rapid computational design and manufacturing of innovative peptide conjugate therapeutics through its IMP3ACT™ platform

Combined company has pro forma cash of $14 million following merger and closing of recent public offering

HOUSTON and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Salarius Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: SLRX) (“Salarius” or the “Company”) and Decoy Therapeutics (“Decoy”) announce the completion of their strategic merger with the combined company now focused on advancing Decoy’s pipeline of peptide conjugate therapeutics engineered through its IMP3ACT platform that reduces the complexity of drug development and manufacturing.

“I’d like to thank both the Salarius and Decoy teams for their hard work and dedication in completing this transaction, which supports the advancement of next-generation therapeutics through our proprietary IMP3ACT Platform,” said Frederick “Rick” Pierce, Chief Executive Officer of Salarius and former Chief Executive Officer of Decoy. “By combining artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and high-speed synthesis techniques, we rapidly design, engineer and manufacture peptide conjugate drug candidates that target serious unmet medical needs. Our technology and innovations in manufacturing allow for advancing new therapies from lab to clinic to commercialization with unprecedented speed. We anticipate multiple value-creating inflection points in the coming year, initially targeting unmet needs in respiratory infectious diseases and gastroenterology (GI) oncology indications.”

Prior to this merger, Decoy attracted financing from institutional investors as well as significant non-dilutive capital from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Seed Fund, the Google AI startup program and the NVIDIA Inception program, among other sources. Decoy also received QuickFire Challenge award funding provided by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) through BLUE KNIGHT™, a legacy collaboration between Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JLABS and BARDA within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.

During the next 12 months, Decoy expects to advance its lead asset, a pan-coronavirus antiviral, to the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to make progress on other programs including a novel broad-acting antiviral to treat flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and a peptide drug conjugate targeting GI cancers.

Then new company will be renamed Decoy Therapeutics. In addition to Decoy’s Co-founder Mr. Pierce serving as Chief Executive Officer, the new company is led by Decoy’s Co-founder Chief Scientific Officer Barbara Hibner, by Decoy’s Chief Business Officer Peter Marschel, by Decoy’s Chief Technology Officer Mike Lipp and by Decoy’s acting Chief Medical Officer and Scientific Advisory Board Chair Shahin Gharakhanian, M.D. Salarius’ current Chief Financial Officer and former acting Chief Executive Officer Mark Rosenblum will continue to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the combined company.

HAYWARD, Calif., Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Benitec Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ: BNTC) (“Benitec” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage, gene therapy-focused, biotechnology company developing novel genetic medicines based on its proprietary “Silence and Replace” DNA-directed RNA interference (“ddRNAi”) platform, today announced financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2025. The Company has filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

“We are fortunate to have achieved several important milestones this year. We previously announced positive interim clinical study results from the Phase 1b/2a trial of BB-301, with a 100% responder rate to BB-301 in Cohort 1. BB-301 was also granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA, and we completed a significant capital raise to fund the advancement of BB-301, which has the potential to become the first approved therapy for the treatment of the central clinical symptom plaguing OPMD patients,” said Jerel A.

We look forward to continued collaboration with the FDA in 2026 to advance the development of BB-301.”

Operational Updates

The key milestones related to the development of BB-301 for the treatment of Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD)-related dysphagia, are outlined below:

On November 3rd, the Company announced positive interim clinical study results from its Phase 1b/2a trial of BB-301. Following administration of BB-301, Cohort 1 patients experienced significant and sustained improvements across multiple clinical measures of swallowing function.

On November 3rd, Benitec announced the addition of Sharon Mates, Ph.D., to its Board of Directors. Dr. Mates served as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and was Co-founder of Intra-Cellular Therapies, a mental health company, from June 2002 until it was acquired for $14.6 billion by Johnson & Johnson in 2025.

[TITLE]Merck to acquire Cidara in $9.2 billion transaction:
[TEXT]
Merck to acquire Cidara in $9.2 billion transaction

The pharmaceutical giant is strengthening its respiratory drug portfolio ahead of losing patent protection for Keytruda, its blockbuster cancer treatment.

The pharmaceutical giant is strengthening its respiratory drug portfolio ahead of losing patent protection for Keytruda, its blockbuster cancer treatment.

Merck has agreed to purchase biotechnology company Cidara Therapeutics for $9.2 billion, marking the latest in a series of strategic acquisitions designed to fortify the pharmaceutical giant’s pipeline before it loses exclusive rights to its most profitable drug. The deal represents a significant premium for Cidara shareholders and underscores the urgency with which major drugmakers are seeking new revenue sources.

The New Jersey based pharmaceutical company announced Friday it would pay $221.50 per share for the San Diego biotech firm, a price that more than doubles Cidara’s closing stock price of $105.99 from the previous day. The substantial premium reflects both the value Merck places on Cidara’s assets and the competitive landscape for promising drug candidates in the respiratory disease space.

A strategic bet on flu prevention

At the heart of the acquisition lies CD388, Cidara’s leading drug candidate that has captured Merck’s attention and investment. The antiviral agent is currently advancing through Phase 3 clinical studies, where researchers are evaluating its effectiveness in preventing influenza infections among individuals facing elevated risk of serious flu complications. Success in these trials could position the drug as a significant commercial product in a market where prevention options remain limited.

The transaction is expected to finalize during the first quarter of 2026, giving both companies time to navigate regulatory approvals and integration planning. For Cidara shareholders, the deal offers immediate and substantial returns, with shares surging to $215.50 in premarket trading following the announcement, more than doubling their value overnight.

Building a respiratory powerhouse

This acquisition follows closely on the heels of another major purchase in the respiratory disease arena. Just last month, Merck completed a roughly $10 billion acquisition of Verona Pharma, gaining access to Ohtuvayre, a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The back to back deals signal a clear strategic direction as Merck positions itself as a leader in respiratory therapeutics.

Chief Executive Rob Davis has characterized CD388 as a potentially important growth driver for the coming decade, expressing confidence that the acquisition will deliver meaningful value to shareholders. His optimism reflects broader industry trends showing increased investment in respiratory diseases, particularly following heightened awareness of airborne illness prevention in recent years.

The Keytruda challenge

The aggressive acquisition strategy stems from a looming financial challenge that keeps pharmaceutical executives awake at night. Merck faces a 2028 patent cliff for Keytruda, its enormously successful cancer immunotherapy that generated nearly $29.5 billion in sales last year alone. When patent protection expires, generic competitors will enter the market, inevitably eroding Merck’s revenue from what has been its most lucrative product.

Davis has been transparent
