[TITLE]Tether Eyes $500B Valuation Amid Explosive Stablecoin Market Growth:
[TEXT]
The global stablecoin market is surging in 2025, with institutional giants like SoftBank and ARK Investment pursuing investments in infrastructure players like Tether.

While Tether and other stablecoins continue to expand, analysts warn that rapid adoption carries financial risks, particularly to central banks’ ability to control interest rates and maintain exchange rate stability.

Tether’s Expansion and Investor Interest

Sponsored

Tether is reportedly exploring a $20 billion funding round, which could value the company at around $500 billion, potentially placing it among the world’s most valuable private firms. Tether aims to use the capital to diversify beyond its core stablecoin business, which currently supports a USDT supply exceeding $170 billion.

SoftBank has been steadily expanding its cryptocurrency investments, while ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, has pursued multiple high-profile crypto funding deals in recent years.

If completed, the round would mark Tether’s most extensive search for external capital yet. Cantor Fitzgerald, a shareholder in Tether, is advising on the potential transaction. Market observers say the move reflects the stablecoin issuer’s dominant position and growing institutional confidence in digital asset infrastructure.

SoftBank and Ark Investment Management are in talks to join a major funding round for Tether Holdings. The deal could value the company at up to $500bn, w/Tether aiming to raise $15–20bn by selling ~3% of the firm. Backing from SoftBank and Ark would give Tether fresh momentum &… pic.twitter.com/LF7bc8v8Sl — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) September 26, 2025

Supported by large US Treasury holdings and a growing Bitcoin reserve, Tether has emerged as one of the most profitable firms in crypto. In Q2 2025, it posted $4.9 billion in net income, up 277% from a year earlier.

Institutional Cash Pours In as Market Explodes

The stablecoin sector is undergoing an explosive growth phase in 2025, driven by unprecedented institutional adoption and emerging regulatory clarity worldwide. According to analysis cited in Coinbase’s August report, the total market capitalization of stablecoins has surged, reaching over $275 billion. Some analysts project the market could reach $1 trillion by 2028.

This growth is fueled by the stablecoins’ utility in cross-border payments, which are used for over 43% of B2B transactions in Southeast Asia. This year marks an inflection point where institutions are actively integrating stablecoins; a Fireblocks survey indicated that 90% of surveyed institutions are now taking action on stablecoin integration, embracing them for treasury management and international settlement.

Beyond Tether’s ambition, other major players are reshaping the landscape: nine major European banks (including ING, UniCredit, and Danske Bank) have joined forces to launch a MiCA-compliant euro-denominated stablecoin, and companies like Finastra have partnered with Circle to integrate stablecoins into bank payment flows.

The movement is gaining momentum in Asia as well. South Korea’s major financial institutions are deeply engaged in preparing for the stablecoin era, aggressively pursuing a “Two-Track Strategy” involving both internal development and strategic partnerships to launch their own Korean Won-backed stablecoins.

For example, a group of at least eight major banks, including KB Kookmin Bank and Shinhan Bank, is reportedly forming a consortium to create a joint venture and infrastructure specifically for the co-issuance of a Won-backed stablecoin. Furthermore, leading banks are meeting directly with foreign stablecoin issuers, such as the US company Circle (USDC issuer), to discuss cooperation, while simultaneously establishing internal task forces to conduct Proof-of-Concept (PoC) testing for real-world settlement using their own digital currency systems.

Rising Stablecoin Use Poses Financial Risks

A new report from Moody’s Ratings, published on September 25, warns that digital currency ownership has surged globally, reaching 562 million people by 2024, up 33% from the previous year. Emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America are leading adoption, often using cryptocurrencies for inflation hedging, remittances, and financial inclusion.

The rapid expansion of stablecoins introduces systemic vulnerabilities. Widespread use could reduce central banks’ control over interest rates and currency stability, a trend termed “cryptoization.” Banks may experience deposit erosion as savings shift into stablecoins or crypto wallets, and underregulated reserves could trigger liquidity runs requiring government intervention.

Cryptocurrency adoption carries different risks in different markets / Source: Moody’s Ratings

However, uneven regulatory frameworks leave countries exposed. Advanced economies are beginning to regulate stablecoins more rigorously, with Europe implementing MiCA and the US passing the GENIUS Act, while Singapore applies a tiered framework. In contrast, many emerging markets lack comprehensive rules, and fewer than one-third of countries have full-spectrum regulation in place.

[TITLE]Short stories, big players: Micro-drama startups brace as gaming giants move in:
[TEXT]
India’s micro-drama startups, racing to capture fleeting attention spans, now face their toughest competition yet as gaming giants enter the rapidly growing market.

These companies are zeroing in on how people spend their breaks: quick bursts of entertainment. Their bet is on snackable micro-dramas—two-to-three-minute episodes packed with twists and emotional payoffs—vying to steal the same eyeballs that might otherwise drift into Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts.

The market is already crowded with ambitious players, including VC-backed startups like Stellaris-funded Flick TV, Peak XV-backed Dashverse, and Zee Entertainment’s Bullet. Established media players and social platforms are also pushing in, from Balaji Telefilms's Kutingg (after its streaming service ALTT was banned in July) to ShareChat’s Moj and QuickTV.

Now, gaming companies like WinZO and Zupee have waded in, pivoting from their real-money gaming businesses after new regulation curtailed operations in August.

The timing could hardly be more critical: India’s short-form video and micro-drama market is clocking a $50 million monthly run rate, according to Redseer—that’s roughly $600 million annually. With more than 300 million users already hooked and a flood of new platforms chasing the format, analysts expect the space to expand into an $8-12 billion opportunity by 2030.

The gaming shift and the revenue battle

Gaming companies bring what entertainment upstarts still lack: captive users and gamified monetization models, translating into commercially primed eyeballs.

Yet, they still have to crack the content puzzle. For the first wave of micro-drama players, gaming’s entry raises uncomfortable questions

[TITLE]Why Experts Predict a Shift Toward Tokenized Assets by 2027:
[TEXT]
The idea of tokenizing assets has been around for a while, but 2027 is shaping up to be the year when it moves from theory into mainstream trading. Experts point to rising institutional involvement, clearer regulations, and fast-improving tech as reasons why tokenized markets are set to explode.

For traders, this means a new layer of opportunity. Instead of only dealing with stocks, ETFs, or crypto, you’ll start seeing real-world assets like real estate, bonds, and money market funds traded on blockchain rails. The shift won’t happen overnight, but by 2027, tokenization could be a normal part of how portfolios are built and managed.

Market Predictions: Tokenized Asset Growth Forecasts for 2027

EY’s survey shows that big investors plan to allocate between 7 and 9 % of their portfolios to tokenized assets by 2027. As interest grows, more investors are asking how to tokenize an asset, from real estate and bonds to money market funds, because understanding the process is quickly becoming as important as choosing the right allocation.

BCG projects tokenized assets could hit $17 trillion in value by 2030, while McKinsey takes a more cautious view at $2 trillion. That spread shows just how much uncertainty is still in play. For traders, it highlights the need to stay flexible, markets may overshoot or underdeliver, and positioning ahead of the curve will matter more than ever.

As of 2025, tokenized assets sit at around $50 billion in market size. That might look small compared to forecasts, but it’s the foundation for exponential growth. In just a few years, we’ve already seen treasury tokens, tokenized funds, and early real estate deals gain traction. If that momentum compounds, the jump from billions to trillions isn’t unrealistic, it’s the same trajectory crypto itself took in its early years.

High-Yield Asset Classes Leading Tokenization by 2027

Not all assets are being tokenized equally. By 2027, we’re seeing a strong shift in how these are packaged, traded, and opened up to more investors through tokenization.

For traders, this means two things:

1. You get access to asset classes that used to be limited to institutions.

2. You can now trade or allocate into these assets with more flexibility and lower minimums.

Here are the four key areas leading the way:

● Private Credit and Alternatives: Around 86% of institutions plan to include private credit in tokenized portfolios. Tokenization lowers entry barriers with fractional ownership and shorter lockups, making high-yield debt more accessible to traders.

● Real Estate: Analysts call this a $10 trillion unlock. Tokenized real estate breaks properties into digital shares, creating liquidity in a historically illiquid market and offering secondary trading options.

● Money Market Funds: Tokenized MMFs have already passed $1 billion TVL. Products from Franklin Templeton and others settle instantly and are gaining traction as a low-risk capital park between trades.

● Corporate Bonds and Treasuries: Tokenized fixed income is expanding, with US and EU pilots issuing digital treasuries. Faster settlement, transparency, and smaller ticket sizes are opening bond markets to more investors.

Trading and Investment Strategies for Tokenized Assets

Tokenized assets are still new, but traders are already building strategies around them. The main focus is on allocation models, platform selection, and risk management. Institutions are setting the tone, and individual traders can take cues from how capital is flowing.

Different strategies depend on risk appetite. Conservative investors use tokenization to diversify without taking on major exposure, while more aggressive traders are leaning in to capture early yield. Here’s a quick breakdown:

Where you trade matters. Not all tokenized asset platforms offer the same experience. Key things to check:

● Custody & Security: Is the platform insured or regulated? How are assets stored?

● Liquidity & Access: Are there active secondary markets? What’s the bid-ask spread?

● Interoperability: Can assets be moved between wallets or used in DeFi apps?

Look for platforms with multi-chain support, institutional-grade custody, and on-chain auditability.

Technology Infrastructure: What’s Changing by 2027

The rails behind tokenized assets are quickly improving. What used to be a clunky, high-fee environment is now moving toward faster, cheaper, and more flexible systems. By 2027, these upgrades will make a real difference in how traders interact with tokenized markets.

One of the biggest changes is the rise of Layer 2 solutions. These are built on top of existing blockchains like Ethereum to reduce transaction fees and speed up trades. Instead of paying $20 to move a token, Layer 2 systems can bring that down to just a few cents — or even less. That makes active trading and portfolio rebalancing much more realistic.

We’re also seeing big improvements in cross-chain interoperability. Before, if your token lived on one blockchain, you were stuck there. Now, with new bridging protocols, you can move assets between networks without having to cash out or start over. This creates more flexibility for traders and lets liquidity flow where it’s needed.

Another key upgrade is smart contract automation. More platforms are embedding logic directly into tokenized assets. This means things like automatic yield distribution, fee payouts, and even portfolio rebalancing can happen on-chain — no manual input needed. That saves time and reduces execution errors.

Here’s what to keep in mind as a trader:

● Layer 2 scaling = lower gas fees and faster transaction times.

● Bridging protocols = flexibility across networks without needing to off-ramp.

● Smart contracts = automation of tasks like yield claims and asset swaps.

Trading Risks and Market Inefficiencies to Monitor

Tokenized assets are still in the build-out phase, which means timing your entry matters. Traders who understand when to step in can capture growth while avoiding unnecessary risks. The path to 2027 will likely unfold in stages, each with its own opportunities.

From now through 2026, we’re in what many call the infrastructure build-out phase. Platforms are being tested, regulations are being finalized, and institutions are lining up capital. For traders, this stage is about positioning early. Watching pilot projects, treasury token launches, and real estate platforms can reveal which markets will scale first.

By 2027, the shift will be clearer. Liquidity will deepen, institutional flows will grow, and tokenized products will start appearing in mainstream portfolios. Entering too late could mean missing early-mover advantages, but entering too early in thin markets could trap capital. Balance is key.

Here are three timing strategies to consider:

● 2025–2026 (Build-Out Opportunities): Focus on infrastructure plays and pilot programs. Traders who track early adoption can capture growth before markets mature.

● Early-Mover Advantages: Tokenized private credit, real estate, and treasury tokens may offer outsized returns as liquidity builds. Fractional access means smaller positions can still deliver strong exposure.

● Exit Strategy Planning (Post-2027): Like any market, tokenization will eventually normalize. Having an exit plan — whether rotating into more liquid products or locking in early gains — helps manage risk.

Conclusion: Positioning for the Tokenized Asset Shift

By 2027, tokenized assets are expected to move from niche experiments into mainstream portfolios, creating both opportunities and risks for traders. Market forecasts point to trillions in value, with institutions already planning allocations and regulators providing clearer frameworks.

The strongest growth will likely come from high-yield areas like private credit, real estate, and tokenized money market funds, supported by infrastructure upgrades that make trading faster, cheaper, and more transparent.

[TITLE]White House confirms 100pc pharma tariff threat won’t apply to Ireland or EU:

Trump announces 100pc import tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, causing further uncertainty for Ireland Tánaiste makes it clear that the existing deal must hold

US president Donald Trump's latest tariffs targeting pharmaceuticals do not apply to countries that have already negotiated trade deals, a White House official confirmed this evening.

Asked whether pharmaceutical tariffs apply to trading partners such as the European Union and Japan that already have trade deals, the official said the Trump administration would honour the 15pc cap as part of those pacts.

It came after Mr Trump announced a raft of import taxes, including 100pc on branded pharmaceutical drugs, to start on October 1.

In a statement this evening, Tánaiste Simon Harris welcomed the confirmation of the exemption from the new tariffs, which could have severely hit Ireland’s multinational pharma manufacturing sector.

“I welcome confirmation from White House officials this evening that the new tariffs outlined by President Trump in relation to pharma overnight will not apply to the EU, including Ireland, as a result of the EU-US framework agreement,” Mr Harris said.

“This is further proof of the benefit of having a negotiated trade agreement and the benefits of the very intensive work that we in Ireland and at a European Union level undertook over many months with the US administration to ensure this trade deal is in place.

“I intend to continue to intensively engage both with the EU and with the US administration, as I have been in recent days in New York and Washington DC, to seek further progress on the removal of trade barriers between the EU and the US in the time ahead.”

Mr Trump announced a raft of import taxes, including 100pc on branded pharmaceutical drugs, to start on October 1.

Other measures will include 50pc on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30pc on upholstered furniture and 25pc on heavy trucks.

Mr Trump’s devotion to tariffs did not end with the trade frameworks and import taxes that were launched in August

The posts on his social media site showed that Mr Trump’s devotion to tariffs did not end with the trade frameworks and import taxes that were launched in August, a reflection of the president’s confidence that taxes will help to reduce the US government’s budget deficit while increasing domestic manufacturing.

The additional tariffs risk intensifying inflation that is already elevated, as well as slowing economic growth, as employers getting used to Mr Trump’s previous import taxes grapple with new levels of uncertainty.

Britain has struck a trade deal with the US but it does not yet include pharma, leaving it open to the 100pc rate.

Mr Trump said on Truth Social that the pharmaceutical tariffs would not apply to companies that are building manufacturing plants in the United States, which he defined as either “breaking ground” or being “under construction”. It was unclear how the tariffs would apply to companies that already have factories in the US.

In August, Mr Trump imposed a 15pc tariff on most pharmaceutical exports from the European Union.

Ireland is one of the biggest exporters of pharmaceutical products to the US from the EU, accounting for €33bn of the €120bn in pharmaceutical exports to the US last year. This announcement now causes further uncertainty for Ireland’s pharmaceutical industry.

Writing this morning, Tánaiste Simon Harris said: “I want to stress, however, that the EU and US Joint Statement issued on August 21 was absolutely clear.

“Any new tariffs announced by the US on pharmaceuticals would be capped at 15pc for products exported by the EU.”

The Fine Gael leader and trade minister stressed: “This remains the case and underlines again the value of the agreement reached last month.”

The Tánaiste was returning home after a series of meetings in both New York and Washington, including a meeting with US secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick, where it is understood there was no hint of a new 100pc tariff.

HELSINKI, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- White-collar unemployment in Finland has surged to a record high, underscoring strains in the labour market as overall joblessness climbed above 10 percent, the highest since 2009, according to official data and union officials.

Statistics Finland said nearly 340,000 people were registered as unemployed jobseekers at the end of July. Among them, nearly 67,000 held an academic degree -- over 9,000 more than a year earlier.

[TITLE]SEALSQ Announces Deal With Quantix Edge Security to Develop Spain’s First Post-Quantum Semiconductor Personalization Center Worth $25M in Expected Revenue:
[TEXT]
Geneva, Switzerland, Sept. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

The Spanish Government recently announced a €19.6 million public investment in Quantix, which is projected to generate €793 million of economic impact in the Region of Murcia over the next five years https://digital.gob.es/comunicacion/notas-prensa/secretaria-digitalizacion-e-inteligencia-artificial/2025/09/2025-09-25

SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES) (“SEALSQ” or “the Company”), a leader in semiconductors, PKI, and post-quantum technology hardware and software, today announced a definitive agreement with Quantix Edge Security to develop and deploy Spain’s first post-quantum semiconductor personalization center in the Region of Murcia.

This agreement, a key milestone in the Quantix Edge Security project previously announced by the Company in June 2024, is expected to generate $25 million of revenue over the next three years with recognition likely to be milestone based over the course of the project. The Company anticipates that the project will start in H1 2026 and further expects that the project milestones will occur regularly over the life of the project creating a relatively even spread of revenue recognition..

This development is aligned with the Spanish Government’s national strategy to strengthen sovereignty in critical sectors such as semiconductors and cybersecurity. In September 2025, the Government announced a €19.6 million public investment in Quantix, projected to deliver €793 million in economic impact to the Region of Murcia over the next five years. The new center will reinforce Spain’s role as a European hub for post-quantum and cybersecurity-focused semiconductor innovation.

SEALSQ also plans to accelerate commercialization by distributing its post-quantum semiconductors through Quantix Edge Security beginning in 2026, even while the Murcia facility remains under construction. This strategy will enable early adoption of SEALSQ’s quantum-resistant technologies and supports the Company’s $170 million pipeline of potential revenue as part of its broader Quantum Roadmap.

In parallel, SEALSQ is preparing to launch the Quantum Shield “QS7001” in mid-November 2025, the world’s first1 secure chip to embed NIST-standardized quantum-resistant algorithms ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber) and ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) at the hardware level. The QS7001 will provide robust protection for critical applications including cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructures, defense and aerospace systems, healthcare platforms, and Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems.

The QS7001 delivers secure key storage, post-quantum signing, and hybrid migration frameworks that enable seamless transitions from RSA/ECC to quantum-safe cryptography, along with an open hardware platform that supports personalized firmware. The product also paves the way for SEALSQ’s upcoming QVault TPM, a Trusted Platform Module scheduled for release in the first half of 2026.

[TITLE]Turkish Airlines inks big Boeing deal after Erdogan visits US:
[TEXT]
ISTANBUL: Turkish Airlines announced on Friday (Sep 26) a deal to buy up to 225 Boeing jets, one day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made his first White House visit since 2019.

The more than two-hour meeting between Erdogan and President Donald Trump raised Ankara's hopes of seeing Washington lift sanctions that since 2020 have blocked it from buying American F-35 fighter jets.

The measures were imposed in retaliation for Türkiye's purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defence system.

Speaking to Turkish reporters on his flight home from Washington, Erdogan described a "sincere, constructive and productive atmosphere" during the talks.

But he conceded that "resolving all problems in a single meeting is, of course, impossible".

The Turkish Airlines deal includes 150 confirmed Boeing aircraft to be delivered between 2029 and 2034, with an option for 75 more, the company said in a statement, without giving a figure for the cost.

"With these orders, we aim to transition our entire fleet to next-generation aircraft by 2035, boosting efficiency and supporting an average annual growth rate of six per cent," the airline said.

The airline made a firm order for 50 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with an option for 25 more.

It also placed an order for 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets, with an option for 50 more.

The airline is also in talks with engine makers Rolls-Royce and GE Aerospace for engines, spare parts, and maintenance services for the Dreamliners.

The Boeing deal follows Turkish Airlines' December 2023 announcement of a 355-plane order from European rival Airbus.
