According to NTT, the transaction will provide improved value to insurance clients via expanded capabilities in core system implementation, digital transformation, testing and application management.

[TITLE]Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Q3: Beats On Revenue, Stock Soars:
[TEXT]
Computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q3 CY2025, with sales up 2.8% year on year to $13.65 billion. On the other hand, next quarter’s revenue guidance of $13.3 billion was less impressive, coming in 0.8% below analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.08 per share was significantly above analysts’ consensus estimates.

Is now the time to buy Intel? Find out in our full research report.

Intel (INTC) Q3 CY2025 Highlights:

Revenue: $13.65 billion vs analyst estimates of $13.17 billion (2.8% year-on-year growth, 3.7% beat)

Adjusted EPS: $0.08 vs analyst estimates of $0.01 (significant beat)

Adjusted Operating Income: $1.52 billion vs analyst estimates of $410.4 million (11.2% margin, significant beat)

Revenue Guidance for Q4 CY2025 is $13.3 billion at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $13.4 billion

Adjusted EPS guidance for Q4 CY2025 is $0.08 at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $0.08

Operating Margin: 5%, up from -68.2% in the same quarter last year

Free Cash Flow was $896 million, up from -$2.7 billion in the same quarter last year

Inventory Days Outstanding: 124, up from 122 in the previous quarter

Market Capitalization: $175.6 billion

“Our Q3 results reflect improved execution and steady progress against our strategic priorities,” said Lip-Bu Tan, Intel CEO.

Company Overview

Inventor of the x86 processor that powered decades of technological innovation in PCs, data centers, and numerous other markets, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a leading manufacturer of computer processors and graphics chips.

Revenue Growth

Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last five years, Intel’s demand was weak and its revenue declined by 7.3% per year. This was below our standards and suggests it’s a low quality business. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.

Intel Quarterly Revenue

We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Intel’s revenue over the last two years was flat, sugggesting its demand was weak but stabilized after its initial drop.

Intel Year-On-Year Revenue Growth

This quarter, Intel reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 2.8% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 3.7%. Company management is currently guiding for a 6.7% year-on-year decline in sales next quarter.

[TITLE]Palantir enters $200M partnership with telco Lumen to offer enterprise AI services:
[TEXT]
Palantir said on Thursday it had struck a partnership with Lumen Technologies that will see the telecommunications company using the data management company’s AI software to build capabilities to support enterprise AI services.

The companies are calling the deal “a multi-year, multi-million-dollar strategic partnership,” but Bloomberg reports, citing anonymous sources, that Lumen is going to spend over $200 million on Palantir’s tech over the course of several years.

The agreement will see Lumen pairing Palantir’s Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) with its own edge computing, broadband infrastructure, and other digital services.

The partnership comes as Lumen tries to transform itself from a traditional telecom provider into a more modern tech infrastructure play. The company in September said it was “collaborating” with Palantir to integrate the latter’s Foundry and AI software and services into its operations, finance, and technology functions, “to transform its network and services with speed.”

While Lumen would not confirm the deal value, its spokesperson Joe Goode told TechCrunch in an email that the company’s use of Palantir’s tech was a “material contributor” to achieving $350 million in cost reductions in 2025. He added that what the companies learned during that collaboration informed their decision to take their partnership to the enterprise market. Lumen has committed to reducing expenses by $1 billion by 2027, and it says it’s already ahead of plan.

“Palantir demonstrated that its Foundry and AIP platforms could unlock Lumen’s data faster and cheaper than traditional data-lake migrations, and together we’re pursuing solutions to help large enterprises do the same,” Goode said.

For Palantir, this is the latest in a long string of deals for which it has partnered up with companies and government organizations of all stripes to sell its AI products and services. Including the Lumen deal, Palantir has struck 19 partnerships this year alone, across aviation, healthcare, telecom, contract management, data management, defense, and more sectors.

“By bringing AI into real-world operations through a connected ecosystem, we’re empowering businesses to reinvent how they operate, compete, and grow,” Kate Johnson, CEO of Lumen Technologies, said in a statement.
