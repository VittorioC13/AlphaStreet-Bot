[TITLE]Ford to invest ₹3,250 cr to revive Chennai plant:
[TEXT]
US automotive major Ford is set to revive its manufacturing operations at Tamil Nadu after it stopped operating its Maraimalai Nagar manufacturing site in 2021.

Sources in the know said that the company representatives are set to meet Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin and State Industries Minister TRB Rajaa today (Friday) ⁠to sign a ₹3,250-crore MoU for powertrain manufacturing at its Chennai plant. ⁠Ford will use the plant to produce all-new, next-generation engines, sources added. The plant will have planned capacity of 2,35,000 engines annually, with production expected in 2029. It is set to create more than 600 jobs.

“⁠A letter of intent was signed in September 2024 for this when the CM Stalin visited the US,” they add. The preparation of the site for the production of the new engines line-up will begin later this year. The production will be largely for exports, but the destinations are yet unclear.

The large investment plans of Ford come at a time despite the recent US tariffs and President Donald Trump’s insisting US companies to set up manufacturing within America.

businessline reported earlier this year that Ford is working to revive the plant in Tamil Nadu with discussions ongoing and delays due to the new Trump administration working on various tariff-related issues.

In September 2024, the US carmaker announced its intention to resume manufacturing at its Chennai plant, two years after halting production in India after a three-decade-long presence in the country. It submitted a Letter of Intent to the Tamil Nadu government, confirming its plan to utilise the facility for export-oriented manufacturing.

[TITLE]GlobalFoundries Plans Billion-Euro Investment to Expand Chip Manufacturing in Germany:
[TEXT]
GlobalFoundries (GF) today announced plans to invest €1.1 billion to expand its manufacturing capabilities at its Dresden, Germany site. The investment will enable a production capacity increase to more than one million wafers per year by the end of 2028, making it the largest site of its kind in Europe.The expansion, known as project SPRINT, is expected to be supported by the German federal government and the State of Saxony under the framework of the European Chips Act, with EU approval for the full program expected later this year. This investment underscores Saxony's role as a critical hub for semiconductor manufacturing and innovation and reinforces Europe's strategic goal of supply chain resilience.As a part of the project, the facility will be upgraded to offer end-to-end European processes and data flows for critical semiconductor security requirements.Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as part of his visit to GF Dresden on 28 October, welcomed the planned investments in Germany: "The SPRINT project is a commitment to Germany as an industrial and innovation location - and above all to the sovereignty of our country and Europe. The investment in chip manufacturing in Dresden sends a signal that Germany wants to play an active role in shaping the development of the global semiconductor market. Germany already plays a leading role in microelectronics in Europe. With its national microelectronics strategy, the federal government is setting the course for further expanding this strength."Saxony's Minister President Michael Kretschmer adds: "The further expansion of semiconductor manufacturing here at GlobalFoundries is a clear commitment to a unique location. The billion-euro investment is more good news for Silicon Saxony, Europe's most important microelectronics location, and demonstrates the attractiveness and dynamism of the cluster that has grown here. This will not only strengthen the Saxon economy—Germany and Europe will also benefit. After all, more chips manufactured here also means more German and European sovereignty and technological independence in this key industry. Germany's economic vulnerability due to excessive dependencies is currently being demonstrated by the example of chip manufacturer Nexperia."The new manufacturing capacity will focus on GF's highly differentiated technologies - with critical performance features including low power, embedded secure memory, and wireless connectivity - all essential for meeting Europe's chip demand for automotive, internet of things (IoT), defense and critical infrastructure applications. These sectors are being rapidly transformed by the rise of physical AI technologies for which GF's semiconductors are essential. The investment will also support continued innovation in next-generation compute architectures and quantum technologies as they scale into the next decade."Recent disruptions in the automotive sector underscore just how vulnerable global chip supply chains truly are. Our planned expansion in Dresden is yet another step in GF's strategy to address these challenges head-on and deliver on our commitment to support Europe's need for secure supply chains and differentiated technologies," said Tim Breen, CEO of GlobalFoundries. "By scaling our manufacturing footprint in Europe, in the U.S. and around the world, GF is reinforcing its role as a resilient and trusted partner to customers in critical industries and building a foundation for the next wave of innovation as physical AI becomes reality."Dr. Manfred Horstmann, senior vice president and general manager European fabs at GlobalFoundries, adds: "With this planned investment, we are deepening our commitment to Germany and Europe. Expanding cleanroom capacity is not just

[TITLE]Mobility startup Tsuyo Manufacturing raises $4.5 million in round led by Avaana Capital:
[TEXT]
Mobility startup Tsuyo Manufacturing has raised $4.5 million in a funding round led by early-stage investment firm Avaana Capital The company will utilise the funds to build a new greenfield manufacturing facility, set up a research and development (R&D) centre, and expand its export operations and partnerships with automakers across Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea, and Europe.“EV is a relatively new domain, and the industry has only recently evolved. In fact, (only) over the last four to five years, people have started taking it seriously. Government incentives, schemes, and policies are also being introduced in a big way,” founder and chief executive Vijay Kumar told ET.Founded in 2020, the New Delhi-based company designs and manufactures core systems that power electric vehicles (EVs) — including motors and controllers used in three- and four-wheelers, trucks, buses, and off-road vehicles, such as mining dump trucks, forklifts, and electric tractors. It supplies these components to automakers, like Mahindra , Volvo, Eicher , and Sonalika.Currently, it has two operational units in Greater Noida.The company has supplied 1.5 lakh powertrain units so far. It has filed four patents, and 25 more are in the pipeline, including for motors that use hybrid magnets and do not rely on rare-earth materials.According to Kumar, the company does not cater to the two-wheeler segment because 99% of scooters and their components are imported by China. “These are traders’ markets, and the technology is largely commodity-based, so there isn’t much scope for differentiation.”The company’s revenue has grown by 10x in five years, he said.“In terms of production capacity as well, compared to when we started, the annual production we achieved last year was almost seven to eight times higher,” he added.Currently, India accounts for 95% of its revenue.Commenting on the investment, Vikas Verma, venture partner at Avaana Capital, said, “Their vertically integrated powertrain, critical for electrification across automotive and industrial applications, exemplifies indigenous, scalable innovation that will define India’s role in building globally resilient supply chains and reducing reliance on rare earth mineral-based technologies.”

[TITLE]Starbucks to sell control of China business to Boyu Capital in $4 billion deal:
[TEXT]
Starbucks said on Monday it would sell control of its China operations to investment firm Boyu Capital in a deal valued at $4 billion, in one of the most valuable divestments of a China unit by a global consumer company in recent years.

Under the agreement, the companies will operate a joint venture with Boyu holding an interest of up to 60% in Starbucks’ retail operations in China.

Starbucks will retain a 40% interest in the joint venture and will continue to own and license the brand and intellectual property to the new entity, the companies said.

Starbucks expects the total value of its China retail business to exceed $13 billion, which includes proceeds from the sale of a controlling interest in the joint venture to Boyu as well as the value of Starbucks retained interest in the venture.

Starbucks is divesting in China as its market share has declined in recent years due to fierce competition from local coffee chains that offer cheaper products amid an economic slowdown that has changed consumer habits.

Its market share in China - home to more than a fifth of its cafes - fell sharply to 14% last year from 34% in 2019, according to Euromonitor International data.

[TITLE]Transportation awards Google major contract after ‘OneGov’ deal:
[TEXT]
The Department of Transportation has inked a deal for Google’s Workspace software suite using discounted rates made possible through the company’s April ‘OneGov’ agreement with the General Services Administration.

According to contracting documents obtained by Nextgov/FCW, Transportation awarded the five-year enterprise license agreement on Sept. 27 to deliver Google Workspace across the department via prime contractor Carahsoft.

The contract has a total ceiling value of up to $89 million and will ultimately provide the department — which has more than 50,000 employees across the country — access to Google Workspace’s cloud-native apps like Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Meet and more, as well as popular AI tools Gemini and NotebookLM.

Google declined to comment for this story and the Transportation Department was unable to comment due to the government shutdown.

In early April, Google became the first company to negotiate an agreement with GSA through its OneGov strategy, which essentially treats government customers as a single large purchaser. Google offered a temporary 71% discount on Workspace through Sept. 30 for government customers, a discount Transportation took advantage of in this deal. More than a dozen tech companies followed Google’s lead in negotiating OneGov deals and discounting billions of dollars’ worth of software to government customers, many for a limited period of time.

“We’re excited to see agencies using the OneGov offerings to help deliver on their missions while also saving taxpayer dollars,” Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum said in a statement to Nextgov/FCW. “This outcome shows how diversity in the federal marketplace yields efficiency, prioritizing American taxpayers first.”

Transportation’s Workspace deal could be a harbinger of more widespread government adoption for Google, which launched its Google Public Sector division more than three years ago specifically to target government business.

While the Google Workspace suite is used by several large agencies, including GSA, the Energy Department and Air Force Research Laboratory, Microsoft’s 365 suite has been the dominant productivity and communications software across the federal government for more than a decade. Contracting documents indicate Transportation and its component agencies, like the Federal Aviation Administration, have long used Microsoft 365 for collaboration and communication needs. It’s unclear how this new deal with Google will impact its Microsoft relationship.

In a late June interview with Nextgov/FCW, Transportation Chief Information Officer Pavan Pidugu laid out his vision for the department's IT operations, focusing on process improvements, people and products. Pidugu said he wanted to remove shadow IT across the department, get rid of redundant IT systems, speed up acquisitions and shift the department and its it staff toward becoming a product-focused organization.

Draper awarded $25 million in state and local funding for Lowell IMPACT Center construction

by Clarence Oxford

Los Angeles CA (SPX) Oct 28, 2025

Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey has announced up to $25 million in state and local funding in partnership with the City of Lowell to support the construction of Draper's Integrated Microelectronics Production and Advanced Chip Technology (IMPACT) Center. This initiative is part of the state's strategy to expand support for the defense sector in Massachusetts.

The planned 75,000 square foot IMPACT Center will be located in the Lowell Innovation Network Corridor (LINC) and is set to house advanced facilities for microelectronics design, production, and packaging. Draper will deliver technology from these facilities to its U.S. Military, Aerospace, and Government customers. The center is expected to create over 150 new jobs in national security, including technicians, engineers, and executive roles.

Governor Healey said, "Massachusetts is proud of our defense leadership - we are the birthplace of the National Guard, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard, and we've carried that legacy of innovation and service forward for generations. We are proud to support Draper's efforts to strengthen this leadership by establishing the IMPACT Center, which will create good jobs, grow our economy and bolster our national security in partnership with UMass Lowell and the City of Lowell."

Jerry Wohletz, Ph.D., President and CEO of Draper, stated, "Today's investment reflects Governor Healey's ongoing commitment to the needs of the nation's defense sector. The IMPACT Center will significantly expand the nation's secure, on-shore microelectronics production capacity and deliver new capabilities to our military. The facility will also strengthen the Commonwealth's manufacturing base and create new jobs for a highly skilled workforce, educated and trained in our local universities, colleges, and trade schools. We are grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration, the Commonwealth, and our partners in state and federal government for supporting our vision of what can be accomplished by this investment."

Draper's partnership involves collaboration with the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML), the University of Massachusetts Building Authority, the City of Lowell, and the Commonwealth. Draper intends to provide up to $10 million over the next decade for programming, research, and education at UML.

Earlier this year, Draper opened a corporate campus at UML as the anchor tenant in LINC, a 1.2 million square foot development designed to foster an innovation ecosystem and economic growth for Lowell. LINC was made possible through a joint effort of UML, UMBA, the City of Lowell, and significant support from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

[TITLE]Major Vietnamese investment announced to boost British aerospace sector:
[TEXT]
Vietnamese airline Vietjet announces investment into 100 new aircraft, with wings designed in Bristol and made in North Wales

major deals for Airbus and Rolls-Royce to benefit sites in Bristol, Derby and North Wales, supporting thousands of jobs and boosting the economy to deliver the Plan for Change

Transport Secretary visits Airbus in Bristol to see research and development in action, with investment supporting aerospace innovation to ensure UK remains a global leader

A significant investment into the British aerospace sector has been announced today (30 October 2025), following a major deal being made between a Vietnamese airline and the UK aerospace sector.

Following the Prime Minister’s meeting with Vietnam’s General Secretary yesterday, VietJet has announced a significant order for 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft.

The Transport Secretary visited Airbus’s site in Bristol today to mark the order and see how this will allow Airbus to continue investing in research and development.

Overall, the deal supports Airbus’ 79,000 strong supply chain and 12,000 employees across the country, with Airbus estimated to bring £5.3 billion to the economy each year.

The wings for 100 aircraft will be manufactured at Airbus’ Broughton site in North Wales, with their design developed at the company’s Filton facility, showing a strong pipeline from concept to reality delivered from the UK . This programme will safeguard highly skilled jobs across both regions, supporting delivery of the Plan for Change.

The deal comes alongside further investment from Vietjet into the UK aviation sector, with Vietjet and Rolls-Royce signing a deal for 92 Trent 7000 engines to be manufactured in the UK for use in 40 A330 Neos, also set to support thousands of high-skilled jobs.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:

This landmark deal shows that British innovation continues to be at the forefront in connecting the world. By working hand-in-hand with our international partners, we are helping our aerospace sector soar, creating thousands of high-skilled jobs, boosting our economy and delivering real benefits for working people across the UK as part of our Plan for Change.

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, said:

This major investment from VietJet is a big vote of confidence in British aerospace and engineering, and will support jobs across the country to deliver our Plan for Change. Homegrown research and development is vital to our net zero ambitions and I’m delighted that this order will encourage investment back into aviation innovation – helping us to continue as a global leader in the industry.

Transport Secretary visits Airbus site in Bristol

The government is also supporting sectors such as aviation with major investments to encourage innovation, including £20.4 billion for research and development across the UK until April 2026.

Further funding to support aviation innovation was also announced over the summer, with £63 million to encourage the development of sustainable aviation fuels ( SAF ) and £4 million allocated to grassroots research projects trialling next-generation drone technology.

These investments have been echoed by strong industry support, with energy logistics firm Exolum recently announcing the creation of a brand-new SAF supply network, starting with a fuel blending facility in Portishead, just outside Bristol.

The government is supporting airport expansion at Gatwick and Luton – where capacity upgrades have been approved – and Heathrow. The moves support the government’s growth mission and any expansion will be balanced with environmental, climate and air quality aims.

By encouraging investment that feeds back into innovation, such as VietJet’s order, aviation can take advantage of cleaner, greener technology to reduce its carbon footprint and expand airports responsibly.

[TITLE]Bridger Aerospace Secures $331 Million in New Financing Commitments to Fuel Growth and Fleet Expansion:
[TEXT]
BELGRADE, Mont., Oct. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings, Inc. (“Bridger”, “the Company” or “Bridger Aerospace”), (NASDAQ: BAER, BAERW), one of the nation’s largest aerial firefighting companies, today announced a significant financial milestone with a new senior secured facility of up to $331.5 million led by Bain Capital’s Private Credit Group (“Bain Capital”). In addition, in a separate announcement filed yesterday, the Company said it finalized its previously announced sale-leaseback of its Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport campus facilities.

Together, these transactions refinance Bridger’s $160 million municipal bond with Gallatin County, consolidate the Company’s existing debt, and provide significant capacity and financial flexibility through a delayed draw facility designed to fund future fleet expansion.

“This financing marks a turning point for Bridger,” Sam Davis, Bridger’s CEO shared. “Our strong quarterly results and our expectations for a second record year have made it possible for us to refinance our existing debt and enter into a new expanded debt facility with increased capacity. We believe this new facility significantly enhances our ability to grow organically. It provides financial flexibility for new aircraft purchases to support contract expansion that will drive EBITDA growth and long-term shareholder value. Bridger’s federal, state, and defense contracts have established our revenue model on a year-round basis.
