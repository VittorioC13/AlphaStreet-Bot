The first day of September should have marked the beginning of one of the busiest periods of the year for Jaguar Land Rover. It was a Monday, and the release of new 75 series number plates was expected to trigger a surge in demand. At factories in Solihull and Halewood, as well as at its engine plant in Wolverhampton, staff anticipated that they’d be working flat out. Instead, when the early shift arrived, they were sent home. The production lines have remained idle ever since. Though they are expected to resume operations in the coming days, it will be in a slow and carefully controlled manner. It could be another month before output returns to normal. Such was the impact of a major cyber attack that hit JLR at the end of August. It is working with various cyber security specialists and police to investigate, but the financial damage has already been done. More than a month's worth of worldwide production was lost. Analysts have estimated its losses at £50m per week.

For a company that made a £2.5bn profit in the last financial year, and which is owned by the Indian giant Tata Group, the losses will likely be painful but not fatal. But JLR is not an isolated incident. So far this year there has been a wave of cyber attacks targeting big businesses, including retailers such as Marks & Spencer and the Co-op, as well as a key airport systems provider. Other high profile victims have included the children's nursery chain Kido, while last year incidents involving Southern Water and a company that provided blood tests to the NHS raised serious concerns

[TITLE]ESG: The high price of good intentions * WorldNetDaily * by Tammy Nemeth, Real Clear Wire:
[TEXT]
This fall, the European Union’s (EU) government in Brussels is set to finalize a sweeping ESG “due diligence” directive that will attempt to reshape global business in Brussels’s image.

The controversial law, several years in the making, has faced stiff resistance from companies and policymakers both within and outside the EU because the directive forces large companies—including non-EU multinationals—to meticulously audit their human rights, emissions, and environmental footprints across entire value chains.

Faced with energy and defense realities in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, it has become a flashpoint for competing priorities within the EU: the Green Deal’s draconian climate action on one hand, and economic competitiveness on the other. Can a continent truly champion industrial competitiveness while imposing costly and burdensome climate rules that shift focus from manufacturing and innovation to an expanding compliance bureaucracy? Who truly benefits, and does this path risk sacrificing Europe’s industrial vitality on the altar of regulatory and climate idealism?

A lot has changed since Europe formally introduced the law – the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, or “CS3D” – on 23 February, 2022. Exactly one day after the legislative proposal was docketed for public comment, Russia launched its ground invasion of Ukraine, setting off a series of diplomatic, military, and energy crises in Europe.

Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe enjoyed plentiful natural gas supplied by a mostly reliable but not adversarial partner in Russia. This abundance allowed policymakers in Brussels to pursue ambitious green policies, positioning the continent at the forefront of global efforts to demonize fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.

The crown jewel of this era was CS3D, meticulously shaped from the 2018 OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. The European Commission’s intent was clear: CS3D would compel domestic and multinational businesses not only to comply with strict climate and human rights standards, but also to serve as global ambassadors of compliance-driven green commerce.

The promise of CS3D was always predicated on the notion that Europe, and multinational businesses, could afford to bear the cost of being the world’s climate conscience. And it is costly. For most businesses, the CS3D represents a seismic financial shift. Compliance means overhauling reporting systems, hiring armies of consultants, and enduring relentless audits. The Danish Presidency of the Council of the European Union’s own analysis estimates that a single company could spend up to EU 2.3 million annually in compliance. Other estimates suggest affected firms could see costs shoot up by 10 to 30 percent.

Oil and gas companies, already under the microscope for their emissions, face additional headaches: they must monitor and report on every supplier’s methane output, overhaul procurement protocols, and invest millions in new software and third-party verification. All companies must also provide a net zero transition plan annually updated to demonstrate fulfillment of emissions reduction targets or lack thereof. Failing to comply is no trivial matter—penalties can reach 5% of global net turnover, and civil liability for damages is now firmly on the table.

Operationally, firms will devote resources to ongoing risk assessment, staff training, and documentation stretching from the boardroom to the field. These are not one-off expenses: the directive requires annual updates, investment disclosures, and persistent scrutiny of supply chains and emissions reduction targets. The bureaucratic load is compounded by the need to chase down compliance across both upstream suppliers and downstream customers, often in countries with no direct link to EU regulation.

Thus, CS3D, by its very design, incentivizes a shift away from material production—the factories, smelters, refineries, and manufacturers that form the backbone of the European economy—toward a white-collar managerial economy, redirecting capital from the business of “building things” to the business of auditing, accounting, and legal compliance. It is a costly model that prioritizes greenhouse gas accountants over engineers and tradespeople at a time when EU leaders say the continent faces a potential war with Russia.

A path towards further deindustrialization is directly at odds with the EU’s “competitiveness” imperative. After Russia’s invasion disrupted gas supplies and exacerbated a cost-of-living crisis throughout the bloc, the European Commission requested an assessment from Mario Draghi, former European Central Bank President, of how to address Europe’s failing competitiveness. Draghi’s September 2024 report put into words what many other world leaders already knew: “the energy landscape has changed irreversibly with the Russian invasion of Ukraine […] fossil fuels will continue to play a central role.” But due to Europe’s decarbonization targets, “EU industries that use energy intensively face higher investment costs than their competitors,” Draghi wrote.

Draghi’s diagnosis of Europe’s self-inflicted stasis gave leaders in Brussels air cover to dethrone climate change as the EU’s top policymaking priority, focusing instead on competitiveness and self-defense. But despite recent rhetoric, Europe continues to forge ahead with its most onerous climate regulations, even as allied trading partners warn of impacts on Europe’s energy supply.

State-owned LNG supplier Qatar Energy, which supplies between 12 and 14% of the EU’s natural gas supply, said in December 2024 that the country would cease doing business with Europe rather than comply with CS3D’s extraterritorial demands. American supermajor ExxonMobil said the directive would “challenge” the US-EU energy deal, comments echoed by US Secretary Chris Wright. Notably, the US currently supplies 45% of the EU’s gas needs.

A second pivotal moment was the election of Donald Trump in November 2024. With the United States adopting a more skeptical and nationalistic stance on climate agreements, European regulators suddenly faced the real prospect of trade friction, energy supplier resistance, and diminished cooperation. CS3D is at the center of these tensions, an archaic holdover from Europe’s pre-war, transatlantic consensus.

In response, talk of “simplifying” CS3D and delaying its implementation until 2028 has gained momentum. Indeed, this fall, Brussels will roll out a “simplified” version of CS3D. The hard truth is that the best version of CS3D is no CS3D at all; but absent scrapping the directive altogether, Brussels must calculate how much of the law it can salvage without risking energy and trade partnerships.

If Brussels is playing a game of chicken, it’s a dangerous game. Reduced gas flows from the US and Qatar would intensify already crippling energy costs across the region, driving further cost-of-living increases in both household spending and industrial operating costs. As Russia continues to encroach on NATO’s eastern border, Europe could not pick a worse time to deprioritize industrial competitiveness seemingly to save face with the green lobby. European leaders know this – this fall, they have a chance to show it.

[TITLE]Notion Capital raises $130 million for European growth fund:
[TEXT]
Notion Capital, a London-based venture capital firm, has announced the close of a new $130 million growth fund. The fund will focus on supporting growth-stage startups across Europe in sectors like AI, defense, and supply chain logistics. Stephen Chandler, managing partner at Notion Capital, emphasized the importance of the new fund in addressing the shortage of growth-stage capital in Europe.

“This opens up a chance for firms like ourselves to become real European champions,” Chandler said. The fund, called Growth Opps III, will target areas of rising demand such as sovereignty, resilience, and artificial intelligence. Chandler described AI as a “super cycle” that is reshaping the industry.

Notion Capital will concentrate on applications of AI to multiply its market reach. Notion Capital has already begun deploying funds into ventures like Upvest, a stock trading API, Kraken, a builder of unmanned surface vessels, and Nelly, a developer of financial products for the medical sector. A dedicated team of fund partners will handle these growth deals and source new opportunities outside the existing portfolio.

Notion Capital secures new funding

The firm has also introduced new leadership with Growth Opps III. Partner Stephanie Opdam will drive the growth strategy alongside Jessica “Jess” Bartos, who joined from Salesforce Ventures as Notion’s first external partner hire.

Europe has historically struggled with a shortage of institutional capital, particularly from pension schemes. However, reforms like France’s Tibi initiative and the UK’s Mansion House Accord are starting to create incentives for long-term capital mobilisation. Reflecting its pan-European ambitions, the fund is denominated in euros and domiciled in Luxembourg, making it less dependent on UK regulation.

Around 85% of its capital came from institutional investors across Europe, the UK, MENA, and the United States. Since its founding, Notion Capital has invested in over 150 companies, including notable names like Currencycloud, GoCardless, Mews, Paddle, and Quantum Systems. Their established relationships with founders serve as a competitive advantage, particularly at the growth stage.

With Growth Opps III, Notion Capital is positioning itself as a key player in Europe’s evolving venture landscape. The firm plans to make about a dozen investments from the new fund, continuing to support ambitious European founders as they scale to global prominence.

Evantic Capital aims to identify and nurture groundbreaking AI startups that demonstrate strong potential in transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics.

The investment fund will provide financial support, strategic guidance, and industry connections to help these startups scale and achieve their transformative goals.

The firm’s launch is seen as a significant boost for the European AI startup ecosystem, which continues to garner global attention for its innovation and growth.

The firm is backed by an exclusive network of 140 seasoned founders, operators, and investors collectively known as “The Legends,” designed to create direct alignment between startup success and stakeholder involvement by allocating up to 50% of investment carry to those Legends who actively support the portfolio companies.

What they’re saying:

“Our Legends are senior leaders—experienced founders, operators, and executives—who bring a deeper level of involvement to our portfolio companies,” explains Matt Miller, Founder and Managing Partner of Evantic Capital.

“This creates a true partnership model: our Legends are not only motivated by goodwill or networking, but by a real alignment of interests. It ensures that when a founder engages with a Legend, they’re interacting with someone who is deeply invested in helping them succeed, both emotionally and economically.”

The other side: The rise of AI technologies presents a myriad of opportunities and challenges.

What’s next: Evantic Capital has already invested in five AI-focused startups and has two more commitments underway, with its current portfolio including Fireworks, Listen Labs, and Nexos.

[TITLE]Afcons shifts focus to Europe, Middle East amid Africa slowdown:
[TEXT]
MUMBAI : Leading infrastructure player Afcons Infrastructure Ltd is exploring opportunities in the Eastern European and Balkan regions to offset a slowdown in business from its conventional overseas markets, including Africa and India's neighbouring countries.

The Shapoorji Pallonji Group company had taken a similar call earlier this year to increase its presence in the lucrative Middle Eastern market, albeit with local partners. It had so far limited its exposure to the region, citing unfavourable contract terms.

Afcons is the most bullish on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East. In Saudi Arabia, it established a 90:10 joint venture company with a local partner in July 2023, called Afcons Contracting Co., to handle local projects.

In July, Afcons emerged as the lowest bidder for three projects in Croatia, which are cumulatively worth over ₹11,300 crore and are to be executed over 42-72 months. The company has yet to be formally awarded the contracts, which it expects to receive before December.

These include the development of a railway line and the construction of two stretches of a highway project.

The company will be competing with key European, American and Turkish contractors active in the region.

For context, Afcons’ FY25 revenue was ₹12,548 crore with a profit of ₹487 crore.

"As a global EPC company, we consistently explore new geographies to support growth and risk mitigation," said Hitesh Singh, vice president and head, corporate strategy, Afcons Infrastructure Ltd.

“Historically, our key international business has been in Africa and neighbouring regions. As part of our overseas strategy, amid some uncertainties in neighbouring areas and funding slowdowns in Africa, we continue pursuing opportunities across areas like Eastern Europe and the Balkans, as well as select prospects in the Middle East."

The company’s three bids in Croatia were part of this approach, he added.

[TITLE]Missing the deadline? Why analysts doubt Tata Steel's 40 mtpa capacity target:
[TEXT]
Tata Steel Ltd's ambitious plan to boost steelmaking is facing scepticism, as execution roadmaps beyond its immediate pipeline remain unclear. At the close of FY25, Tata Steel's local capacity stood at just 26.6 mtpa, far from the target of 40 mtpa by FY30 that chairman N. Chandrasekaran set in July 2024.

Apart from the two expansion projects already announced for Kalinganagar and subsidiary Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NNL), the company's road to 40 mtpa remains unclear, analysts said.

The main goal is to ramp up Kalinganagar to full capacity utilization of 8 mtpa by the end of 2025. This is a critical step, as the expansion helps Tata Steel serve demand in the near term. The other is to scale up NINL. While its expansion is critical—it will help Tata Steel sell long steel used in construction, infrastructure and appliance industries—the clearances to expand its capacity from 1 mtpa to 5 mtpa are still awaited.

Once both expansion projects are completed, Tata Steel will achieve a capacity of 31-32 mtpa, still far from its target.

Chief executive officer (CEO) TV Narendran indicated in a post-earnings call for the June quarter that the company is "ready to go to the board maybe by October, November as soon as we get the environment clearance."

What analysts said

"The 40 mtpa capacity target is an ambitious goal the company has set for itself," said Aditya Welekar, senior research analyst at Axis Securities. "In India, the immediate priority is the NINL Phase-1 expansion, which remains the only project currently in the pipeline. Other projects are not yet at a definitive stage."

Tata Steel's latest annual report speaks of further expansion at Meramandali and Kalinganagar after NINL Phase-1, but formal announcements detailing scope, budget, and construction timelines are missing.

Kotak Securities noted that board approval, tentatively set for 3QFY26 after detailed engineering and land acquisition are complete, would precede a 3 to 3.5-year commissioning period, pushing the unit's operational date to around 2029.

According to analysts, what’s missing are announcements around execution details and timelines.

Tata Steel’s European operations could also weigh on its ability to fund domestic expansions as they transition towards low-carbon and sustainable steel production overseas.

Welekar of Axis pointed out that Tata Steel's British and Dutch operations are also undergoing restructuring, "which might delay the capex for the Indian expansion projects."

Tata Steel acquired NINL nearly three years ago through a privatization process. It has turned around the loss-making unit company into an Ebitda-positive unit. In FY25, the NINL unit reported ₹1,000 crore Ebitda. The acquisition helped the steelmaker expand further in long steel products.

Kalinganagar is Tata Steel’s greenfield project. It is currently running at 4.5-5mtpa capacity. The Phase-II expansion aims to add 5mtpa capacity to existing 3 mtpa, taking it to 8 mtpa.

Tata Steel operates five major manufacturing units in India, including integrated plants at Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar, and facilities at Gamharia, Meramandali, and NINL.
