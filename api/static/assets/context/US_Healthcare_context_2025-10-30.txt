Key Factors Driving the Growth of the Gastroparesis Market

Rising Gastroparesis Prevalence

According to DelveInsight analysis, the United States accounted for approximately 715K cases of gastroparesis in 2024. These cases are anticipated to increase by 2034. This upward trend is driven by the rising prevalence of diabetes, the leading underlying cause, improved diagnostic tools enabling more accurate detection, and greater clinical awareness leading to higher diagnosis rates

GIMOTI’s Role in Optimizing Healthcare Efficiency

GIMOTI is the only approved drug demonstrated to reduce hospitalizations, emergency room visits, medical office visits, and associated healthcare costs compared to oral metoclopramide, providing a clear clinical and economic advantage.

Clinical Promise of Naronapride

Naronapride uniquely integrates 5-HT4 receptor agonist with D2 receptor antagonism within a single molecule. Given its promising clinical profile and the growing unmet need in gastrointestinal disorders, there is a compelling opportunity for Renexxion Ireland and Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH to expand its research into dual-targeted therapeutic approaches.

Novel Gastroparesis Competitive Landscape

Companies like Vanda Pharmaceuticals (Tradipitant), Neurogastrx (NG101), CinDome Pharma (Deudomperidone), Renexxion Ireland (Naronapride), Processa Pharmaceuticals and Intact Therapeutics (PCS12852), and others are investigating their key products for gastroparesis.

Emergence of Novel Drug Classes

The pipeline of novel therapeutic candidates targeting diverse mechanisms such as NK-1R antagonists (Tradipitant), 5-HT4 receptor agonists (PCS12852), D2 receptor antagonists (NG101), dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonists (CIN-102), and others demonstrates strong innovation and commitment to addressing unmet needs in gastroparesis treatment.

Gastroparesis Market Analysis

Managing gastroparesis remains challenging, focusing primarily on symptom relief and improving gastric motility rather than providing a definitive cure. Initial strategies often involve lifestyle modifications, including dietary adjustments, glycemic control, and adequate hydration, but these measures generally yield only modest benefits for most patients. Pharmacologic treatments form the cornerstone of therapy: prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, domperidone, and erythromycin are used to promote gastric emptying, while antiemetics (ondansetron, granisetron, phenothiazines) and neuromodulators (tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs, delta ligands) help manage nausea, vomiting, and related symptoms.

GIMOTI, a nasal form of metoclopramide, offers a non-oral option for those with persistent symptoms despite oral therapy. Nevertheless, many patients continue to experience inadequate symptom control. In severe, treatment-resistant cases, advanced interventions like gastric electrical stimulation or G-POEM may be considered, though both are invasive, expensive, and supported by limited evidence. Overall, existing treatments reveal significant unmet needs, emphasizing the necessity for safer, more effective, and accessible therapeutic options for gastroparesis.

The therapeutic landscape for gastroparesis is gradually evolving as new candidates progress through development. Companies including Vanda Pharmaceuticals (tradipitant), CinDome Pharma (deudomperidone), Processa Pharmaceuticals (PCS12852), Renexxion Ireland, Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH (Naronapride), Neurogastrx (NG101), and others are actively investigating treatments aimed at improving symptom management and overall disease control across the 7MM.

[TITLE]How medication is changing HIV narratives:
[TEXT]
How medication is changing HIV narratives

New treatments and long-acting medications are reshaping HIV care, turning fear into freedom as science, access, and awareness unite to redefine what it means to live healthy, whole, and hopeful.

The changing story of HIV

In recent years, the story around HIV has shifted dramatically. What was once viewed as a life sentence is now increasingly seen as a manageable condition. Medication is responsible for much of that change. The promise it holds is altering how people live, love, plan, and hope.

When HIV treatment first became widely available, it consisted of a complex regimen of pills taken daily, often with significant side effects and strict adherence requirements. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), early therapies saved lives but demanded immense discipline and caused fatigue, nausea, and other complications that made daily life challenging. Over time, scientists refined the therapy into what is known as antiretroviral therapy (ART), introducing triple-drug combinations that became the gold standard. These regimens offered durable suppression of the virus, allowing people to live longer, healthier lives.

Simplifying treatment, reshaping lives

Today, the landscape is evolving again. Researchers and clinicians are focusing on simplifying treatment to reduce barriers and stigma. Healthline reports that improved convenience and reduced side effects are reshaping not just the science of treatment, but the experience of living with HIV. Fewer pills, fewer visits, and fewer reminders of one’s diagnosis are giving people greater autonomy and quality of life.

One major advancement is the development of long-acting therapies. Instead of a daily pill, people can now receive injections as infrequently as once a month, every six months, or potentially even less often. The drug Lenacapavir, known commercially as Yeztugo, recently became the first FDA-approved HIV prevention option offering six months of protection, according to a statement from Gilead Sciences. These innovations reduce daily burdens, minimize stigma, and empower individuals to stay consistent with treatment or prevention regimens.

U=U: transforming intimacy and identity

With better treatment options, the conversation around HIV is changing. Instead of focusing on survival, people are beginning to talk about thriving, pursuing careers, raising families, and forming relationships without fear. The concept of “undetectable equals untransmittable” (U=U) — verified by Northwestern Medicine and other medical institutions means that individuals with undetectable viral loads cannot transmit the virus sexually. This scientific fact has opened emotional and psychological doors, allowing people to reclaim their sense of normalcy and intimacy.

The narrative is also expanding beyond treatment to prevention. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) has highlighted how HIV medications now serve dual purposes: suppressing the virus in those who have it and preventing infection in those who don’t. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has revolutionized prevention efforts, with both daily oral and injectable options providing greater flexibility. This shift from reactive to proactive care represents one of the most important public health developments in the ongoing fight against HIV.

The equity gap in access and awareness

Still, the promise of medication is only as strong as the system that delivers it. Access remains uneven, especially in underserved and marginalized communities. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) emphasizes that scientific progress must be paired with equitable access, education, and healthcare reform to close the gaps in treatment and prevention. For people of color — particularly Black Americans who continue to experience higher infection rates, these disparities highlight the urgent need for resources, awareness, and culturally informed outreach.

Long-acting treatments are helping address some of these inequities. A study published on PubMed Central (PMC) found that such therapies are particularly effective for populations facing barriers like unstable housing, mental health challenges, or limited healthcare access. Reducing the frequency of medication can mean fewer missed doses and better outcomes, ultimately improving overall community health.

Beyond medicine: confronting stigma

Of course, medication alone does not erase stigma. Despite medical advances, HIV continues to carry social and emotional burdens. But as narratives shift from fear to empowerment, medicine becomes a tool for transformation. People living with HIV are now sharing stories of thriving , building families, starting businesses, traveling, and contributing to their communities with confidence.

Scientists are still searching for a cure. Research at the University of Virginia and other institutions suggests that hidden viral reservoirs remain the greatest obstacle to complete eradication. But the outlook is hopeful. Each breakthrough brings humanity closer to a world where HIV is no longer a global threat, but a manageable condition with dignity and stability.

A new narrative of resilience and hope

For communities that have historically carried the weight of this epidemic, the transformation is profound. As medication continues to evolve, so does the cultural narrative surrounding HIV. It’s no longer defined by secrecy, shame, or fear. Instead, it’s about resilience, empowerment, and progress.

The pill or injection represents freedom, control, and the right to live fully. It’s a story of science and humanity intersecting one where the future of HIV is no longer about surviving the diagnosis but living beyond it, with hope, health, and purpose.
