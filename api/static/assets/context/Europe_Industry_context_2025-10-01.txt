[TITLE]Latvia Orders Rheinmetall Ammunition Factory – Group Expands Global Ammunition Production Network | Soldier Systems Daily:
[TEXT]
Rheinmetall is further expanding its ammunition production capacity and is now planning to build a modern production facility for 155 mm calibre artillery ammunition in Latvia. In the presence of Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silia, a corresponding Memorandum of Understanding was signed today in Hamburg. The facility shall be operated by a joint venture between Rheinmetall Waffe Munition GmbH (51%) and the Latvian State Defence Corporation, LLC of Latvia (49%). The key points were documented in a memorandum of understanding, which was signed by representatives of both sides.

By establishing its own 155 mm ammunition production facility, Latvia is taking a further step towards strengthening its defence capabilities and expanding its independent defence sector. The produced ammunition is to ensure supplies for the National Armed Forces of Latvia, as well as strengthen security of supply chains and be available to partner countries.

The production line will feature a state-of-the-art production facility, including a shell forging and filling line. Construction is scheduled to begin in spring of 2026, with production expected to start around a year later. The €275 million investment will enable the facility to produce tens of thousands of artillery shells and create at least 150 local jobs. Regional companies and the domestic economy will be integrated into the facility’s value chain.

Latvian Prime Minister Evika Sili?a said: “Signing this MoU is a clear step towards strengthening Latvia’s security and developing our defence industry. By aiming to establish partnership with Rheinmetall Latvia not only builds stronger national defence, but also contributes to security of supply in Europe, enhancing industrial capacity as well as facilitating economic growth. I have been directly involved in this process because I believe that investing in our defence industry is investing in the safety and future of our people.”

Armin Papperger, CEO of Rheinmetall AG: “We are delighted to be able to contribute to Latvia’s national sovereignty in the field of ammunition. At the same time, the production line will strengthen our position as the world’s leading manufacturer of artillery ammunition. At Rheinmetall, we are committed to supporting our customers as a reliable partner with first-class services. I am confident that we will also build similar partnerships for ammunition production in other countries”.

Ingrida Kirse, Board Member of the State Defence Corporation: “With the utmost sense of responsibility, we are taking on the entrusted task of jointly establishing an artillery ammunition production facility in Latvia. I am confident that all the necessary conditions are in place, as this project brings together several essential components. On the one hand, the mission of the State Defence Corporation is to ensure the needs of the National Armed Forces and to foster the development of Latvia’s defence industry by developing manufacturing capacity. On the other hand, Rheinmetall contributes its longstanding expertise, accumulated know-how, high standards, and international recognition. This synergy forms the foundation of a strong partnership that will both advance the industry and strengthen the security of Latvia and the wider region.”

It was only at the end of 2024 that Rheinmetall was commissioned by Latvia’s neighboring Lithuania to build a modern ammunition production facility for artillery shells. Construction of the plant, which is set to begin in a few weeks at the Baisogala site in the heart of Lithuania, mirrors the size and design to the facility planned for Latvia.

[TITLE]BMW Group’s newest, most innovative production site officially opens in Debrecen:
[TEXT]
Debrecen. With an impressive ceremony that artistically combined Hungarian culture and modern automotive production, Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, today officially opened the BMW Group plant in Debrecen. The BMW Group’s newest and most innovative production site marks the beginning of a new era for the company. In late October, the new BMW iX3 will enter series production in the Hungarian university town of Debrecen as the first vehicle of the Neue Klasse. Plant Debrecen was planned virtually and realised in practice fully in line with the principles of the BMW iFACTORY, becoming the first BMW Group car plant to rely entirely on electricity from renewable energy during normal operation.

In addition to Oliver Zipse, high-ranking representatives from Hungarian politics, such as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the Mayor of Debrecen, László Papp, as well as Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management for Production, Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management for Human Resources and Real Estate, and Hans-Peter Kemser, President and CEO BMW Manufacturing Hungary Kft., attended the grand opening.

“In our global production network, our new plant in Debrecen is a pioneer: It is our first fully-electric plant, the first production site to operate entirely without fossil fuels – and the first to build vehicles for the Neue Klasse. This makes our plant in Debrecen a decisive factor in the BMW Group's future success,” said Oliver Zipse. “The opening also sends a strong signal: We are expanding our footprint on our home continent and reaffirming our commitment to Europe as a strong and competitive location for industry.”

Hans-Peter Kemser added at the ceremony: “This is not only a new BMW Group plant – it is a cornerstone of progress. We are a partner to culture, to education and to the University of Debrecen, where together we foster the talents that will shape the future. And above all, it is a community – deeply embedded in the life of Debrecen and Hungary.”

Strengthening the industrial base and expanding training

The official opening ceremony began with a look back at the plant’s construction, following a 2018 decision that launched one of Hungary’s largest greenfield investments. The BMW Group’s first Central European location has firmly placed Debrecen on the region's automotive map, creating more than 2,000 direct jobs – and many more along the supply chain, at regional suppliers and service providers that have recently established themselves in Debrecen, alongside national and international companies. The new plant has also strengthened the industrial park and driven additional investment in transport and infrastructure.

At the same time, through collaborations with institutions such as the local university and the Vocational Training Centre of Debrecen, DSZC, Plant Debrecen has also become one of the largest training hubs for dual education programmes in Hungary.

Only the best of the best for Debrecen

Plant Debrecen is the first BMW Group production site not tied to a specific primary plant. Instead, it serves as a network plant, combining best practices from different locations worldwide. For example, the press shop is modelled on the systems used in Spartanburg (USA) and Swindon (Great Britain), with their know-how and technologies further refined for Debrecen. In the body shop, the positioning of nearly 1,000 industrial robots, along with their processes, was digitally simulated in detail beforehand. The number of joining methods was also significantly reduced, with further streamlining allowing design features for the Neue Klasse to be integrated early in development.

Paint shop key to largest reduction in CO 2 e emissions

At BMW Group Plant Debrecen, the paint shop plays a critical role in significantly reducing the BMW iX3’s CO 2 e footprint. Production of the new BMW iX3 will generate a total of

[TITLE]Dutch govt proposes 2 bn euros support to Tata Steel arm for IJmuiden plant decarbonisation project:
[TEXT]
New Delhi, Sep 29 (PTI) Tata Steel on Monday said the Dutch government has proposed support of up to 2 billion euros for a decarbonisation project at its IJmuiden plant.

The homegrown steel maker and its European arm, Tata Steel Nederland (TSN), have signed a Joint Letter of Intent with the Government of the Netherlands and the Province of North Holland.

"Pursuant to extensive discussions, the Government of the Netherlands and the province of North-Holland, Tata Steel and TSN have agreed an intended framework for the integrated project in TSN and signed a non-binding JLoI for the first phase of transition to low CO2 steel production and to improve a healthy living environment around the IJmuiden site," Tata Steel said.

The Dutch government intends to support up to 2 billion euros. Additionally, TSN has made an application to the EU Innovation Fund for 0.3 billion euros.

TSN has not yet completed the full engineering of the integrated project and therefore not finalised the total spend, the company said, adding that the remaining amount is expected to be funded by a combination of the cash generated and contributed by Tata Steel Nederland, project financing debt, and funding procured by Tata Steel over the period of project spend.

T V Narendran, CEO & Managing Director, Tata Steel and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Tata Steel Nederland said, “We would like to thank Minister Hermans, her colleagues in the Cabinet and the team from the Netherlands Government and from the province of North-Holland who have engaged constructively and painstakingly with us over the last 2 years to complete this first step in our journey towards creating a sustainable long-term future for Tata Steel Nederland."

Tata Steel owns a steel manufacturing plant at IJmuiden in the Netherlands with an estimated capacity of 6.75 MTPA of liquid steel in FY25.

[TITLE]Melanion Capital Pioneers First Private Bitcoin Treasury Model in Europe:
[TEXT]
Firm to raise €50m to Bitcoin and offer treasury blueprint for other private companies to follow

PARIS, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Melanion Capital today announced the launch of a new strategic initiative, positioning itself as the first private regulated asset management company to implement a Bitcoin treasury operated model (BTOC). This marks a new phase in the investment management firm's evolution as a leader in Bitcoin (BTC) investment, and unlocking opportunities for other private companies to follow in its footsteps.

The move reflects Melanion's conviction that Bitcoin is not just a tactical hedge, but the foundation of a historic monetary transition. The transformation towards Bitcoin treasuries has become a significant trend for public companies, including those outside the crypto space, where a portion of their cash reserves is allocated to the decentralized currency.

Unlike public company models, Melanion's private structure provides greater flexibility to navigate volatility, structure deals, and manage liquidity. The firm will apply its strategy directly on its own balance sheet, offering a demonstration of what a sustainable Bitcoin treasury looks like, ahead of providing the framework to other private businesses to become a BTOC.

"Melanion was founded as a forward-thinking asset manager with traditional roots," said Jad Comair , Founder & CEO of Melanion Capital. "In time, it became clear that Bitcoin represents not just an asset, but a destination as the long-term anchor of capital preservation and growth, especially for Bitcoin treasuries. Our pivot to a regulated treasury is a commitment to that belief: that we can overperform on an asset which is already successful and make this model available for other private businesses to follow."

Melanion differentiates itself from passive treasury approaches by engineering alpha on top of Bitcoin exposure. The firm applies advanced capital structuring, treasury optimisation, and liquidity design to deliver enhanced performance beyond Bitcoin's own repricing cycle.

To accelerate this strategy, Melanion's board is set to raise €50 million in capital dedicated entirely to Bitcoin allocation. This will represent one of the largest private treasury commitments to Bitcoin in Europe, underlining both the scale of Melanion's ambitions and its belief that corporate treasuries must adapt to the new monetary order.

Paul Dalziel , Head of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy at Melanion Capital, said, "By anchoring our own treasury in Bitcoin, we demonstrate its potential role as a superior long-term store of value. But our ambition is larger, as we hope to show how private companies can compound that exposure, turning Bitcoin from a defensive allocation into a source of active outperformance."

Building on the firm's pioneering track record of bridging traditional and decentralized finance, including the launch of Europe's first Bitcoin Equities UCITS ETF in 2021, Melanion views its private treasury model as an actionable playbook for others.

"Our long-run vision is simple and we mean to lead by example," added Comair. "Every company will one day become a Bitcoin treasury company, and our strategy will help them achieve that".

Investment in Bitcoin carries a risk of partial or total loss of capital.

About Melanion Capital:

Founded in Paris in 2013, Melanion Capital is an independent alternative asset management firm and Bitcoin treasury company, bridging traditional finance and innovation. Recognised as a "Jeune Entreprise Innovante" by the French Ministry of Research, the firm launched its digital asset business in 2020 and was the first to offer a UCITS-compliant Bitcoin thematic ETF in 2021.

Today, Melanion is defining the standard for private Bitcoin treasuries: proving the resilience, compliance, and profitability of its own model, ahead of enabling its use to other private businesses.

[TITLE]EU and NATO Consider Denying Russia Baltic Access:
[TEXT]
The northern European countries are currently embroiled in a Russian hybrid warfare attempt, a situation that demands immediate and decisive attention. Denmark, a member of both the EU and NATO, is set to host a European Union Summit in Copenhagen this week, with the primary focus on Russian aggression in Ukraine and its hybrid warfare tactics. The Danish transportation ministry has already taken steps to ban all civilian drone flights in Danish airspace, underscoring the urgency of the security situation. Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, and other Baltic Sea region countries are currently under threat from drone attacks linked to the Russian naval presence in the region, or originating from Russian or dark fleet vessels.

The current crisis has again pushed EU and NATO members to reassess options to counter these developments, including a complete blockade of the seas for Russian assets. Current EU, UK, and US sanctions on Russia are already impacting Putin’s revenues, but Moscow still holds access to the seas, particularly Baltic outlets. Growing calls are being heard for a blockade of the Baltic Sea and its gateways, seen as a measure that could hurt Putin severely. The options are on the table; however, the risks and rewards remain unclear. What is clear, however, is the need for a coordinated EU/NATO response.

The Baltic Sea and its gateways—including the Skagerrak, Kattegat, Danish Straits, and Øresund—are not only narrow waterways but also vital maritime arteries for commerce, energy, and communication. These routes connect Northern and Central Europe to global markets, making them strategically important. The growing threat of Russian interference in these areas is a cause for concern.

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Baltic Sea has been contested—not primarily militarily but through ageing “shadow” tankers, suspicious anchor-dragging incidents severing subsea cables, and repeated drone and airspace probes. Moscow’s hybrid warfare also involves associated actors, as evidenced by reports of Chinese vessel operations. The threats are real and increasing, but options to counter them have been limited until now. Western politicians and military leaders are examining possible NATO and EU coastal state actions to block Russian dark fleet movements in the Baltic. Such steps could profoundly affect Russia’s revenues, NATO’s risk calculus, and global oil markets.

Lawful measures to block Russian access exist but have not yet been implemented. European coastal states could establish port denials, targeted sanctions, insurance and financial interdictions, and naval patrols under clear legal mandates—options that may now be discussed in Copenhagen. Grey-zone measures, such as persistent interdiction of ship-to-ship transfers and denial of bunkering and port services, should also be considered. Some are even discussing kinetic interdiction (seizing or sinking vessels), but this remains too far-fetched for many NATO members. The UNCLOS rules have until now prevented such measures, as kinetic action in peacetime against broadly flagged merchant tonnage carries a high risk of legal breach and escalation. Still, hybrid warfare may soon push some toward black ops strategies. To be effective, the Copenhagen Summit should adopt a layered civil-military strategy leveraging peacetime authorities such as customs, port-state control, sanctions enforcement, insurance leverage, naval presence, and monitoring.

Global oil markets, already volatile, could face sharp disruptions if Baltic access is denied. The region hosts key Russian export nodes for crude and petroleum products, and also serves as a hub for ship-to-ship logistics and dark fleet operations. Coordinated denial strategies among Baltic states, combined with insurer participation, would raise Russia’s operational costs. Port denials, STS policing, and insurance withdrawals would increase transport costs and logistical friction as dark fleet tankers reroute and pay higher premiums. This would reduce Russia’s market access and force heavier discounts on its barrels. While Russia has alternative routes (Arctic, Black Sea), these are unattractive in winter or vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks.

The effects are not yet clear but warrant close assessment. If interdiction is implemented without kinetic escalation, the likely consequences include higher freight rates and insurance premiums in the Baltic, as well as regional price spikes for refined products such as diesel and heating oil due to supply chain reconfiguration. The most significant impact will be pressure on Russian fiscal receipts as throughput and netbacks fall. In the long term, markets may adapt through rerouting to Asia, but the real impact will depend on the duration and scope of EU/NATO measures. Baltic denial would mainly affect Russia’s western ports, such as Primorsk and Ust-Luga, which handle crude and refined exports for Europe and beyond. The greatest pressure on Russia will come if such measures are sustained over time.

Ultimately, Russia’s hybrid warfare and its revenue base must be targeted. A new, more proactive denial strategy in the Baltic, combined with Ukraine’s drone and missile strikes on Russian energy infrastructure, could deal a serious blow. Oil markets must factor not only supply–demand fundamentals but also the strategic decisions of European leaders and military actions on the ground.

YouTube to Pay $24.5 Million to Settle Trump Lawsuit

The Hollywood Reporter ^ | September 29, 2025 | Winston Cho

Posted on by nickcarraway

Most of the funds will go toward the construction of a $200 million ballroom at the White House. Other companies that have settled lawsuits from Trump include Meta, X and Disney's ABC.

Add YouTube to the list of tech and media companies to settle a lawsuit from President Trump after the start of his second term.

The Alphabet-owned company agreed to pay $24.5 million to resolve a lawsuit over the suspension of Trump’s account following a mob of his supporters attacking the U.S. Capitol in 2021, according to court papers filed on Monday.

Under the deal, $22 million will go toward a trust for the National Mall, the entity handling the construction of a $200 million ballroom at the White House. The remainder is earmarked for other plaintiffs in the case, including the American Conservative Union, Andrew Baggiani, Austen Fletcher, Maryse Veronica Jean-Louis, Frank Valentine, Kelly Victory and Naomi Wolf.

The agreement follows Meta and X earlier this year reaching deals to settle similar lawsuits challenging the suspensions of Trump’s accounts. Combined with settlements from other companies, including Disney’s ABC and Paramount’s CBS News, he’s made at least nearly $90 million, with much of the funds going toward his presidential library.

Trump alleged a violation of the First Amendment. Legal observers have noted that private companies have the right to deplatform individuals and that the tech firms were motivated to settle because of his return to office.

At the time, YouTube maintained that Trump violated its policy over inciting violence. It indefinitely suspended his account, allowing him back onto the platform in 2023 to allow “voters to hear equally from major national candidates in the run-up to an election.” Meta and X also reinstated Trump’s accounts.

A wrinkle in the case: Trump sought a court order of the unconstitutionality of Section 230, Big Tech’s favorite legal shield that has historically afforded companies significant legal protection from liability as third-party publishers. Such a finding could’ve crippled the operations of Google, Meta and X, among various others.

The settlement “shall not constitute an admission of liability or fault on the part” of YouTube, the Monday filing states. Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
