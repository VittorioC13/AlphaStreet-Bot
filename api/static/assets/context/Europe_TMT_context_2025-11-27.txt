[TITLE]Saudi Arabia's First Quantum Computer: Can It Break Bitcoin?:
[TEXT]
In brief Saudi Aramco installed the Kingdom’s first quantum computer, built by France-based Pasqal.

The 200-qubit system marked Saudi Arabia’s entry into the global quantum race.

Experts said current machines cannot yet break Bitcoin’s cryptography, but progress is accelerating.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Saudi Arabia has entered the global quantum computing race.

Saudi Aramco, the government-controlled energy and chemicals company, said Monday it has installed the Kingdom’s first quantum computer, in a move that adds to mounting security concerns for Bitcoin and other blockchain networks.

Aramco said the 200-qubit machine, built by Pasqal, a France-based neutral-atom quantum computing company, and installed at its Dhahran data center, has been designed for industrial applications such as energy modeling and materials research.

Pasqal said it is the most powerful system the company has delivered to date. A qubit, or quantum bit, is the basic unit of a quantum computer.

﻿

“The deployment of our most powerful quantum computer yet is a piece of history and a landmark for the Middle East’s quantum future,” Pasqal CEO Loïc Henriet said in a statement. “Pasqal continues its expansion, delivering practical quantum power to industry.”

Saudi Arabia’s move places it alongside governments in the U.S., China, the EU, the UK, Japan, India, and Canada that have funded national quantum programs intended to expand research infrastructure and train the workforce needed for future fault-tolerant systems.

Experts warn that if quantum machines ever become powerful enough, they could reveal private keys or forge signatures, allowing attackers to steal funds or crack privacy mechanisms. But just how real is that threat today?

A serious threat or a shot in the dark?

Yoon Auh, founder of Bolts Technologies, said rapid progress in quantum computing has forced security communities to take the threat seriously, amid “repeated jumps” in the technology.

“With so much effort and money going into this, breakthroughs are inevitable,” he told Decrypt. “Nobody knows when, but the threat is no longer theoretical. It still can’t break ECC or RSA today, but progress is steady.”

Auh said the motivation for nation-state investment extends beyond cryptanalysis.

“Quantum computing is the first technology that could become a global digital weapon not controlled by any political system,” he said.

Still, the research is some ways off from cracking systems like the one Bitcoin is built on.

According to research scientist Ian MacCormack, a 200-qubit system is small in practical terms, since current machines are limited by noise and short coherence times that restrict how many operations they can run.

“200 qubits is enough to do some interesting experiments and demonstrations, assuming the qubits are high quality, which is hard to do with even that few of them, but nowhere near enough to do error corrected computing of the sort you would need to run Shor's Algorithm,” he said, referring to the a quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer.

Progress ahead

In September, researchers at Caltech unveiled a neutral-atom system with 6,000 qubits.

However, even machines of that scale are still used for research, simulations, and algorithm development rather than for attacking cryptography.

“What you need is a very long coherence time compared to the duration of your operations,” Caltech graduate student Elie Bataille told Decrypt. “If your operations are one microsecond and you have a second of coherence time, that means you can do

[TITLE]Abaxx Exchange Granted Registration as a Foreign Board of Trade by U.S. CFTC, Enabling Direct Participation by U.S. Futures Firms:
[TEXT]
TORONTO, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abaxx Technologies Inc. (CBOE:ABXX)(OTCQX:ABXXF) (“Abaxx” or the “Company”), a financial software and market infrastructure company, majority shareholder of Abaxx Singapore Pte Ltd. (“Abaxx Singapore”), the owner of Abaxx Commodity Exchange and Clearinghouse (individually, “Abaxx Exchange” and “Abaxx Clearing”), and producer of the SmarterMarkets™ Podcast, today announced that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) has granted Abaxx Exchange registration as a Foreign Board of Trade (“FBOT”).

The registration permits U.S.-based futures commission merchants (FCMs), brokers, and trading firms to directly access Abaxx Exchange’s regulated markets for the first time, marking a significant milestone in the Company’s commercial expansion. With this designation, Abaxx’s physically-deliverable futures markets are now open to the world’s largest derivatives trading community, accelerating participation across the Company’s growing suite of benchmark contracts.

A New Access Point for Global Commodity Trade

Abaxx’s growing suite of centrally-cleared commodity futures and derivatives provides better price discovery and risk management tools for the commodities critical to the transition to a lower-carbon economy — spanning energy, environmental, battery materials, and precious metals markets.

Abaxx markets include the only physically-backed LNG forward curves currently trading in the global market; the only physically-deliverable, U.S. dollar-denominated gold kilobar futures contract based in Singapore; the first physically-deliverable, U.S. dollar-denominated lithium carbonate benchmarks outside China; and the first financially-settled contracts indexed to the utilization of installed wind capacity in Germany. Built around the realities of modern commodity trade, each Abaxx benchmark addresses practical challenges that today’s market participants face in price discovery, hedging, and risk management.

“FBOT registration positions Abaxx to bring direct U.S. participation into the commodity benchmarks of the energy transition,” said Joe Raia, Chief Commercial Officer at Abaxx Exchange. “With this access, U.S. commercial players can participate in benchmarks anchored in real physical trade flows — expanding participation and liquidity in Abaxx markets and extending smarter markets to the world’s largest futures trading community.”

“Our clients are increasingly seeking access to regulated venues that reflect the evolution of global commodity trade,” added Tom Anderson, SVP, Group CFO & COO at ADM Investor Services. “Abaxx’s FBOT registration provides an additional pathway for our U.S. participants to engage with those opportunities.”

“We welcome Abaxx Exchange’s Foreign Board of Trade registration and the access it provides our North American commodity futures clients to trade these new markets,” added Randall Fenlon, Global Co-Head of Energy, Commodities & Shipping at BGC Group.

Abaxx’s full suite of energy, environmental, battery materials and precious metals futures is available for trading from 1000 to 2400 SGT (14 hours), Monday to Friday, except for Singapore public holidays.

India Inc will remain "measured" on its investments despite the steady revenue growth in the December quarter, a domestic credit rating agency said on Tuesday. Icra said the industry will report a revenue growth of 8-10 per cent in the Q3 FY26, which is broadly in line with the 9.2 per cent year-on-year jump in the September quarter.From a profitability perspective, it said the operating profit margin (OPM) will show an improvement amid expectations of an upbeat demand as commodity prices soften compared to the year-ago period.However, the good show on the topline and bottom line may not necessarily lead to an uptick in the long-cherished private capex.Given the uncertain global environment and tariff-related ambiguity, Icra expects the private capex cycle to remain measured.It added that certain sectors, such as electronics, semiconductors, data centres and niche segments within the automotive space, like electric vehicles, will continue to see a scale-up in investments.The government capex is expected to support the overall investment activity in the economy, it said, adding that the headroom for investment growth is likely to be lower in H2 FY26 after the upfronting seen in H1.The US tariffs hit the textile sector as players chose to take the impact rather than passing on the pressures to customers, resulting in a profitability compression, the agency said.The healthy revenue growth in the December quarter is likely to be driven by festive demand and GST rationalisation, it added."Domestic rural demand remains resilient, and tailwinds like GST rate rationalisation, income tax relief announced during the Union Budget 2025, 1 percentage point interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India between February 2025 and November 2025, leading to lower borrowing costs and easing food inflation are expected to boost urban consumption," its co-group head for corporate ratings Kinjal Shah said.The ongoing geopolitical tensions and steep US tariffs continue to impact demand sentiments, especially for export-oriented sectors, such as agro-chemicals, textiles, auto and auto components, seafoods, cut and polished diamonds, and IT services, Shah added.In Q2, a seasonal slowdown in demand in the oil and gas, airlines and power sector and deferment of purchases in the consumer durables and FMCG sector amid expectations of a GST rate rationalisation led to a lower revenue growth of 2.5 per cent on a sequential basis.IT services companies faced growth challenges in constant currency terms, owing to cautious spending by US clients amid global uncertainties in the quarter, it said.The prolonged monsoon this year dampened the Q2 FY26 year-on-year revenue growth across several sectors like air conditioners, beer and value-added dairy products, it pointed out.

India and Israel have revived negotiations for a long-pending Free Trade Agreement (FTA), nearly a decade after the last formal talks stalled, with experts saying the emphasis should be on strategic collaboration rather than merchandise trade.The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) on Monday said that India–Israel trade remains modest, and the renewed push should focus on areas such as defence manufacturing, electronics, semiconductors, water and irrigation technology, precision agriculture, cybersecurity, and frontier R&D.“For both countries, therefore, the value of the renewed FTA effort lies less in merchandise trade and more in strategic cooperation -- in defence manufacturing, electronics, semiconductors, water and irrigation technology, precision agriculture, cybersecurity, and frontier R&D,” GTRI Founder Ajay Srivastava said.India and Israel first opened FTA talks in 2010 and held several rounds of discussions through 2012–13. However, the negotiations stalled after 2014 amid disagreements over tariffs, standards, and access for sensitive products.Following a series of high-level exchanges in 2024–25, the two governments have now finalised new Terms of Reference to relaunch negotiations. Last week, they formally inked these terms, signaling the restart of talks.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, after his visit to Israel from November 20–22, indicated that the FTA discussions may follow a two-phase approach: an initial package focused on tariff reductions for goods, followed by a broader agreement covering investment, technology transfer, defence, space, agri-tech, cybersecurity, AI, fintech, R&D, innovation, and drip-irrigation systems.Bilateral merchandise trade between India and Israel remains relatively small at $3.6 billion in FY2025.India’s exports to Israel totaled $2.1 billion, dominated by cut and polished diamonds ($555 million), rice ($102 million), organic chemicals ($96 million), ceramic tiles ($81 million), and aircraft parts ($54 million).Imports from Israel reached $1.5 billion, led by diamonds ($333 million), electronics ($350 million) -- including integrated circuits ($117 million) and electronic components ($66 million) -- as well as fertilisers ($135 million), insecticides ($63 million), and machinery ($91 million).GTRI noted that even with an FTA, Indian exports may struggle to expand significantly. Israel, a high-income, technology-driven market of under 10 million people, has limited demand for Indian mass-market products such as textiles, automobiles, and general engineering goods.In sectors where India is competitive -- agriculture, generics, steel, chemicals -- Israel is either self-sufficient, tightly regulated through quality and phytosanitary norms, or already extends tariff preferences to partners such as the EU and the US.This keeps Indian products at a structural disadvantage.“As a result, commerce remains concentrated in a few niche categories such as diamonds, rice, and ceramic tiles,” the GTRI brief said.The think tank stressed that the real value of the FTA lies in strategic collaboration. Beyond goods trade, the two countries are expected to deepen cooperation in defence manufacturing, electronics, semiconductors, water and irrigation technologies, precision agriculture, cybersecurity, and frontier R&D -- sectors where both nations have complementary strengths.With the renewed push, India–Israel economic ties are entering a phase where the focus is likely to shift from modest merchandise trade to broader strategic and technological collaboration, setting the stage for a more future-oriented partnership.

Despite the consolidation phase, Nifty is trading below its intrinsic value, says Nimesh Chandan , CIO of Bajaj Finserv Asset Management. He believes this undervaluation presents a strong entry point for investors, with earnings growth expected to accelerate in FY26–27. Chandan is bullish on BFSI consumption , pharma, chemicals, and home improvement as key sectors for generating alpha.The current equity market setup reflects a phase of consolidation, yet underlying fundamentals are improving. We are seeing an acceleration in economic growth; corporate earnings growth is improving; steps taken on the fiscal side and the monetary side are showing their impact on the demand or consumption side. We are likely to see higher capacity utilisation in the corporate sector, and that will encourage private capex. We hope that India will be able to sign a favourable trade agreement with the US and the EU and trigger a revival in exports too.While global uncertainties persist, with the combination of strong earnings momentum, resilient domestic demand, and bottom-up opportunities across large, mid, and small caps, we believe the markets are poised for an upcycle from here on.Over the past 12–14 months, the Indian equity market witnessed net selling by FIIs. There were multiple factors at play – a slowdown in corporate earnings, geopolitical issues, higher valuation comfort in some other emerging nations, and uncertainty around US trade tariffs. While the lack of AI-focused plays is one among these multiple reasons, we do not see it as a key deterrent of FII flows. India has always offered strong diversification to global portfolios due to its unique demographics, faster economic growth, and a diversified basket of high-quality businesses.After a substantial relative underperformance over the past 12–15 months versus the emerging market index, Indian markets now offer an improved growth-valuation dynamic for global investors. India presents a unique investment case today – strong growth prospects, robust balance sheets, and a stable government. As the emerging market bull cycle enters its next phase, a high-quality market like India should see a rebound in capital flows. A likely earnings upcycle in H2FY26 and FY27 could provide a further fillip.It is a fact that India is not seen as one of the pioneering nations in AI-related developments. However, it is too early to draw conclusions

[TITLE]Quad up for rare earths treasure hunt: Why India should be raring to take the lead:
[TEXT]
Till this summer, unless you were a nuclear physicist, a Cold War geek or a Scrabble champion, you may not have paid much heed to the seventeen tongue twisters, clubbed as rare earth elements (REE), sitting at the bottom of the periodic table.Since then, interests in the exotic minerals have exploded globally with Beijing turning them into ammunition for economic statecraft. The world has woken up to the exclusivity and unseen foundational role minerals like neodymium, dysprosium, samarium, lutetium, yttrium (among others) plays in today’s modern global economy -- key raw material for making super-strong, permanent heat-resistant magnets that run every motor in the world. From cars to fighter jets, smart phones, robots, weapons, wind turbines, semiconductors, MRI machines and microwaves. Indian policymaking desperately needs to catch up.A cascade of billion-dollar deals, diplomatic détentes, government interventions including that of Pentagon , cross border partnerships, private sector investments from companies as diverse as Apple to Daido Steel to European engineering colossus ABB and Honda are fast transforming the once slumbering global critical minerals industry. The US and several of its allies in Europe, Asia and Australia believe such ramp up will act as a bulwark against China’s aggressive efforts to ringfence production and curb exports that threatened to shutter key factories around the world, including auto -- the largest manufacturing sector in most advanced economies – and even brought President Donald Trump to heel on his belligerent trade war and tariff tirades.The quotidian magnet has suddenly found its way alongside oil, microchips, steel and vaccines in the great geopolitical chess board.But seven months since the Chinese choke, New Delhi’s Rs 7,300 crore PLI scheme to catalyse the home grown REE industry is still being finalised. Not a single rupee has reached Indian factories. In comparison, just last week, MP Materials, which operates the sole American rare earths mine joined forces with the US Department of War and Saudi state mining company to build a rare earth refinery in the Gulf kingdom. Pentagon that invested a landmark $400 m in the miner will further dial up to fund the new JV despite a 49% stake in lieu of supplies for the country’s manufacturing and defence industries.In this new resource war, India’s inertia is especially jarring. The US Rare Earth Magnet Security Act is offering powerful tax credits and direct investments, while the Pentagon is underwriting production with hundreds of millions in grants, offtake agreements, and strategic stockpiling to sever Chinese dependence. Canada, Japan and Australia, with direct US government support, are racing to launch new mines, magnet plants, accelerating capacity and supply chain independence. They are extending “friend-shoring” offers to India to build alternative supply chains outside China’s control. Without fast and decisive action, we will be excluded from these newer realignments.Australia has heavy REs, but not much of a magnet making industry yet. We have the lighter ones. Indian state miner Indian Rare Earths Ltd (IREL) produces 1,300–1,500 tons of neodymium oxide annually, though current government projections aim to scale output ninefold by 2027. But this oxide is of little use without the essential metallization and magnetization capacity as I have argued in an earlier piece. The US has a large market, desperate to stand on its own feet but its own mining sector has whittled away its early technological edge after decades of political apathy. Japan can step in to fill that vacuum. In the last 50 years, outside of China, companies like Hitachi Metals (Protereal), TDK or Shin-Etsu Chemicals have excelled in their RE magnet making prowess. Japan’s domestic industry was itself born out of a crisis with a supply squeeze from China in 2010 after a maritime spat involving the two neighbours -- riding piggyback on our critical minerals by sourcing from Indian Rare Earth Ltd (IREL).Everyone benefits if the four collaborate to accelerate timelines and reduce risk by incentivising technology transfer and global JVs for magnet making, R&D into advanced grades, newer breakthroughs that do not rely on REs and recycling. Our low cost manufacturing can produce for the home market and for the world. Is there a better way to resuscitate the QUAD alliance in today’s fractured, Trumpian world?In June our carmakers – amongst the hardest hit by the export controls – were in hyperdrive trying to secure alternate supplies as many of their component vendors were staring at the last leg of inventory. Mid- November, most have tempered down their anguish but reality on ground is starkly different. Since summer, only four export licenses have been approved for magnet volumes representing less than 5% of the 3,600 tons India imported in FY2025. Bottomline: Our manufacturers must still make do with threadbare supplies, risking technological obsolescence. By assembling products that are two decades behind the global curve our export aspirations are on the verge of collapse, as the single most critical technology input is effectively unavailable or priced out. By insisting on a convoluted process requiring self-declarations and compliance verifications, Beijing wants our crippling dependence to continue. Perhaps it makes strategic sense, at least for the short term, to have mandatory domestic offtake procurement of RE magnets for some of our priority sectors like auto and defence. Nothing stops China to lift the ban and flood the market with cheap imports and kill competition, the moment they sense new competition. If they have weaponised trade and undercut tariffs, our pushbacks cannot just be lip service.Back in 1992, Deng Xiaoping publicly announced his intentions to make REE “the oil of China.” Since then, their iron grip on the entire value chain -- through the templated state backed blend of low-cost production, extraction, cornering of global supplies/mines, lax environmental rules, cheap loans and export limits -- has helped to price out competition and entrench their global dominance. Their indices set the price of the raw materials for the world, making trade opaque and illiquid, curbing miners’ ability to hedge against price volatility in a market that at $5.6 billion in 2024, was 33 times smaller than copper and smallest among all industrial metals as per Goldman Sachs estimates. Australia is breaking free from Chinese hegemony over raw material pricing. We should too.India’s PLI scheme with a target capacity of up to 6,000 tonnes/year plans to offer has deeper structural problems as well, argues industry players in private. The proposed 15% capex subsidy is insufficient, because government cost estimates wrongly assume Chinese equipment imports, which have become impossible. Equivalent Japanese or German machinery is 40–60% pricier, leaving most Indian industrial groups unwilling to invest without a far higher subsidy. Even the US is giving a $30/kg subsidy to match Chinese pricing. Policy must reflect the true cost to galvanize meaningful domestic production. Post Cabinet approval, it will also take at least a quarter for application invites, another 15–18 months for capital equipment (mostly non-Chinese, far more expensive), and years of construction. Best case: the 1st Indian-made rare earth magnet is ready around late 2027. Delay or timidity is turning our opportunity into vulnerability as alternatives are being rebuilt around purposeful policymaking. We should be raring to go and secure our place in the next industrial revolution.

[TITLE]UK government commits GBP 6.9 million to boost satellite communications sector:
[TEXT]
UK government commits GBP 6.9 million to boost satellite communications sector

by Sophie Jenkins

London, UK (SPX) Nov 25, 2025

The UK Space Agency has announced a GBP 6.9 million investment to accelerate the development of next-generation satellite technologies. The new funding, delivered through the European Space Agency's ARTES programme, supports five efforts led by UK organisations and aims to expand the nation's role in innovative space communications.

Projects selected for funding span a range of applications, from satellite refuelling and logistics to advanced 5G and optical communication systems. These initiatives are part of the UK's strategy to strengthen capabilities in satellite communications, positioning, navigation and timing, in-orbit servicing, space domain awareness, and the use of space data for Earth applications.

The European satellite industry is projected to generate GBP 40 billion in revenue by 2033. The UK could secure up to GBP 800 million from just 2% of this market.

Space Minister Liz Lloyd emphasized that "Space technology and especially satellites, are essential to our daily lives. From the sat nav in your car to your mobile phone, from weather forecasts to your online banking - space is where it all happens.

By backing our UK sector, we're not only cementing our position as a European space leader - we're creating high-skilled jobs, attracting investment, and ensuring space technologies can connect communities to the space-enabled services they need."

Among the funded projects, Orbit Fab will carry out the Advancing Satcom Technology with Refuelling and Logistics (ASTRAL) programme, receiving GBP 2.9 million in total and GBP 1.3 million for its initial phase from ESA. The project will demonstrate UK-developed technology for refuelling electric propulsion satellites, which extends mission lifetimes and improves satellite manoeuvrability.

Cornwall's Goonhilly Earth Station will lead the AGILE project to develop Antenna Ground Interface and LunaNet Equipment. With GBP 1.6 million in funding, the initiative will create units allowing global antennas to communicate directly with lunar spacecraft via the LunaNet specification, supporting the growing wave of lunar missions.

Vicinity Technologies is awarded GBP 1.19 million to design 5G Non-Terrestrial Network payloads and user terminals for its Satellite Access Networks project. The group will build the full software stack for both space and ground segments, intended to provide reliable internet access in underserved and urban areas.

A GBP 356,000 grant goes to Archangel Lightworks for the Space Optical Link Integration Study (SOLIS). In collaboration with Eutelsat, the team will assess the deployment of Free Space Optical Communications within the Eutelsat OneWeb LEO network, aiming for faster, higher-capacity data transmission.

Inmarsat Navigation Ventures Ltd (Viasat UK) will receive GBP 881,000 to develop the International Virtual Satellite Operators Network (Phase 2). This service is designed for governments to plan, procure, and manage secure satellite communications across multiple providers.

UK Space Agency Chief Executive Dr Paul Bate highlighted that "Today's investment shows how the UK's space ambitions translate into real-world impact. By advancing satellite communications technology, we're not only building a globally competitive sector but also ensuring that communities - even in the most remote corners of the UK - can access the services they need. This is space delivering for people and powering our future economy."

The new ARTES projects, in partnership with businesses, universities, and research centres, are expected to stimulate high-skilled employment and deliver tangible advances in weather prediction, communications, and security.

Laurent Jaffart, Director of ESA's Connectivity and Secure Communications, commented, "ESA is committed to supporting a vibrant and striving telecommunications ecosystem in Europe, while achieving a zero-debris environment in space. This milestone, with support from the UK Space Agency, will further strengthen the European autonomy and sovereignty that we are collectively striving for with our Member States."

Dr Colin Baldwin, Executive Director of the UKspace Trade Association, remarked, "UKspace's Satellite Telecommunications Committee, run jointly with techUK, has made a strong case that our industry has the expertise, technology and talent to capture a significant portion of the global satellite communications market over the coming decade.

We are delighted to see so many of our member companies benefiting from and taking advantage of the UK Space Agency's investment in the ARTES programme at the ESA Council of Ministers meeting in 2022 continuing to develop new innovations which will help to achieve this goal."

The funding comes ahead of the ESA Ministerial Council in Bremen, where the UK's investment in future European space activities and economic growth will be decided. Independent analysis indicates that every GBP 1 invested in ESA produces GBP 7.49 in direct economic benefits for the UK.

In addition to ESA programmes, the UK space sector now benefits from expanded national funding, with GBP 2.8 billion allocated to the UK Space Agency through 2029/30.

Mumbai: India has seen record investments in subsea cable connectivity, with four out of seven major subsea networks now landing in the country, said Carl Grivner, chief executive, FLAG , one of the world's largest independent subsea network operators.FLAG, backed by UK-based private equity firm 3i Group, operates systems linking Mumbai to Singapore, and Chennai to Singapore which entailed total investments of $20 million."We have plans to invest approximately $40 million in several key initiatives and projects, including Indian terrestrial routes, new investments between India to Malaysia/Singapore, and are exploring cable landing party opportunities," Grivner told ET. "In addition to our ILD (international long distance) licence, we're applying to expand our licence footprint to better meet customer demand," he added.As global concerns rise over subsea cable security and redundancy, Grivner stressed the need for diverse and redundant routes to mitigate outages like those in the Red Sea.FLAG plans to diversify its network mix from 90% subsea and 10% terrestrial to 60% subsea and 40% terrestrial in the coming years, building land-based extensions through Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Turkey among markets to bypass volatile maritime zones.Grivner, an infrastructure sector veteran and former CEO of London's Colt Technologies, believes that India's rising middle class and hyperscaler-led data centre boom are fuelling demand for high-capacity, low-latency links."We're talking gigawatts of data centre capacity now, and that demands massive connectivity both within and beyond India," he said.Grivner also urged greater private equity participation in the subsea ecosystem, which could boost efforts by telecom companies and hyperscalers like Google and Meta. FLAG, which plans further investments in India and Asia, is also exploring edge data centres to serve the low-latency demands of AI-driven applications.On policy measures for supporting India's connectivity, Grivner said, "I'm very encouraged to see that the DoT (Department of Telecommunications) has become far more open and progressive in the last four-five years. And I would suggest them to continue opening this market with new participants."FLAG has full ownership of the cables FNAL, FA-1, FEA, HAWK and FALCON, and investments in other India-to- Asia and European paths. FLAG has also made an initial investment in a new Trans-Pacific cable and intends to make further investment announcements in the future, Grivner said.In April this year, FLAG secured a $340 million refinancing deal from Apterra, Barclays, CIBC, DNB, HSBC, NAB, and NatWest to support growth and expansion, including investments in subsea cable network upgrades, edge data centres, and cable landing stations.In December 2024, the company committed $34 million investment to secure new capacity on the India-Asia-Xpress and India-Europe-Xpress cable systems, which also saw an investment from Reliance Jio.

[TITLE]Why the world must wake up to China’s science leadership:
[TEXT]
Two conversations have stayed with me over the past 25 years. Around 2001, a European Union official in Beijing — where I was then a UK diplomat — told a group of us that the reason countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom were allowing technology transfer to China was to see a day when the nation could return the favour. And, in 2017 in Austria, a retired UK security official stated wearily that if there was one constant in policymaking towards China, it was to perpetually be five to ten years behind the times.

How China can become a biotechnology superpower

Those points resonate in 2025. China has become an important player in research and development (R&D). Yet, most of the outside world has still not woken up to this fact.

On 23 October, China’s Communist Party announced that, for the next five years, it will focus on “high-quality development” with “innovation as the fundamental driving force”. This will require, it says, “substantial improvements in scientific and technological self-reliance and strength” (see go.nature.com/4ahcvj8). Policymakers should take this statement seriously for three reasons.

First, China has an incentive. At a meeting a few days later, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump agreed to halt their tariff wars and trade skirmishes. But China knows that its technological dependence on the United States and others is a vulnerability, and that it needs to become autonomous.

Second, it is not just words but hard cash that the Chinese government is committing to achieving its goals. The nation’s R&D investments increased nearly sixfold between 2007 and 2023, overtaking the EU’s and coming close to US figures (see go.nature.com/4a2xres). The latest plans indicate that this trend is set to continue.

Chinese scientists increasingly lead joint projects with the UK, US and Europe

And third, China has the human capital, too. In 2020, the nation produced 3.6 million graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), compared with 2.6 million in India and 820,000 in the United States (see go.nature.com/4ppekyx). And, in 2022, some 50,000 people in China graduated with STEM PhDs, compared with 34,000 in the United States (see go.nature.com/4iedi4z). China’s leading universities, including Fudan in Shanghai and Tsinghua in Beijing, rank highly on global lists.

Over the past half-century, China’s development was achieved mainly by 250 million labourers moving from rural areas to urban ones, making the country the ‘factory of the world’. By contrast, going forwards, it will be young Chinese scientists who will drive progress.

A powerful example is the unexpected January release of DeepSeek, an app based on artificial intelligence developed by a 200-strong technology company in Hangzhou. Despite criticism that DeepSeek has a lower capacity than other AI models, the firm’s proof that China could produce its own AI systems provided a powerful symbolic moment.

How provinces and cities can sustain US–China climate cooperation

Chinese leaders admit that their country has a long way to go. But it would take a brave person to dismiss China’s chance of achieving its goal of becoming a technological superpower by 2035. That is why it is important for other governments to engage with China effectively.

[TITLE]Data Centers, AI, and Energy: Everything You Need to Know:
[TEXT]
The primary bottleneck for AI expansion has shifted from power generation to physical infrastructure, with long lead times for grid upgrades, a global transformer shortage, and geopolitical vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chain (copper, lithium, rare earth elements) creating acute risks.

Despite major tech companies' net-zero pledges, the sheer velocity of the AI buildout forces a reliance on reliable baseload power from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas through 2030, with nuclear power viewed as the long-term, carbon-free solution.

The exponential energy demand of AI-driven data centers, particularly from high-performance accelerated servers (GPUs and ASICs), is rapidly outpacing global energy efficiency trends, leading to a projected doubling of data center electricity consumption by 2030.

For the past decade, the defining narrative of the global energy sector has been the transition of supply. Governments, utilities, and investors have focused almost exclusively on shifting generation assets from fossil fuels to renewables, retiring coal plants in favor of wind farms and solar arrays....

The narrative for the next decade, however, is currently being rewritten by a structural shift in demand that few predicted would happen this quickly: the exponential rise of the data center.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) transitions from theoretical models in research labs to wide-scale commercial deployment, data centers have evolved. They are no longer passive warehouses for email storage and website hosting; they are now active, energy-intensive industrial engines. These facilities have become the "refineries" of the digital age, processing raw data into economic value, and in doing so, they are exerting unprecedented pressure on electricity grids, water resources, and critical mineral supply chains.

The implications for the energy market are profound. We are witnessing a collision between the digital economy's exponential growth curve and the physical economy's linear constraints. This guide provides a comprehensive analysis of how data centers utilize resources, the specific energy mixes powering them across different geopolitical regions, and the systemic risks posed by the integration of hyperscale compute infrastructure with legacy power grids.

Part I: The Anatomy of Consumption

To understand the macro-level impact of the sector on global energy markets, it is necessary to first understand the micro-level physics of the data center itself. These facilities are complex aggregations of IT equipment, environmental controls, and power management systems, each with distinct energy profiles that contribute to the total load.

From CPU to GPU and Custom Silicon

The fundamental driver of increasing energy density is the changing nature of the silicon chip. For decades, the industry relied on Central Processing Units (CPUs) for general-purpose computing. While powerful, CPUs operate within a relatively predictable energy envelope. The rise of Generative AI has necessitated a wholesale shift toward "accelerated servers."

The GPU Explosion

The initial phase of the AI infrastructure buildout has been defined by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). To understand the energy implications, one must understand the architecture. A traditional CPU is designed to do a few complex tasks very quickly in sequence. A GPU, conversely, is designed to do thousands of simple mathematical tasks simultaneously. Since AI training is effectively one giant matrix multiplication problem, the GPU is exponentially more efficient at the task than a CPU.

However, this computational density comes at a severe thermodynamic cost. As the industry packs more transistors onto silicon wafers to process larger models, the power draw per chip has skyrocketed. We have moved from an era of "general purpose" computing to "high-performance" computing, where energy consumption is the primary constraint on performance.

The market for these high-performance chips is currently dominated by a few key players driving the energy intensity of the sector:

Nvidia H100 "Hopper": Currently the industry standard for AI training. A single H100 chip can consume up to 700 watts at peak utilization. When installed in a server rack of 8 to 16 GPUs, the power density exceeds anything legacy data centers were built to handle.

Nvidia B200 "Blackwell": The next-generation architecture. It promises massive performance gains but raises the thermal stakes significantly, with a single chip capable of drawing up to 1,200 watts.

AMD Instinct MI300X: The primary competitor to Nvidia, offering high-density memory configurations that also require significant power and cooling infrastructure.

The deployment of these chips is fundamentally altering the physical requirements of the data center building. A legacy server rack typically draws 5 to 10 kilowatts (kW) of power. A modern rack packed with Blackwell or H100 GPUs can draw between 50 and 100 kW.

This tenfold increase in power density forces a transition from air cooling (fans blowing over metal heatsinks) to liquid cooling. Air is simply not a dense enough medium to carry away the waste heat generated by a 100kW rack. Consequently, the next generation of data centers is being plumbed like industrial chemical plants, with coolant loops running directly to the silicon die to prevent thermal throttling.

The Hyperscaler Rebellion

As energy constraints tighten and power costs rise, the major technology giants—the "Hyperscalers"—are seeking to reduce their dependence on general-purpose GPUs. While GPUs are excellent for AI, they still include legacy graphics logic that AI models do not need. This "silicon bloat" equates to wasted watts.

To solve this, companies are evolving toward Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These are custom chips designed from the ground up to do exactly one thing: run neural networks. By stripping away general-purpose features, these chips achieve significantly higher performance per watt, allowing data center operators to get more compute out of the same grid connection.

The major players have all launched proprietary silicon strategies:

Google (TPU): Google’s Tensor Processing Units are the veterans of this space. The latest 6th-generation "Trillium" TPU is explicitly engineered for energy efficiency, offering a 67% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the previous generation.

AWS (Trainium & Inferentia): Amazon Web Services has bifurcated its silicon. Trainium is built for the heavy lift of training models, while Inferentia is designed for the low-cost, low-energy task of "inference" (running the model for end-users).

Microsoft (Maia): Microsoft has introduced the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator, custom-designed to run large language models on the Azure cloud. It features a unique "sidekick" liquid cooling setup that fits into existing data center footprints.

Meta (MTIA): The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator is designed specifically for Meta's recommendation algorithms, optimizing for the specific math heavily used in social media ranking rather than generative text.

This shift toward ASICs represents the industrialization of AI. Just as the automotive industry moved from general workshops to specialized assembly lines, the data center industry is moving from general-purpose servers to specialized AI pods.

These custom chips allow Hyperscalers to decouple their growth from the broader supply chain constraints of the merchant GPU market. More importantly, they allow for a holistic system design. Because Google designs the TPU, the server rack, the cooling loop, and the data center shell, they can optimize the cooling flow to match the exact thermal profile of the chip, squeezing out efficiency gains that are impossible with off-the-shelf hardware.

Beyond the Silicon Limit

Looking further ahead, the industry recognizes that even custom silicon has a physical limit. As transistors shrink to the size of atoms, electrical resistance creates heat that cannot be easily mitigated. To break this energy curve, R&D labs are exploring exotic architectures that abandon traditional electronics entirely.

Two specific technologies are currently moving from theory to prototype:

Silicon Photonics: Current chips use copper wires to move data. Copper has resistance, which generates heat. Companies like Lightmatter and Ayar Labs are replacing copper with light (photons). Light generates virtually no heat compared to electricity and travels faster, potentially solving the data movement energy bottleneck that currently plagues large clusters.

Neuromorphic Computing: Traditional computers separate memory and processing, wasting energy moving data back and forth (the Von Neumann bottleneck). Neuromorphic chips are designed to mimic the human brain’s architecture, using "spiking neural networks" where processing and memory happen in the same location. These promise orders-of-magnitude reductions in power for specific sensory processing tasks.

This architectural pivot from CPU to accelerated silicon—and eventually to photonics—is not merely a technical detail; it is creating a two-speed energy market. The "old" internet of email and web hosting will continue to run on efficient, low-growth CPU servers. The "new" economy of AI will run on power-hungry accelerated infrastructure.

According to 2024 data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), this split is already visible in the data. Conventional servers are projected to see electricity consumption grow at a modest rate of 9 percent annually. In stark contrast, electricity consumption for accelerated servers (GPUs, TPUs, and ASICs) is projected to grow by 30 percent annually. By 2030, these accelerated servers will account for almost half of the net increase in global data center electricity consumption.

The Breakdown of Power Usage

A data center’s electricity consumption is distributed across five primary categories. Understanding this breakdown is critical for investors and analysts trying to identify where efficiency gains—and energy wastes—are located.

Source: IEA

Servers: Servers account for approximately 60 percent of total demand in a modern facility. This is the electricity actually doing the "work" of computation. As chip density increases, this percentage is rising relative to auxiliary systems, meaning the grid is becoming more directly coupled to the computational workload. When an AI model is training, the load is constant and high; when it is idle, it drops. This variability introduces new challenges for grid operators accustomed to steady industrial loads.

Cooling and Environmental Control: Cooling represents the single largest variable in data center efficiency, accounting for anywhere between 7 percent and 30 percent of total electricity intake. This massive variance highlights a divided market.

"Hyperscale" data centers—those massive campuses owned by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft—utilize advanced techniques to keep cooling demands near that 7 percent floor. They employ hot-aisle containment, free-air cooling, and increasingly, direct-to-chip liquid cooling. The shift to TPUs and high-end GPUs has made water cooling a necessity rather than a luxury, as air alone can no longer dissipate the heat generated by modern silicon.

In contrast, smaller enterprise data centers and legacy facilities are far less efficient. Many of these older facilities burn up to 30 percent of their total electricity intake just fighting the laws of thermodynamics, using energy-intensive air conditioners to keep servers from overheating. This sector is also the primary driver of water usage in data centers.

Storage, Network, and Infrastructure: The remainder of the power wedge is split between storage systems (5 percent), network equipment like switches and routers (5 percent), and general infrastructure like lighting and physical security. While individually small, the sheer volume of data being retained for AI training datasets means that storage energy demands are growing in absolute terms.

This internal distribution of energy—heavily weighted toward the silicon itself—explains why the industry is so focused on chip efficiency. Every watt saved at the server level cascades through the system, reducing the need for cooling, power distribution, and backup infrastructure. However, as the breakdown illustrates, the "low hanging fruit" of cooling efficiency has largely been harvested by the hyperscalers. The next frontier of efficiency gains must come from the compute load itself.

Ultimately, understanding the micro-level physics of the server rack is only the first step. While an individual GPU or TPU is a marvel of engineering, the aggregation of millions of these chips into global fleets creates a macro-economic force. The efficiency gains at the chip level are currently being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of deployment, leading us from the physics of the rack to the physics of the grid.

To grasp the full impact on global energy markets, we must move beyond the walls of the facility and look at the aggregate demand these components are placing on national power systems. The internal struggle between heat and compute is now spilling over into a global struggle for capacity.

Part II: The Scale of Demand

Data centers currently occupy a relatively small niche in global energy usage compared to heavy industry or transportation, but their growth velocity is outpacing almost every other sector in the global economy.

Current Baseline and Future Trajectories

In 2024, global data centers consumed an estimated 415 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. To put that in perspective, 415 TWh is roughly equivalent to the total annual electricity consumption of France. This represents approximately 1.5% of global electricity consumption. While this figure may appear marginal to the casual observer, the rate of change indicates a looming crunch.

Over the last five years, consumption has grown at 12 percent annually. Looking forward to 2030, the IEA projects this demand to accelerate, outlining three distinct scenarios that market watchers should monitor.

The Base Case: In the most likely scenario, global electricity consumption for data centers is projected to double, reaching roughly 945 TWh by 2030. In this future, the sector would consume just under 3 percent of the world’s total electricity. This doubling in just six years would require the addition of power generation capacity roughly equivalent to the entire current grid of Germany.

The "Lift-Off" Case: This scenario assumes that current supply chain constraints are resolved rapidly and that AI adoption accelerates unchecked by regulation or economics. Under these conditions, demand could surge to 1,700 TWh by 2035—consuming nearly 4.5 percent of the world's electricity. This would place data centers on par with the energy footprint of the entire country of India.

The Headwinds Case: Conversely, if technical bottlenecks, geopolitical fracturing, or slow AI adoption prevail, demand may plateau around 700 TWh. Even in this conservative view, the sector remains a massive industrial consumer, but one that stays below 2 percent of global demand.

The Carbon Footprint

Beyond raw electricity usage, the carbon implications are significant. Today, data centers account for roughly 180 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 emissions annually, which is roughly 0.5% of global energy-related emissions. While this is currently lower than aviation or shipping, the trajectory is steeper.

If the "Lift-Off" scenario comes to pass, these emissions could rise to 1.4% of the global total. While hyperscalers are offsetting this with renewable purchases, the "location-based" emissions (the actual carbon emitted by the local grid powering the facility) often remain higher than the "market-based" emissions (the net figure after offsets). This discrepancy is key for ESG investors: a data center in a coal-heavy region like Inner Mongolia or West Virginia has a physical carbon footprint that no amount of paper credits can fully erase.

The End of the Efficiency Era

Regardless of which scenario plays out, the trajectory is undeniable: the digital economy is decoupling from the energy efficiency trends of the past decade. For years, global data center energy use remained relatively flat even as internet traffic exploded, thanks to massive improvements in server efficiency and cloud consolidation. That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends. Unlike electric vehicles, which distribute load across millions of endpoints and can charge during off-peak hours, data centers are concentrated, baseload consumers. A single hyperscale campus can consume as much power as a mid-sized city, demanding that power 24/7 with zero tolerance for intermittency. This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Contextualizing the Surge

That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition, creating a wedge of new demand that the grid was not built to accommodate.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends.

This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Part III: The Energy Mix and Carbon Reality

There is a significant divergence between the stated decarbonization goals of major technology companies and the physical reality of the grids powering their facilities. Most hyperscalers have aggressive "Net Zero" targets, often aiming to run on 100% carbon-free energy by 2030. However, the physical electrons flowing into their servers largely come from fossil fuels and will likely continue to do so through the medium term due to the mechanics of baseload power.

1. Coal

Despite global efforts to phase out coal, it remains the silent workhorse of the digital economy. Coal is currently the largest single source of electricity for data centers globally, accounting for approximately 30 percent of the sector's power.

This reliance is heavily skewed by geography, specifically China. As the world's second-largest market for data infrastructure, China derives nearly 70 percent of its data center power from coal. However, even in Western markets, the baseload requirements of data centers often necessitate reliance on grid mixes that still contain coal generation, particularly during periods of low renewable output. The IEA projects that while coal's share will eventually decline, it will remain a critical pillar of supply until at least 2035, challenging the "green" narrative of the AI revolution.

2. Natural Gas

Natural gas currently meets 26 percent of global data center demand, but its role is arguably more critical than the raw percentage suggests. Gas is expected to be a primary beneficiary of the AI boom in the short term, particularly in North America.

Data centers operate on a standard of "five nines" (99.999%) of reliability. A power outage is not an inconvenience; it is a catastrophic financial event. Intermittent renewables like wind and solar cannot yet provide this level of uptime without massive battery storage, which is not yet deployed at sufficient scale. Consequently, natural gas serves as the dispatchable generation source of choice.

In the United States, natural gas is already the largest fuel source for data centers, accounting for over 40 percent of demand. Between 2024 and 2030, natural gas and coal combined are expected to meet over 40 percent of the additional electricity demand generated by data centers. For natural gas investors, the data center boom represents a new, durable source of industrial demand that is largely price-insensitive.

Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. In this edition….Gemini 3 puts Google at the top of the AI leaderboards…the White House delays an Executive Order banning state level AI regulation…TSMC sues a former exec now at Intel…Google Research develops a new, post-Transformer AI architecture…OpenAI is pushing user engagement despite growing evidence that some users develop harmful dependencies and delusions after prolonged chatbot interactions.

I spent last week at the Fortune Innovation Forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where I moderated several panel discussions around AI and its impacts. Among the souvenirs that I came back from KL with was a newfound appreciation for the extent to which businesses outside the U.S. and Europe really want to build on open source AI models and the extent to which they are gravitating to open source models from China.

[TITLE]Why the GenAI Infrastructure Boom May Break Historical Patterns:
[TEXT]
Authored by Mihir Kshirsagar

Observers invoke railroad, electricity, and telecom precedents when contextualizing the current generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) infrastructure boom—usually to debate whether or when we are heading for a crash. But these discussions miss an important pattern that held across all three prior cycles: when the bubbles burst, investors lost money but society gained lasting benefits. The infrastructure enabled productivity gains that monopolistic owners could not fully capture. Investors lost, but society won.

GenAI threatens to break this pattern. Whether or not the bubble bursts as many anticipate, we may not get the historical consolation prize. There are two reasons to doubt that GenAI will follow this trend:

First, as I discuss in my prior post, the chips powering today’s systems have short-asset lives compared to the decades-long life of infrastructure of past cycles. Companies are also actively pursuing software optimization techniques that could dramatically shrink hardware requirements. In either case, the infrastructure that is left behind after a correction is not likely to become a cheap commodity for future growth.

Second, the current market is shaped by hyperscaler-led coalitions that enable surplus extraction at multiple layers. As I discuss below, the usage-based API pricing captures application value, information asymmetry enables direct competition with customers, and coalition structures subordinate model developers to infrastructure owners. If productivity gains materialize at scale, these rent extraction capabilities may enable hyperscalers to realize the revenues that justify infrastructure investment—something past infrastructure owners could not do. But whether through sustained profitability or post-bust consolidation, the structural conditions that enabled broad diffusion of benefits in past cycles are absent.

Now, there are some countervailing considerations. The research and development supporting open-weight models might be a source for productivity gains to be spread more broadly, and could even serve as the “stranded assets” that enable future innovation if the bubble bursts. But the regulatory environment needs to support such initiatives.

Railroads

The railroad industry consolidated dramatically after the Panic of 1873. By the early 1900s, seven financial groups controlled two-thirds of the nation’s railroad mileage. J.P. Morgan’s syndicate reorganized bankrupt roads into the Southern Railway and consolidated eastern trunk lines. Edward Harriman controlled the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific systems. James J. Hill dominated northern routes through the Great Northern and Northern Pacific. This concentration raised serious antitrust concerns—the Sherman Act was passed in 1890 largely in response to railroad monopoly power.

But even with consolidation, railroad owners still struggled to pay their debts because the infrastructure’s economic benefits were dispersed across the economy and did not flow back directly to the owners. Richard Hornbeck and Martin Rotemberg’s important work shows how at the aggregate level when economies have input distortions—misallocated labor, capital stuck in less productive uses, frictions in resource allocation—the railroad infrastructure can generate substantial economy-wide productivity gains. These gains persisted over decades regardless of which financial group controlled the local rail lines. Farmers in Iowa shipping grain to Chicago paid freight rates, but the productivity improvements from market access—crop specialization, mechanization investments justified by larger markets, fertilizer access—stayed with the agricultural sector.

The infrastructure that enabled these gains had useful lives measured in decades. Railroad tracks laid in the 1880s remained economically viable into the 1920s and beyond. Rolling stock, locomotives, and terminal facilities similarly had useful lives of twenty to forty years. When railroads consolidated, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling agricultural productivity gains. The consolidation was anticompetitive, but the economic benefits didn’t concentrate entirely with the infrastructure owners.

Three structural constraints, beginning with the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but only effectively imposed nearly two decades later, limited railroad owners from capturing the economic surplus generated by their investments. First, bound by common carrier obligations, railroads charged fixed rates for shipping based on weight and distance, not a share of crop value. The railroad recovered infrastructure costs plus a margin, but could not discriminate based on agricultural productivity. Second, railroads had no visibility into which farms were most productive, or which crops were most profitable beyond what could be inferred from shipping volumes. As a result, they could not observe and selectively advantage their own agricultural ventures. Third, railroads faced substantial barriers to entering agriculture; directly operating farms required different expertise, capital, and management than operating rail networks. Now, railroads did try to move upstream, but regulatory actions prevented them from extending their dominant position.

Electricity

Samuel Insull built a utility empire in the 1920s that collapsed spectacularly in 1932, taking over $2 billion in investor wealth with it (nearly $50 billion today). The subsequent restructuring produced regional utility monopolies—by the 1940s, electricity generation and distribution were recognized as natural monopolies requiring either public ownership or regulated private provision. This consolidation was problematic enough that Congress passed the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935 to break up remaining utility combinations.

Despite the market correction, the generating plants and transmission infrastructure built in the 1920s and 1930s had useful lives of forty to fifty years. Even as utility ownership consolidated into regional monopolies, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling manufacturing productivity gains that utilities sold electricity to but couldn’t capture surplus from.

Cheap electricity transformed American manufacturing in ways the utilities could not fully capture. Paul David’s foundational work on the “dynamo problem” shows that electrification enabled factory reorganization—moving from centralized steam power with belt drives to distributed electric motors allowed flexible factory layouts, continuous-process manufacturing, and eventually assembly-line production. Manufacturing productivity gains from electrification were substantial and persistent, but utilities sold kilowatt-hours at regulated rates. They could not price discriminate based on which manufacturers were most innovative or extract ongoing surplus from manufacturing productivity improvements.

The constraints preventing electric utilities from capturing the surplus paralleled railroads in important respects, and were also eventually imposed through regulation. Utilities charged volumetric rates for electricity consumed, not a share of manufacturing output. A factory paid based on kilowatt-hours used, whether it was producing innovative products or commodity goods. Regulation eventually standardized rate structures, limiting even the ability to price discriminate across customer classes. Utilities had minimal visibility into how electricity was being used productively—they knew aggregate consumption but couldn’t observe which production processes were most valuable. And while some utilities did integrate forward into consumer appliances to stimulate residential demand, this was primarily
