[TITLE]Ottawa gave Stellantis $105M for Ont. plants before automaker revealed U.S. plans:
[TEXT]
After giving Stellantis close to $105 million to retool two Ontario plants, the federal government is now reviewing the contract to see if the automaker violated the deal by announcing it's moving some production to the U.S.

Stellantis publicly revealed its plans last week to move its Jeep Compass production from Brampton, Ont., to Illinois.

Asked by CBC News if he wants to recover taxpayer money already given to Stellantis, Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne suggested the government is taking action.

“We’re going to enforce our contractual rights, definitely,” said Champagne, who was involved in negotiating contracts with Stellantis.

“You just have to look at their circumstances, what was promised and what is being delivered."

WATCH | 'Going to enforce our contractual rights', says Champagne on Stellantis returning government money: ‘Going to enforce our contractual rights,’ says Champagne on Stellantis returning government money | Duration 0:48 Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne was asked if he is looking for a return on investment following auto manufacturer Stellantis shipping production out of Ontario to the U.S., after the government provided the company with millions in support to encourage production in Canada.

Stellantis's new American expansion plan has been called a major blow to Canada and was celebrated by the White House as a victory.

U.S. President Donald Trump has signalled he wants to dominate auto manufacturing. His commerce secretary Howard Lutnick told an audience in Toronto this month he wants to drain auto assembly from Canada.

The Canadian government has now confirmed to CBC News that it handed over more than $18.6 million to Stellantis in the 2023 fiscal year, and another $85.9 million in 2024's fiscal year, to retool its Windsor and Brampton plants.

But that’s only one-fifth of the money Ottawa offered Stellantis.

In 2022, the federal government announced it would invest $529 million to help the automaker modernize those two plants to boost electric vehicle production in Canada.

The money came from the Strategic Innovation Fund to support jobs in Windsor and Brampton. It’s standard for this funding to be disbursed in phases once a company submits claims for costs incurred if certain commitments are met, the department responsible said.

"We made sure at the time that we had proper protection for workers," Champagne said.

Industry Minister Mélanie Joly said on Tuesday the government is reviewing a series of confidential agreements with Stellantis to figure out if the automaker's relocation announcement violated any conditions.

WATCH | Government threatens legal action against Stellantis: Ottawa threatens legal action against Stellantis | Duration 2:17 Canadian politicians of all stripes expressed anger and frustration over Stellantis moving Jeep production from Brampton, Ont., to Illinois — and Ottawa is considering taking legal action.

In a letter to the company's CEO last week, Joly warned Stellantis it has “legally binding commitments” to keep its “full Canadian footprint, including Brampton, in exchange for financial support."

The letter points to Stellantis’s commitments under the Strategic Innovation Fund and an agreement tied to the company’s NextStar Energy project.

As of March last year, Ottawa had given Stellantis $268 million for the NextStar project, according to the federal government's public accounts.

Unclear if money can be recovered

Even though Ottawa has given the automaker millions of dollars, it’s unclear how much ability it has to enforce the contracts or get the money back.

Asked if she had the power to recover the money, Joly didn’t say.

“We are confident that we are able to put a lot of pressure on the company, because when we sign contracts with companies to support them, everything is of course linked to job creation, Joly said in French on Tuesday.

Joly also said she's speaking to other car companies.

“I had conversations again this weekend and Friday with Honda, with Ford, and I will continue to have conversations, of course, with GM,” she said.

WATCH | Canada 'must play hardball' with Stellantis, says union: Canada must 'play hardball’ with Stellantis, says union | Power & Politics | Duration 9:23 Unifor national president Lana Payne calls Stellantis’s decision to move the slated production of a Jeep model from Brampton, Ont., to Illinois ‘egregious.’ Payne tells Power & Politics that Canada must 'do everything in this moment' to retain jobs and production until trade negotiations conclude.

The government has made deals and announced support to help these major auto manufacturers with Canada's transition to electric vehicles.

After Stellantis announced it was moving some production to the U.S., Flavio Volpe said the government needed to send a message to other automakers that if they “cower” to the White House there will be “real consequences”.

“We’re not going to set the precedent here that you can say, 'I don’t care

[TITLE]Raytech Holding Limited Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Notification Regarding Minimum Bid Price Deficiency:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Raytech Holding Limited (NASDAQ: RAY) (the “Company”), a Hong Kong-headquartered company specializing in design, sourcing and wholesale of personal care electrical appliances for international brand owners, today announced, on October 14, 2025, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that based on the closing bid price of the ordinary shares of the Company for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer meets the continued listing requirement of Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2), to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share.

The notification has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has provided the Company with an 180 calendar days compliance period, or until April 13, 2026, in which to regain compliance with Nasdaq continued listing requirement. In the event that the Company does not regain compliance in the compliance period, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar days, should the Company meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and is able to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. However, if it appears that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company’s securities will be subject to delisting.

The Company is currently evaluating options to regain compliance and intends to timely regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirement. Although the Company will use all reasonable efforts to achieve compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2), there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with that rule or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq continued listing requirement.

[TITLE]Sonoco Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results:

Summary:

Entered into an agreement on September 7, 2025, to sell Sonoco’s ThermoSafe business unit, which is one of the leading providers of temperature-assured packaging, to Arsenal Capital Partners for a total purchase price of up to $725 million, with net proceeds expected to be used to repay existing debt

Grew third quarter net sales to $2.1 billion, up 57.3% from the prior-year quarter, primarily from acquisitions

Improved quarterly adjusted net income attributable to Sonoco by 29.3% year over year to $191.2 million, and reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.92

Third quarter net sales of $2.1 billion reflect an increase of 57.3% compared to the corresponding prior-year quarter, driven by sales added from our Metal Packaging Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) business following the December 4, 2024 acquisition of Titan Holdings I B.V. (“Eviosys”). Additionally, sales benefited from price increases implemented to offset the effects of inflation and tariffs and from the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

GAAP operating profit for the third quarter increased to $195 million due to operating profit from our Metal Packaging EMEA business following the acquisition of Eviosys, a positive price/cost environment, solid productivity from certain procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives, and the absence of losses on the sale of two production facilities in China. These positive factors were partially offset by a negative product mix in certain businesses and higher restructuring costs.

Effective tax rates on GAAP income from continuing operations before income taxes and adjusted income from continuing operations before income taxes, were 6.0% and 22.9%, respectively, in the third quarter, compared to 35.2% and 21.1%, respectively, in the same period in 2024.

“I’m incredibly proud of our team’s strong operating performance in the third quarter as we achieved record top-line and bottom-line performance along with margin expansion despite challenging market conditions and higher than expected interest costs, said Howard Coker, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our Consumer Packaging segment sales and operating profit each grew 117% and adjusted EBITDA increased by 112%. Most of the improvement came from the addition of Metal Packaging EMEA and improved results from our Metal Packaging U.S. business. Our Industrial Paper Packaging segment improved operating profit by 28%, adjusted EBITDA by 21%, operating profit margin by approximately 336 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 359 basis points driven by year-over-year improvement in price/cost and productivity.”

“In addition, we believe the recently announced sale of our ThermoSafe unit will substantially complete Sonoco’s transformation from a large portfolio of diversified businesses into a simplified structure with two core global business segments — Consumer Packaging and Industrial Paper Packaging. Proceeds from the sale, which is expected to close before year-end, are projected to further reduce Sonoco’s net leverage ratio.”

Paul Joachimczyk, Sonoco’s Chief Financial Officer, added, “We generated $292 million in operating cash flow in the quarter which was up 80% over the prior year period due to solid improvement in working capital. We expect further strong cash flow generation in the fourth quarter as the seasonal build of working capital reverses.”

Third Quarter 2025 Segment Results

(Dollars in millions except per share data)

Sonoco reports its financial results in two reportable segments: Consumer Packaging (“Consumer”) and Industrial Paper Packaging (“Industrial”), with all remaining businesses reported as All Other.

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Consumer September 28, 2025 September 29, 2024 Change September 28, 2025 September 29, 2024 Change Net sales1 $ 1,438 $ 662 117 % $ 3,732 $ 1,827 104 % Segment operating profit1 $ 209 $ 96 117 % $ 510 $ 229 123 % Segment operating profit margin1 15 % 15 % 14 % 13 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA1, 2 $ 260 $ 122 112 % $ 663 $ 305 117 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin1, 2 18 % 18 % 18 % 17 %

Consumer segment net sales grew 117%, driven by sales attributable to Metal Packaging EMEA following the acquisition of Eviosys, price increases implemented to offset the effects of inflation and tariffs, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by softer volumes in the rigid paper and U.S. metal packaging businesses.

Segment operating profit and segment adjusted EBITDA grew primarily as a result of profits from Metal Packaging EMEA and a strong price/cost environment in our U.S. metal packaging business.

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Industrial September 28, 2025 September 29, 2024 Change September 28, 2025 September 29, 2024 Change Net sales $ 585 $ 585 — % $ 1,731 $ 1,779 (3 )% Segment operating profit $ 90 $ 70 28 % $ 242 $ 203 19 % Segment operating profit margin 15 % 12 % 14 % 11 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA2 $ 123 $ 102 21 % $ 337 $ 295 14 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin2 21 % 17 % 19 % 17 %

Industrial segment net sales remained flat at $585 million as volume declines across the segment and the loss of net sales related to the 2024 divestiture of two production facilities in China offset year-over-year price increases.

Segment operating profit margin increased to 15% and adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 21% due to price recovery and productivity from certain procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives, which were only partially offset by lower volume/mix.

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended All Other September 28, 2025 September 29, 2024 Change September 28, 2025 September 29, 2024 Change Net sales $ 108 $ 107 1 % $ 288 $ 336 (14 )% Operating profit $ 18 $ 17 5 % $ 43 $ 48 (11 )% Operating profit margin 17 % 16 % 15 % 14 % Adjusted EBITDA2 $ 21 $ 20 2 % $ 51 $ 58 (12 )% Adjusted EBITDA margin2 19 % 19 % 18 % 17 %

Net sales were relatively flat as volume gains in temperature-assured packaging were essentially offset by lower volume from industrial plastics.

Operating profit and adjusted EBITDA improved 5% and 2%, respectively, year over year as solid productivity from certain procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives offset lower volumes from industrial plastics and negative price/cost.

1Excludes results of discontinued operations.

2Segment and All Other adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See the Company’s reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures later in this release.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights

Cash and cash equivalents, including discontinued operations, were $245 million as of September 28, 2025, compared to $443 million as of December 31, 2024, with the decrease primarily related to changes in net working capital and net debt reduction.

Total debt, including discontinued operations, and net debt were $5.2 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, as of September 28, 2025, reflecting decreases of $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, compared to December 31, 2024, primarily related to the repayment of the outstanding $1.5 billion principal amount of borrowings under the Company’s 364-day term loan facility in 2025 using proceeds from the sale of TFP.

On September 28, 2025, the Company had available liquidity of $1,405 million, comprising available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility of $1,160 million and cash on hand.

Cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2025 was an inflow of $277 million, compared to an inflow of $438 million in the same period of 2024. The main driver of the year-over-year change in operating cash flow was the increased seasonal need for working capital during the year related to Metal Packaging EMEA. This working capital build is expected to reverse during the fourth quarter.

Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of fixed assets, for the first nine months of 2025 were $248 million, compared to $267 million for the same period last year.

Free Cash Flow for the first nine months of 2025 was $29 million compared to $171 million for the same period of 2024. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Company’s definition of Free Cash Flow, the explanation as to why it is used, and the reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities later in this release.

Dividends paid during the nine months ended September 28, 2025 increased to $156 million compared to $152 million in the same period of the prior year.

Guidance(1)

Full-Year 2025

Adjusted EPS (2) : Adjusted to $5.65 to $5.75 per diluted share from previous guidance of approximately $6.00

: Adjusted to $5.65 to $5.75 per diluted share from previous guidance of approximately $6.00 Adjusted EBITDA (2) : $1,300 million to $1,350 million, substantially in line with previous guidance

: $1,300 million to $1,350 million, substantially in line with previous guidance Cash flow from operating activities: Adjusted to $700 million to $750 million from previous guidance of $800 million

Commenting on the Company’s outlook, Sonoco’s Joachimczyk said, “We are adjusting full-year earnings guidance in anticipation of continuing volume weakness in the fourth quarter especially from our Metal Packaging and Industrial EMEA businesses due to continuing difficult macroeconomic conditions. To address these shortfalls, we are implementing targeted restructuring activities for operations and supporting functions to enable our businesses to better leverage our market capabilities and generate strong cash flow.”

Coker concluded, “Looking ahead at the remainder of the year, our top priorities are to continue building momentum for growth and improving our competitive position by further reducing our cost structure. We believe both our Consumer and Industrial businesses have solid growth funnels with new product and market launches planned in 2026 and beyond. While we are disappointed that our projected 2025 results fall below our previous expectations, we believe Sonoco is in the best position in our history and we are excited

TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Kosovo war veterans and thousands of their supporters gathered Friday in the Albanian capital, Tirana, in a protest against a European Union-backed court prosecuting their former fighters who waged the 1998-1999 war for independence from Serbia, claiming the tribunal is biased and unjust.

Demonstrators from Kosovo and other European countries filled Tirana’s main Skanderbeg Square in support of arrested former leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA — a former Kosovo Albanian guerrilla group that led the fight for independence.

Many held national Albanian and KLA flags, while a group of former fighters and some youngsters were in KLA uniform. Some sang songs

[TITLE]Northrim BanCorp Earns $27.1 Million, or $1.20 Per Diluted Share, in Third Quarter 2025:
[TEXT]
ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northrim BanCorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NRIM) (“Northrim” or the “Company”) today reported net income of $27.1 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $11.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2025, and $8.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in third quarter 2025 profitability as compared to the third quarter a year ago was primarily the result of the gain from the sale of certain assets by Pacific Wealth Advisors of $14.2 million, as well as an increase in net interest income, and higher purchased receivable income, which were partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes and higher other operating expenses. Net interest income increased over the same periods primarily due to higher earning asset balances, lower interest-bearing liability balances, higher yields on earning assets, and a lower cost of funds. Purchased receivable income increased primarily due to the Company’s acquisition of Sallyport Commercial Finance, LLC (“Sallyport or SCF”), which was completed on October 31, 2024. Sallyport and its direct and indirect subsidiaries provide services and products related to purchased receivable factoring and asset-based lending in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

The Company's Board of Directors approved a 4-for-1 forward stock split of its common stock that was effective after the close of business on September 22, 2025, for shareholders of record at the close of business on September 18, 2025 (the “Stock Split”). The Stock Split is part of the Company's ongoing review of optimal trading and spread levels. The intended purpose of the Stock Split is to enhance stock liquidity, make shares more accessible to a broader base of retail investors, and support increased trading activity. All per share ratios in this release have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the Stock Split.

Dividends per share in the third quarter of 2025 remained consistent with the first and second quarter of 2025 at $0.16 per share as compared to $0.155 per share in the third quarter of 2024.

“We achieved yet another quarter of record core earnings as loan yields continued to increase and deposit costs decreased. In addition, we recognized a $10.9 million after-tax gain from the sale of certain assets by Pacific Wealth Advisors where we have a minority interest,” said Mike Huston, Northrim’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Northrim’s Alaskan deposit market share increased by 187 basis points to 17.5% in 2025 and has increased by 531 basis points over the past five years. We are proud of this progress and believe these gains are the result of consistent investments in our people and banking infrastructure.”

Third Quarter 2025 Highlights:

Net interest income in the third quarter of 2025 increased 5% to $35.3 million compared to $33.6 million in the second quarter of 2025 and increased 23% compared to $28.8 million in the third quarter of 2024.

Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis (“NIMTE”) * was 4.88% for the third quarter of 2025, up 16-basis points from the second quarter of 2025 and up 53-basis points from the third quarter a year ago.

was 4.88% for the third quarter of 2025, up 16-basis points from the second quarter of 2025 and up 53-basis points from the third quarter a year ago. Return on average assets (“ROAA”) was 3.32% and return on average equity (“ROAE”) was 35.66% for the third quarter of 2025 compared to ROAA of 1.48% and ROAE of 16.37% in the prior quarter and ROAA of 1.22% and ROAE of 13.69% for the third quarter of 2024.

Portfolio loans were $2.22 billion at September 30, 2025, up 1% from the preceding quarter and up 11% from a year ago, primarily due to new customer relationships and expanding market share, as well as retaining certain mortgages originated by Residential Mortgage, a subsidiary of Northrim Bank (the “Bank”). The Company sold $61 million in consumer mortgages in the second quarter of 2025 and $16 million in the third quarter of 2025 that were included in loans held for investment as of the end of 2024 to reduce the concentration of residential real estate loans and to provide additional liquidity for future commercial and construction loan growth.

Total deposits were $2.91 billion at September 30, 2025, up 3% from the preceding quarter, and up 11% from $2.63 billion a year ago.

Alaska Economic Update

(Note: sources for information included in this section are included on page 15.)

The Alaska Department of Labor (“DOL”) has reported Alaska’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in August of 2025 was 4.7% compared to the U.S. rate of 4.3%. The total of 355,900 payroll jobs in Alaska, not including uniformed military, increased 0.8% or 2,900 jobs between August of 2024 and August of 2025. This matched the year-over-year increase for the U.S. of 0.8% for the same period.

According to the DOL, the Oil and Gas sector had the largest growth rate in new jobs of 6% through August compared to the prior year, up 500 direct jobs. The Construction sector added 1,000 positions for a year-over-year growth rate of 4.8% in August of 2025. The Manufacturing sector, which is dominated by seafood processing, added 900 jobs and grew 5.7% in the same period. The larger Health Care sector also grew by 900 jobs for an annual growth rate of 2.1%. Transportation, Warehousing and Utilities added 300 jobs for a 1.1% growth rate. Professional and Business Services increased 200 jobs year-over-year through August of 2025, up 0.7%.

The Government sector declined by 100 jobs, or (0.1%). Government gained 200 State positions, while losing 100 Federal jobs and 200 Local government jobs in Alaska between August of 2024 and August of 2025. Other declining sectors include: Information down 300 jobs or (-6.8%); Leisure/Hospitality declined 100 jobs (-0.2%); Wholesale Trade lost 100 jobs (-1.5%) and Financial Activities, down 100 jobs (-0.9%).

Alaska’s seasonally adjusted personal income was $59.4 billion in the second quarter of 2025 according to the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis (“BEA”). Alaska had an annualized improvement of 9.7% in the first quarter and 5% in the second quarter of 2025. This is compared to the national average of 6.4% in the first quarter and 5.5% in second quarter of 2025. Alaska enjoyed an annual personal income improvement of 5.8% in 2024 compared to the U.S. increase of 5.6%. Per capita personal income in Alaska is now estimated at $80,208 according to the BEA, ranking it 12th highest of the 50 U.S. states.

Alaska’s Gross State Product (“GSP”) in the second quarter of 2025 reached $74.2 billion according to the BEA. Alaska’s inflation adjusted “real” GSP increased 1.5% in 2024, 1.8% annualized in the first quarter of 2025, and 2% in the second quarter of 2025. The average U.S. GDP growth rate was 2.8% for 2024, annualized -0.6% in the first quarter of 2025 and 3.8% in the second quarter of 2025. Alaska’s real GSP improvement in the second quarter of 2025 was led by the Mining, Oil & Gas sector; Transportation & Warehousing; Professional, Scientific & Technical Services; and Manufacturing, but was somewhat offset by decreases in Retail Trade and Government.

Alaska exported $5.9 billion in goods to foreign countries in 2024 according to the U.S. International Trade Administration. China is the largest importer of Alaska’s products at $1.5 billion, followed by Australia at $804 million, Japan at $674 million and South Korea at $634 million in 2024. Fish and related maritime products accounted for the largest volume at $2.1 billion, followed by minerals and ores $2 billion, and primary metals at $992 million in 2024. Oil & Gas international exports were $380 million because the majority of Alaska’s production is refined and consumed within the United States.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, for the U.S. increased 2.9% between August of 2024 and August of 2025. In Alaska, the rate of increase was lower at 2.4% for the same time period. The largest increases since last August came from Apparel (+6.9%), Food and beverage (+3.9%), and Housing (+3.8%). Slower increases or declining costs in Medical Care (+1.2%), Gasoline (+0.9%), Transportation (-1.2%) and Recreation (-1.7%) through August 2025 have helped moderate inflationary pressures in Alaska relative to the U.S.

The monthly average price of Alaska North Slope (“ANS”) crude oil has ranged between a high of $76.39 a barrel in January of 2025 and a low of $67.07 in May of 2025. The August 2025 average was $69.29. The Alaska Department of Revenue (“DOR”) calculated ANS crude oil production was 461 thousand barrels per day (“bpd”) in Alaska’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Production rose to 469 thousand bpd in fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. In the Spring 2025 Revenue Forecast published March 12, 2025, the DOR expects production to continue to grow to 663 thousand bpd, or 41% by fiscal year 2034. This is primarily a result of new production coming on-line in and around the NPR-A region west of Prudhoe Bay. A partnership between Santos and Repsol is constructing the new Pikka field and ConocoPhillips is developing the large new Willow field. There are also several smaller new fields in Alaska’s North Slope that are contributing to the State of Alaska’s production growth estimate.

The Alaska Permanent Fund is seeded annually by the oil wealth the State continues to save each year and has grown significantly over 40 years of successful investment. As of August 31, 2025 the fund’s value was $83.26 billion. According to the DOR it is scheduled to contribute $3.7 billion to Alaska’s General Fund in fiscal year 2025 for general government spending and over $600 million to pay the annual dividend of $1,000 in October to Alaskan residents.

According to the Alaska Multiple Listing Services, the average sales price of a single-family home in Anchorage rose 6.2% in 2024 to $510,015, following a 5.2% increase in 2023. This was the seventh consecutive year of price increases. Through September of 2025 prices continued to increase on average 3.7% to $529,097.

The average sales price for single family homes in the Matanuska Susitna Borough rose 3.8% in 2024 to $412,859, after increasing 4% in 2023. This continues a trend of average price increases for more than a decade in the region. Through September of 2025 prices continued to increase on average 6.7% to $440,366. These two markets represent where the vast majority of the Bank’s residential lending activity occurs.

The Alaska Multiple Listing Services reported a 3.4% increase in the number of units sold in Anchorage when comparing 2024 to 2023. The first nine months of 2025 saw a 4.7% increase in home sales compared to the same nine months of 2024 in Anchorage.

Last year there was virtually no change in the number of homes sold in the Matanuska Susitna Borough, with only four fewer homes sold in 2024 than in 2023 or -0.2%. In the first nine months of 2025 the number of units sold has increased by 133 sold or 11.1% in the Matanuska Susitna Borough compared to the first nine months of 2024.

[TITLE]Covenant Logistics Group Announces Third Quarter 2025:
[TEXT]
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Covenant Logistics Group, Inc. (NYSE: CVLG) (“Covenant” or the “Company”) announced today financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. The Company’s conference call to discuss the quarter will be held at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time on Thursday, October 23, 2025.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David R. Parker, commented: “Our third quarter results of $0.35 per diluted share, or $0.44 per diluted share on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, reflect essentially flat year-over-year performance in our asset-light business units and lower performance in our Truckload business units, mainly attributable to higher costs and under-utilized equipment. It was a busy quarter internally as we continued to invest in the future while managing costs during a prolonged period of overcapacity and muted demand.

“We continued to invest in and grow within certain industries that our dedicated fleet services with new start-up contracts, which weighed on third quarter margins but are expected to improve over time. Meanwhile, we continue to evaluate contracts in the rest of our Truckload business for improvement or exit. Overall, we expect modest contraction in our combined Truckload fleet and growth in our asset light segments as we allocate capital toward better returning business units. This process may impact quarterly financial results as we grow and shrink certain segments, adjust staffing needs, and dispose of equipment in potentially volatile used equipment markets.

“Our 49% equity method investment with Transport Enterprise Leasing (“TEL”) contributed pre-tax net income of $3.6 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to $4.0 million, or $0.11 per share, in the prior year quarter. The decline in TEL’s earnings is a result of customer bankruptcies that have accelerated over the past twelve months. While TEL’s overall business model remains healthy, we expect this headwind to continue for the foreseeable short term.

“Finally, I would be remiss not to acknowledge the unexpected passing of Lew Thompson, founder of Lew Thompson and Son Trucking Company, which we acquired in April 2023. Lew was a great friend and business partner, and his wisdom, humor, and storytelling will be missed by all. Lew was also a great mentor to the team that assumed day-to-day management of the business. We are confident this talented team will continue to ensure an exceptional customer experience, and we will honor Lew by continuing to serve our customers in a manner that would make him proud.”

Mr. Parker continued, “The third quarter included approximately $0.1 million in net items that have been excluded from adjusted financial results. Among these items was a $3.8 million gain from discontinued operations relating to a litigation settlement associated with our factoring business that was exited in 2020. Offsetting this gain was $3.7 million of expenses in severance and abandonment of certain underutilized leased facilities and systems related to exiting a large Managed Freight contract and the planned exit of legacy Dedicated contracts not providing sufficient returns. While these decisions were difficult and created a cost headwind in the quarter, we believe they needed to be made to improve the long-term cost profile of the Company. A detail of these costs is summarized in the table below.”

Gain item: Gain proceeds from discontinued operations $3.8 million Expense items: Employee separation costs $1.4 million Lease abandonment and customer exit costs $0.4 million Abandonment of long-lived software $1.9 million Net third quarter adjustments $0.1 million

Combined Truckload Revenue

Paul Bunn, the Company’s President commented on truckload operations, “For the quarter, total revenue in our truckload operations increased 0.3%, to $199.7 million. The increase in total revenue consisted of $1.7 million more freight revenue and $1.1 million less fuel surcharge revenue, which varies with the cost of fuel. Freight revenue grew by $1.7 million, or 1.0%, as a result of a 4.6% increase in the average tractor fleet, partially offset by lower equipment utilization.”

Expedited Truckload Revenue

Mr. Bunn added, “Freight revenue in our Expedited segment decreased $7.2 million, or 8.2%. Average total tractors decreased by 31 units, or 3.4%, to 861, compared to 892 in the prior year quarter. Average freight revenue per tractor per week decreased 5.0% as a result of a 5.4% decrease in utilization, partially offset by a small increase in freight revenue per total mile.”

Dedicated Truckload Revenue

“For the quarter, freight revenue in our Dedicated segment increased $8.9 million, or 10.8%. Average total tractors increased by 136 units, or 9.7%, to 1,539, compared to 1,403 in the prior year’s quarter. Average freight revenue per tractor per week increased 1.0% as a result of a 7.0% increase in freight revenue per total mile, partially offset by a 5.7% decrease in utilization.”

Combined Truckload Operating Expenses

Mr. Bunn continued, “Rising operating costs in our Truckload segment negatively impacted operating margins compared to the prior year quarter. Higher costs primarily include salaries, wages and related expenses, insurance, and both variable and fixed expenses necessary to seat and operate our equipment. Some expense increases were expected, as they relate to growth in high-service and low-mileage operations. The expense increases were partially offset by a 5.0% increase in freight revenue per total mile.

“Salaries, wages and related expenses increased year-over-year by 5 cents, or approximately 4%, on a per total mile basis. The increase was driven primarily from the year-over-year impact of significant growth in our dedicated protein supply chain business as well as employee separation costs incurred during the quarter. As we grow our dedicated fleet in niche services, it requires hiring and retaining skilled drivers and maintenance professionals to operate and maintain specialized equipment on loads that typically move heavy weights on non-paved roads with shorter lengths of haul, resulting in higher costs on a per total mile basis. Additionally, as the freight market improves and the driver market tightens, we anticipate that driver pay will continue to rise.

“Safety continues to be our priority as we consistently strive to raise our own standards by hiring highly qualified drivers, implementing proactive training sessions, and investing in and implementing safety equipment and technology. For the past several years, our safety statistics have been at or near the best in our history. However, given the self-insured portions, potential additional premiums in certain layers based upon experience, and limits of our insurance program, and the risk of extremely large awards and settlements in our industry (so-called “nuclear verdicts/settlements”), the amount of expense recognized from period to period can fluctuate materially. Insurance and claims expense for the current quarter was 4 cents per mile, or 24% higher than the prior year on a per total mile basis as a result of the incurrence and development of certain large claims. At a minimum, we anticipate the fourth quarter insurance expense to remain elevated compared to historical amounts.

“Equipment related expenses, including Operations and maintenance and Depreciation and amortization, increased approximately 8 cents per total mile, or approximately 15%, compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to an increased amount of unproductive equipment. In addition, costs associated with seating our equipment, including recruiting and onboarding expenses, contributed to the increase compared to the prior year. Going forward, as the driver market tightens, we anticipate the cost of recruiting and onboarding to remain elevated.

“For the quarter, Managed Freight’s freight revenue increased 14.0%, from the prior year quarter. Operating income improved 0.4% and adjusted operating income improved 11.7% compared to the third quarter of 2024. The growth in this segment is attributable to new business awarded in the year by a large customer that will no longer continue in the fourth quarter.”

“For the quarter, Warehousing’s results were fairly comparable to the prior year with reduced revenue of $0.4 million and operating income and adjusted operating income reduced $0.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter, we are anticipating growth in this segment from a large new facility start up with an existing customer scheduled to begin in November 2025.”

Capitalization, Liquidity and Capital Expenditures

Tripp Grant, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, added the following comments: “At September 30, 2025, our total indebtedness, composed of total debt and finance lease obligations, net of cash (“net indebtedness”), increased by $48.7 million to approximately $268.3 million as compared to December 31, 2024. In addition, our net indebtedness to total capitalization increased to 38.8% at September 30, 2025, from 33.4% at December 31, 2024.

“The increase to net indebtedness in the first three quarters of the year is primarily attributable to acquisition-related payments of $19.2 million and repurchasing approximately $36.2 million of common stock outstanding.

“At September 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $2.7 million. Under our ABL credit facility, we had no outstanding borrowings, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of $19.9 million, and available borrowing capacity of $90.1 million.

“At the end of the quarter, we had $1.2 million in assets held for sale that we anticipate disposing of within twelve months. The average age of our tractors increased to 23 months compared to 20 months a year ago.

“Our expectations for net capital equipment expenditures in the fourth quarter is $15 million to $20 million.”

Outlook

Mr. Parker concluded, “Our outlook is impacted by both short-term and long-term factors. In the short term, we expect our Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter to be sequentially lower than our Adjusted EPS for the third quarter. The reasons include expected lower profits from our minority investment in TEL attributable to credit losses in their small-carrier customer base, the impact of the U.S. government shutdown on our Department of Defense business, an expected increase in claims accruals, and loss of a large Managed Freight customer rolling off faster than the results of Star Logistics Solutions ramp. These negative factors are expected to more than outweigh our current expectation of a modest peak season boost to Expedited and Managed Freight.

“Over the intermediate to long term, I am more excited today than I have been in the last three years. From a freight environment perspective, capacity exits seem to be accelerating based on publicly announced bankruptcies of small carriers and our observation of TEL’s customer base, as well as increased enforcement of government policies concerning English language and non-domiciled drivers. In addition, there are potential demand drivers from unwinding excess inventories from import pull-forwards, tax and monetary policies, and clarification of trade policy. We have internal plans and opportunities to continue to grow certain dedicated and warehouse business that has the potential to yield acceptable margins and hold or downsize our other Truckload capacity until returns improve. To the extent we downsize capacity, we may experience severance, equipment disposal, and other costs that create uneven results in a given quarter but are expected to lead to stronger and more sustained results over time.

The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is down -0.37%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is down -0.36%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is down -0.68%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) are down -0.37%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) are down -0.70%.

Stock indexes are under pressure today, led by losses in chipmakers after Texas Instruments forecasted Q4 revenue that was below expectations. Also, Netflix is down more than -9% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 EPS. Other corporate earnings results today are mixed for stocks. Intuitive Surgical is up more than +16% after boosting its worldwide Da Vinci procedure growth forecast for the whole year. Also, Capital One Financial is up more than +3% after reporting better-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS.

US MBA mortgage applications fell -0.3% in the week ended October 17, with the purchase mortgage sub-index down -5.2% and the refinancing sub-index up +4.0%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -5 bp to 6.37% from 6.42% in the prior week.

The markets are focusing on progress in US-China trade talks, as President Trump reiterated his threat on Monday to boost tariffs on Chinese goods "if there isn't a deal" by November 1. President Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in South Korea.

The shutdown of the US government continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including the last three weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the September payroll report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the September consumer price report, which was initially scheduled to be released last Wednesday, will be released this Friday. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingers, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don't align with President Trump's priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

The markets this week will focus on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. Also, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 that have provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results are expected to beat analysts' expectations, the highest in a year. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

The markets are pricing in a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

Overseas stock markets are lower today. The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.43%. China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.07%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.02%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today are down -3 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is up +1.0 bp to 3.972%. Supply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $13 billion of 20-year T-bonds later today. Losses in T-notes are contained due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

European government bond yields are mixed today. The 10-year German bund yield is up +1.6 bp to 2.568%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 6.5-month low of 4.369% and is down -5.5 bp to 4.422%.

UK Sep CPI rose +3.8% y/y, unchanged from Aug and weaker than expectations of +4.0% y/y. Sep core CPI unexpectedly eased to +3.5% y/y from +3.6% y/y in Aug, weaker than expectations of +3.7% y/y.

ECB Vice President Guindos said, "The current ECB interest-rate level is adequate as the path forward for inflation looks positive," and risks to the outlook for consumer-price growth are balanced.

Swaps are discounting a 2% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

[TITLE]Desalination Booming in Chile, but Farmers Hardly Benefit:
[TEXT]

By Orlando Milesi (IPS)

HAVANA TIMES – Desalination projects are booming in Chile, with 51 plants planned to process seawater and a combined investment of US$ 24.455 billion. However, these initiatives hardly benefit small-scale farmers, who are threatened by the prolonged drought, and cause environmental concerns.

A survey by the Capital Goods Corporation and the Chilean Desalination and Reuse Association (Acades) revealed that these projects, already in the engineering and construction phases, will add 39,043 liters of water per second in production capacity. “Using seawater, desalinated or saline, and reusing wastewater relieves pressure on rivers and aquifers, ensuring water for people, ecosystems, and productive activities” –Rafael Palacios.

Fifteen of these projects belong to the mining sector, eight to the industrial sector, eight to the water utility sector, and 20 are linked to green hydrogen, a clean fuel but very water-intensive, which the country aims to be a major producer of.

Of the future plants, 17 are located in the desert region of Antofagasta, in the far north of this elongated South American country, which lies between the Andes mountain range and the Pacific Ocean.

There are 11 projects in the southern region of Magallanes, followed in number by the regions of Atacama, Coquimbo, and Valparaíso, in the north and center of Chile, which concentrate most of the investment.

Rafael Palacios, executive director of Acades, told IPS that this country “faces a scenario in which water availability in northern and central Chile could decrease by up to 50% by 2060, so we cannot continue to depend solely on continental sources.”

“Using seawater, desalinated or saline, and reusing wastewater relieves pressure on rivers and aquifers, ensuring water for people, ecosystems, and productive activities,” he emphasized.

Currently, 23 desalination plants are already operating in Chile with a capacity of 9,500 liters per second. They primarily serve mining needs, but also industrial and human consumption.

Small-scale farmers benefit

Dolores Jiménez has been president for the last eight years of the Association of Agricultural Producers of Altos de la Portada, in Antofagasta. The association has 90 active members who collectively own 100 hectares where they have created a Hydroponic City.

“We have no water problems thanks to an agreement with Aguas Antofagasta. We have an oasis which we would otherwise not have without that agreement,” Jiménez told IPS by telephone from Antofagasta, the capital of the region of the same name.

Aguas Antofagasta is a private company that desalinates water in the north of this country of 19.7 million inhabitants. The company draws water from the Pacific Ocean using an outfall that extends 600 meters offshore to a depth of 25 meters.

In desalination, outfalls are the underwater pipes that draw seawater and return and disperse the brine in a controlled manner, far from the coast and at an adequate depth.

Founded 20 years ago, the company currently desalinates water in three plants in the municipalities of Antofagasta, Tocopilla, and Tal Tal, supplying 184,000 families in that region.

In its project to supply the general population, it included the association of small-scale farmers who grow carrots, broccoli, Italian zucchini, cucumbers, medicinal herbs, and edible flowers.

“They support us with water from the pipeline that goes to Mejillones (a coastal city in the region). They financed the connection for us to fill six 30,000 liter tanks, installed on a plot at the highest point. From there, we distribute it using a water tanker truck,” informed Jiménez.

“Now, thanks to a project by the (state) National Irrigation Commission, we were able to secure 280 million pesos (US$294,000) for an inter-farm connection that will deliver water through pipes to 70 plots,” she added.

This will mean significant savings for the farmers.

In Pullally, in the municipality of Papudo, in the central Valparaíso region, 155 kilometers northwest of Santiago, Jesús Basáez used to grow strawberries alongside a dozen other small farmers. But the crop failed due to the salinity of the groundwater, apparently caused by the drought affecting the La Ligua and Petorca rivers and proximity to the sea.

He then switched to quinoa, which tolerates salinity well. Today he is known as the King of Quinoa, a grain valued for its nutritional properties and versatility, which was an ancestral food of Andean highland peoples and has now spread among small Chilean farmers.

Basáez has three hectares planted with white, red, and black varieties of quinoa, which he irrigates with water obtained from a well, as he told IPS during a visit to his farm.

The public University of Playa Ancha, based in the city of Valparaíso, installed a mobile desalination plant on his farm that uses reverse osmosis to remove components from the saltwater that are harmful for irrigation. Pressure is applied to the saltwater so that it passes through a semipermeable membrane that filters the water, separating the salts.

After successful tests, Basáez is now

[TITLE]Brandywine Realty Trust Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results And Adjusts And Narrows 2025 Guidance:
[TEXT]
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:BDN) today reported its financial and operating results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025.

Management Comments

“We are pleased with our 2025 business plan progress highlighted by achieving the midpoint of our speculative revenue target and many of our operating objectives,” said Gerard H. Sweeney, President and Chief Executive Officer of Brandywine Realty Trust. “We continue to have one of the office sectors lowest forward lease expiration schedule with only 4.9% of revenues expiring through 2026. The pipeline for our commercial development projects remains strong at 1.6 million square feet with 75,000 in active lease negotiations. Our two residential developments, Solaris at Uptown ATX and Avira at Schuylkill Yards are both 99% leased. Liquidity remains in excellent shape with no outstanding balance on our $600 million unsecured line of credit and $75 million of cash on hand. We recently issued $300 million of 5 year unsecured notes at 6.125% and used the majority of those proceeds to prepay a $245 million secured loan scheduled to mature in February 2028. As a result we unencumbered approximately $45 million of net operating income and, once again, have a fully unencumbered wholly owned operating portfolio. This early prepayment will generate a fourth quarter earnings charge approximating $12.3 million or $0.07 per share. As a first step in recapitalizing our development joint ventures, we acquired our partner’s preferred equity interest in 3025 JFK for $70.5 million. Our 2025 business plan contemplated proceeding with recapitalizing several projects once stabilization occurred and capital market conditions improved. While we believe additional recapitalizations will occur, the timing of those transactions has been delayed. We are revising and narrowing our 2025 FFO guidance range to $0.51 to $0.53 per share to reflect the $0.07 per share prepayment charge and the impact of the development recapitalization occurring in late 2025 or 2026.”

Net loss available to common shareholders: $(26.2) million, or $(0.15) per share.

Funds from Operations (FFO): $28.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income was $115.6 million for the third quarter of 2025, representing a $4.0 million, or 3.6%, increase from the second quarter of 2025, and a $2.0 million, or 1.7%, increase from the third quarter of 2024. Interest income increased by $5.9 million, or 4.1%, from the second quarter of 2025, while interest expense increased by $1.9 million, or 5.9%, to $34.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, from $32.6 in the prior quarter. The quarter over quarter growth in net interest income resulted from a $315 million increase in average earning assets, primarily due to a $303 million increase in average balances on deposit at the Federal Reserve, as well as a 2 basis point increase in the net interest margin.

The increase in net interest income compared to the third quarter of 2024 was the net result of a $17.6 million decline in interest expense, that exceeded a $15.6 million decline in interest income. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of a $1.18 billion decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities compared to the third quarter of 2024. The decline in interest-bearing liabilities was driven by a decrease in borrowings that resulted from the redemptions of Bank Term Funding Program ("BTFP") advances in the third quarter of 2024. Interest expense on borrowings declined by $14.9 million. Additionally, interest expense on deposits declined by $3.7 million as a result of a 12 basis point decrease in cost of deposits. The decrease in interest income was the result of a $1.06 billion decrease in average interest-earning assets compared to the third quarter of 2024, that coincided with the Company's deleveraging strategy of redeeming the BTFP advances. The yield on earning assets also declined by 11 basis points from 4.43% in the third quarter of 2024 to 4.32% in the third quarter of 2025.

Net Interest Margin

Our tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.33% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 3.31% for the second quarter of 2025 and 3.05% for the third quarter of 2024. The yield on our interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2025 increased to 4.32%, compared to 4.28% in the prior quarter, while our cost of funds increased to 1.05% for the third quarter of 2025, from 1.03% in the prior quarter. Loan yields increased in the third quarter of 2025 to 5.25%, from 5.22% in the second quarter of 2025. Investment yields, excluding fair value hedges, increased by 5 basis points compared to the prior quarter, while interest from the Federal Reserve declined by 4 basis points. The increase in our cost of funds from the prior quarter was due to a two-basis point increase in our cost of deposits to 0.86%, from 0.84%, and an increase in the average balance and cost of customer repurchase agreements. For the third quarter of 2025 average customer repurchase agreements were $456.2 million at a cost of 2.00%, compared to $376.6 million and 1.66% for the prior quarter.

Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2025 increased by 28 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2024, primarily as a result of 42 basis point decrease in cost of funds, to 1.05% for the third quarter of 2025, from 1.47% in the same quarter of last year. The decrease in cost of funds was primarily due to a $1.23 billion decline in average borrowings. For the third quarter of 2025, the Company had average deposits and customer repurchase agreements of $12.47 billion, at an average cost of 0.90%, and average borrowings of $500.0 million, at an average cost of 4.61%, compared to the third quarter of 2024 in which average deposits and customer repurchase agreements of $12.42 billion had an average cost of 1.01%, and borrowings averaged $1.73 billion, at an average cost of 4.77%. The decrease in cost of funds, exceeded the modest decrease in interest earning asset yields from 4.43% for the third quarter of 2024 to 4.32% in the third quarter of 2025. The decrease in earning asset yields was impacted by a decrease in loan yields from 5.31% for the third quarter of 2024 to 5.25% for the third quarter of 2025, and a 1.05% decrease in the yield on funds on deposit at the Federal Reserve.

Earning Assets and Deposits

Average earning assets increased by $315.0 million compared to the second quarter of 2025 and declined by $1.06 billion when compared to the third quarter of 2024. The average balance in funds held at the Federal Reserve increased by $303.4 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the second quarter of 2025, while average loans increased by $17.5 million and average investment securities decreased by $11.5 million for the same period. Compared to the third quarter of 2024, the decrease in average earning assets was due to decreases of $232.9 million in average loans, $244.1 million in average investment securities, and $581.3 million in funds held at the Federal Reserve. The average balance on noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $71.8 million, or 1.02%, from the second quarter of 2025 and the average balance on interest-bearing deposits and customer repurchase agreements increased by $217.0 million from the same period. Compared to the third quarter of 2024, the average balance on total deposits and customer repurchase agreements increased by $52.8 million, or 0.43%. On average, noninterest-bearing deposits were 59.28% of total deposits during the most recent quarter, compared to 59.72% for the second quarter of 2025 and 59.10% for the third quarter of 2024.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income was $13.0 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared with $14.7 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $12.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. Noninterest income decreased in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the second quarter primarily due to a $8.2 million loss on sales of available-for-sale securities in the third quarter of 2025, offset by a $6.4 million increase in other income. The increase in other income includes a $6.0 million legal settlement received in the third quarter of 2025.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2025 was $58.6 million, compared to $57.6 million for the second quarter of 2025 and $58.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. The $1.02 million quarter over quarter increase in noninterest expense includes a $500,000 provision for unfunded loan commitments in the third quarter. Salaries and benefits expense increased by $877,000 compared to the second quarter as a result of annual mid-year salary increases, while occupancy expense decreased by $283,000. The $260,000 decrease in noninterest expense from the third quarter of 2024 was the net result of decreases in most expense categories that were partially offset by a $444,000 increase in software expense related to technology investments and a $1.25 million increase in the provision for unfunded loan commitments.

As a percentage of average assets, noninterest expense was 1.50% for the third quarter of 2025, 1.52% for the second quarter of 2025, and 1.42% for the third quarter of 2024.

[TITLE]European aerospace groups reach framework deal on satellite merger, sources say:
[TEXT]
ROME/PARIS :European aerospace groups Leonardo, Airbus and Thales have reached a framework deal on a proposed merger of their satellite businesses, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Leonardo is scheduled to hold an extraordinary board meeting on Tuesday to discuss details of the deal, which is subject to board and regulatory approvals, one of the sources said.

Leonardo, Thales and Airbus declined to comment.

PROPOSED VENTURE AIMS TO COMPETE WITH ELON MUSK

Europe's largest satellite makers have been in talks for more than a year to create a new satellite manufacturing company to compete on a larger scale with rivals led by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which owns the highly successful Starlink service.

Reuters reported last month that the three groups had redoubled efforts to combine their satellite businesses into a roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.66 billion) joint venture modelled on the pan-European MBDA missiles business.

Code-named "Project Bromo," talks had hit a roadblock over the summer when the parties could not agree on governance and valuation, insiders said.

One of the sources said the talks, which involve dividing politically sensitive technology and jobs between France and Italy, had not been helped by the government crisis in Paris.

Problems have also included disputes over the politically sensitive share of work, according to French daily La Tribune.

ANTI-TRUST REVIEW

The key remaining hurdle, analysts say, will be getting past a competition review by the European Commission.

Previous attempts to merge satellite activities in the past decade foundered on anti-trust concerns and national rivalries.

But the dramatic rise of Musk's Starlink network and a shift in the market towards cheaper satellites have increased pressure on Europe to combine assets or be pushed out of the market.

The deal could take up to two years to implement and the initial umbrella deal is the first step, sources familiar with the matter said. Last week, Thales denied a report that a sought-after provisional deal had been reached at that time.

Europe's top satellite makers have long competed to build complex spacecraft in geostationary orbit but have been hit by the arrival of cheap tiny satellites in low Earth orbit.

The deal will combine loss-making satellite activities of Airbus with those of Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio - two ventures currently controlled by France's Thales and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.

Paris-based consultancy Novaspace says more than 43,000 satellites will launch over the next decade, representing a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services.
