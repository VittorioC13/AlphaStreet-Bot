[TITLE]BKT wheels into consumer segment:
[TEXT]
There are plenty of “non-sexy” businesses in the world that investors like Warren Buffet are famously said to love. One of them involves manufacturing off-highway tyres (OHT). Certainly, tyre maker Balkrishna Industries (BKT) has made its fortune in the space, exporting to 160 countries. It closed last financial year with revenues of roughly ₹10,615 crore, of which 70 per cent came from exports.

BKT now plans to wheel into the highly competitive consumer segment, besides strengthening its presence in India. Says Rajiv Poddar, joint managing director, BKT, “Our vision was to be a one-stop solution provider for everything off-road for our partners. Now, we are expanding that vision to include the on-road space as well.”

Poddar says commercial production for on-road tyres will begin in 2026. He says the company has earmarked an investment of ₹3,500 crore over the next three years. “Our investments are going into all our three verticals — off-road, on-road, and carbon black.” According to analysts, carbon black accounts for a good chunk of tyre manufacturing cost, so the backward linkage gives BKT good leverage.

The road ahead

The brand’s consumer tyres will be manufactured at its flagship factory in Bhuj, says Poddar. “It will be a brownfield in Bhuj. The work has started, and progressing as per our schedule.” The company has four manufacturing plants in India — two near Gurgaon, one in Aurangabad, and one in Bhuj, close to the seaport.

Given its export focus, how come BKT has no plants abroad, close to its markets? Responds Poddar, “I think we have been able to get the distribution right and make stock in adequate quantity to hit the end-user just in time.”

Poddar is the third-generation promoter in the tyre company, which was started by his grandfather Mahabirprasad, who incidentally hails from the Siyaram Silk Mills Poddar family (there was an amicable restructuring in 2013, disentangling cross-holdings). Poddar did his A levels in the UK, graduated in business administration and management, and returned in 2005 to enter the family business, where his dad, Arvind Poddar, was already in the thick of things. “I spent

[TITLE]How Balaji Wafers feeds Gujarat’s growth into a snack powerhouse:
[TEXT]
Last week, when snacks maker Balaji Wafers announced selling a 7 per cent stake to private equity firm General Atlantic — valuing the company at around $4 billion — people did a double take.

Wasn’t this the company PepsiCo sued for similarities in its chips packaging and design infringement? In fact, in 2020, the Bombay High Court had directed the Gujarat-based namkeen company to stop selling its ‘Rumbles’ chips, which allegedly looked a lot like the US cola giant’s Lay’s chips.

For Chandubhai Virani — the former canteen worker who built a snacks empire — this was just another minor speed breaker in his entrepreneurial journey, and he smartly revamped the design and forged ahead with his business.

While GA is in the final stages of clinching the deal, Balaji’s snacks had several suitors including, ironically, PepsiCo, ITC, General Mills and other PE firms.

This is the second major deal in the Indian snacks segment this year, after Temasek acquired a 10 per cent stake in Haldiram’s at a valuation of $10 billion.

The Balaji advantage

The decentralised production model and tightly-knit farm linkages of Balaji Wafers Pvt Ltd — celebrated for its founder’s rags-to-riches story — have helped trigger a ‘Gujarat snacks cluster effect’, drawing dozens of small and mid-sized processors into the ecosystem over the past two decades. “One of the better things

The Inland Waterways Authority of India IWAI ), the nodal agency for development of waterways under the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways (MoPSW), has signed two key Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) to strengthen Assam’s inland water transport network and industrial logistics.The agreements—one with Assam Petro-Chemicals Ltd. (APL) and another with the Government of Assam—aim to promote the movement of cargo and passengers through the state’s extensive river systems, advancing the goals of sustainable connectivity and regional growth.The Union Minister of Ports, Shipping & Waterways (MoPSW), Sarbananda Sonowal chaired a comprehensive review meeting with senior officials of the ministry as well as the IWAI on all projects in Assam, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya, including those under Central Sector Scheme (CSS).At the IMW, the first MoU between IWAI and Assam Petro-Chemicals Ltd. (APL) aims to collaborate for transportation of Methanol and Formalin through the Indo-Bangladesh Protocol Route (IBPR) and National Waterways (NW). The initiative will facilitate exports from IWAI jetties at Bogibeel, Pandu, and Jogighopa to destinations in Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, while also strengthening domestic supply chains through National Waterways-1 and 2.The project aligns with the Government of India’s flagship initiative, PM Gati Shakti – National Master Plan for Multi-Modal Connectivity and is expected to significantly enhance Assam’s export and industrial potential. APL currently produces 1.98 lakh metric tonnes of Methanol and 1.15 lakh metric tonnes of Formalin annually, and the new arrangement will enable bulk, cost-effective, and eco-friendly transportation of these products. The total investment for the initiative is pegged at Rs 400 crore, covering the procurement of tanker vessels and related infrastructure.IWAI will provide comprehensive operational and technical support, including facilities at its Bogibeel, Pandu, and Jogighopa terminals, navigation assistance, bunkering facilities, and firefighting systems. It will also help APL develop 10 flat-bottom tanker barges with capacities between 500 and 1,000 metric tonnes. APL will coordinate logistics, vessel operations, and statutory clearances to ensure seamless cargo movement.The second MoU, signed between IWAI and the Government of Assam, focuses on the development and promotion of an Urban Water Transport (UWT) System, or Water Metro, in Tezpur, Guwahati, and Dibrugarh.Sonowal said, “These MoUs mark a major step forward in realizing the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi whose leadership continues to transform the Northeast into a hub of inland waterway connectivity and industrial opportunity. We remain firmly anchored in our intent to develop the inland waterways ecosystem in the region for optimum utilization and explore possibilities and convert them into tangible opportunities that drive growth, trade, and sustainability.”The review meet, held at the Maritime Skill Development Centre (MSDC), focused on 15 primary projects in progress as well as 10 Central Sector Scheme (CSS) projects including 3 in Mizoram, 2 in Nagaland, 2 in Tripura and 1 each in Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur. Two recommended new projects under CSS, one each in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, were also discussed at the event. The meeting also cleared a Concept Study for an all-weather approach road at Bogibeel for smooth passage to the Cargo-cum-Tourist terminal.The Inland Waterways Authority of India signed an agreement with Heritage River Journeys Pvt. Ltd. to develop and induct new cruise vessels and expand cruising operations on the national waterways. The partnership aims to strengthen premium tourism experiences and tap the heritage and natural appeal of the Brahmaputra and other major rivers. The value of the MoU stands at Rs 500 crores.IWAI and the Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships (DGLL) have signed an MoU to establish a collaborative framework aimed at enhancing river navigation safety and promoting tourism along National Waterway 2 (NW-2) in Assam. The partnership envisions the development and establishment of river lighthouses and allied infrastructure at Bogibeel, Silghat, Biswanath Ghat, and Pandu, which will serve as vital aids to navigation and help ensure safer passage for vessels operating along the Brahmaputra. The MoU exchange aims to unlock the tourism potential of river lighthouses by promoting them as hubs for eco-tourism and heritage tourism.A landmark MoU with Rhenus Logistics at Rs 1,000 crores will enable induction of modern tug-barges on the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers, significantly enhancing cargo transportation capacity and improving multimodal logistics efficiency for the Northeast. In addition, for the development of cruise terminals at Neamati, Silghat, Biswanath Ghat and Guijan, an investment of Rs 299 crore has been earmarked.In Mizoram, IWAI is advancing key inland water transport projects in Mizoram to strengthen regional connectivity and river-based mobility. Study is underway for IWT infrastructure on the Tlawng River and the Chhimtuipui River, with project values of Rs 0.89 crore and Rs 1.42 crore respectively.Additionally, construction work has commenced under Stage-I of the Rs 9.82-crore project for developing IWT infrastructure on the Khawthlangtuipui–Tuichawng stretch in Lunglei district. The project includes two river terminals at Thekaduar and Tlabung, two HDPE floating jetties with floating gangways, and new passenger boats equipped with outboard jets, enabling safer and more efficient passenger movement in the region.In Nagaland, IWAI is preparing DPRs for developing Inland Water Transport facilities at Doyang Lake and for promoting water sports and tourism at Noune and Shilloi Lakes under CSS. In Manipur, a Techno-Economic Feasibility study and DPR has been proposed for developing IWT on the Barak River and its tributaries, as well as the Imphal and Nambul rivers in Manipur under the CSS. In Meghalaya, DPR for developing IWT infrastructure on Umiam Lake and the Umngot River (NW-106) are being conducted.In Tripura, IWAI is advancing two key initiatives to strengthen regional connectivity and tourism. A project valued at Rs 24.53 crore has been taken up to develop the Gumti River and establish navigational linkage with the Meghna river system in Bangladesh.The project includes development of a navigational channel, bank protection works, construction of nine floating pontoon terminals, and installation of navigational aids. Additionally, study is going on for the introduction of a cruise ship service on Dumbur Lake in Dhalai district aimed at boosting tourism and leisure-based river travel in the state.A proposal has been initiated for the development of Inland Water Transport (IWT) infrastructure on the Siang River in Arunachal Pradesh. The project includes construction of terminals with associated facilities such as buildings, sheds, internal roads, pathways, fencing, wharves, and solar infrastructure, along with installation of floating jetties, fairway development and navigational aids. The proposal also includes provision of vessels such as ferry services, FRP boats and high-speed leisure boats to support passenger mobility and tourism.

[TITLE]U.S. moves to tame the skies as disruptive passenger incidents reach new highs:
[TEXT]
The U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday launched a nationwide campaign urging travelers to improve their behavior at airports and on flights, as disruptive incidents remain far above pre-pandemic levels.

The effort, called "The Golden Age of Travel Starts with You," aims to restore civility in the skies and address a surge in disruptive behavior. The department said the initiative is meant to "jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel."

Disruptive passenger incidents doubled in 2024 compared with 2019, while in-flight outbursts — ranging from inappropriate behavior to physical attacks — surged 400% by 2025.

The Department of Transportation said the campaign aimed to improve the travel experience while ensuring the safety of passengers, flight crew and airport staff.

In a video promoting the campaign, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged travelers to consider their conduct, asking whether they help pregnant passengers or older adults with overhead luggage, or simply say "please" and "thank you."

He also asked passengers to "dress with respect" ahead of the holiday travel season.

[TITLE]Xcel Energy seeks $355.5M revenue hike, increasing residential bills nearly 10% on average:
[TEXT]
Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has asked state regulators for an increase of $355.5 million to its rate base, which would boost the average residential electric bill by nearly 10% per month.

Xcel filed the proposal Friday with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which will take testimony from the company and various intervening parties and hold a public hearing. If approved, the increase would take effect in September 2026.

Xcel Energy-Colorado President Robert Kenney said the utility’s last increase to the rate base was in 2022. The average residential bill rose by 3.2%, according to an Xcel statement after an agreement was reached with all the parties

The rate base is a utility’s investments to provide services and on which it’s allowed to earn a regulated rate of return.

“This rate case is to recover costs associated with investments that we’ve made over the last three years,” Kenney said.

The Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, said the proposed increase is “too big of an increase.”

“It’s an especially large increase given the context of the economic times,” said Joseph Pereira, UCA deputy director.

The increase is largely related to Xcel’s expanded capital spending on distribution, transmission and generation, Pereira said.

“It’s unclear to parties in the UCA that the company is prioritizing investments that are the biggest bang for the buck, that increase reliability and that adopt an intelligent approach to how they’re using the grid,” Pereira said. “It still appears that the company is using a crude blanket approach to replacing and investing in new infrastructure.”

Kenney said Xcel has invested in safety, reliability, making the system more resilient, electrifying transportation and buildings, meeting increased demands from growth and taking steps to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

Xcel has said it has reduced carbon emissions by 57%. The state’s target is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2030.

Xcel is upgrading its electric grid with a $1.7 billion transmission project. The Colorado Power Pathway includes transmission lines, power substations and other equipment stretching over 12 counties, mostly in eastern Colorado.

“We’ve added a tremendous amount of renewable energy over the last several years,” Kenney said. “And we’ve done all of this while keeping bills as low as possible.”

Xcel has faced criticism over the past few years for what the UCA has called “a pancaking of rate increases.”

The criticism of Xcel and other regulated utilities heated up in 2023 after a cold winter and high natural gas prices sent costs soaring statewide. A legislative committee held hearings and approved a bill intended to protect customers against future price shocks and level what some see as a playing field tilted in the utilities’ favor.

Kenney said Xcel Energy’s rates have been well below state and national averages for approximately the last 10 years. But, he added, the company recognizes that some customers face challenges to paying their bills. He said Xcel is expanding its programs to help people struggling to pay their bills and adding $10 million in assistance. People can also call 800-895-4999.

In the past, Xcel required people to show proof of income to apply for help, but now will accept their statements of need. And those receiving other aid, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will be automatically eligible.

Under Xcel’s proposed rate hike, the average monthly residential bill would rise 9.9%; small commercial bills would go up 9.3%-9.4% per month; and large commercial monthly bills would increase 7.3%-8.6%.

Jerusalem: The authority spearheading Tel Aviv's ambitious $50-billion metro rail project is eager to bring seasoned Indian metro companies on board, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said."Israel has expressed a deep desire that Indian companies come forward and bid aggressively in the project," Goyal told ET on Saturday.Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA) - Israel government's agency overseeing the project - opened the prequalification process for the metro's first phase in Tel Aviv, a city that is home to 44% of Israel's population and nearly half of its jobs.Highlighting India's formidable metro-building credentials - 23 cities and more than 1,000 km of networks - Goyal added, "Several Indian firms, both public and private, have experience in metro construction. Israel is keen that India becomes a key part of the project. I hope our companies show interest and join the bidding process."While the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has helped build subway systems in Bangladesh and Bahrain, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) - the operator of the Hyderabad Metro - has been involved in constructing the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit in Indonesia as well as the Mauritius Light Rail Transit System.In August, state-owned BEML clinched its first international metro contract, a small $1-million order from Malaysia."This single project in Tel Aviv is worth ₹4.5 lakh crore - that's the scale of opportunity awaiting Indian companies in Israel," Goyal said, adding that he had discussed the prospects with Itamar Ben Meir, CEO of the NTA. "The project will involve 300 km of tunneling, considering both directions."According to the Tel Aviv metro plan, the subway network will comprise three lines covering 150 km, with 109 stations and four depots to support operations. Phase 1 alone includes 78 km of twin tunnels and 59 stations, representing an investment of $20 billion.The pace of designing and executing the ambitious project slowed after the October 7, 2023 attacks and the subsequent conflict in Gaza."Once an Indian company begins supplying equipment (should it win the contract), it will generate jobs back home. Moreover, young Indian men and women will travel to Tel Aviv to help set up the metro project," Goyal said, highlighting the wider ripple effects of securing what is set to become the most expensive infrastructure project in Israel's history.According to Israeli media reports, the NTA aims to attract bidders from Europe, India, and South Korea.Before meeting Goyal in Tel Aviv, and as part of its pre-tender outreach, CEO Ben Meir led a delegation to South Korea to meet executives from major firms, including Hyundai and Samsung.

[TITLE]The next big disruption: How India can build a climate-smart fisheries economy by 2030:
[TEXT]
India’s climate-smart fisheries pathway to 2030 is now being driven by very recent policy moves and budget-linked programmes. The focus has shifted to scaling modern systems (RAS, biofloc, digital platforms, seaweed, EEZ rules) with ring‑fenced funding and timelines under PMMSY, PM‑MKSSY and the 2025–26 Budget.

The Union Budget 2025–26 proposed the highest-ever annual allocation of ₹2,703.67 crore for the fisheries sector, explicitly to deepen modernisation and sustainability. The same policy note confirms that PMMSY has been extended up to 2025–26, with projects worth ₹21,274.16 crore already approved for hatcheries, modern pond systems, cold chains, landing centres and digitalisation of value chains. PM‑MKSSY, a Central Sector sub‑scheme (₹6,000 crore; 2023‑24 to 2026‑27), is designed to formalise the sector, universalise aquaculture insurance, and push technology adoption and quality systems across the value chain.

Technology priorities built into PMMSY/PM‑MKSSY

The latest PMMSY presentation and “5 years of PMMSY” note highlight a clear tilt toward climate‑smart, tech‑heavy infrastructure.

1. Biofloc and intensive aquaculture units: Biofloc‑based farms are funded as a distinct activity under PMMSY and showcased in the 5‑year compendium; new units are being financed up to 2025‑26 to reduce water use and increase productivity in both freshwater and brackish systems.

2. Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS): RAS construction is an eligible PMMSY component and features in state‑level project lists, especially for cold‑water and peri‑urban production.

3. Smart landing centres and harbours: The 2025 PIB brochure lists “smart technologies: online auctioning, AI tools, IoT systems, and port management software” as explicit features of new/modernised fishing harbours and landing sites sanctioned by July 2025.

4. Insurance and credit rails for tech adoption: PM‑MKSSY funds aquaculture insurance products and formal credit (via KCC and NBFC/bank linkages) for small producers to invest in RAS, biofloc and other intensive technologies.

National fisheries digital platform: Future‑facing digital core

The National Fisheries Digital Platform (NFDP) was launched in 2024 and is being scaled through 2026‑27 as PM‑MKSSY’s digital backbone.

● By March 2025, it had registered more than 20 lakh fishers, farmers, and micro‑enterprises, providing a work‑based digital identity and unified interface for credit, insurance, subsidies and training.

● Budget‑linked plans include integration of e‑auction modules, traceability, and satellite‑based advisories into this platform so that small‑scale fishers can access climate and price information in one place.

New regulatory architecture for the EEZ

Budget 2025–26 announced an “enabling framework for sustainable fisheries from the Indian EEZ and high seas”, with focus on Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep.

● In November 2025, the government notified Rules for “Sustainable Harnessing of Fisheries in the EEZ”, fulfilling this Budget pledge.

● These Rules are linked to India’s Blue Economy strategy and aim to regulate deep‑sea and distant‑water fishing, allocate fishing opportunities, and embed monitoring and reporting requirements that can later plug into digital tracking and low‑carbon fleet policies.

This is important going forward because any shift to fuel‑efficient or hybrid vessels, mandatory VMS/AIS‑based tracking, or carbon‑linked subsidies can now be implemented within this EEZ framework.

Seaweed and coastal blue economy: Forward pipeline

On the seaweed side, the government’s future plan is framed by:

● NITI Aayog’s “Strategy for the Development of Seaweed Value Chain” which identifies ~24,700 ha of suitable sites and calls for seed banks, farmer producer organisations, and integration with agri‑markets.

● A 2024 PIB note on “Development of Seaweed in Coastal Areas” links this strategy to PMMSY/PM‑MKSSY funding and explicitly mentions support for nurseries, rafts, processing units and research on high‑value species.

ICAR‑CMFRI’s 2025 updates from Lakshadweep show that this is not legacy experimentation but a scaling trajectory: the administration, guided by CMFRI, is expanding commercial seaweed farms, mobilising SHGs, and positioning it as a climate‑resilient livelihood in line with the blue‑economy agenda.

Where India is headed by 2030

2025–26 will see the completion of the first phase of PMMSY, extended with a strong emphasis on intensive aquaculture systems such as RAS and biofloc, alongside the development of smart harbours, cold-chain capacity and wider digitalisation. During this period, PM-MKSSY will be operationalised across all states and Union Territories to support formalisation, insurance coverage and robust quality-assurance systems.

By 2026–27, PM-MKSSY will be fully rolled out, with the National Fisheries Digital Platform (NFDP) serving as a universal registry and service backbone. Traceability systems and e-auction networks will expand significantly, while aquaculture insurance is expected to reach far deeper coverage nationwide.

Looking ahead to 2030, India’s fisheries and aquaculture sector is poised for a structural shift. A growing share of production will come from intensive, climate-resilient systems—RAS, biofloc and tank-based farming—that optimise water use and reduce environmental impact. End-to-end digital value chains will connect harbours to export markets, powered by NFDP and state-level smart-harbour ecosystems. Deep-sea and EEZ fisheries will be more widely regulated in line with Blue Economy and climate-commitment goals, guided by the new EEZ rules and NITI Aayog’s emerging deep-sea strategy. Meanwhile, seaweed cultivation and other low-impact coastal enterprises are expected to scale through PMMSY/PM-MKSSY and state initiatives, supporting livelihoods while adding meaningful carbon-sequestration co-benefits.

JPMorgan Chase announced a sudden increase in investments in critical U.S. industries, such as energy and defense, noting the firm will increase its previous 10-year $1 trillion commitment by 50%, to $1.5 trillion.

This initiative will begin with a $10 billion investment primarily into select American companies to help enhance growth, spur innovation and accelerate strategic manufacturing.

Must Read

“It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing — all of which are essential for our national security,” Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorganChase, said in a statement (1).

“Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America’s economy. America needs more speed and investment. It also needs to remove obstacles that stand in the way: excessive regulations, bureaucratic delay, partisan gridlock and an education system not aligned to the skills we need.”

The four key industries the company plans to focus on include supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience, and frontier and strategic technologies.

Following the Trump administration’s lead

On Oct. 10, after Beijing announced extensive new export control rules on rare earth minerals and other technologies, the Trump administration retaliated with an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. President Donald Trump also cancelled his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

In October alone, the U.S. imported 5,473 metric tons of rare earth minerals from China, according to data from the General Administration of Customs (2).

As a way to reduce U.S. dependence on China, the Trump administration has begun investing in these critical mineral industries, and the Pentagon plans to procure up to $1 billion worth of critical minerals as part of a global stockpiling spree, according to a Financial Times report (3).

“China’s ability to turn off the supply of these critical minerals would have a direct, palpable and adverse effect on U.S. ability to field the kind of high-tech capabilities that we’re going to need for any kind of strategic competition or conflict,” Stephanie Barna, a lawyer at Covington & Burling, told the Financial Times.
