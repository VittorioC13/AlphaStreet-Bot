[TITLE]US$20bil photonic AI manufacturing city to be built in Nilai, says Aminuddin:
[TEXT]
SEREMBAN: An advanced photonic AI manufacturing city will be developed on a 1,200ha area in Nilai near here, says Datuk Seri Aminuddin Harun.

The Mentri Besar said the project, touted to be the first large-scale photonic computing and semiconductor initiative of its kind in the world, would involve an investment of some US$20bil over a five-year period.

"This will be one of the first large-scale photonic semiconductor manufacturing hubs in South- East Asia, and among the first globally, establishing Negri Sembilan as a leader in the future of advanced manufacturing.

"It is expected to deliver major benefits such as 40,000 high-paying skilled jobs, 20,000 indirect jobs across supporting industries and with a total of 60,000 long-term employment opportunities," he said in a statement.

Aminuddin said the project, which would position Malaysia at the forefront of the next global computing era, was a collaboration between Mehamood Hosein, founder of the Hosein Family Office, a United States-based deep-technology office and Gan Family Office led by Tan Sri Gan Kong Seng.

Gan is also Nilai Resources Group Bhd chairman.

"The Hosein Family Office brings the core photonic AI compute platform, long-term engineering and architectural leadership, engagement with international institutional investors and a development vision planned at a scale of approximately US$20bil over five years.

"Tan Sri Gan and his family office are contributing 1,200ha of prime land in Nilai, construction leadership and integrated infrastructure development and master planning for a world-class technology and industrial city.

"This ensures the Nilai Advanced Photonic AI Manufacturing City is developed on strong Malaysian foundations and built to international standards," he said, adding that the partnership will lead to Malaysia receiving world-class technology and global investment engagement to establish a sovereign photonic AI manufacturing capability.

Aminuddin said the development would include photonic chipset integration facilities, glass interposer and waveguide factories, AI compute system assembly lines, a national real-time AI and digital twin research centre, a deep-tech engineering and technology training academy and a modern integrated township to support industry and workforce growth.

"Photonic architecture is widely regarded as the next platform for semiconductor technology for the future, providing the performance, scale, and efficiency required to support advanced AI, national digital infrastructure, and next-generation industrial systems.

"This positions Malaysia among the first nations to build the semiconductor platform of the future," he added.

He added that the development will also position Malaysia as one of the few nations capable of producing the next generation of high-performance AI compute systems that will power future economies.
