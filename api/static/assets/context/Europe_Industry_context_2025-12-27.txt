[TITLE]India’s first indigenous MRI scanner built by Zoho-backed VoxelGrids:
[TEXT]
In a major milestone for Made-In-India medtech, VoxelGrids, a Zoho-backed start-up, has developed the country’s first indigenous MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scanner.

The scanner, which has been deployed at Chandrapur Cancer Care Foundation near Nagpur, is the culmination of a 12-year mission by Founder Arjun Arunachalam and his team to domestically design and build an MRI system – a critical diagnostic tool for hospitals, which currently relies almost entirely on foreign imports.

Interestingly, the machine, with a Magnetic Field Strength of 1.5 tesla, is not just a locally made version of MRIs from global giants like Siemens or GE HealthCare but comes with its own technological advancements, he told businessline. VoxelGrids’ MRI scanners, due to the absence of liquid helium, are around 40 per cent cheaper to build, he added.

“Additionally, we have been able to make the electronics around the magnet extremely well-packaged while maintaining the same bore-size making it far more power efficient and reducing operating costs exponentially,” he said.

Arunachalam added that the company also offers pay-per-use models, allowing hospitals to pay for MRI machines dynamically over time. This is particularly important for smaller hospitals that may not be able to afford the high one-time cost, thereby significantly expanding MRI footprint in India, he said.

The improved footprint would be crucial, as recent industry analyses indicate only around 5,000 MRI machines in India, an estimated density of 3.5 machines per million people. According to a market study by the Competition Commission of India, the top 5 OEMs (Siemens, GE, Philips, United Imaging, and Hitachi) have over 91 per cent market share in terms of revenue in the MRI market in India.

Arunachalam adds that while the company has not yet made a full commercial launch, it already has the capacity to make 20-25 such scanners per year at its Bengaluru manufacturing facility. “We have had a lot of interest from many hospitals and are expecting a commercial launch by the end of this fiscal year,” he said.

The company had secured $5 million in funding from Zoho and will eye a larger round as it approaches volume production, he added.

Looking ahead, VoxelGrids’ team is also working to further improve their MRI machines, including developing a containerised mobile version. Though the current focus is on serving domestic demand, Arunachalam did not rule out an export market in the long term.

[TITLE]Pet care is set to become India’s next FMCG battleground in 2026:
[TEXT]
Drools has been the closest competitor to Mars in recent years, but the influx of new FMCG players is expected to reshape pricing dynamics. Industry experts, however, believe the impact will be measured. “Reliance will be an important player, but I don’t see it dominating any time soon,” commented Santosh Sreedhar, partner at Avalon Consulting. He noted that Reliance’s scale would come through its retail chain, not the broader distribution network built over years by Mars or Drools. Sreedhar expects Waggies and HappyFur to cater to the mid-lower price band, while significant acceleration might occur in the mid-premium segment, balancing affordability and quality for large-scale adoption.

[TITLE]Emerge's 2025 Story of the Year: How the AI Race Fractured the Global Tech Order:
[TEXT]
In brief DeepSeek’s ultra-low-cost AI model shattered the assumption that U.S. chip dominance would indefinitely suppress China’s AI ambitions, triggering a global tech realignment.

By late 2025, the U.S. and China had severely decoupled their AI ecosystems—splitting hardware, software, standards, and supply chains—while embedding civilian AI advances into military doctrine.

The rivalry extended beyond bilateral conflict, forcing allies and emerging economies to choose between American-led proprietary control and China’s open-source influence, all while rare earths, data centers, and defense contracts became frontline assets in a new cold war over intelligence itself.

The great unraveling began with a single number: $256,000. DeepSeek, a year-old Chinese startup, claimed it spent that relatively small sum training an AI model that matched the capabilities of OpenAI—which spent over a hundred million dollars to get to the same place. When the app hit Apple's store in January, Nvidia lost $600 billion in a single trading day, which was the largest one-day wipeout in market history.

The technical feat aside, DeepSeek’s efficiency breakthrough quickly ignited a global contest far beyond benchmarks or code. Nvidia's China market share had collapsed from 95% to zero. Beijing banned all foreign AI chips from government data centers. The Pentagon signed $10 billion in AI defense contracts. And the world's two largest economies had split the technology stack into warring camps, from silicon to software to standards.

The AI war of 2025 was redrawing the map of global power.

DeepSeek's breakthrough exposed a strategic miscalculation that had defined American AI policy for years: the belief that controlling advanced chips would permanently cripple China's ambitions. The company trained its R1 model using older H800 GPUs—chips that fell below export control thresholds—proving that algorithmic efficiency could compensate for hardware disadvantages.

"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen—and as open source, a profound gift to the world," venture capitalist Marc Andreessen posted on X after testing it.

The AI market entered panic mode. Stocks tanked, politicians started polishing their patriotic speeches, analysis exposed the intricacies of what could end up in a bubble, and enthusiasts mocked American models that cost orders of magnitude more than the Chinese counterparts, which were free, cheap and required a fraction of the money and resources to train.

Washington's response was swift and punishing. The Trump administration expanded export controls throughout the year, banning even downgraded chips designed specifically for the Chinese market. By April, Trump restricted Nvidia from shipping its H20 chips.

“While the Nvidia news is concerning, it’s not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides,” Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Secruities, told CNN.

The tit-for-tat escalated into full decoupling. A new China's directive issued in September banned Nvidia, AMD, and Intel chips from any data center receiving government money—a market worth over $100 billion since 2021. Jensen Huang revealed the company's market share in China had hit "zero, compared to 95% in 2022."

﻿

“At the moment, we are 100% out of China,” Huang said. “I can’t imagine any policymaker thinking that’s a good idea—that whatever policy we implemented caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world to zero.” He called U.S. policy "a mistake" that would backfire by accelerating Chinese chip independence.

He was right. Huawei and domestic players like Cambricon now dominate China's AI infrastructure. By year's end, analysts projected Chinese chipmakers would capture 40% of the domestic AI server market—a stunning reversal from near-total American dominance just three years earlier.

But the semiconductor war was only the surface. Beneath it, America deployed its most potent weapon: control over the economics of the global market, setting up an "AI Action Plan" in July and a policy of tariffs and sanctions aimed at cementing its political and financial dominance.

In response, China began to exert control over the physical elements that make modern technology possible. In October, Beijing announced the strictest rare earth export controls in its history. The new restrictions didn't just limit sales—they applied the Foreign Direct Product Rule to rare earths for the first time, meaning even products made outside China using Chinese rare earth technology would require export licenses. Companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries would be automatically denied.

The target was unmistakable: America's defense industrial base. China controls 94% of permanent magnet production and 90% of rare earth refining—the elements essential for F-35 fighter jets, Tomahawk missiles, and the AI chips that power autonomous weapons. The expanded controls covered holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, each critical to defense systems.

The U.S. wasn’t caught flat-footed. In July, the Pentagon had invested $400 million in MP Materials, America's only rare earth miner, becoming its largest shareholder. The deal included a 10-year price floor of $110 per kilogram—nearly double the market rate—to protect domestic production from Chinese price dumping. But even with this investment, MP Materials would produce just 1,000 tons of neodymium-boron-iron magnets by year's end—less than 1% of China's 138,000-ton output.

"It's scandalous that we don't have a rare earths strategic reserve," University of Pennsylvania finance professor Jeremy Siegel told CNBC. The supply chain warfare had exposed a vulnerability more fundamental than chip design: America's military depended on adversary-controlled minerals to function.

The AI battle of the titans is continuing. In late November, Trump signed an executive order launching the Genesis Mission—a Department of Energy-led AI initiative the White House compared in "urgency and ambition" to the Manhattan Project.

The Genesis Mission aims to build an integrated AI platform that would harness decades of federal scientific datasets to train "scientific foundation models" and deploy AI agents for autonomous research and discovery. Its goals range from nuclear fusion to advanced manufacturing to semiconductor development, with the platform designed to give American researchers access to supercomputing resources and proprietary datasets no Chinese lab could match.

But whether the $400 million already invested in rare earth mining or the Genesis Mission's national laboratory network can offset China's manufacturing dominance remains unclear—but Washington is now treating AI supremacy as a matter of wartime urgency.

From trade war to actual war?

It turns out that China's advancements were the product of a Military-Civil Fusion Strategy, as the Marine Corps call it. Under Xi Jinping's oversight, China started to create an integrated ecosystem where nearly every technological advance can also serve military purposes.

PLA strategists envision AI transforming not just weapons but warfare itself. Large language models would conduct cognitive operations, manipulating adversary perceptions and decision-making. Swarms of obsolete fighters converted to autonomous drones would overwhelm defenses through sheer scale. The goal: transition to "intelligentized warfare" where speed of decision-making—measured in milliseconds—determines victory.

In the west, Silicon Valley's relationship with the Pentagon also underwent its own revolution. Tech giants that once banned military work now competed for defense contracts worth hundreds of billions. The whole trend started back in December 2024, when Palantir and Anduril announced a consortium to build AI infrastructure for the military.

OpenAI, which had prohibited weapons applications, reversed course and signed defense partnerships with the Pentagon. Google, which abandoned Project Maven in 2018 after employee protests, quietly returned with a $200 million Pentagon contract in July. Anthropic also started to adopt a more anti-China political stance, urging governments to intervene to hinder China's advances and securing a western dominance of the industry.

The battle for the consumer

While hardware wars raged and militaries mobilized, American companies staged a comeback in AI's most visible consumer domain: video generation. OpenAI's Sora 2, released in September, set new standards with synchronized audio, 4K resolution, and multi-shot storytelling. Google's Veo 3 and its 3.1 update followed, leveraging unrestricted access to H100 and H200 chips that Chinese competitors couldn't obtain.

Just a few months earlier, China's Kuaishou and other firms had led text-to-video development. Now American firms dominated, proving that in compute-intensive domains, hardware access remained decisive.

The American resurgence extended beyond video to the foundational models themselves. In November, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5—what the company called "the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use." The model became the first to break 80% on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark measuring real-world software engineering capabilities, outperforming both OpenAI's GPT-5.1 and Google's Gemini 3 Pro. Anthropic claimed the model scored higher on its internal engineering tests than any human job candidate ever had. For an industry that had spent January panicking over DeepSeek's efficiency breakthrough, Claude Opus 4.5 served as a reminder that American labs still held the performance crown—at least for now.

China vs. world: Open-source models fight it out

2025 was also a great year for open-source models. In fact, one could argue that this was the year open-source AI caught up—and, again, it involved its own dose of the good old China vs America drama.

Image: NBC

Alibaba's Qwen family alone accounted for 40% of new language models uploaded monthly to Hugging Face, spawning over 100,000 derivatives and 600 million downloads. The open approach built soft power that export controls couldn't touch—developers worldwide could run Chinese models without restriction, creating a parallel ecosystem independent of American infrastructure.

And how can you prevent a global adoption of free open source models? With regulations.

China's DeepSeek faced bans across dozens of countries. Italy moved first in January, blocking the app over data privacy violations. Taiwan, Australia, South Korea, and multiple U.S. states and agencies followed. By July, NATO allies including the Czech Republic branded DeepSeek a "Trojan horse" for Beijing's intelligence services.

Meta's Llama used to be the most popular LLM in the community; the fourth generation was released this year. OpenAI also released GPT-oss, its only open source model in years. Besides that, the open-source LLM community didn't see much hype in America. Ai2 released a family of models trained in America from scratch, and other companies, including Perplexity, fine-tuned DeepSeek to make it more pro-US and anti-China in its responses.

Not everything is rivalry, though, when developers leave geopolitical fights aside and work towards common goals, they come up with nice products. The models developed by Nous Research—a research team from America, China, Europe and the UAE—is a good example of that.

Besides the China-US Cold-War 2.0, other governments also started to get more involved in AI, setting it as a key element of their public agendas.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE pledged $2 trillion in AI investments during Trump's May visit—money dwarfing American hyperscaler spending. Saudi Arabia's $600 billion commitment included partnerships with Nvidia, AMD, Google Cloud, and AWS to build 2,200 megawatts of data center capacity—more than four times the UAE's 500 megawatts.

Both nations walked a tightrope, wanting American chips and expertise while maintaining deep China ties through Huawei-built telecommunications infrastructure. Washington demanded they choose sides, imposing strict controls to ensure AI hardware didn't reach Beijing or Moscow.

Europe too mounted its own sovereignty bid. The European Commission unveiled a €200 billion InvestAI initiative in April, targeting AI gigafactories and data infrastructure to reduce dependence on American and Chinese technology. But by year's end, the €200 billion remained largely aspirational. Europe allocated just 18% of its €252 billion in venture capital to AI between 2020-2025, compared to America's 34% of $1.33 trillion.

The fracturing carries profound implications. Trade patterns are realigning. Military doctrines are being rewritten around AI-enabled warfare. Developing nations face pressure to choose between eastern and western standards—decisions that will shape their digital governance for decades.

China's bet on open-source democratization versus America's proprietary model represents competing visions of technological power. Beijing seeks influence through freely available tools that create dependencies subtler than export controls. Washington relies on maintaining leads in frontier capabilities and controlling access to the most powerful systems.

Neither strategy guarantees victory. China's open models gain adoption but sacrifice economic returns that fund development. America's closed systems generate revenue but risk irrelevance if developers migrate to unrestricted alternatives. Europe… is being Europe.

What began as a trade dispute over AI chips has metastasized into full-spectrum competition encompassing technology, ideology, resources, and military doctrine. China weaponized its rare earth monopoly. America mobilized its defense industrial base. Both nations fused civilian innovation with military applications in a race toward AI-enabled warfare that has no precedent in history.

The silicon iron curtain that descended in 2025 may prove as consequential as the one that divided Europe for half a century. Only this time, the fault line runs through every smartphone, data center, autonomous system, and permanent magnet that powers modern civilization. The great divide has begun.

[TITLE]Activist Ananym Capital urges LKQ to sell its European auto parts business:
[TEXT]
Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.

Activist: Ananym Capital Management

Ownership: 0.39%

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.

What's happening

On Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

Behind the scenes

LKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers.

The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers.

Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint.

Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.

LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount.

The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000 . However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock.

In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.

Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment.

Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries.

Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.

The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA.

The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA.

The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price.

While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone , and Genuine Parts , may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that.

Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.

In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time.

If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders.

Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

[TITLE]Stocks See Support from Economic Confidence After Strong US GDP Report:
[TEXT]
The Wall Street sign is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange by hapabapa via iStock

The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Tuesday rose +0.46%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) rose +0.16%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) rose +0.50%. March E-mini S&P futures (ESH26) rose +0.42%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH26) rose +0.49%.

Stock indexes closed higher on Tuesday on reinforced confidence in US economic fundamentals after the stronger-than-expected US Q3 GDP report of +4.3%, although most of the other economic reports were weaker-than-expected. In any case, stocks were undercut as the odds for a Fed rate cut at the next meeting on Jan 27-28 dropped to 13% from 20%. Also, the 10-year T-note yield rose slightly.

US Q3 real GDP rose +4.3% (q/q annualized), stronger than expectations of +3.3% and the Q2 rate of +2.5%. The Q3 GDP Price Index rose +3.8% (q/q annualized), much stronger than expectations of +2.7% and up from Q2’s +2.1%. The Q3 core PCE Price Index rose +2.9% (q/q annualized), in line with expectations but up from Q2’s +2.6%.

The Conference Board’s Dec US consumer confidence index fell by -3.8 points to 89.1 from Nov’s revised level of 92.9 (preliminary 88.7), weaker than expectations for a report of 91.0.

The Dec Philadelphia Fed non-manufacturing index fell by -0.5 points to -16.8 from -16.3 in Nov, which was weaker than expectations for a rise to -15.0.

Oct durable goods orders fell -2.2% m/m, which was weaker than expectations of -1.5%. Oct durable goods orders ex-transportation rose +0.2% m/m, slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.3%. Oct core capital goods orders (ex transportation and defense), a proxy for capital spending, rose +0.5% m/m, which was slightly stronger than market expectations of +0.3%.

Nov US industrial production fell -0.1% m/m, slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.1%. Nov manufacturing production fell -0.4% m/m, weaker than market expectations of +0.1%.

The Dec Richmond Fed manufacturing index rose by +8 points to -7 from Nov’s -15, and was stronger than market expectations of -10.

Seasonal factors are bullish for stocks. According to data from Citadel Securities, since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, climbing 1.3% on average.

The markets are discounting a 13% chance that the FOMC will cut the fed funds target range by 25 bp at the next FOMC meeting on January 27-28.

Overseas stock markets rose slightly on Tuesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.10%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.07% for the fifth consecutive daily gain. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.02%.

Interest Rates

March 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) on Tuesday fell by -1.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose by +0.2 bp to 4.165%. T-note prices fell on the stronger-than-expected US Q3 GDP report of +4.3%, although most of the other economic reports released Tuesday were mildly weaker than expected on balance.

T-note prices were also undercut by supply overhang. The Treasury on Tuesday sold $70 billion of 5-year T-notes and $28 billion of 2-year floating rate notes. The Treasury will sell $44 billion of 7-year T-notes on Wednesday.

European government bond yields ended lower. The 10-year German bund yield on Tuesday fell back from Monday’s 9-month high and ended the day down -3.6 bp at 2.862%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell by -2.7 bp to 4.509%.

Swaps are discounting a 0% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on February 5.

US Stock Movers

The Magnificent Seven stocks all closed higher on Tuesday except for Tesla. Nvidia (NVDA) rallied by more then +3%. Alphabet (GOOGL)and Amazon.com (AMZN) closed up by more than +1%.

Chip stocks closed mixed. Marvel Technology (MRVL) and Nvidia (NVDA) rallied by more than +3%, while Globalfoundries (GFS) was the weakest chip stock with a loss of -1.7%.

Cryptocurrency-exposed stocks traded lower, with Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) falling about -0.8%.

Riot Platforms (RIOT) fell by more than -5%, and Strategy (MSTR) fell by nearly -4%. Coinbase Global (COIN) and Mara Holdings (MARA) fell by more than -2%.

Miners saw support as gold, silver, and copper all posted new record highs on Tuesday. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) closed up +2.5%, and Newmont Mining (NEM) closed up +0.35%.

Sable Offshore Corp (SOC) soared by +36% after news that the US Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration approved the company’s Las Flores pipeline restart plan.

Additionally, we intend to leverage the longstanding relationships we have with our business partners to capitalize on opportunities in emerging markets.”

First Half of Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Highlights

• Revenue was $95.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $66.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Gross profit was $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $2.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Loss from operations was $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 116.6% from $1.1 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Net income was $0.04 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 96.9% from $1.3 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.01 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $0.05 for the same period of the last fiscal year.

Revenue

Total revenue was $95.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 42.11% from $66.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. This increase was mainly attributable to a increase in demand for liquid sugar from our customers, compared to the same corresponding period.

• Revenue from sales of sugar was $60.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 35.4% from $44.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was mainly due to stronger sales of liquid sugar in the China market and higher demand for Brazilian sugar from the Africa region. • Revenue from sales of rice was $19.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 41.3% from $14.0 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was mainly attributable to market development efforts in the Africa region, as well as lower rice prices from the end of last year to mid-2025, which encouraged higher sales volume. • Revenue from sales of oil and fat products was $14.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 81.0% from $8.0 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to lower oil prices during the first half of 2025, which stimulated demand and sales growth. • Revenue from sales of others was $0.01 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to nil for the same period of the last fiscal year. The sale of others represented random sales of creamer based on customer requests and orders.

A breakdown of revenue in terms of geographic regions for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2025 is summarized below:

For the six months ended June 30, (US$’000) ($ thousands) 2024 % 2025 % Variance Change (%) Africa $ 40,112 60.0 $ 66,162 69.6 26,050 64.9 China 5,762 8.6 15,232 16.0 9,470 164.4 Vietnam 2,734 4.1 1,252 1.3 (1,482 ) (54.2 ) Thailand 8,662 13.0 1,589 1.7 (7,073 ) (81.7 ) Singapore 4,923 7.4 4,825 5.1 (98 ) (2.0 ) Other countries 4,683 7.0 5,976 6.3 1,293 27.6 Total revenue $ 66,876 100.0 $ 95,036 100.0 28,160 42.1

• Revenue from Africa was $66.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by $26.1 million, or 64.9%, from $40.1 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The growth was primarily due to the Company’s continued market development efforts and successful engagement of new customers, particularly in the West and East African regions. These initiatives expanded the customer base and strengthened the Company’s market presence. • Revenue from the China was $15.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which rose significantly by $9.5 million, or 164.4%, from $5.8 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The sharp increase was mainly attributed to the Company’s growing market share in liquid sugar, which continues to gain traction among food and beverage manufacturers in China. The Company also benefited from improved supply chain efficiency and strong customer retention in this segment. • Revenue from Vietnam was $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by $1.5 million, or 54.2%, from $2.7 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to regulatory changes following China’s ban on premix sugar imports from Vietnam in March 2025. • Revenue from Thailand was $1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased sharply by $7.1 million, or 81.7%, from $8.7 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The decrease was mainly due to regulatory changes following China’s ban on premix sugar imports from Thailand effective December 2024, which significantly affected trading activities. • Revenue from Singapore was $4.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased slightly by $0.1 million, or 2.0%, from $4.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The Company’s local operations remained relatively stable, supported by steady customer demand in its home market. • The overall global prices and regulatory changes can significantly impact the revenue.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue was $92.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 44.5% from $64.0 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the increased in revenue as described above, which was contributed by higher demand for the Company’s sugar, rice and oil products from customers.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit was $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 9.8% from $2.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. Sugar prices held relatively firm during the period; however, rising purchase and transportation costs compressed margins, leading to a decrease in gross profit despite continued demand strength. Global supply for rice hit record highs, pushing prices down. Many traders still held older, higher-cost inventories, and logistics and packaging costs stayed elevated, which leading to narrower profit margins even though raw rice costs weren’t rising. Production of oils and fats products increased and demand softened, causing weaker selling prices while increased in upstream costs has narrowing the margin.

Overall gross margin was 2.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to 4.4% for the same period of the last fiscal year. Although sales volume increased, gross profit and gross margin decreased as higher raw material and logistics costs were not fully passed on to customers. Lower selling prices for rice and oils and fats products further squeezed margins, resulting in a decline in overall profitability despite revenue growth.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses were $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 57.9% from $1.8 million for the same period of the last fiscal year.

• Selling and marketing expenses were $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 92.5% from $0.4 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to increase in sales commissions payable arising from the increase in revenue, along with business developments cost and the amortization of prepaid consultancy fees. • General and administrative expenses were $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increased of 46.6% from $1.3 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was mainly attributable to higher legal and professional fees incurred in connection with additional regulatory filings and fees paid to external consultants for listed-company and capital market advisory services, amounting to approximately $0.5 million. In addition, the Company recorded approximately US$0.2 million in impairment losses, primarily relating to provision of expected credit loss, reflecting a more prudent assessment of credit risk during the period.

Other Income and Interest Expense

Other income was $0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 27.8% from $0.6 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The decrease in other income was mainly attributable to the absence of ECL reversals and a reduction in government grants recognized during the year. This was partially mitigated by write-back of trade credit balances no longer payable.

Interest expense was $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 113.3% from $0.1 million for the same period of last fiscal year. The increase was mainly as a result of interest and associated charges from newly activated bank facilities that began at the beginning of the year.

Profit before Tax and Income Tax Expense

Profit before tax was $0.04 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 96.9% from $1.6 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. Correspondingly, income tax was nil for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by $0.3 million from $0.3 million for the same period of last fiscal year.

Net Income

Net income was $0.04 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 96.9% from $1.3 million for the same period of last fiscal year.

Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.002 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $0.05 for same period of the last fiscal year.

Financial Condition

As of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 million, compared to $0.7 million as of December 31, 2024.

Net cash used by operating activities was $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025. The cash outflow from operating activities primarily reflected (i) non-cash adjustments of approximately $0.1 million, mainly comprising depreciation of property, plant and equipment, unrealized gain on derivative contracts, allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, unpaid interest expenses and interest income, and (ii) changes in working capital that resulted in a net outflow of approximately $2.3 million. The movements in working capital were mainly due to a significant increase in accounts payable and accruals of $17.4 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts and other receivable of $20.0 million, as well as a decrease in inventories and increase in margin call amounting to $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

Net cash used in investing activities was $0.001 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily attributable to the purchase of property, plant and equipment.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025. The cash inflows were mainly contributed by new bank borrowings of $12.6 million and proceeds from a related party of $0.4 million, partially offset by repayment of bank borrowings of $9.1 million, repayment of amount due to related parties of $0.6 million, and principal payments on finance lease liabilities.

[TITLE]The 2025 Reforms in Full Swing Under PM Narendra Modi:
[TEXT]
2025 will be remembered as the year India consciously chose to think bigger, move faster, and reform deeper. Under PM Modi, it became a defining moment when the country shed layers of outdated laws, simplified its tax and regulatory structures, opened new frontiers for industry, and aligned governance with the aspirations of a confident nation.

It was a year when India’s economic philosophy shifted toward clarity, scale, and global ambition. The impact was felt across rural India, industry, labour markets, and the emerging sectors that will shape the future. The clarion call given by PM Modi for regulatory reforms on 15th August and need to redraft laws for 21st century India was reflected in these reforms.

Surpassing every global estimate, the Indian economy showed a staggering 8.2% GDP growth in 2025. It was the result of breathing new life into the economy through landmark reforms, cutting across sectors from taxation to labour reforms, from port modernisation to nuclear energy, from FDI to FTAs along with significant deregulation.

Labour Reforms: Placing Workers at the Core of India’s Growth Story

2025 marked the first year when the Labour Codes reshaped India’s world of work in a visible and decisive way. By consolidating 29 fragmented laws into four modern codes, India created a labour framework that is clearer for businesses and more secure for workers.

With a stronger focus on fair wages, smoother industrial relations, wider social security and safer workplaces, the reforms position the labour market to support a growing workforce of 64.33 crore, encourage higher female participation and sustain lower unemployment levels as the economy expands.

Recent labour reforms have expanded social protection across India’s workforce. Nearly 10 million gig workers now receive annual social security support of Rs5,000-10,000. Between 50 and 70 million contract workers are being brought under Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ State Insurance coverage, translating into benefits of Rs15,000-25,000 per worker each year. A new national wage floor is set to raise incomes for 150-180 million low-wage workers.

The reforms are expected to expand the formal workforce by 15 percent, while bringing nearly 50 crore working-age women into the labour pool. For industry, the changes translate into a 60-70 percent reduction in compliance requirements per factory, alongside cost savings of roughly Rs5,000 crore from lower expenditure on manpower, consultants, and production shutdowns.

Next-Generation GST Reforms: A Simpler, Fairer, More Transparent System

India’s GST system saw its most meaningful simplification in 2025, moving to a clean two-slab structure of 5% and 18% that eased the burden on households, MSMEs, farmers and labour-intensive sectors. The reform aimed to reduce disputes, improve compliance and strengthen digital oversight while keeping sin goods outside the new structure to maintain fiscal balance. The impact was visible in consumer sentiment, with India recording record Diwali sales of Rs6.05 trillion and witnessing its strongest Navratri sales in over a decade.

The reforms led to Average GST burden reduction of 5% for consumers with upto 20% reduction in GST burden for some and an additional INR ~1 lakh crore in their pockets.Reduction in life and health insurance also ensured annual savings of 50,000 crores due to reduced premiums leading to better uptake of life and health insurance

SBI Research now projects that even with lower slabs and rationalisation, GST revenues in FY26 are expected to exceed budget estimates. This reinforces the view that a simpler tax regime can be both people-friendly and fiscally strong, positioning India on a path toward a clearer, more predictable and growth-oriented indirect tax framework. Simpler registration procedures have enabled 90% reduction in registration time from 30 to 3 days for small firms.

Income Tax Revolution: Relief for the Middle Class

2025 brought a transformative shift for India’s middle class with an income tax framework that finally reflected the realities of modern household budgets. For the first time, individuals earning up to Rs12 lakh a year faced no income tax at all, creating meaningful savings and giving families the financial space to plan, invest and spend with greater confidence.

Simultaneously, India replaced the old Income-tax Act of 1961, burdened with 4,000+ amendments and thousands of complexities, with the modern, simplified Income Tax Act, 2025. The new law rationalises exemptions, reduces litigation, improves clarity, and strengthens voluntary compliance. It represents a decisive break from colonial-era drafting and signals India’s entry into a new era of transparent, technology-driven tax administration.

Reforms in Building Permits and Environmental Clearance

Modi Government has enabled easier norms for constructing manufacturing units by reducing the previous uniform 33% mandate for green cover and introducing a differentiated system based on an industry’s pollution potential. This will unlock around 1.2 lakh hectares of industrial, reduce project cost upto 20% and spur Rs20-30 lakh crore in investments.

Similarly, individual industrial units located within an industrial park that has already obtained a comprehensive Environmental Clearance (EC) are generally not required to seek a separate EC. This will prevent investment and employment losses from EC delays, particularly in time-sensitive sectors by upto 6-18 months.

32 more industries have been also added “White Category” of industries including sectors like solar power, bicycle assembly, handloom, scientific instruments, tea packing, bio-fertilizers, and wood furniture (without spray painting). This will reduce compliance burdens and reduce entry barriers for first-time and smaller entrepreneurs, lowering fixed compliance costs at the start-up stage and free up resources for Pollution Control Boards to focus on high risk sectorsfor ease of doing business. This will benefit 3,000 to 5,000 industries annually.

The Great EoDB Reset: India Unshackles Its Entrepreneurs Through QCO Reform

The Ease of Doing Business reforms defined 2025 as a year of breaking barriers. A sweeping review of Quality Control Orders removed mandatory compliance for 76 product categories and identified over 200 for deregulation, lifting a major burden off MSMEs and exporters.

Removal of these QCOs will result in doubling India’s share of apparel exports from ~3% ($15bn) to ~5% ($30bn) in 5 years, reduction in production costs in footwear and auto industries by 10%-15%, 2-5% lower prices for domestic consumers for electrical, electronics, bicycles and automotive products leading to consumption boost. Additionally, removal of these QCOs will also result in creation of 30-33 lakh direct jobs and an equal number of indirect jobs.

Letting Small Companies Think Big

Expanding the definition of “small companies” to include firms with turnovers up to Rs100 crore reshaped the landscape for thousands of Indian enterprises. The reform created an environment where growing businesses no longer felt constrained by administrative hurdles, but instead were encouraged to scale with confidence and compete on a larger stage.

This will reduce compliance burden for

[TITLE]Threat landscape for industrial automation systems. Africa, Q3 2025:
[TEXT]
Africa

Key cybersecurity issues in the region

Low cybersecurity maturity of industrial companies

High threat detection rates point to low cybersecurity maturity across industrial companies on the continent: the availability of internet access on OT computers, weak phishing protection, large portions of unprotected infrastructure, and still relatively poor employee cyberhygiene.

In Africa, the percentage of ICS computers on which all categories of threats were blocked is higher than the global average.

Unprotected OT infrastructure and weak network segmentation

In Africa, the percentage of ICS computers blocking self-propagating malware (worms and viruses) is significantly higher than the global average. By the percentage of ICS computers on which worms were blocked, Africa leads all other regions by a wide margin; in terms of viruses, it ranks second.

High detection rates of self-propagating malware and malware spread via network folders at the industry, country, or regional level likely indicate unprotected OT infrastructures lacking even basic endpoint protection. Such unprotected computers become sources of further malware spread.

Weak enterprise network segmentation and lack of control over removable media further exacerbate the situation.

Absence or ineffectiveness of perimeter defenses for OT networks

The rate of spyware detections in the region far exceeds the global average: it was 1.6 times higher in Q3 2025.

Finding spyware on ICS computers usually indicates that the initial infection vector — whether a malicious link, an attachment from a phishing email, or an infected USB device — has already succeeded. This points to the lack or ineffectiveness of OT network perimeter defenses, such as monitoring network communications and enforcing removable media usage policies.

By the percentage of ICS computers on which spyware is blocked, Africa consistently ranks first among all regions.

Lack of control over the use of removable media

In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which threats were blocked when connecting removable media was 4.3 times higher than the global average. In this indicator, Africa leads the world by a wide margin.

Frequent attempts to infect protected systems via USB drives may indicate:

A low level of enterprise digitalization (lack of secure internal file storage and transfer systems);

The existence of significant unprotected enterprise infrastructure acting as a source of USB infections;

A poor overall information security culture.

Cybersecurity adoption lags behind the pace of rapidly developing industries

One broad conclusion we can draw from years of monitoring OT infrastructure exposure to threats is that the implementation of cybersecurity measures and tools almost always lags behind industry growth. When facilities are commissioned, cybersecurity is often an afterthought. Protections are insufficient, staff is poorly trained, and compliance with security policies is half-hearted.

This trend is clearly visible in statistics on African industries and infrastructure types (see below). Rapidly developing sectors include oil and gas, energy, manufacturing, and construction. Engineering is developing alongside these.

Statistics across all threats

In Q3 2025, Africa remained the leading region by the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked. However, Southeast Asia is only 0.3 p.p. behind in second place.

In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers in Africa where malicious objects were blocked dropped a bit further — to 27.4%. Nevertheless, this figure is still 1.4 times higher than the global average. Moreover, compared to Northern Europe (which ranks last), Africa’s rate is now 3 times higher (up from 2.5).

This indicator has been declining in the region for four consecutive quarters.

Across African countries, the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked ranges from 15.8% in Djibouti to 34.5% in Ethiopia.

The rate falls below 20% in only two countries: Zimbabwe and Djibouti. In Niger, Algeria, Cameroon, Tanzania, Gabon, the DRC, and Ethiopia, it’s over 30%.

Threat sources

In Q3 2025, Africa’s rate was higher than the global average for all threat sources with the exception of network folders. The rate for removable media threats was particularly high: 4.3 times higher.

Nevertheless, the rate for all threat sources decreased this quarter.

Removable media

Despite a steady decline in the percentage of ICS computers on which removable media threats were blocked, Africa continues to lead the world by a large margin in this indicator. Africa’s figure (1.43%) is 28.6 times higher than that of Australia and New Zealand, which has the lowest rate.

Among the countries in the region, Burundi leads significantly in the percentage of ICS computers on which threats were blocked upon connecting removable media, with 4.68%. The other countries range from 0.22% in Togo to 3.62% in Libya.

The main threat categories blocked on ICS computers from removable media in Q3 2025 were worms, spyware, viruses, and malicious scripts. By the percentage of ICS computers on which these categories were blocked, Africa also leads the world (in viruses, it ranks second).

Internet

Another threat source where Africa leads is the internet. In Q3 2025, Africa’s percentage of ICS computers on which internet threats were blocked (10.31%) exceeded that of Northern Europe (lowest ranking) by 2.3 times.

Among countries in the region, Gabon leads with 14.16%. Chad has a noticeably smaller percentage of ICS computers with blocked internet threats (3.87%).

The primary internet threat categories blocked on ICS computers in Q3 2025 were malicious scripts and phishing pages, denylisted internet resources, malicious documents, and spyware.

Email clients

After increasing during the first two quarters of 2025, the percentage of ICS computers in Africa where email client threats were blocked decreased. Globally, Africa ranks fifth among regions with 4.18%. This is 5.4 times higher than in Russia, which has the lowest figure globally.

South Africa and Namibia clearly lead the region in the percentage of ICS computers on which threats were blocked in mail clients, with 11.33% and 10.84%, respectively. Somalia has the lowest rate at 0.4%.

The main email client threat categories blocked on ICS computers in Q3 2025 were malicious scripts and phishing pages, malicious documents, and spyware.

Threat categories

In Africa, the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked exceeds the global average in every threat category except miners in the form of executable files for Windows.

The most significant differences with global averages are seen in the following categories:

Viruses: Africa’s rate is 2.5 times higher

Worms: 2.5 times higher

Spyware: 1.6 times higher

In Q3 2025, Africa leads the rankings in the percentage of ICS computers on which the following were blocked:

Malicious scripts and phishing pages (JS and HTML) — Africa jumped up from fourth to first place

Denylisted internet resources

Spyware

Worms

Africa ranks second in viruses and ransomware.

Self-propagating malware: worms and viruses

Worms and viruses are the main threat categories blocked when connecting removable media to ICS computers. Given Africa’s consistent top ranking for this threat source, it’s unsurprising that worms and viruses spread faster there than in other regions.

The worm rate, similar to the overall percentage of threats from removable media, is gradually decreasing. Virus dynamics are more complex, but we’ve also seen a decline here over the last two quarters.

Worms

Africa remains the consistent leader among regions in the percentage of ICS computers on which worms are blocked. Although the figure is gradually declining, it is still significantly higher in Africa than anywhere else.

In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which worms were blocked in Africa increased slightly to 3.16%. This is 14.4 times higher than in Northern Europe, which ranks last.

Among the region’s countries Gabon leads this metric by a large margin with an anomalously high 16.04%. This is 1.8 times higher than the next country, Mali (8.94%). The lowest figure is in Zimbabwe — 0.74%.

Viruses

In terms of ICS computers where viruses are blocked, Africa ranks second globally with 3.53%. This is 22.1 times higher than Australia and New Zealand, which is last.

Cameroon (9.31%) and Mauritania (8.88%) lead the region in the percentage of ICS computers on which viruses are being blocked. The lowest figure is in South Africa — 0.46%.

Spyware

Africa consistently leads regions in the percentage of ICS computers on which spyware was blocked. In Q3 2025, this figure in Africa dropped to 6.33% — still 4.5 times higher than in Northern Europe, which has the lowest percentage of ICS computers on which spyware is being blocked.

This metric has been declining in the region for three consecutive quarters.

Senegal leads the region by a wide margin in the percentage of ICS computers on which spyware was blocked, with 12.24%.

Ransomware

In Q3 2025, Africa ranks second globally in the percentage of ICS computers on which ransomware was blocked, with 0.29%. This is 5.8 times higher than Northern Europe, which has the lowest rate.

In Q2, Africa was the leader in this metric. In Q3, the percentage of ICS computers on which ransomware was blocked decreased slightly, and the region dropped to second place in the ranking.

Among the countries of the region, Madagascar (1.17%) and Rwanda (0.84%) recorded the highest percentages of ICS computers where ransomware was blocked.

Notably, the threat was not detected in every country in the region in Q3 2025.

Malicious scripts and phishing pages

In Q3, Africa rose from fourth to first place globally in the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious scripts and phishing pages are blocked. The figure increased to 9.41% in this quarter. This figure is 3.7 times higher than in Northern Europe, which has the lowest percentage value.

Despite this sharp rise in ranking, the value for this quarter is not the highest seen in the last three years. Notably, during this period Africa also topped the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious scripts and phishing pages were blocked twice more — in Q3 and Q4 2024.

Among countries in the region, South Africa leads in this metric with 12.0%. South Africa also leads the ranking for email client threats. Chad had the lowest figure at 2.51%.

Denylisted internet resources

In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which access to denylisted internet resources was blocked decreased across all regions. Africa remained the leader in this metric with 4.96%. This figure is 2.1 times higher than in Australia and New Zealand, which ranks last.

Uganda leads the region in the percentage of ICS computers on which denylisted internet resources are being restricted, with 8.94%. This country is also among the top 3 in the region for the percentage of ICS computers on which internet threats are blocked. Chad had the lowest figure at 1.82%.

Industries

In Africa, construction remains the most frequently threatened industry among those covered in this report. Africa leads globally in the percentage of ICS computers in this industry where malicious objects were blocked.

This report presents the results of analyzing statistics obtained with the help of Kaspersky Security Network (KSN). The data was received from KSN users who consented to its anonymous sharing and processing for the purposes described in the KSN Agreement for the Kaspersky product installed on their computer.

The benefits of joining KSN for our customers include faster response to previously unknown threats and a general improvement in the quality of detection by their Kaspersky installation achieved by connecting to a cloud-based repository of malware data that is not transferable to the customer in its entirety by nature of its size and the amount of resources that it uses.

Data shared by the user contains only the data types and categories described in the appropriate KSN Agreement. This data helps to a significant extent in analyzing the threat landscape and serves as a prerequisite for detecting new threats including targeted attacks and APTs .

Statistical data presented in the report was obtained from ICS computers that were protected with Kaspersky products and which Kaspersky ICS CERT categorized as enterprise OT infrastructure. This group includes Windows computers that serve one or several of the following purposes:

Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) servers

Building automation servers

Data storage (Historian) servers

Data gateways (OPC)

Stationary workstations of engineers and operators

Mobile workstations of engineers and operators

Human machine interface (HMI)

Computers used to manage technological and building automation networks

[TITLE]Minister 'determined' to get Dublin Airport passenger cap legislation passed next year:
[TEXT]
TRANSPORT MINISTER DARRAGH O’Brien said he plans to bring a memo to Cabinet in January on proposed legislation to lift the Dublin Airport passenger cap.

The current Dublin Airport passenger cap is set at 32 million passengers per year.

It is a condition of the planning permission granted for the construction of Terminal 2 in 2007.

In April, the High Court put a stay on the Dublin Airport passenger cap after a number of key issues relating to the case were referred to Europe, so currently the cap is not in operation.

The passenger cap has caused controversy over the last year, with Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary slamming the government this summer for the slow pace of action.

He hit out at the government for not passing legislation to scrap the cap within the first six months of the government’s term.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin has previously said it is “imperative” the passenger cap is lifted.

In an interview with The Journal, the transport minister said the proposed legislation is “complex” but added:

“The cap itself needs to go but there are legal complexities within it, but we’re well advanced on the legislation. We’re not quite there yet. I want to have a memo to Cabinet in January, if I can, and I think we can do that, because it’s a critical piece of infrastructure.”

Separate to that, he said there is a planning application with Fingal County Council around facilities within the airport. The minister said he has been informed that will not be completed until Quarter 1 2027.

Fingal Council

“I’d like to see that decision be made sooner. I really would like Fingal to to deal with that sooner than that,” he said.

Once the legislation is introduced, it will have to make its way through the Houses of the Oireachtas, but the minister wants to get the law passed next year.

He added that it will be interesting to see where the different political parties land on the issue, as he said it’s not sustainable into the future to have a cap.

“If I can get the bill through Cabinet and get the draft heads drafted, there’s no reason why we couldn’t get the legislation passed next year in 2026 and actually I’m determined to do that,” he added.

“But it has been more complicated than I would like, to be honest, but it’s critically important. The airport in Dublin accounts for 3% of GDP out of that campus alone, every single year. It employs just short of 25,000 people directly, but 125,000 indirect,” said the minister.

The cap was based on the level of road traffic back in 2008, said the minister, who added that Fingal County Council “should have dealt with this in that 10 year period”.

“They didn’t. So, I’m left with the situation, but I’m determined to deal with it,” he concluded.

[TITLE]Central SOEs urged to push upgrading:
[TEXT]

China will push its centrally administered State-owned enterprises to pursue both the upgrading of traditional industries and the development of emerging sectors in 2026, as part of efforts to support overall economic growth and better serve public needs, the country's top State assets regulator said.

Speaking at a meeting of heads of central SOEs held in Beijing earlier this week, Zhang Yuzhuo, chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, or SASAC, said the government will continue to sustain momentum in key fields such as new energy, electric vehicles, new materials, aerospace, the low-altitude economy, quantum technology and 6G next year.

Zhang said that the SASAC will foster and expand new consumption scenarios in areas including culture and tourism, the digital economy and healthcare to cultivate new growth drivers and underpin overall economic development.

Backed by advances in artificial intelligence, central SOEs will roll out a new round of digital transformation across a wide range of sectors, while accelerating the tiered development of smart factories.

"These efforts will be accompanied by continued investment in technological upgrading and large-scale equipment upgrades, as well as more rigorous energy-saving and carbon-reduction retrofits in key industries, to speed up the overall transition," he added.

At the same time, policymakers will promote more integrated development models, encouraging companies to move from pure manufacturing toward integrated manufacturing-and-services operations, and to upgrade service activities from labor-intensive to knowledge-intensive segments.

Zhang said that strategic and specialized restructuring, and high-quality mergers and acquisitions will also be advanced to strengthen central SOEs' competitiveness and efficiency in 2026.

As the government has sharpened its focus on the real economy and core business activities, and moved to optimize the structure and allocation of State-owned assets this year, resources have increasingly been channeled into areas related to national security, critical sectors of the economy and essential public needs, according to the commission.

For example, strategic and specialized restructuring has continued this year, marked by the establishment of China Yajiang Group Co Ltd and China Changan Automobile Group Co Ltd, alongside asset integrations in power batteries by China FAW Group Corp and cruise operations by China Tourism Group, improving the efficiency of resource allocation.

During the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period, central SOEs invested more than 5 trillion yuan ($711 billion) in research and development, delivered a steady flow of major innovation breakthroughs, and posted average annual investment growth of over 20 percent in emerging industries, said the SASAC.

Over the same period, the government carried out six strategic restructurings involving 10 central SOEs, and established nine new groups with different functions.

China Changan Automobile Group, one of three centrally administered State-owned automotive groups, was established in July through a restructuring of the former Changan Automobile and some other companies.

Building on the production base of its predecessor operations, the group saw its 30 millionth vehicle roll off the production line early this month, just over four years after reaching the 20 millionth milestone.

Zhu Huarong, the group's chairman, said that in addition to expanding sales in overseas markets, the Chongqing-headquartered group will step up its transition toward electrification, connectivity and intelligent systems in 2026.

Chen Wenjian, chairman of China Railway Group Ltd, a Beijing-headquartered railway and infrastructure project contractor, said the central SOE will sharpen its focus on integrating technological and industrial innovation to strengthen core competitiveness during the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) period.

"We will focus on upgrading traditional sectors rather than simply expanding capacity," said Chen. "In the construction business, this means accelerating a shift toward smarter, greener and more integrated models, with artificial intelligence deployed to deliver practical, scenario-based applications across our projects."
