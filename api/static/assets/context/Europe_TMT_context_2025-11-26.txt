[TITLE]Hyperscalers Crash the Grid as Big Tech Becomes a Power Trader:
[TEXT]
America’s hyperscalers are looking to ensure the electricity for their huge data centers by entering the supply side of the market—power trading.

Meta, Microsoft, and Apple, to name a few, have either requested or obtained authorizations from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale power.

Meta Platforms, for example, seeks to incentivize long-term commitments in power-generating capacity by expanding into power trading and having the flexibility to contract electricity from future power plants, according to Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy.

Currently, power plant developers are careful about committing investments in the long term, which is not enough to meet the demand from AI and data centers.

Power capacity developers “want to know that the consumers of power are willing to put skin in the game,” Meta’s Parekh told Bloomberg in an interview last week.

“Without Meta taking a more active voice in the need to expand the amount of power that’s on the system, it’s not happening as quickly as we would like,” the executive added.

U.S. power utilities are investing a record amount of money into transmission and grid connection. But current forecasts of AI-driven power demand vary so much that there is a massive margin of error, analysts and utility officials told Reuters Events in June.

The U.S. market faces “a moment of peak uncertainty,” according to Rebecca Carroll, senior director of market analytics at energy advisor Trio.

Electric utilities face a high degree of uncertainty over future revenues as the boom of AI data centers generates widely varying forecasts of peak demand in many areas across the country.

If utilities overestimate their future demand, they risk overbuilding new capacity that will not be met by consumption. A possible overbuild would come at the expense of the American ratepayers, who have already seen electricity prices rising at a faster pace than U.S. inflation over the past three years.

The era of stagnated power demand in the United States ended about two years ago when hyperscalers started the race to develop AI-driven solutions and build huge data centers across the U.S.

America’s five largest hyperscalers are set to hike spending on data centers by 50% to over $300 billion in 2025, according to estimates by Wood Mackenzie.

U.S utilities have already committed to add 116 gigawatts (GW) of large load to their networks, equivalent to around 15% of U.S. peak electricity demand in 2024, the energy consultancy reckons.

The venture into power trading from hyperscalers could give utilities more certainty that their future new capacity will find customers.

“We’re seeing a breakdown between the demand and supply sides of the market, with the biggest actors playing on both sides,” WoodMac’s Ben Hertz-Shargel told Bloomberg.

“To better orchestrate growth, you need some of the largest buyers of electricity to actively support the buildout of the supply side.”

If Meta and other tech giants commit to long-term purchase agreements, power capacity developers will be more willing to invest in long-lead plant construction.

Meta alone is investing $600 billion in the U.S. by 2028 to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion, the company said earlier this month.

The company says it’s making additional investments in energy supply and these have so far helped to add more than 15 GW of new energy projects to the grid across 27 states, representing more than $16 billion in capital investments.

It’s not only clean energy that will power the huge data centers of the hyperscalers—natural gas will play an important role, too.

For example, Meta’s new data center in Richland Parish in Louisiana, worth over $10 billion, will source electricity from three new gas-fired power plants after the Louisiana Public Service Commission this summer approved an agreement that paves the way for Entergy Louisiana to build these plants.

“Importantly, Meta is paying its share of the costs for the infrastructure needed to support its operations, ensuring that other customers are protected from those expenses,” Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO, said in August.

[TITLE]SEC Clears Fuse Energy Token in Win for US Crypto ‘Regulatory Clarity’:
[TEXT]
In brief The SEC has granted no-action relief stating it will not recommend enforcement if Fuse offers and sells its ENERGY token without registration, provided the company follows the structure in its November 19 submission.

The agency has emphasized that its position depends on Fuse maintaining the facts and conditions described in its filing.

Fuse said the decision follows months of engagement with the SEC in a win for U.S. crypto clarity.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Fuse Crypto Limited, an energy-technology company that operates distributed-energy programs across the U.S. and Europe, received a key regulatory boost on Monday after the SEC said it would not pursue enforcement over the firm’s planned rewards token.

In a response to Fuse’s November 19 no-action request, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance said it would not object if Fuse offers and sells its ENERGY token without registration, provided the company adheres to the structure described in its submission.

"We are very pleased to receive confirmation that the SEC staff will effectively not consider the Fuse reward token program a securities offering," Stephen Wink, global co-chair of Latham & Watkins’ Fintech Industry Group, the law firm representing Fuse, told Decrypt. "This is another positive step toward providing greater clarity to innovators in the digital asset space."

While the SEC stressed that its view is contingent on Fuse maintaining the token structure described in its submission, the decision offers one of the clearest examples yet of the regulator distinguishing a loyalty-style digital token from an investment product.

“This landmark is the result of months of productive engagement with the SEC, and Fuse is proud to play a role in pushing forward regulatory clarity for crypto in the U.S.," the company said in a statement on X. “The momentum is building.”

﻿

Fuse tokenomics

London-based Fuse had argued the Solana-based token’s design limits speculation, noting that redemption values are capped by its profit margins and tied to the average market price when consumers use them.

Fuse’s system awards tokens to households that install or operate distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar, batteries, and EV chargers.

The firm also argued that the token functions like a rebate for energy-efficiency participation rather than an investment tied to the company’s performance.

SEC staff ultimately agreed that the token’s value will not depend on the overall success of Fuse or the Fuse Network, a core element of the Howey test used to determine whether an asset is a security.

The decision drew support from Bill Hughes, a lawyer at Consensys, who said the SEC's cited factors made the outcome clear.

“There is not a lawyer in crypto that would have thought this token was a security,” he wrote on X, calling the matter an “easy case.”

[TITLE]CPSC warns Rad Power Bikes owners to stop using select batteries immediately due to fire risk:
[TEXT]
In an unprecedented move, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued a public safety warning urging owners of certain Rad Power Bikes e-bike batteries to immediately stop using them, citing a risk of fire, explosion, and potentially serious injury or death.

The warning, published today, targets Rad’s lithium-ion battery models RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304, which were sold with some of the company’s most popular e-bikes, including the RadWagon 4, RadRunner 1 and 2, RadRunner Plus, RadExpand 5, RadRover 5 series, and RadCity 3 and 4 models. Replacement batteries sold separately are also included.

According to the CPSC, the batteries “can unexpectedly ignite and explode,” particularly when exposed to water or debris. The agency says it has documented 31 fires linked to the batteries so far, including 12 incidents of property damage totaling over $734,000. Alarmingly, several fires occurred when the battery wasn’t charging or when the bike wasn’t even in use.

Complicating the situation further, Rad Power Bikes – already facing significant financial turmoil – has “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” according to the CPSC. The company reportedly told regulators it cannot afford to replace or refund the large number of affected batteries. Rad previously informed employees that it could be forced to shut down permanently in January if it cannot secure new funding, barely two weeks before this safety notice was issued by the CPSC.

For its part, Rad pushed back strongly on the CPSC’s characterization. A Rad Power Bikes Spokesperson explained in a statement to Electrek that the company “stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the ebike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.”

The company explained that its products meet or exceed stringent international safety standards, including UL-2271 and UL-2849, which are standards that the CPSC has proposed as a requirement but not yet implemented. Rad says its batteries have been repeatedly tested by reputable third-party labs, including during the CPSC investigation, and that those tests confirmed full compliance. Rad also claims the CPSC did not independently test the batteries using industry-accepted standards, and stresses that the incident rate cited by the agency represents a tiny fraction of a percent. While acknowledging that any fire report is serious, Rad maintains that lithium-ion batteries across all industries can be hazardous if damaged, improperly used, or exposed to significant water intrusion, and that these universal risks do not indicate a defect specific to Rad’s products.

The company says it entered the process hoping to collaborate with federal regulators to improve safety guidance and rider education, and that it offered multiple compromise solutions – including discounted upgrades to its newer Safe Shield batteries that were a legitimate leap forward in safety in the industry – but the CPSC rejected them. Rad argues that the agency instead demanded a full replacement program that would immediately bankrupt the company, leaving customers without support. It also warns that equating new technology with older products being “unsafe” undermines innovation, noting that the introduction of safer systems, such as anti-lock brakes, doesn’t retroactively deem previous generations faulty. Ultimately, Rad says clear, consistent national standards are needed so manufacturers can operate with confidence while continuing to advance battery safety.

Lithium-ion battery fires have become a growing concern across the US and internationally, with poorly made packs implicated in a rising number of deadly incidents.

While Rad Power Bikes states that no injuries or fatalities have been tied to these specific models, the federal warning marks one of the most serious e-bike battery advisories issued to date – and arrives at a moment when the once-dominant US e-bike brand is already fighting for survival.

[TITLE]Sandisk joins S&P 500 following Western Digital spinoff, replacing Interpublic:
[TEXT]
Atmosphere at the Variety 2025 Power of Young Hollywood Party, Presented by SANDISK held at the Four Seasons Los Angeles at Beverly Hills on August 07, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California.

Shares of flash storage vendor Sandisk popped 7% in extended trading on Monday after the company was added to S&P 500.

Sandisk's addition to the benchmark comes nine months after the company was spun out of Western Digital . Sandisk will replace marketing company Interpublic , which is being acquired by Omnicom , S&P Global said in a statement.

It's the latest tech company to join the S&P 500, which gets an increasing amount of its value from internet, software and semiconductor businesses. AppLovin , Datadog , DoorDash and Robinhood became members of the index earlier this year.

Stocks tend to rally when they're added to the benchmark as fund managers who track the S&P 500 need to buy shares to reflect the changes.

Western Digital bought Sandisk in 2016 for $15.6 billion. In February, Western Digital spun out its flash business as Sandisk, which now has a market cap of

Lambda Raises More Than $1.5 Billion for AI Infrastructure

Lambda secured more than $1.5 billion to expand its AI cloud business. The company is shifting its strategy by building and owning its own data centers rather than renting capacity from larger cloud providers. Lambda said it plans to grow its footprint of GPU clusters and invest in the physical infrastructure needed to support customers building large models and agent-driven applications.

The round reflects a growing belief that AI infrastructure itself has become a competitive advantage. Companies training advanced models often face long wait times and rising costs when relying on shared cloud platforms. Lambda’s approach aims to give customers predictable access to high-end computing resources. Investors see this model as supporting stronger long-term margins as demand for new AI systems continues to rise.

Luma AI Expands With Giant Series C and Saudi Backing

Luma AI closed a $900 million Series C round led by HUMAIN, the Saudi-backed initiative focused on large-scale AI development. Luma plans to support a 2-gigawatt supercluster in Saudi Arabia to train the company’s next generation of multimodal models. The company is known for Ray3, a model that handles video and image generation, and for Dream Machine, a tool that has grown in popularity among designers and creative teams.

The new investment marks a shift for Luma as it moves from entertainment and digital content into areas that require deeper real-world understanding, such as robotics, simulation and industrial design. The involvement of Saudi capital highlights how national investors are positioning themselves in the global AI race by building their own large-scale infrastructure. For Luma, the partnership gives the company access to reliable computing power at a moment when demand for advanced training capacity continues to exceed supply across the industry.

NestAI Lands Funding and Partnership to Accelerate Physical AI

In Europe, NestAI announced a $100 million raise alongside a new partnership with Nokia. The company focuses on what it calls physical AI, which refers to AI systems that operate in real environments rather than on screens. NestAI develops software for unmanned vehicles, autonomous inspections and command platforms used in logistics, infrastructure and industrial facilities.

[TITLE]AI, an enabler of universal access, increased equity, and global influence for India: Vinod Khosla:
[TEXT]
Education and healthcare are the core of human capital, and raise productivity, speed technology adoption, and shape a country’s demographic trajectory. But it’s quality that moves long-run growth.One and a half billion Indians need education and healthcare access. Building infrastructure for education, primary and secondary education needs decades of investments in infrastructure and human capital. Imagine if these needs disappeared and infinite levels of highly personalised education at all levels from kindergarten to PhDs and MBBS degrees was possible with personalised styles of teaching and training at near zero cost? Basic AI tutors can be universally accessible in 2026 in all regional languages (Khasi in Meghalaya anyone?) with an accelerated effort and at levels of performance and availability at higher levels.In 2006, I pondered the dearth of health institutions in India . A simple calculation showed me that if I had 30 years and a trillion dollars to spend on getting the patient-doctor ratio in India similar to that in the US, I could not do it. Further investigation seemed to indicate that the only answer possible was AI physicians, AI mental health therapists, AI physical therapists, health and behavioural health coaches and other AI medical expertise. All-AI expertise was the ONLY answer even with huge financial resources and yet AI expertise would need only a fraction of resources needed to have human expertise. Well before 2030 it should be possible, only for the cost of compute, to provide almost all physician and therapy expertise that might be required. Near-free multi-specialty primary care, chronic disease management, health coaching, nutrition advice and navigation are all possible using AI. A billion dollars a month could deliver very high levels of primary, mental health, chronic disease management, and multi-specialty care to every Indian 24x7, in their regional language and local social context.Access to law and legal rights: AI can offer an infinite number of virtual courts and free AI lawyers for any citizen to get knowledge and access to their legal rights without years of delay.An integrated, low friction access to essential services through a personal Aadhaar AI portal is possible: Fortunately, through Aadhaar which was implemented for identity and financial services based on that identity, near-term essential services become easier to implement. India can make AI and AI-based essential services a new “public utility” atop the India Stack. Beyond these essential services, a knowledge source like ChatGPT available to every Indian just as the UAE is currently considering, would do much for upleveling Indians. It would usher in an era of “mass intelligence.”There is a very short-term opportunity to build an AI centred set of services for India’s population. Though naysayers will disagree this can be done at low risk, acceptance can be increased by running comparative trials to human powered services. This can be done at a fraction of the cost of today’s meagre services in these areas.Another area of consumer demand is consumer entertainment. Most such content will be near free and much more diverse, customized and accessible in every region and genre, dramatically reducing the cost of services like Netflix and featuring more original and regional content. But entertainment is an arena private entrepreneurs and companies can handle well and near free without government services.At the other end of the needs spectrum, national defence, cybersecurity, cyberwar and internal security will benefit dramatically as the rules of war change and will be primarily driven by AI competence, not gross muscle. This will be a longer transition but can start immediately.Most essential services will be near free, provided by governments, and relatively costless. Transitions will be difficult, chaotic, and often resisted.Of course, the Indian population will need much more than these essential services, including jobs, housing, roads, transportation, energy and other infrastructure. Not all problems can be solved by AI. But AI offers India a unique opportunity in the mid-term to solve many critical needs and substantially uplevel the opportunity for its population. India can establish global leadership and new economic sectors for exports and leverage its population demographics.AI will have a disruptive impact on people and jobs. A recent Stanford study reveals AI disproportionately impacts entry-level workers aged 22-25 in AI-exposed jobs like software engineering and customer service in the US. Given the nature of the global economy, much of this impact cannot be avoided whether we like it or not. AI will displace jobs but significantly, in my view, initially the countries that don’t adopt AI will lose more jobs than those which don't. Rapid education into an AI-centric workforce will be both a necessity and opportunity for some countries if AI upskilling of talent is rapidly adopted.Exporting AI transformation capability from India using it’s established BPO and IT services industries, both of which will suffer greatly if they do not transform themselves, is a large economic opportunity for the country. Exporting the Aadhaar-like identity, education, healthcare and legal capabilities is another opportunity.In an AI knowledgeable workforce and economy many such AI-driven opportunities will emerge, as many current business opportunities decline. We can have AI provide an infinite number of high school and college graduates, experts in accounting, material science, chip design, manufacturing process control, structural engineering, biotechnology PhDs, an infinite number of doctors, oncologists, accountants… you get the idea. Yes, it will be disruptive to the labourers India has available. By 2040, India should and must set up its economy to leverage this world where expertise, usually a hallmark of developed economies, will be near free and far exceeding human performance in most areas. AI will erode the value of traditional degrees by providing expertise in all these areas.AI/self-driving driven public transit in small vehicles could reduce the investment required and dramatically increase the capacity of existing or future rights of way in passengers per hour (per metre of road width) and money required for any level of passenger throughput capacity in operating costs and capital investment by as much as 5-10x, making private financing for such systems feasible while maintaining public transit prices per passenger mile.None of this happens without energy fuelling the economy but fusion and superhot geothermal, unrelated to AI, along with solar and wind provide the opportunities to again lead. Being the manufacturing supply chain for the new energy infrastructure, in a world shunning China, is an opportunity. Rapidly adopting new AI and robotics-based housing manufacturing techniques may reduce their labour content and hence employment potential, but rapid, low cost construction with far less materials wastage may be enabled by new manufacturing and design techniques. More citizens can have houses.A developing economy needs resources and very little has been done globally with new approaches to minerals discovery. AI-driven geosciences are showing early signs of being very useful in discovering new resources like copper, iron, and other minerals and developing better processes for minerals processing like lithium and rare-earth refinement.A global view is detailed at AI: Utopia or Dystopia, my blog on AI’s implications in the developed world. AI will likely lead to GDP being a poor measure of national welfare. It will likely lead to a deflationary economy and many more dislocations but opting out will be an option far worse than opting in, even with all its uncertainty. What will give meaning and what will people do is speculated upon in this blog. It needs much more debate, discussion, feedback and continual updating.For India, universal mobile access, compute availability, and public trust are critical for this vision to work. Significant infrastructure gaps must be eliminated, especially in rural and low-income areas that might hinder equitable AI deployment. And innovation must be paired with policy frameworks promoting contestability, worker support, data governance, and inclusive ecosystems. AI integration requires robust regulatory ecosystems. AI should leverage—not replace—human professionals who can provide oversight with checks and balanced integration plans until such time that comparative studies have been exhaustively run on AI alone. Frameworks around ethics, privacy, data ownership, and digital inclusion are needed to ground this vision in real institutional needs.AI can be a great equalizer. AI can be hugely deflationary as expertise-based services decline to near zero cost and are available in infinite quantities allowing for a world of abundance. As Elon Musk wrote in a recent post: “There will be universal high income. Everyone will have the best medical care, food, home, transport and everything else. Sustainable abundance.” But getting there will be hard and chaotic.The future is ours to make with many acts of commission and action needed. Errors of omission and inaction could be catastrophic. Sun Microsystems and later went on to found Khosla Ventures, which is one of the early backers of firms like OpenAI and DoorDash.

Rapidly adopting new AI and robotics-based housing manufacturing techniques may reduce their labour content and hence employment potential, but rapid, low cost construction with far less materials wastage may be enabled by new manufacturing and design techniques. More citizens can have houses.A developing economy needs resources and very little has been done globally with new approaches to minerals discovery. AI-driven geosciences are showing early signs of being very useful in discovering new resources like copper, iron, and other minerals and developing better processes for minerals processing like lithium and rare-earth refinement.A global view is detailed at AI: Utopia or Dystopia, my blog on AI’s implications in the developed world. AI will likely lead to GDP being a poor measure of national welfare. It will likely lead to a deflationary economy and many more dislocations but opting out will be an option far worse than opting in, even with all its uncertainty. What will give meaning and what will people do is speculated upon in this blog. It needs much more debate, discussion, feedback and continual updating.For India, universal mobile access, compute availability, and public trust are critical for this vision to work. Significant infrastructure gaps must be eliminated, especially in rural and low-income areas that might hinder equitable AI deployment. And innovation must be paired with policy frameworks promoting contestability, worker support, data governance, and inclusive ecosystems. AI integration requires robust regulatory ecosystems. AI should leverage—not replace—human professionals who can provide oversight with checks and balanced integration plans until such time that comparative studies have been exhaustively run on AI alone. Frameworks around ethics, privacy, data ownership, and digital inclusion are needed to ground this vision in real institutional needs.AI can be a great equalizer. AI can be hugely deflationary as expertise-based services decline to near zero cost and are available in infinite quantities allowing for a world of abundance. As Elon Musk wrote in a recent post: “There will be universal high income. Everyone will have the best medical care, food, home, transport and everything else. Sustainable abundance.” But getting there will be hard and chaotic.The future is ours to make with many acts of commission and action needed. Errors of omission and inaction could be catastrophic. Sun Microsystems and later went on to found Khosla Ventures, which is one of the early backers of firms like OpenAI and DoorDash.

The European Commission (EC) has approved a €450m ($518m) subsidy from the Czech government for onsemi to establish a new silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor fabrication facility in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Czechia.

The funding forms part of the US-based chip manufacturer’s planned €1.64bn investment and is expected to enable the completion of the plant by 2027.

Upon completion, the Rožnov pod Radhoštěm plant is expected to become the first integrated SiC device manufacturing site of its kind in the European Union (EU).

The facility will handle all stages of SiC device production, from crystal growth to finished semiconductors.

In June 2024, onsemi confirmed plans for a multi-year brownfield investment in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm.

The company’s existing local operations include silicon crystal growth and wafer manufacturing. The new facility will build on this foundation with vertically integrated SiC production capabilities.

Nexperia chip supply : A factory next to a weed-ridden lot in China's industrial south has become a global choke point for automotive chips, upending a sector that just a few years ago swore it wouldn't be caught again by supply-chain disruptions.Automakers vowed to strengthen supply lines after COVID-19 snarled semiconductor output in 2020 and a Japanese factory fire aggravated the shortage a year later. But the crisis engulfing Dutch chipmaker Nexperia's plant exposed a blind spot: The industry never envisioned low-tech chips would become a lever for China against the West."No one prepared for geopolitical disruption, and they're still not prepared," said Ambrose Conroy, CEO of U.S. firm Seraph Consulting, which advises automakers.The Dutch government took control of Netherlands-based Nexperia in late September, citing concerns its technology could be passed on to Chinese owner Wingtech. Beijing retaliated by halting exports of finished Nexperia chips packaged at the plant in the Pearl River Delta.The Netherlands last week reversed course from its decision to take control of Nexperia, signalling a potential breakthrough.From its Dongguan factory, Nexperia ships semiconductors used in everything from car brakes to electric windows. They sell for fractions of a penny each, yet the shortage forced Nissan and Honda to cut production and drove German supplier Bosch to curtail factory working hours.This account of how the industry scrambled to respond to the unforeseen crisis is based on interviews with a dozen people, including auto executives, suppliers and chip distributors, who described how just-in-time inventory practices and limited supply-chain diversification left automakers vulnerable to geopolitical shock.The reporting shows how China's dominance reaches beyond cutting-edge technology and rare earths to mundane-yet-critical components and how Beijing wields that power to paralyse global production. Some details, including the size of Bosch's exposure and companies' struggles with requirements to trade in yuan, haven't previously been reported.While the Dutch government took control of the headquarters in Nijmegen, the operations in China remained under the control of Nexperia's Chinese parent."The Dutch thought they had seized Nexperia, but they only took over an office building," said Li Xing, a professor of international relations at the Guangdong Institute for International Strategies, a think tank."What this shows is that, even in mid- and low-end segments, they depend on China. If China wants to get a grip on you, it still can. You have no way out."In a statement, a spokesperson for Wingtech said Nexperia has become an industry leader since being acquired. "The current crisis shows that breaking up international companies harms supply chains and puts key industries at risk," the spokesperson said.China's commerce ministry didn't respond to requests for comment.A Nexperia spokesperson said the semiconductor industry's global complexity made it hard to foresee the impact of geopolitics.Nexperia's chips were seen as so cheap and available that one European automaker didn't normally prepare alternative supplies, said one person at the carmaker. The chips are "very ordinary electronics with low prices," said this person, who like most of those interviewed spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.The Nexperia episode shows that manufacturers' strategic vulnerability stretches beyond high-tech components, said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, a managing director at Ankura Consulting in Beijing.Bosch didn't initially have sufficient alternatives ready, despite ordering 200 million euros ($231 million) worth of Nexperia products a year, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Bosch declined to comment. Nexperia resumed sales to some domestic distributors in late October but required payment in yuan, instead of foreign currencies used previously. The currency change was an apparent bid by the Chinese business to operate more independently of Dutch headquarters, Reuters has reported. Ready-to-ship chips piled up at the Dongguan plant because it wasn't able to handle all the yuan transactions, according to two people briefed on the matter.The situation has since eased, they said.A Wingtech spokesperson said there hadn't been a chip backlog or systems issues with yuan payment, but didn't elaborate.China allowed some Nexperia exports to resume this month after U.S. President Donald Trump met with China's Xi Jinping in Seoul. That came just in time for Bosch and suppliers Aumovio, ZF Group and Hella, which were days away from halting some production, according to a person briefed on the matter.Bosch, Aumovio and ZF declined to comment. A Hella spokesperson said it has maintained supply-chain stability.When Reuters visited the Dongguan plant on a recent weekday, some blinds were drawn and trucks came and went from a docking area. Dozens of scooters were parked outside.Austria's Melecs and Apple supplier JABIL have managed to source chips from Nexperia. Both have used Chinese entities, allowing them to settle in yuan, the two people briefed on the matter said.A Melecs spokesperson declined to comment. JABIL did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The chip shortage showed automakers hadn't heeded lessons from the previous shock, said Julie Boote, autos analyst at Pelham Smithers Associates in London."You would expect them to have several months' worth of supply inventory for chips," she said. "That's what they said after the last crisis."Nissan Chief Performance Officer Guillaume Cartier said replacing vulnerable supply chains takes time."I know what everyone will tell me, 'Ah, but you didn't learn from the past,'" he told Reuters last month. "Yeah, OK. But do you believe you change all your supply in three years?"The Nexperia shortage forced Nissan to cut production of its top-selling Rogue SUV, Reuters has reported, and poses a continuing risk for this year.Conroy, the consultant, advises clients to hold extra inventory of critical components in the region where they're needed. That's a costly change for an industry that relies on "just-in-time" inventory management to minimize costs.Not all carmakers got whiplashed.

Nexperia semiconductors are widely used in components like power modules, which manage electricity, and are often soldered straight onto the components. That means they can't just be swapped out for another chip, said Nori Chiou, investment director at White Oak Capital Partners.Any new vehicle component needs to undergo testing that can add months to the process of securing alternative parts, Chiou said. Nexperia's spokesperson said substitution can't be completed "overnight" because parts that seem identical can perform differently in vehicles.Germany's Hella is considering alternative suppliers for Nexperia's chips but testing and approvals could take up to a year, longer than initially expected, according to one person in the auto-supply industry.Hella's spokesperson said it was shifting to "already qualified second sources wherever possible" to maintain stable supplies.Ankura Consulting's Montufar-Helu said preparing for chip choke points will not be easy - or cheap."Everyone is going to start talking once again about building resilience, about diversification," he said.

India's emerging electric car market remains under the shadow of Chinese imports as the manufacturers continue to rely on the world's largest exporter for key components such as semiconductors, batteries and magnets. A report in the Times of India reveals that only six of every 46 (around 13%) electric vehicle (EV) models sold in India have been found eligible for benefits under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme of the government, as they meet the domestic value-addition mandates.The rest 87% EV models in India were marked ineligible for PLI as they carried imported content more than the stipulated levels with the vast part of components coming in from China, sources told TOI.As per the Ministry of Heavy Industries' PLI Scheme for automobile companies and auto components released in September 2021, automakers are required to meet a minimum 50% domestic value addition (DVA) and follow Phased Manufacturing Programme similar to FAME-II Scheme. The government provides a relaxation on import of battery cells that takes the DVA cut-off lower to 40%As per TOI's sources, the government has approved six models under the scheme, including five car models from Tata Motors and one from Mahindra . "All the other models sold in the market, including from companies such as JSW MG, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, Citroen, VinFast, Volvo, Tesla and Audi, have over 60% imported content," the source said.The EV models that have gained from the PLI scheme are - Tata Punch , Tata Nexon, and Tata Harrier SUVs, Tata Tiago hatch, and Tata Tigor sedan, along with Mahindra XEV9E.Tata's popular EV Curvv and Mahindra BE6 green did not meet PLI's local value addition criteria, despite other models from the autogiants making the cut.Officials from companies whose models did not make the cut told TOI that meeting the DVA criteria at such a nascent stage of EV adoption remains challenging. "The local supply ecosystem for EVs is still not as evolved as it is in the internal-combustion engine (ICE) category. Also, with limited sales of the greens, it is quite challenging and practically unviable to ask our supply chain partners to come to India," a top functionary at a leading European automaker told TOI.EV makers in India import a range of auto components from China and Taiwan, some of which are key elements to make the industry function smoothly."These include lithium-ion battery cells; rare earth magnets; DC Motors; laminated stators; semiconductor chips; printed circuit boards, and electronic child parts, all of which are coming from China," an industry executive said, citing a PwC study on localisation of EV component supply chain in India. "Then you have connectors; contactors; relays, and DC-DC converters which come from China and Taiwan," the executive said.The government launched the PLI scheme in view of the need to reduce exposure to supply chain volatility and drive localisation in the production of EVs. The PWc study emphasises that a strong push from various Government initiatives over the next few years to create an enabling local ecosystem, coupled with the need for EV OEMs to stabilise and control the ever-growing spend on EV components , will drive localisation of the EV supply chain in India.The PLI scheme aims to build 50 GWh of manufacturing capacity with 60% value addition over a period of 5 years. However, the pace at which this capacity grows may be slow due to the high investments required and the complexities involved in cell manufacturing.Localisation has always been a strong mandate for India’s automotive sector due to numerous inherent advantages, the study mentioned, adding that global tensions and COVID-led disruptions in the auto sector have reinforced the need for developing strong local supply chains.The localisation of EV manufacturing in India is particularly challenging due to the nature of components, assembly lines and the available infrastructure in India. As per estimates by PwC, previously non-existent components such as batteries with advanced chemistry, electric motors, power electronics and software now make up at least 50–60% of an EV, most of which are not present in India.Most of the locally manufactured motors are currently relying on Chinese imports for child parts to ensure commercial viability, with limited local value addition in brushless DC (BLDC) motors. While India will have to import rare earth magnets from China, other components such as laminated stators, are also mainly Chinese imports. China and Taiwan control majority of the global supplies of electric components like connectors, contactors, relays and DC-DC convertors, which are important parts of an EV high-voltage circuit.In addition to this, the black box assembly locks in a significant value in EV manufacturing, but is difficult to localise without the support of tier-1 manufacturers or in-house capabilities.India's auto sector continues to rely heavily on Chinese imports, which give rise to volatility and price hikes for the industry. While the government is taking crucial steps to boost localisation of EV production, private players can also play a key role with collaboration and investment to make India an EV superpower.

[TITLE]Denmark Data Center Colocation Supply & Demand Analysis Report 2025: Market to Grow at a CAGR of 34.57% During 2024-2030, Driven by AI Adoption, Cloud Growth, and Sustainability Push:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Denmark Data Center Colocation Market - Supply & Demand Analysis 2025-2030" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Denmark data center colocation market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 34.57% from 2024 to 2030

The report covers retail colocation pricing (with add-ons) and wholesale colocation pricing with trend analysis, alongside an assessment of the latest market trends, potential opportunities, growth restraints, and overall prospects for Denmark’s colocation data center industry. It also outlines the competitive landscape, including market share analysis of colocation operators based on IT power capacity and revenue.

Denmark is one of the growing colocation data center markets in the Nordics region. The average occupancy rate of data center facilities is expected to reach around 90%, indicating that the vacancies will be only around 10% by 2030.

The Danish data center market is driven by several growth factors, including the surge in AI adoption, increasing cloud services, rising government support for data centers, rapid digitization, sustainability initiatives in data centers, increasing submarine cables development, and the adoption of advanced technologies such as 5G, big data, and IoT. However, the country also faces some challenges, such as Power constraints, high construction costs, and high power costs.

Some of the leading colocation data center operators in the market include Digital Realty, GlobalConnect, Cibicom, Aeven (NNIT), Bulk Infrastructure, STACK Infrastructure, and Others.

In Denmark, demand for retail colocation is expected to decline, while demand for wholesale colocation is projected to grow over the forecast period. This shift is driven by companies across various industries - such as finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and telecommunications - rapidly migrating their operations to cloud platforms to enhance scalability, data accessibility, and operational efficiency.

The Danish government takes initiatives to support digitalization across the country. For instance, in February 2024, the Danish government announced its plans to establish a new digitalization strategy for 2024-2027 in Denmark, focusing on the development of artificial intelligence, digital education, digital skills enhancement, the green transition, and the digital transformation of SMEs in Denmark.

Denmark has strong infrastructure connectivity through land and sea. The country consists of around 28 existing submarine cables, such as Aurora, Baltica, DANICE, COBRAcable, Fehmarn Balt, Energinet Lyngsa-Laeso, GlobalConnect-KPN, Havsil, Ronne-Rodvig, Skagenfiber West, and Skagerrak 4, which connect Denmark with other European countries such as Sweden, Germany, Norway, Poland, the Netherlands, the UK, and Ireland.

[TITLE]Starlink revenue surges as Spark’s market share slips in Commerce Commission report:
[TEXT]
A measure of market trends

“The market share of the incumbent provider, Spark, has decreased over the last five years. Energy bundlers such as Mercury have entered the broadband market over this period and begun to increase their market shares as consumer preference for energy bundles has increased,” the commission said in its annual market monitoring report, released in June.

“In the rural market, LEO (low-Earth orbiting) satellite provider Starlink has seen considerable growth since its entry in 2021,” the commission said.

Starlink tops $100m

The commission’s June report said Starlink customers had increased 57% from 37,000 to 58,000 over the past year, accounting for 19% of the rural market and 2% overall.

Starlink owner SpaceX was beneath the levy’s $10m threshold in 2023.

In 2024, SpaceX’s qualifying New Zealand revenue - that is, revenue generated from telecommunications services - was $73.79m as it debuted on the levy charts.

This year, SpaceX’s qualifying revenue jumped 38% to $100.99m.

The Commerce Commission's final determinations for 2025 Telecommunications Development Levy payments. (In the regulator's jargon, each firm is a "qualifying liable person" or QLP.)

(SpaceX’s slower revenue growth than customer growth is presumably down to Starlink supplementing its $159-a-month household plan with a slower $79-a-month option and moves to discount its hardware or offer it for free.)

The period has also seen Sky TV enter the telco market with broadband plans, with a slow but steady rise.

Last year, Sky had $52.38m in revenue to which the levy could be applied. This year, it was $60.13m as the pay TV provider reported a 4% increase in broadband customers to 50,867.

The regulator says the 'Other' category consists mainly of "many smaller providers such as wisps [wireless internet service providers] that operate non-cellular wireless networks regionally".

Spark share slides

As the UFB rollout wrapped up, Jarden’s Arie Dekker predicted that the “Other category” could grow to include hundreds of thousands of customers due to the new fibre setup making it easier for a power company or pay-TV provider to offer internet.

That seems to be playing out (with the addition of Starlink, too).

And it seems to have impacted the largest player the most.

Spark, which had 32.86% of industry-qualified revenue in the year to June 2021, had dropped to 28.87% by last year and 27.17% this year.

Overall, telco revenue tracked for the commission’s levy calculations is up this year to $4.9b from $4.8b last year.

One NZ, Chorus and 2degrees all saw modest increases in their actual revenue this year (see table below), but Spark fell back.

And the field of alternative players just got bigger.

Mercury and Contact are now the fourth and fifth largest retail internet providers in New Zealand, the commission says, having doubled their market share from 6% to 13% over the past five years.

Last month, Genesis Energy joined them, launching its own bundled broadband plans.

It’s a nuanced picture. Sky and Genesis could have created their own retail broadband services from scratch, but both minimised risk by partnering with 2degrees, which manages their services behind the scenes (Contact partners with wholesale specialist Devoli, one of many wholesale and infrastructure firms that also feature on the table above).

Starlink, Starlink, Starlink

Starlink has multiple lines of business in New Zealand.

At present, Starlink is the only LEO (low-Earth orbiting) satellite constellation providing commercial broadband coverage to New Zealand, which can be accessed by a dish on the roof of your home, business, bach or boat (although within months it’s expected to face competition from the Amazon-owned Project Kuiper).

Since December last year, One NZ has been Starlink’s exclusive partner for its Direct to Cell service, which lets you send a text (and soon, if all goes to plan, make a voice call) via satellite to a regular smartphone, providing 100% coverage if you’ve got line-of-sight to the sky.

One NZ paid an undisclosed sum for its Starlink Direct to Cell exclusivity – and for an unspecified amount of time. But industry insiders widely expect Spark to be named the second local Starlink Direct to Cell partner in the New Year.

(2degrees also has a satellite-to-mobile deal in the works but with newcomer AST SpaceMobile, backed by some big names including AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone global, BlackRock and Google) . There’s no launch date but 2degrees says it will include voice and data - and things are looking tangible with 2degrees constructing a $10m ground station in Marton.)

The commission refused to break out revenue associated with the One NZ-Starlink deal. It said that Musk’s firm had been cooperative, supplying financials for its overall New Zealand business.

Starlink also provides a business-grade product, which involves a much larger, high-gain dish and costs up to $1015 per month. While the residential version of Starlink is DIY, Spark, OneNZ and 2degrees are all reseller partners for the business version, bundling value-added services too.

Network for Learning, the Crown-owned company responsible for connecting the 2500 or so state schools, has a contract with Starlink to provide connectivity for rural schools.

Civil Defence Emergency Management has trialled Starlink for disaster relief community hubs (using a battery taken from a Toyota Corolla - Starlink modems have the same susceptibility to power cuts as any electricity-dependent hardware.)

And Air New Zealand inked a deal for Starlink to provide internet – wifi that’s actually fast and usable - on its planes. A trial began mid-year.

At Spark’s annual meeting this month, a shareholder asked “How will Elon Musk’s Starlink affect Spark in the long term, and what’s the strategy for that?”

“Starlink has a role to play in New Zealand in terms of rural connectivity where fibre or copper or sometimes even mobile is unavailable,” chairwoman Justine Smyth replied.

Lambda Raises More Than $1.5 Billion for AI Infrastructure

Lambda secured more than $1.5 billion to expand its AI cloud business. The company is shifting its strategy by building and owning its own data centers rather than renting capacity from larger cloud providers. Lambda said it plans to grow its footprint of GPU clusters and invest in the physical infrastructure needed to support customers building large models and agent-driven applications.

The round reflects a growing belief that AI infrastructure itself has become a competitive advantage. Companies training advanced models often face long wait times and rising costs when relying on shared cloud platforms. Lambda’s approach aims to give customers predictable access to high-end computing resources. Investors see this model as supporting stronger long-term margins as demand for new AI systems continues to rise.

Luma AI Expands With Giant Series C and Saudi Backing

Luma AI closed a $900 million Series C round led by HUMAIN, the Saudi-backed initiative focused on large-scale AI development. Luma plans to support a 2-gigawatt supercluster in Saudi Arabia to train the company’s next generation of multimodal models. The company is known for Ray3, a model that handles video and image generation, and for Dream Machine, a tool that has grown in popularity among designers and creative teams.

The new investment marks a shift for Luma as it moves from entertainment and digital content into areas that require deeper real-world understanding, such as robotics, simulation and industrial design. The involvement of Saudi capital highlights how national investors are positioning themselves in the global AI race by building their own large-scale infrastructure. For Luma, the partnership gives the company access to reliable computing power at a moment when demand for advanced training capacity continues to exceed supply across the industry.

NestAI Lands Funding and Partnership to Accelerate Physical AI

In Europe, NestAI announced a $100 million raise alongside a new partnership with Nokia. The company focuses on what it calls physical AI, which refers to AI systems that operate in real environments rather than on screens. NestAI develops software for unmanned vehicles, autonomous inspections and command platforms used in logistics, infrastructure and industrial facilities.

Nokia plans to integrate its secure connectivity and sensing capabilities into NestAI’s systems, creating a joint approach that links advanced networking with autonomous operations. For customers, the appeal is the promise of automation that can handle tasks like facility monitoring, site inspections or logistics routing with fewer delays and fewer manual steps. NestAI’s raise suggests that real-world autonomy is moving from pilot programs into broader commercial use as companies seek ways to streamline operations and reduce routine on-site labor.

Function Reaches New Valuation as It Launches Medical Intelligence Lab

Function Health, a U.S.-based medical intelligence company, announced a new valuation of $2.5 billion as it launched Function Lab, a research program aimed at improving clinical decision support. The company develops AI tools that help physicians evaluate patient data, analyze imaging and plan care. Function said the new capital will allow it to build more advanced reasoning systems that support care teams across multiple specialties.

The company positions its platform to reduce administrative burden and improve diagnostic accuracy. Health systems have shown growing interest in technology that can help clinicians navigate rising patient volumes, expanding documentation requirements and complex medical histories. Function’s focus on clinically aligned models reflects an industry shift toward AI tools that must be reliable, traceable and safe for use in regulated environments.

[TITLE]How artificial intelligence can help achieve a clean energy future:
[TEXT]
There is growing attention on the links between artificial intelligence and increased energy demands. But while the power-hungry data centers being built to support AI could potentially stress electricity grids, increase customer prices and service interruptions, and generally slow the transition to clean energy, the use of artificial intelligence can also help the energy transition.

For example, use of AI is reducing energy consumption and associated emissions in buildings, transportation, and industrial processes. In addition, AI is helping to optimize the design and siting of new wind and solar installations and energy storage facilities.

On electric power grids, using AI algorithms to control operations is helping to increase efficiency and reduce costs, integrate the growing share of renewables, and even predict when key equipment needs servicing to prevent failure and possible blackouts. AI can help grid planners schedule investments in generation, energy storage, and other infrastructure that will be needed in the future. AI is also helping researchers discover or design novel materials for nuclear reactors, batteries, and electrolyzers.

Researchers at MIT and elsewhere are actively investigating aspects of those and other opportunities for AI to support the clean energy transition. At its 2025 research conference, MITEI announced the Data Center Power Forum, a targeted research effort for MITEI member companies interested in addressing the challenges of data center power demand.

Controlling real-time operations

Customers generally rely on receiving a continuous supply of electricity, and grid operators get help from AI to make that happen — while optimizing the storage and distribution of energy from renewable sources at the same time.

But with more installation of solar and wind farms — both of which provide power in smaller amounts, and intermittently — and the growing threat of weather events and cyberattacks, ensuring reliability is getting more complicated. “That’s exactly where AI can come into the picture,” explains Anuradha Annaswamy, a senior research scientist in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering and director of MIT’s Active-Adaptive Control Laboratory. “Essentially, you need to introduce a whole information infrastructure to supplement and complement the physical infrastructure.”

The electricity grid is a complex system that requires meticulous control on time scales ranging from decades all the way down to microseconds. The challenge can be traced to the basic laws of power physics: electricity supply must equal electricity demand at every instant, or generation can be interrupted. In past decades, grid operators generally assumed that generation was fixed — they could count on how much electricity each large power plant would produce — while demand varied over time in a fairly predictable way. As a result, operators could commission specific power plants to run as needed to meet demand the next day. If some outages occurred, specially designated units would start up as needed to make up the shortfall.

Today and in the future, that matching of supply and demand must still happen, even as the number of small, intermittent sources of generation grows and weather disturbances and other threats to the grid increase. AI algorithms provide a means of achieving the complex management of information needed to forecast within just a few hours which plants should run while also ensuring that the frequency, voltage, and other characteristics of the incoming power are as required for the grid to operate properly.

Moreover, AI can make possible new ways of increasing supply or decreasing demand at times when supplies on the grid run short. As Annaswamy points out, the battery in your electric vehicle (EV), as well as the one charged up by solar panels or wind turbines, can — when needed — serve as a source of extra power to be fed into the grid. And given real-time price signals, EV owners can choose to shift charging from a time when demand is peaking and prices are high to a time when demand and therefore prices are both lower. In addition, new smart thermostats can be set to allow the indoor temperature to drop or rise — a range defined by the customer — when demand on the grid is peaking. And data centers themselves can be a source of demand flexibility: selected AI calculations could be delayed as needed to smooth out peaks in demand. Thus, AI can provide many opportunities to fine-tune both supply and demand as needed.

In addition, AI makes possible “predictive maintenance.” Any downtime is costly for the company and threatens shortages for the customers served. AI algorithms can collect key performance data during normal operation and, when readings veer off from that normal, the system can alert operators that something might be going wrong, giving them a chance to intervene. That capability prevents equipment failures, reduces the need for routine inspections, increases worker productivity, and extends the lifetime of key equipment.

Annaswamy stresses that “figuring out how to architect this new power grid with these AI components will require many different experts to come together.” She notes that electrical engineers, computer scientists, and energy economists “will have to rub shoulders with enlightened regulators and policymakers to make sure that this is not just an academic exercise, but will actually get implemented. All the different stakeholders have to learn from each other. And you need guarantees that nothing is going to fail. You can’t have blackouts.”

Using AI to help plan investments in infrastructure for the future

Grid companies constantly need to plan for expanding generation, transmission, storage, and more, and getting all the necessary infrastructure built and operating may take many years, in some cases more than a decade. So, they need to predict what infrastructure they’ll need to ensure reliability in the future. “It’s complicated because you have to forecast over a decade ahead of time what to build and where to build it,” says Deepjyoti Deka, a research scientist in MITEI.

One challenge with anticipating what will be needed is predicting how the future system will operate. “That’s becoming increasingly difficult,” says Deka, because more renewables are coming online and displacing traditional generators. In the past, operators could rely on “spinning reserves,” that is, generating capacity that’s not currently in use but could come online in a matter of minutes to meet any shortfall on the system. The presence of so many intermittent generators — wind and solar — means there’s now less stability and inertia built into the grid. Adding to the complication is that those intermittent generators can be built by various vendors, and grid planners may not have access to the physics-based equations that govern the operation of each piece of equipment at sufficiently fine time scales. “So, you probably don’t know exactly how it’s going to run,” says Deka.

And then there’s the weather. Determining the reliability of a proposed future energy system requires knowing what it’ll be up against in terms of weather. The future grid has to be reliable not only in everyday weather, but also during low-probability but high-risk events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, all of which are becoming more and more frequent, notes Deka. AI can help by predicting such events and even tracking changes in weather patterns due to climate change.

Deka points out another, less-obvious benefit of the speed of AI analysis. Any infrastructure development plan must be reviewed and approved, often by several regulatory and other bodies. Traditionally, an applicant would develop a plan, analyze its impacts, and submit the plan to one set of reviewers. After making any requested changes and repeating the analysis, the applicant would resubmit a revised version to the reviewers to see if the new version was acceptable. AI tools can speed up the required analysis so the process moves along more quickly. Planners can even reduce the number of times a proposal is rejected by using large language models to search regulatory publications and summarize what’s important for a proposed infrastructure installation.

Harnessing AI to discover and exploit advanced materials needed for the energy transition

“Use of AI for materials development is booming right now,” says Ju Li, MIT’s Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. He notes two main directions.

First, AI makes possible faster physics-based simulations at the atomic scale. The result is a better atomic-level understanding of how composition, processing, structure, and chemical reactivity relate to the performance of materials. That understanding provides design rules to help guide the development and discovery of novel materials for energy generation, storage, and conversion needed for a sustainable future energy system.

And second, AI can help guide experiments in real time as they take place in the lab. Li explains: “AI assists us in choosing the best experiment to do based on our previous experiments and — based on literature searches — makes hypotheses and suggests new experiments.”

He describes what happens in his own lab. Human scientists interact with a large language model, which then makes suggestions

[TITLE]EU proposal to delay parts of its AI Act signal a policy shift that prioritises big tech over fairness:
[TEXT]
The roll-out of the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act has hit a critical turning point. The act establishes rules for how AI systems can be used within the European Union. It officially entered into force on August 1 2024, although different rules come into effect at different times.

The European Commission has now proposed delaying parts of the act until 2027. This follows intense pressure from tech companies and from the Trump administration.

Rules contained in the act are based around the risk posed by an AI system. For example, high risk AI is required to be very accurate and be overseen by a human. This was to apply to companies developing high-risk AI systems posing “serious risks to health, safety or fundamental rights” from August 2026 or a year later. But now organisations deploying these technologies, whose purposes would include analysing CVs or assessing loan applications, will now not come under the bill’s provisions until December 2027.

The proposed delay is part of an overhaul of EU digital rules, including privacy regulations and data legislation. The new rules could benefit businesses, including American tech giants, with critics calling them a “rollback” of digital protections. The EU says its “simpler” rules would help “European companies to grow and to stay at the forefront of technology while at the same time promoting Europe’s highest standards of fundamental rights, data protection, safety and fairness”.

The negative reaction to the proposals exposes transatlantic fault lines over how to effectively govern the use of AI. The first international speech by Vice President JD Vance in February 2024 offers a useful insight into the current US admininstration’s attitudes towards AI regulation.

Vance claimed that excessive regulation of the sector could “kill a transformative industry just as it’s taking off”. He also took aim at EU regulations that are relevant to AI such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Digital Services Act (DSA). He said that for smaller firms, “navigating the GDPR means paying endless legal compliance costs”.

He added that the DSA created a burden for tech companies, forcing them to take down content and police “so-called misinformation”. Vance further pledged that the US would not accept “foreign governments … tightening the screws” on American tech companies.

On the offensive

By August of this year, the Trump administration had launched its own AI policy offensive, including a plan to accelerate AI innovation and national AI infrastructure. It announced executive orders to streamline data infrastructure, promote the export of American AI technologies and prevent what the administration sees as the potential for bias in federal AI procurement and standards.

It also sought deregulation, open-source development (where the code for AI systems is available to developers) and “neutrality”. The last of these appears to mean resisting what the White House sees as “woke” or restrictive governance models.

Additionally, President Trump has criticised the EU’s Digital Services Act, threatening additional tariffs in response to further fines or restrictions on US tech companies. EU responses varied. While some policymakers were reportedly shocked, others reminded US leaders that EU rules apply equally to all companies, regardless of origin.

So how can this gap over AI policy be bridged? In March 2025, a group of interdisciplinary US and German scholars – ranging in disciplines from computer science to philosophy – gathered at the University of North Carolina in the town of Chapel Hill. Their aims were to tackle a series of questions
