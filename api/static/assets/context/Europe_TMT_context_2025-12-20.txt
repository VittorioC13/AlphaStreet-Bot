[TITLE]Fortnite Not Coming to iOS in Japan as Epic Games CEO Accuses Apple of 'Obstruction and Lawbreaking':
[TEXT]
Epic Games is not going to bring Fortnite to iOS in Japan as promised because of the fees imposed by Apple's new App Store rules, ‌Epic Games‌ CEO Tim Sweeney said on social media. Sweeney complained that Apple did not comply with Japan's Mobile Software Competition Act "honestly" and instead "launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan."

Back in 2024 when the MSCA passed, Sweeney said that Epic would launch Fortnite in Japan in late 2025. He made the announcement before he was aware of how Apple planned to comply with the MSCA.

Sweeney accused Apple of charging "competition-crushing" junk fees, including a five percent fee on revenue from apps distributed through alternate app marketplaces. ‌Epic Games‌ would need to pay Apple a five percent fee on all revenue generated via game purchases made through an ‌Epic Games‌ Store in Japan, or 15 percent on digital purchases through a web link if the Fortnite app were to be distributed through the ‌App Store‌.

Obviously, real competition won't happen, and consumers won't benefit, when Apple abuses its position between users and competitors to obstruct honest dealing between them. This is another sad day in the history of relationships between platform makers, developers, and consumers, and we will be raising our complaints with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission.

Sweeney said that ‌Epic Games‌ plans to raise complaints with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission.

Apple says that it worked with Japanese regulators when establishing its new rules to comply with the MSCA, so it is not clear if ‌Epic Games‌ will be able to persuade Japan to implement more stringent restrictions.

Japan's rules allow Apple to be compensated for its intellectual property, and Japan's interoperability rules allow Apple to refuse requests in situations where privacy and security would be compromised. Along with allowing for alternative app marketplaces, the MSCA adds support for alternate payment methods and allows Japanese users to set new functionality for the iPhone's Side Button.

‌Epic Games‌ was able to bring the ‌Epic Games‌ Store to the European Union, but Apple does have a 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee for marketplaces there, too. The Core Technology Fee will transition to a five percent Core Technology Commission for all developers in the EU starting on January 1, 2026, so the fees will be very similar to the Japan fees.

Birkenstock shares plunge 9% as German sandal maker warns tariffs will slam profits

NY Post ^ | December 18, 2025 | By Taylor Herzlich

Posted on by Oldeconomybuyer

Shares in Birkenstock plunged 9% Thursday after the German shoe retailer warned tariffs will likely weigh heavily on its profit margins.

The company – known for its chunky cork sandals – said it expects its annual gross margins will drop by a full percentage point due to US tariffs in the new fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30, 2026.

Birkenstock, which listed in New York in 2023, still operates the majority of its production in Germany – leaving it exposed to the Trump administration’s 15% tariff on the European Union, which it reached after a trade deal with the 27-nation bloc over the summer.

[TITLE]Vehicle to Grid Market Set to Reach US$ 65.84 Billion by 2035 | Astute Analytica:
[TEXT]
Chicago, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global vehicle to grid market was valued at US$ 6.27 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach US$ 65.84 billion by 2035, growing at a CAGR of 26.50% between 2026 and 2035.

The year 2025 marks a definitive tipping point where global electric vehicle fleets, now approaching 40 million units, have transformed into essential grid assets. Such critical mass has effectively forced the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to evolve from experimental science projects into a scalable commercial necessity. Stakeholders have consequently shifted their focus from questioning technical feasibility to prioritizing operational revenue metrics. Utilities and fleet operators are actively deploying these virtual power plants to stabilize energy networks while simultaneously generating tangible cash flow. The conversation has moved beyond engineering pilots to hard unit economics.

Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/vehicle-to-grid-v2g-market

Maximizing revenue per kilowatt-hour now drives investment strategies across the sector, replacing earlier theoretical studies. Investors specifically focus on the proven capability of these aggregated assets to defer billions in infrastructure upgrades. Fleet operators, in turn, utilize the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to successfully convert depreciating vehicles into active profit centers. This transition creates a bifurcated value proposition where both grid stability and fleet profitability improve simultaneously through bidirectional integration. The sector currently stands at a juncture where integration creates immediate commercial viability for all participants.

Key Findings in the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Market

Market Forecast (2034) USD 65.84 billion CAGR 26.50% Largest Region (2025) North America (38.22%) By Vehicle Type Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (69.24%) By Charging Type Bidirectional Charging Type (60.10%) By Solution Hardware (69.25%) By Application Frequency Regulation (21.40%) By End User Commercial (33.84%) Top Drivers Rising intermittent renewable energy requires decentralized storage solutions.

Automotive OEMs actively forming aggregation partnerships for revenue generation.

Utilities deploying virtual power plants to manage peak loads. Top Trends Adoption of ISO 15118-20 standard for seamless interoperability.

Integration of AI for predictive energy trading and optimization.

Bundling of home solar, storage, and EV charging hardware. Top Challenges Lack of uniform interconnection standards across different utility regions.

Consumer anxiety regarding battery degradation from frequent discharging.

Complex certification processes for hardware to meet safety codes.

Mandatory ISO Standards Compel Hardware Makers To Adopt Interoperable Architectures

Mandatory implementation of ISO 15118-20 for new public chargers in Europe as of Summer 2025 has forced hardware manufacturers to ensure universal interoperability. These standards enable seamless "Plug & Charge" functionality, thereby eliminating the friction previously associated with manual authentication. Such protocols also facilitate the dynamic pricing communication required for real-time grid balancing. Regulatory mandates have effectively removed the fragmented technical barriers that previously stalled broader adoption within the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market.

Regional policy variances continue to shape deployment velocities differently across the globe, creating distinct pockets of opportunity. April 2025 saw Beijing and Shenzhen launch massive city-wide pilots explicitly integrating bidirectional charging into national renewable frameworks. North American states like California concurrently implemented interconnection reforms to drastically reduce approval times from months to weeks. These legislative actions provide the necessary regulatory certainty for the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to expand beyond pilot phases. Consequently, global manufacturers are aligning their supply chains to meet these harmonized requirements.

Commercial Fleets Leverage Revenue Stacking To Reduce Ownership Costs Significantly

Commercial fleets currently generate the most immediate financial returns through strategic revenue stacking, outpacing other segments. Data confirms that heavy-duty commercial vehicles now earn between USD 2,200 and USD 2,500 annually per unit by participating in frequency regulation markets. Fleet managers utilize the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to monetize idle time effectively, ensuring assets remain productive even when parked. Operational teams, therefore, no longer view vehicles solely as transport assets but as mobile energy storage units capable of substantial earnings.

Integration of bidirectional technology subsequently reduces the total cost of ownership by nearly 20% compared to standard electric fleets. Such savings often exceed the value of traditional government subsidies, making the technology attractive even without public funding. Financial directors increasingly prioritize these operational efficiencies to improve balance sheets and offset higher upfront vehicle costs. The Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market consequently offers a sustainable economic model that functions independently of external grant funding or temporary incentives, proving its long-term viability.

Smart Energy Management Slashes Peak Charges Driving Depot Profitability Upwards

Smart bidirectional charging strategies enable depots to cut peak power charges by up to 70% in high-demand zones. Facility managers leverage on-site batteries to flatten demand curves during expensive operational windows, thereby shielding the business from volatility. Avoiding punitive utility rates creates immediate savings that often outweigh direct revenue earned from grid services. The Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market thrives on these "behind-the-meter" optimizations because they require minimal external permissions compared to energy export schemes.

Depots control these energy assets directly to manage internal consumption patterns efficiently, ensuring operational continuity. Real-time load balancing ensures that high-power charging does not trigger excessive demand fees, preserving profit margins. Early adopters report seeing ROI immediately upon deployment through drastically reduced monthly utility bills. Operational independence drives rapid growth in the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market as fleets bypass complex interconnection procedures associated with exporting power to the main grid.

School Bus Predictability Accelerates ROI Payback Encouraging Unsubsidized Electrification Adoption

Electric School Buses represent the ideal asset class for bidirectional integration due to large 100kWh batteries and highly predictable downtime schedules. Analysis of 2025 pilots indicates that each bus earns approximately USD 3,000 per year through grid services during idle periods. The consistent availability of these vehicles allows for aggressive participation in capacity markets without compromising student transport. School districts subsequently leverage the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to transform student transportation into a revenue-generating utility service.

V2G revenue streams significantly alter the procurement logic for educational institutions by offsetting high capital costs. Earnings from grid services reduce the ROI payback period for electric buses by 2 to 3 years, making the investment far more attractive. Unsubsidized electrification becomes financially viable as the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market matures and monetizes these assets. Districts effectively utilize buses as stationary storage during summer months to maximize income, ensuring the fleet pays for itself year-round.

Distributed Storage Assets Defer Capital Expenditure Forcing Utility Business Model Evolution

Grid operators avoid constructing new power plants by utilizing distributed EV batteries as virtual buffers against demand spikes. A pivotal Dutch study estimates avoided grid reinforcement costs will reach USD 1.6 billion between 2025 and 2030 through widespread V2G adoption. Widespread utilization of these assets stabilizes the network against renewable energy fluctuations, reducing the need for peaker plants. Utilities increasingly rely on the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market to manage peak loads without heavy infrastructure investment.

Deferring physical upgrades saves billions in capital expenditures (CAPEX) regarding substations and transformers, improving utility margins. Utility executives now design tariffs specifically to unlock these distributed storage resources and encourage customer participation. The macro-economic case compels power companies to offer incentives that align consumer behavior with grid needs. Strategic integration of the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market proves essential for maintaining grid reliability during the rapid energy transition.

Intelligent Algorithms Mitigate Degradation Risks Validating Long Term Asset Viability

Intelligent charging algorithms mitigate battery health concerns by keeping state-of-charge in optimal mid-ranges. Research from 2025 confirms that controlled V2G cycling increases degradation by only 9% to 14% over ten years. Economic compensation covers these minor wear costs five times over, making the trade-off highly profitable for owners. Battery longevity actually improves in some cases compared to vehicles left sitting at 100% charge, debunking earlier myths. The Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market validates that smart management preserves asset value while generating income.

Hardware preferences are shifting as mass-market vehicles adopt AC bidirectional solutions to lower costs for consumers. Commercial depots continue to favor DC wallboxes to ensure strict grid code compliance and higher power flows. Software platforms ensure that every kilowatt discharged delivers maximum value with minimum impact on battery health. Technology advancements reinforce the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) market as a safe and profitable endeavor for asset owners concerned

Unlike manufacturers of transceivers, VIAV focuses on producing the critical testing equipment that ensures these high-speed optics function reliably before reaching the market. While this makes the company less explosive in terms of end-product growth, it solidifies its role as an indispensable part of the optics supply chain.

The company is experiencing robust financial momentum, with revenue projected to grow 28% by FY26 and EBITDA expected to expand even faster at 49%, underscoring operational leverage and efficiency in its testing solutions business. VIAV maintains a net income margin of 9.7%, reflecting solid profitability in a highly technical and specialized segment. From a valuation perspective, the company trades at a forward-looking EV/Sales of 3.2x, EV/EBITDA of 15.3x, and a P/E of 27.0x, suggesting room for upside as investors recognize its strategic positioning.

The combination of strong projected financial growth, essential technology for the broader optics ecosystem, and a favorable risk/reward profile makes VIAV an attractive investment. The company is not only benefiting from the optics sector’s tailwinds but also has an enduring moat through its specialized testing equipment, which is critical for ensuring high-speed optical performance. This positions VIAV to capture long-term value, offering investors a compelling opportunity to participate in both near-term growth and sustained industry expansion.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Cisco Systems, Inc.

[TITLE]What’s up with… Liberty Global, NGMN, 1&1:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Liberty Global is selling its business in Slovakia to part of the growing e& PPF Telecom empire; NGMN calls for greater harmonisation in monitoring energy consumption in mobile backhaul infrastructure; German 5G challenger’s 5G network now reaches 25% of the country’s households; and much more!

Liberty Global is in divestment mode. The company, which has telecom operations in multiple European markets, including Belgium (Telenet), Ireland (Virgin Media Ireland), the UK (via its 50% stake in Virgin Media O2) and the Netherlands (via its 50% stake in VodafoneZiggo), is selling its last remaining central European operation, UPC Slovakia, to O2 Slovakia for €95m. UPC Slovakia provides broadband, pay-TV and telephony services to 375,000 customers (2024 figure) in 80 towns and cities across Slovakia, of which

[TITLE]General Assembly Speakers Push to Close Digital Divides, Transform Promise of World Summit on Information Society into Real-World Gains for All:
[TEXT]
Ministers from around the world today underscored the role of the UN in creating a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented digital future as the General Assembly took stock of the implementation of commitments made at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).

The Summit is an evolving multi-stakeholder platform that addresses issues raised by information and communications technologies. It was first held in two phases, in Geneva in 2003 and in Tunis in 2005. The WSIS Forum is an annual multi-stakeholder event, and in 2025, it took the shape of the WSIS+20 High-Level Event, held in July in Geneva, Switzerland.

Solly Malatsi, Minister for Communications and Digital Technologies of South Africa, who chaired that event, said there was widespread support for the continuation of the WSIS architecture, “provided that the process and the way we work evolves with changing times”. “We must close the remaining digital divides”, address affordability, and equip people — especially women, youth, persons with disabilities and communities in the Global South — to participate meaningfully in the information society. WSIS has been a compass for his country’s digital journey. In 2005, fewer than 1 in 10 South Africans were online. Today, almost 8 in 10 are connected, 4G coverage is at 99 per cent “and more than a million kilometres of fibre knit our country together”. But 13 million South Africans are still offline.

Digital Divides as Development Divides

Many speakers from the Global South highlighted this disconnect — despite concerted efforts to adopt technology, it is challenging to keep pace. The representative of Lesotho highlighted the WSIS+20 outcome document’s focus on closing persistent digital divides, which is crucial for remote communities in landlocked least developed countries such as hers. Lesotho has achieved over 95 per cent mobile coverage across mountainous terrain; integrated non-geostationary orbit satellite services to extend high-speed broadband and is leveraging “its unique high-altitude location, natural quietness and cold climate to attract investments in energy and data centers”, she said. However, she expressed concern

[TITLE]AI-driven data centres to lift demand for gensets in India: Cummins:
[TEXT]
Engine and genset manufacturer Cummins Group is betting big on India’s data centre boom, with the 106-year-old US company expecting the country to emerge as one of the world’s fastest-growing data centre markets, on par with the US, China and Europe.Shveta Arya, Cummins Group's India region leader, said India was moving beyond data storage to power-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, increasing demand for reliable backup power.“By nature, data centres – whether they store data or process it – require 99.99% uptime. Backup power is critical, and that is where we come in,” Arya told ET.The AI boom remains favourable for Cummins and its generator sets, she added.Arya said India has a significant opportunity to convert data into digital assets. “We believe India is moving towards that phase, where both global and domestic players will train AI models locally and unlock the value of India’s data by digitising and analysing it.”Despite the strong demand outlook, Arya said challenges remain for data centre development in India. According to her, one of the biggest bottlenecks is site readiness. “Finding the right site, preparing it and securing the necessary approvals takes time,” she said, adding that the challenge is not technological in nature.In 2024-25, Cummins India sold over 25,000 generator sets and delivered more than 7,000 MW of power to customers across the country, according to its annual report.The company said demand is being driven by sectors that require uninterrupted, high-reliability power, with data centres, healthcare, commercial real estate, manufacturing and infrastructure emerging as key focus areas.Equipment manufactured in India is exported to markets across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, the company said.Beyond large data centres, Cummins is also targeting demand from quick commerce and commercial infrastructure.The company’s Indian operations, headquartered in Pune, recently launched an 82.5 kVA genset designed for quick commerce warehouses , commercial establishments, infrastructure projects, and construction sites.“When platforms such as Zepto, Swiggy or Zomato set up warehouses or cold storage facilities, they need reliable backup power. This genset is rightly sized for such warehouses,” Arya said.She added that in warehouse applications, return on investment is a key consideration. Customers want to maximise space for storage rather than allocate it to large gensets. “By reducing footprint and fuel consumption, we aim to lower operating costs for customers,” she said.Arya said hydrogen may be the fuel of the future, but felt the transition may not happen anytime soon. “It is not a light-switch transition. You cannot move from diesel to hydrogen overnight,” she said, adding that the shift could take 30 to 40 years.She said global research on hydrogen has also slowed due to limited collaboration. “When countries work together, progress is faster. Right now, that is not happening enough,” Arya said.Cummins already has a hydrogen internal combustion engine ready and expects it to be available commercially by around March 2027. “Customers were very interested a few years ago, but today they are cautious because hydrogen production in India has not scaled up,” she said.Arya said hydrogen has long-term potential for India as it can be produced locally and reduce dependence on imports. If made using renewable energy such as solar power, it can also be a zero-carbon fuel. However, hydrogen remains expensive and difficult to store and transport.Cummins India, a listed arm of Cummins Group, reported a strong performance for the September 2025 quarter with a 41.3% rise in net profit to Rs 637 crore. The company's shares closed at Rs 4,385 apiece on the NSE on Thursday.

[TITLE]US energy regulator directs PJM to set AI data center rules:
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON, Dec ‌18 : The U.S. energy regulator on Thursday directed the largest U.S. grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to establish rules on the connection of artificial intelligence-driven data centers and other large electricity loads located next to power plants, a move an analyst says benefits existing natural gas and nuclear plants.

Backers of AI and other facilities that consume large amounts of power say that co-locating them near power plants offers efficiency benefits, including cutting the need for new ‌transmission lines. Opponents say it can damage grid reliability and raise ‌power bills for surrounding communities by reducing electricity available for public use.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the move will protect consumers in the mid-Atlantic region that serves about a fifth of Americans in 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Laura Swett, the FERC chairman, said the order was a "monumental step towards fortifying America's national and economic security in the AI revolution," and would ensure power rates remain "just and ‍reasonable."

PJM said it is reviewing the order. "We share FERC’s focus on clear and transparent rules as data centers expand their role as an engine of the U.S. economy," said PJM spokesperson Jeffrey Shields.

Washington policy advisory firm Capstone called the order a "major victory" for existing nuclear and gas plants, as it directs PJM to ​implement rules that allow power stations to ‌reduce output to the grid to serve new behind the meter customers such as data centers.

Power bills for the region are expected to continue to rise after PJM on ​Wednesday reported fresh record-high capacity prices that reflected electricity demand by data centers overtaking supplies.

The expansion of Big Tech's ⁠data centers has driven up so-called capacity ‌prices in PJM by about 1,000 per cent over a roughly two-year period, intensifying energy affordability problems for ​those living and working in the region.

FERC took aim at PJM's open access transmission tariff, which the operator says governs its services in the region to allow for a ‍fair and competitive wholesale electricity market.

The agency said the tariff was "unjust and unreasonable due to a lack of ⁠clarity and consistency in the rates, terms, and conditions." It directed PJM to revise its tariff to detail the terms ​and conditions for interconnection customers ‌to follow when using generating facilities to serve co-located load.
