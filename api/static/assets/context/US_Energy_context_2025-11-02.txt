[TITLE]AI Energy Crunch: Hyperscalers Turn to Small Nuclear Reactors:
[TEXT]
Despite global momentum and policy support, the SMR revolution faces substantial execution risks, including cost control, supply chain maturity, regulatory bottlenecks, and the need for robust financing structures to ensure timely and on-budget delivery.

Key industry players such as NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy are moving SMRs from conceptual designs to billion-dollar commercial projects, with notable advancements in deployment programs, industrial heat applications, and corporate energy strategies.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are experiencing a significant comeback, driven by their scalability, siting flexibility, and ability to provide carbon-free baseload power, crucial for rising AI energy demands and industrial decarbonization.

After decades of stagnation, nuclear energy is staging a comeback — and it’s no longer the gigawatt-scale reactors of the past leading the charge. Small modular reactors, once dismissed as niche or speculative, have moved to the center of a global energy and geopolitical pivot. Their appeal lies in scalability, siting flexibility, and the promise of dedicated, carbon-free baseload power—a vital ingredient in an era defined by the AI energy demand surge and industrial decarbonization.

The shift from ambitious blueprints to billion-dollar commercial projects is officially underway, driven by key industry announcements throughout 2025. Some of the leading stakeholders include NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy.

NuScale Power: From De-Risking To Gigawatt-Scale Deployment

NuScale Power has cemented its role as the bellwether of the SMR movement, but its commercial success will depend on disciplined financing. In early September 2025, the company announced a landmark collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority and ENTRA1 Energy to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of its SMR technology within the TVA service region — the largest SMR commitment in U.S. history.

The structure of this deal is as important as its scale. Rather than placing the full “first-of-a-kind” financial and regulatory burden on TVA, ENTRA1 will reportedly finance, own, and operate the facilities, selling power back to TVA through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement. This off-balance-sheet approach could prove pivotal, unlocking institutional investment and moving SMRs from demonstration projects into a bankable, utility-scale asset class.

[TITLE]ExxonMobil Beats Q3 Earnings Estimates, Boosts Dividend Again:
[TEXT]
Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM has reported third-quarter 2025 earnings per share of $1.88 (excluding identified items), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.81. The bottom line declined from the year-ago quarter’s $1.92.

Total quarterly revenues of $85.3 billion lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $86.8 billion. The top line also declined from the year-ago figure of $90.02 billion.

Better-than-expected quarterly earnings resulted from higher oil equivalent production volumes and higher natural gas prices. The positives were partially offset by lower crude oil price realizations.

Dividend Hike

ExxonMobil increased its quarterly dividend to $1.03 per share for the fourth quarter of 2025, marking the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend-per-share increases. This represents a 4% increase from the dividend of 99 cents per share paid out in the third quarter of 2025.

Operational Performance

Upstream

The segment reported quarterly earnings (excluding identified items) of $5.68 billion, down from $6.16 billion in the year-ago quarter. The figure is slightly above our estimate of $5.36 billion. The decline was primarily led by lower crude oil price realizations, partially offset by higher production.

Operations in the United States recorded a profit of $1.23 billion, lower than $1.69 billion in the September-end quarter of 2024 and below our estimate of $1.27 billion. The company reported a profit of $4.45 billion from non-U.S. operations compared with $4.47 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Production: ExxonMobil’s production averaged 4,769 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), higher than 4,582 MBoe/d a year ago. The figure missed our estimate of 4,846.1 MBoe/d.

Liquids production increased to 3,380 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d) from 3,187 MBbls/d in the prior-year quarter. The figure missed our estimate of 3,402.6 MBbls/d. The increase can be attributed to higher production from the United States and Canada/Other Americas.

Also, the Yellowtail project began operations earlier than planned in the third quarter. It is the biggest development in Guyana so far and has greatly increased the country’s total production capacity.

Natural gas production totaled 8,334 million cubic feet per day (Mmcf/d), marginally down from 8,369 Mmcf/d a year ago. The figure also missed our estimate of 8,660.6 Mmcf/d.

Price Realization: In the United States, ExxonMobil recorded crude price realization of $63.56 per barrel, down from the year-ago figure of $72.94. The figure also missed our estimate of $64.07. Crude price realization for non-U.S. operations decreased to $62.58 per barrel from $73.07 in the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the same was pinned at $62.01 per barrel.

[TITLE]Analysis-Trump's big nuclear reactor push raises safety concerns:
[TEXT]
By Tim McLaughlin and Timothy Gardner

(Reuters) -A huge nuclear deal announced by the Trump administration earlier this week provides a multi-billion-dollar incentive for the U.S. government to issue permits and approvals for new Westinghouse reactors - an unprecedented structure that critics say poses environmental and safety risks.

Under the agreement with Westinghouse Electric's owners, Canada-based Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management, the U.S. government will arrange financing and help secure permits and approvals for $80 billion worth of Westinghouse reactors.

In return, the plan offers the U.S. government a path to a 20% share of future profits and a potential 20% stake in the company if its value surpasses $30 billion by 2029.

The deal is one of the most ambitious plans in U.S. atomic energy in decades, underscoring President Donald Trump's agenda to maximize energy output to feed booming demand for artificial intelligence data centers.

But the financial incentives risk clouding regulatory scrutiny aimed at preventing nuclear accidents, according to safety advocates and regulatory experts.

"The things that could go wrong are Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima," said Greg Jaczko, a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, pointing to three of the worst nuclear power accidents on record.

"All have causes tied to insufficient regulatory independence."

The White House said concerns about safety were unfounded.

“The regulatory regime remains the same and is not compromised. There’s nothing in the deal about regulatory changes,” the White House said in an emailed statement.

Westinghouse owner Cameco declined to comment. Brookfield and Westinghouse did not respond to messages requesting comment.

TD Cowen analysts told clients in a research note this week they expect Westinghouse to have 10 new large-scale reactors - enough gigawatts to power several million homes - under construction by 2030 as a result of the deal.

Typically, it takes around a decade for a new nuclear power plant to get built, largely due to the rigorous permitting requirements and enormous costs and complexities associated with construction.

Patrick White, a nuclear regulatory and technology expert at the Clean Air Task Force, said effective regulation did not need to be a slow or extended process and there were benefits to moving more efficiently.

"Ensuring that nuclear regulation is also timely and predictable is in the best interest of both companies and the public," White said.

Todd Allen, a nuclear expert at the University of Michigan, said the design of Westinghouse reactors is well established, but questioned how fast projects could progress.

"With that aggressive timeline, and demand for the reactors around the world, I wonder if there is a big enough workforce to handle all of these projects," Allen said.

DELAYS TO PREVIOUS U.S. PROJECT

Westinghouse’s last U.S.-based nuclear project, building two nuclear reactors at the Vogtle power plant in Georgia, forced the company into bankruptcy protection in 2017.

The two reactors were about seven years behind schedule and cost about $35 billion, more than double the original estimate of $14 billion.

Patty Durand, director of nonprofit Georgians for Affordable Energy, has spent years analyzing that project and said she fears fast permitting would overlook the risks associated with climate change.

She said severe droughts have forced operators to curtail nuclear power in Europe and the United States to avoid overheating their reactors.

Westinghouse also had a slew of problems related to the modular design of its AP1000 reactors, such as some parts' dimensions being wrong when they arrived on site. The AP1000 would also be used for the new reactors, built from prefabricated parts and assembled on site.

Edwin Lyman, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said he fears the Trump administration will exert too much power over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to get the new reactors permitted.

“If the White House fully takes over the NRC and it is no longer at all independent, then it could be used just as a tool for sweeping deals for which the White House could accelerate licensing on its preferred projects regardless of their actual safety implications, and that's a dangerous thing,” Lyman said.

[TITLE]Canadian government claims hacktivists are attacking water and energy facilities:
[TEXT]
Hacktivists targeted Canadian ICS, disrupting water, oil, and agricultural infrastructure

ICS vulnerabilities stem from unclear roles and poor asset protection

Canada urges VPNs, 2FA, and threat detection to secure ICS environments

The Canadian government has issued a new security alert warning of so-called hacktivists targeting Industrial Control Systems (ICS).

The report says the Cyber Centre and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has received “multiple reports” of incidents involving internet-accessible ICS.

Among the reports were an attack on a water facility, in which the miscreants tampered with water pressure valves and degraded the service for the community.

How to secure the assets

The report also mentions a Canadian oil and gas company, in which an Automated Tank Gauge (ATG) was manipulated into triggering false alarms.

Finally, there was an attack on a grain drying silo in a Canadian farm, where the attackers changed temperature and humidity levels. Luckily, the attack was caught on time, otherwise it could have resulted in “potentially unsafe conditions.”

ICS are computer-based systems used to monitor and control industrial processes and critical infrastructure, including Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control Systems (DCS), and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC).

By gaining access, cybercriminals can disrupt power grids, water supplies, manufacturing lines, or transportation networks, causing widespread damage and safety risks. For hacktivists, exploiting ICS is a way to gain media attention, discredit organizations, and “undermine Canada’s reputation,” the report further stated.

[TITLE]Shell to Sign Exclusive Oil Exploration Deal with Angola:
[TEXT]
One of Africa’s biggest oil producers, Angola, will sign next week an exclusive agreement with Shell under which the supermajor will explore and potentially develop several offshore blocks, Angola’s oil and gas agency ANPG has said.

“This event marks a historic moment for the Angolan oil sector, consolidating Shell's presence in Angola, an ANPG statement said, as carried by Reuters.

Under the agreement Shell will explore Blocks 19, 34, and 35 and several ultra-deepwater blocks as Angola looks to revive its exploration and production sector following years of underinvestment and supply restrictions under the deals within OPEC, which the country quit effective January 2024.

Earlier this year, Angola’s crude output slipped below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time in two and a half years and for the first time since one of Africa’s biggest oil producers quit OPEC.

Angola’s motivation to exit the cartel after 16 years was a spat with the OPEC and OPEC+ members

[TITLE]Trump tariffs to raise costs, delay oil and gas projects in 2026, report says:
[TEXT]
US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are set to raise operating costs, disrupt supply chains and weaken investment momentum for the oil and gas industry in 2026, a report published by Deloitte showed on Wednesday.

Why it’s important

The energy industry relies heavily on global supply chains and internationally sourced materials such as drilling rigs, valves, compressors and specialised steel are central to their operations.

US tariffs on these components and other key input materials, including steel, aluminum and copper, could increase material and service costs across the value chain by 4 per cent to 40 per cent, potentially compressing industry margins, the report said.

Context

The US has imposed tariffs on a wide range of imports, including 10 per cent to 25 per cent on crude feedstocks not covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and 50 per cent on steel, aluminum and copper.

The tariffs could reshape the oil and gas industry’s cost structure and add uncertainty around feedstock sourcing, Deloitte said in its report.

Key points

Inflation and financial uncertainty sparked by the tariffs could push final investment decisions (FIDs) and offshore greenfield projects worth more than $50 billion to 2026 or later.

As a result, operators may struggle to recover higher costs, which could eventually dampen investment activity in the sector, the report said.

As input costs climb and cascade through the value chain in the form of pricing adjustments, Deloitte expects oil and gas companies will renegotiate contracts with escalation and force majeure clauses to share risks and limit exposure to volatility.

What’s next

The ongoing disruptions could drive companies to prioritise supply chain resilience over lowest-cost sourcing and shift to domestic or non-tariffed suppliers and use foreign trade zones or tariff reclassification to manage duties, Deloitte said.

“This shift is significant given the United States’ reliance on imports, with nearly 40 per cent of oil country tubular goods demand in 2024 met through foreign sources.”

[TITLE]Nepal Calls for Renewable Energy Investment - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
Nepal Invites International Investment in Renewable Energy

New Delhi – The Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation, Physical Infrastructure and Transport, and Urban Development, Kulman Ghising, has called upon the international community to invest in Nepal’s hydropower and solar power, as well as other renewable energy sources. Minister Ghising highlighted that Nepal’s journey towards clean energy is entering a crucial new era.

“With immense hydropower potential, growing solar energy capacity, and expanding cross-border transmission lines and energy connections, we have the potential to sustainably energize the region,” Ghising stated. “I invite our friendly nations and partners to invest in Nepal, invest in renewable energy, and become part of a brighter and greener future for all.”

Addressing a thematic session on “Envisioning Regional and Global Interconnections for Large-Scale Clean Energy Transition,” Ghising served as a key speaker on the sustainable development of vast energy potential and the roadmap for trilateral electricity trade (Nepal-India-Bangladesh). He emphasized that Nepal’s hydropower is a strategic enabler for clean energy transformation in South Asia.

He noted that Nepal’s hydropower is a crucial resource for a resilient and stable grid in the region. Ghising highlighted Nepal’s vision to become a major exporter of clean and green energy to South Asia, with hydropower production not only contributing to the country’s development but also supporting regional sustainability. He mentioned that Nepal and India are jointly identifying and constructing high-capacity transmission line infrastructure with the goal of exporting 15,000 MW of renewable energy by 2035.

Nepal is rich in energy resources, with approximately 83,000 MW of hydropower potential and around 42,000 MW of pumped storage hydropower potential. These resources are clean, renewable, and ideally complement the solar and wind energy of Nepal’s neighboring countries, he added.

He explained that as grids develop regionally and globally, interconnected transmission networks enable the flow of renewable energy between different regions, balancing electricity demand and supply, reducing costs, and expanding access.

“This vision aligns perfectly with the ‘One Sun, One World, One Grid’ concept, where clean energy flows seamlessly and sustainably across borders,” he said. “To turn this vision into reality, regional countries must move towards an integrated electricity market.”

“Ensuring a seamless, non-discriminatory, and unrestricted flow of green energy requires transparent regulations, standardization of norms, and open access to transmission infrastructure – key elements for attracting private investment and ensuring long-term sustainability.”

Ghising emphasized that cross-border energy cooperation is at the heart of Nepal’s clean energy vision. He stressed the need to strengthen transmission infrastructure between not only Nepal and India but also India and Bangladesh to establish a fully integrated grid among the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) countries, facilitating effective regional integration of electricity.

He called for further strengthening regional and international cooperation to address and mitigate the serious damage that climate change is inflicting on electricity systems and livelihoods.

Minister Ghising stated, “Another crucial aspect of sustainability is the resilience of our energy infrastructure to cope with the increasing impacts of climate change. Although Nepal’s contribution to carbon emissions is negligible, frequent floods and droughts are causing serious damage to our electricity systems and livelihoods, often requiring large-scale reconstruction. Therefore, strengthening climate-resilient infrastructure is our national priority, and we call for further strengthening regional and international cooperation to address and mitigate these climate-induced damages.” He reiterated the importance of investment in renewable energy for a sustainable future.

[TITLE]US electric utilities entering investment ‘super-cycle,’ says Morningstar DBRS:
[TEXT]
U.S. electric utilities are entering a five-year capital expenditure “super-cycle” as they build out transmission and generation networks to meet new demand from data centers, Morningstar DBRS said in a Monday research note.

“Investment in electricity infrastructure is projected to be $1.4 trillion from 2025 to 2030, double the amount invested in the prior 10 years,” the firm said. And based on data from the North American Electric Reliability Corp., Morningstar said many regions can expect load growth to increase from previously estimated 6.1% to around 11.6% over the next decade.

“The challenges posed by the rapid buildout of data centers are overlaid on existing concerns for most utilities, including decarbonization and guaranteeing the reliability of grid infrastructure while increasing the contribution of renewable power,” Morningstar said. “The projected surge in demand provides opportunities for utilities that must be counterbalanced with structural changes and regulatory support for utilities and rate payers.”

"We anticipate that regulated utilities with supportive regulatory commissions, solid credit ratings, and access to capital markets will deploy the needed capex to take advantage of the data center boom," Bukola Folashakin, Morningstar assistant vice president of corporate ratings, said in a statement. "We expect this capex investment in turn to make such utility locations attractive for more data center construction, potentially creating a cycle of increased revenue for as long as data centers remain economically viable."

Some states — Morningstar named California, Texas, and Louisiana — will see elevated risks of resource inadequacy next year that “in extreme conditions, could trigger electricity shortfalls,” according to the note.

Morningstar’s analysis mirror’s recent capital expenditure estimates from the Edison Electric Institute, which expects U.S electricity generation to grow “for the foreseeable future.” The group, which represents investor-owned utilities, said generation rose 3% in 2024 and generation investments as a share of the industry’s total capital expenditures have risen for four straight years.

The rapid rise in electricity demand, following decades of stagnation, will challenge utilities in a few ways, according to Morningstar.

Uncertainty around needed data center capacity “makes it challenging for utilities to accurately forecast future power demand and the required investment,” according to the report. And those data centers bring demand surges that are driving “higher tolls for other customer segments,” which “will be exacerbated as more data centers become operational.”

Meeting the demand requires massive utility investment but “traditional funding sources are inadequate to meet future investment needs,” Morningstar said. “Utilities are increasingly looking to private capital to fill funding gaps,” while increased ratepayer-funded investments lead to regulatory lag.
