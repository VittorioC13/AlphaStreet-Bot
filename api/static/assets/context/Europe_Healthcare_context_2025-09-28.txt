US president Donald Trump's latest tariffs targeting pharmaceuticals do not apply to countries that have already negotiated trade deals, a White House official confirmed this evening.

Asked whether pharmaceutical tariffs apply to trading partners such as the European Union and Japan that already have trade deals, the official said the Trump administration would honour the 15pc cap as part of those pacts.

It came after Mr Trump announced a raft of import taxes, including 100pc on branded pharmaceutical drugs, to start on October 1.

In a statement this evening, Tánaiste Simon Harris welcomed the confirmation of the exemption from the new tariffs, which could have severely hit Ireland’s multinational pharma manufacturing sector.

“I welcome confirmation from White House officials this evening that the new tariffs outlined by President Trump in relation to pharma overnight will not apply to the EU, including Ireland, as a result of the EU-US framework agreement,” Mr Harris said.

“This is further proof of the benefit of having a negotiated trade agreement and the benefits of the very intensive work that we in Ireland and at a European Union level undertook over many months with the US administration to ensure this trade deal is in place.

“I intend to continue to intensively engage both with the EU and with the US administration, as I have been in recent days in New York and Washington DC, to seek further progress on the removal of trade barriers between the EU and the US in the time ahead.”

Mr Trump announced a raft of import taxes, including 100pc on branded pharmaceutical drugs, to start on October 1.

Other measures will include 50pc on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30pc on upholstered furniture and 25pc on heavy trucks.

Mr Trump’s devotion to tariffs did not end with the trade frameworks and import taxes that were launched in August

The posts on his social media site showed that Mr Trump’s devotion to tariffs did not end with the trade frameworks and import taxes that were launched in August, a reflection of the president’s confidence that taxes will help to reduce the US government’s budget deficit while increasing domestic manufacturing.

The additional tariffs risk intensifying inflation that is already elevated, as well as slowing economic growth, as employers getting used to Mr Trump’s previous import taxes grapple with new levels of uncertainty.

Britain has struck a trade deal with the US but it does not yet include pharma, leaving it open to the 100pc rate.

Mr Trump said on Truth Social that the pharmaceutical tariffs would not apply to companies that are building manufacturing plants in the United States, which he defined as either “breaking ground” or being “under construction”. It was unclear how the tariffs would apply to companies that already have factories in the US.

In August, Mr Trump imposed a 15pc tariff on most pharmaceutical exports from the European Union.

Ireland is one of the biggest exporters of pharmaceutical products to the US from the EU, accounting for €33bn of the €120bn in pharmaceutical exports to the US last year. This announcement now causes further uncertainty for Ireland’s pharmaceutical industry.

Writing this morning, Tánaiste Simon Harris said: “I want to stress, however, that the EU and US Joint Statement issued on August 21 was absolutely clear.

“Any new tariffs announced by the US on pharmaceuticals would be capped at 15pc for products exported by the EU.”

The Fine Gael leader and trade minister stressed: “This remains the case and underlines again the value of the agreement reached last month.”

The Tánaiste was returning home after a series of meetings in both New York and Washington, including a meeting with US secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick, where it is understood there was no hint of a new 100pc tariff.

[TITLE]Trump tariffs: Who stands to lose from new US pharma duties? – DW – 09:
[TEXT]
The US president's latest tariff move will see the US impose 100% levies on imports of branded or patented pharmaceutical goods from October 1. What could it mean for global trade?

The news came in much the same way as previous tariff bombshells from the US president had — suddenly, via social media, and with much left unclear.

In a post on his social media site late on Thursday, Donald Trump announced steep new tariffs on US pharmaceutical imports.

"Starting October 1st, 2025, we will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product, unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America,” he wrote on Truth Social.

So far, pharmaceutical goods have been exempt from the so-called reciprocal tariffs Trump announced back in April. That was mainly because earlier this year, the US government opened a national security probe examining the possibility of tariffs on pharma goods.

Trump has regularly threatened that pharmaceutical products would be hit with tariffs since returning to office in January so the move itself is not a major surprise, even if the timing is.

What exactly will the move mean for drugs companies?

There were two possible exemptions in Trump's announcement. He said the tariffs will not apply to so-called generic drugs, apparently meaning drugs and pharmaceuticals that use the same ingredients and are used in the same way as existing, branded drugs, originally covered by chemical patents.

However, Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, says the distinction between branded and generic drugs is not entirely clear because there can be a "big difference."

"There's a lot of branded, generic drugs for example. That all seems to be smashed together in Trump's announcement. At this stage, we just don't know how it will play out," she told DW.

Deborah Elms says it's still not clear what exactly will exempt a company from Trump's pharma tariffs Image: Hinrich Foundation

The other distinction Trump announced is that the tariffs will not apply to companies that produce drugs in the US or who plan to build factories there.

He wrote that "IS BUILDING" will be defined as "breaking ground" and/or "under construction." Therefore, there will be "no Tariff on these Pharmaceutical Products if construction has started," he added.

Elms says this carve-out could be significant but emphasized that because all there is to go on so far is a social media post from Trump.

If she were a pharma executive now she would be "buying a shovel and digging a hole somewhere," she suggested, in order to declare that her company had broken ground and was "preparing for a factory development."

"It's unclear what would be sufficient to avoid tariffs. They could come up with a lot of criteria that either qualifies or disqualifies. I can imagine that there will be a lot of confusion over this," said Elms.

Neil Shearing, Capital Economics' group chief economist, believes the announcement "is not quite as big a move as it appears at first sight" because the exemption for firms producing within the US is "more significant."

"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the US or have announced plans to build production in the near future. This would appear to make them exempt from the new tariffs," Shearing wrote in a note to clients.

Several large pharmaceutical companies have recently pledged to begin new construction in the US, such as Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, Roche Holding and GSK.

A report by US business daily Wall Street Journal earlier this month identified more than a dozen drugmakers which had pledged to spend more than $350 billion (€299 billion) collectively by the end of this decade on drugmaking and related activities within the US.

Which countries will be worst affected?

According to the United Nations Comtrade Database, the US imported around $213 billion worth of pharmaceutical products in 2024.

Data from the MIT Observatory of Economic Complexity identified Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore and India as the top five exporters of pharmaceuticals to the US in July 2025. The EU accounts for around 60% of all US pharma imports.

However, it is unclear how pharmaceutical firms operating from Ireland, Germany or other EU nations will be impacted. That's because when details of the US-EU trade agreement were released in late August, it appeared that EU pharma tariffs would be limited to 15%, in line with most other tariffs in the deal.

Simon Harris, Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, announced he would be "studying the impact of this announcement" but stressed that the August trade agreement made clear that tariffs on pharma products would be capped at 15%. "This remains the case," he said in a

[TITLE]The Baltics: a region punching above its weight on the global life sciences stage:
[TEXT]
Lithuania is home to over 400 companies involved in the life sciences ecosystem. Image credit: Gabrielius Jauniskis via Flickr

Once best-known on the world stage as a country with a rich basketball history, a sport so deeply ingrained in Lithuanian national identity and culture it is considered by many to be the country’s second religion, Lithuania in the present day is making plays in a different industry altogether – rapidly growing as a leading force in the European life sciences scene.

While Lithuania is a country with a population of just 2.8 million people, it is home to over 400 life sciences companies, involved in areas from gene editing, small molecule disciplines, and mental health R&D.

With the goal to have 5% of the country’s GDP driven by the life sciences industry by 2030, the presence of big players including Thermo Fisher Scientific and Biogen, and continued investment from the likes of Lithuanian life sciences conglomerate the Northway Group, the nation is fast becoming a regional leader in the biotech space.

This year’s Life Sciences Baltics conference revealed the actions Lithuania is undertaking in a bid to punch above its weight on the global life sciences stage. Speakers throughout the two-day event, which took place in Vilnius, Lithuania from 16-18 September, amply demonstrated how companies in Lithuania are driving success in the life sciences industry and how ecosystem partners are helping the region to succeed.

Supporting growth in the Baltics

In recent years, Lithuania, its Baltic country counterparts Latvia and Slovenia, plus Finland, set out to create a joint action plan to support a more integrated life sciences ecosystem across the Baltics.

The Baltic Biotech HUB Action Plan, which was developed under the EU’s BioConnect project, aims to help participants address gaps which may may not be immediately evident within their own local ecosystems and create a shared vision on a wider scale, explains Andrii Shekhirev, co-leader of non-profit the Biocatalyst Foundation, during a session at the conference.
