[TITLE]Cal-Maine Foods Positions for Growth in Prepared Foods with New Leadership and Expansion Plans:
[TEXT]
RIDGELAND, Miss., Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ: CALM), the largest egg company in the United States and a leading player in the egg-based food industry, is strengthening its prepared foods platform through new leadership appointments and targeted prepared foods production capacity expansions.

Johnathan Zoeller has joined Cal-Maine Foods as Chief Financial Officer, Prepared Foods, adding valuable external experience with over 25 years as a senior financial and corporate accounting executive. He most recently served as Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations for Westlake Corporation, a global diversified industrial company, where he led the global treasury operations, cash management, credit, collections, risk management, and investor relations functions for the Fortune 500 company since 2018.

In addition, Dave Jordan has been promoted internally to President, Echo Lake Foods, previously serving as Senior Vice President, Operations. Dave is a seasoned food and beverage operations leader known for modernizing manufacturing networks, driving large-scale transformation, and building high-performance, people-centered cultures. He brings deep expertise in enterprise operations, capital improvement execution, and continuous improvement across complex, multi-site organizations to the role.

“Talent is at the center of every chapter of sustained growth,” commented Sherman Miller, president and chief executive officer of Cal-Maine Foods. “We are thrilled to welcome John and celebrate Dave’s well-deserved promotion. Their leadership, expertise, and dedication will be central to our prepared foods platform, and we are excited to have them as part of the Cal-Maine Foods’ management team as we continue to grow and serve our customers.”

In parallel, Cal-Maine Foods is launching a new $15 million network optimization and capacity-expansion project at Echo Lake Foods, expected to add 17 million pounds of annual scrambled egg production by mid-fiscal 2027.

The project consolidates all scrambled egg manufacturing into a single, modernized facility, creating a more efficient, centralized operation, and expands capacity with a new production line at the facility to support both near-term demand and long-term organic growth. By centralizing production, Echo Lake Foods eliminates redundancy across sites, streamlines workflows, and strengthens supply reliability. In addition, the upgraded equipment and automation are expected to improve yields and reduce labor requirements. Together, we believe these improvements will enhance Echo Lake Foods’ operational efficiency, increase throughput, and position the network to meet rising customer demand as part of Cal-Maine Foods’ broader long-term prepared foods strategy.

This investment builds on the previously announced $14.8 million high-speed pancake line project, which is expected to add an additional 12 million pounds of annual production through early fiscal 2027.

While these expansion initiatives are underway and expected to drive higher output, improved efficiency, and greater operational flexibility once complete, Echo Lake Foods has and will experience a temporary reduction in production volumes and higher costs, which began late in the second fiscal quarter of 2026 and are expected to continue through the remainder of fiscal 2026.

In addition, Cal-Maine Foods announced that its joint venture, Crepini Foods, will invest $7 million through fiscal 2028 to add 18 million pounds of additional production capacity. This growth will be achieved through a series of new equipment and line installations, which is expected to gradually increase capacity over the next two years and expand Crepini Foods’ volume by more than sevenfold.

In total, these planned investments are expected to grow Cal-Maine’s prepared foods production capacity by more than 30 percent in the next 18-24 months.

“These prepared foods investments are a critical component of our multi-year plan to strengthen mid-cycle earnings, enhance portfolio resilience, and capture accelerating demand for high-protein, ready-to-eat, and convenience formats,” Mr. Miller said. “By investing in our facilities and building an exceptional leadership team, we believe we are creating a bigger, stronger, more capable prepared foods platform for the years ahead.”

[TITLE]Eterna Plc launches N21.5 billion Rights Issue:
[TEXT]
Caption: L-R: Managing Director/CEO, Mr Olumide Adeosun; Chairman, Board of Directors, Dr Gabriel Ogbechie, OON; and Company Secretary, Mr David Edet, at the formal signing ceremony for the Rights Issue of ETERNA Plc recently in Lagos Credit: Eterna Plc

Eterna Plc, one of Nigeria’s leading integrated energy companies, has finalised arrangements for a rights issue of 978,108,485 ordinary shares at N22.00 per share, expected to raise approximately N21.52 bn. The capital raise is designed to strengthen the company’s balance sheet and support strategic expansion across its business segments.

The formal signing ceremony for the rights issue was held on Tuesday, 2 December 2025, marking a major milestone in the company’s capital-raising programme, following shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting in July 2025.

Under the structure of the Rights Issue, existing shareholders are entitled to subscribe for three new ordinary shares of 50 kobo each for every four ordinary shares held as at the close of business on 27 November 2025. The subscription period will run from 12 January 2026, when the Acceptance List opens, to 18 February 2026, when it officially closes. All new shares issued will rank pari passu with existing ordinary shares.

This capital raise follows Eterna Plc’s strong financial performance in recent years. The company recorded a 71 per cent increase in revenue to N313.6 bn in 2024, compared to N183.2 bn in 2023. It also returned to profitability with a profit before tax of N4.48 bn, representing a significant turnaround from the N11.97 bn loss recorded in 2023.

The positive financial momentum has continued into 2025, with half-year results showing a 6.9 per cent increase in consolidated revenue and a 143.9 per cent rise in profit before tax to N1.57 bn, compared to the same period in 2024.

Proceeds from the Rights Issue will be deployed to support several strategic initiatives, including the expansion of the retail network, upgrading of the lubricant blending plant, enhancement of LPG retail assets, acquisition of commercial delivery assets, expansion of aviation fuelling operations, and investment in ESG-related projects.

A portion of the capital raised will also serve as an operational working capital buffer to enhance day-to-day liquidity, including inventory financing and short-term trade payables. This is expected to provide resilience against market volatility, foreign exchange fluctuations, and potential supply disruptions.

The Nigerian downstream oil and gas sector continues to undergo structural reforms, regulatory adjustments, and macroeconomic pressures such as fuel price deregulation, foreign exchange instability, and volatility in global crude oil prices. Despite these challenges, Eterna Plc has maintained resilience through its diversified and integrated operations across fuel distribution, lubricant manufacturing, LPG retailing, and aviation fuelling.

The Board of Directors, led by the Chairman, Dr Gabriel Ogbechie, OON, believes that the Rights Issue will further strengthen Eterna’s competitive positioning in the downstream sector and enable the company to pursue opportunities in energy transition, LPG network expansion, and accelerated retail growth.

[TITLE]From Nigeria to Namibia, Africa’s Energy Revival Draws a Flood of New Capital:
[TEXT]
Many of the resource-rich countries in Africa have intensified efforts to become more attractive for exploration and production (E&P) investment. Reforms in licensing rounds, production sharing contracts, and fiscal policy are improving investor returns and are set to drive $41 billion in upstream investment in 2026, the African Energy Chamber’s State of African Energy 2026 Outlook shows.

From legacy oil producers Nigeria and Angola to emerging exploration hotspots such as Namibia, African resource holders are looking to compete with other regions for the billions of U.S. dollars that foreign investors could pour into their energy and minerals sectors.

Long-time producers, including the biggest oil producers Nigeria, Libya, and Angola, have made their licensing and fiscal policy more attractive, and emerging wannabe producers are offering incentives. All African countries are betting on boosting natural gas exploration, production, and development amid growing demand for gas and LNG for domestic use and for exports to Europe and Asia.

“The continent offers compelling opportunities for investors who are prepared to engage in a transparent, regulated, and increasingly competitive E&P landscape,” AEC executive chairman NJ Ayuk said in a statement.

“Governments and operators must continue to balance national priorities with investor confidence to unlock Africa’s vast hydrocarbon potential.”

Reforms in recent years have allowed Angola to improve its above-ground risk score since 2017, reflecting extensive regulatory and institutional reforms. Angola’s fiscal incentives, including terms for gas, marginal fields, and incremental production, have successfully attracted upstream investment, consolidating its status as a continental leader, AEC’s report said.

Related: Global Supply Woes Push Copper Past $11,400 Per Ton

While Angola is trying to reverse years of falling oil production, it bets big on standalone gas development and has just launched its first plant to process non-associated natural gas.

Angola also looks to accelerate the permitting phase of new minerals projects to attract investment. In October, Angola launched production at its first major copper mine, Tetelo, as the country looks to diversify into critical minerals.

Nigeria, the top oil producer in Africa, is auctioning 50 oil and gas blocks, eyeing $10 billion in new investments over the next ten years and 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in additional production capacity.

Nigeria’s licensing program with updated terms and incentives targeting specific terrains and resource types has renewed interest in projects in the country and has boosted investor confidence in the upstream potential, evidenced in recent project approvals by Shell and TotalEnergies, AEC said.

Senegal and Cote d’Ivoire in West Africa have also attracted the interest and investment of the international majors.

Cote d’Ivoire has seen majors expand offshore development, and its huge oil and gas field Baleine started up production two years after discovery, thanks to Italy’s Eni.

According to the African Energy Chamber, Cote d’Ivoire maintains a pragmatic approach to foreign investment and regardless of the outcome of the 2025 presidential election, authorities are expected to continue supporting upstream investors while emphasizing adherence to local content requirements, particularly for offshore developments.

Real GDP growth in Senegal is expected at

[TITLE]REA Plans N500bn Capital Market Raise for Solar Projects:
[TEXT]
The Rural Electrification Agency says it will go to the capital market to raise N500bn, backed by a new renewable asset management company designed to hold and leverage federal solar investments worth $200m to $300m.

The Managing Director of the agency, Abba Aliyu, disclosed this at PwC’s power roundtable in Lagos recently, saying the move was part of a broader push to unlock long-term financing for off-grid projects.

He said the Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, had approved the creation of the Renewable Energy Asset Management Company, adding that the agency would immediately move all its renewable assets into the new firm.

According to him, the new RAMCO will be created with a balance sheet of close to $200m to $300m, and the assets must be collateralised to create more private sector funding.

He explained, “For the sustainability of our projects, the minister approved the creation of the Renewable Energy Asset Management Company. And I presented this because the private sector needs to see this. So, all those assets of energising education that we have done, we have sent the request. Once the minister approves it, we are going to move those assets into the balance sheet of this RAMCO.

“So, the RAMCO will be created with a balance sheet of close to $200m to $300m. And we are not now going to wait and just look at our asset, just providing services. Those assets must be collateralised to create more private sector funding.

“REA will soon go to the capital market to raise N500bn using RAMCO, using the assets for us to have funding to continue to do the work that we are doing. And that is also the great finance and investment facility that we are now co-hosting. We want to now change that narrative because we can’t just sit and say there is no project development financing. What are we doing? So we are changing that.

We’re discussing with the Bank of Industry to create a project planning, financing, and credit facility all embedded in one. And this is a discussion that has gone very far.”

Aliyu explained that REA’s planning data now shows that 22 million households need electricity access.

He said the agency’s modelling identified 9.9 million homes suitable for solar home systems, 5.3 million for grid extension, and 6.8 million for mini-grids.

But despite growing demand, Aliyu said large-scale renewable projects remain stalled by a crippling lack of early-stage funding.

“Limited access to project development financing is one key challenge. To date, there is no financier that I know that provides financing for project development,” he said.

According to him, developers of the earlier 14 grid-connected Independent Power Producers failed because banks refused to support them before project viability was established.

”We have seen the case of those that have spent money, that wanted to do the grid-connected renewables, the 14 IPPs… They spent money, and at the end of the day, they could not reach viability. So, that lack of viable financing for project development, to me, is one of the key challenges that is there,” he said.

He also faulted banks for staying on the sidelines, saying, “Apart from Sterling Bank, Stanbic IBTC, and FCMB, we have not seen other banks critically active in financing even the renewable energy due to lack of understanding of the infrastructure.”

Aliyu further listed supply-chain bottlenecks, low productive demand in rural areas and social hesitation toward solar as major barriers.

He regretted that some people have not seen renewable energy, specifically solar, as a viable alternative for providing electricity.

He argued that renewable energy must be treated as core national infrastructure, saying, “Renewable energy is an infrastructure project, and it should be seen as that.”

[TITLE]Rail Vision Enters the Quantum Transportation Market with Strategic Acquisition Agreement:
[TEXT]
Ra’anana, Israel, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rail Vision Ltd. (Nasdaq: RVSN) (“Rail Vision” or the “Company”), an early commercialization stage technology company seeking to revolutionize railway safety and the data-related market, today announced the signing of an agreement for a strategic transaction to acquire 51% ownership of Quantum Transportation Ltd. (the “Acquisition” and “Quantum Transportation”), a cutting-edge quantum computing and AI company specializing in error correction technologies. The closing of the Acquisition is expected to close in late December 2025 to early January 2026, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Quantum Transportation holds an exclusive sub license, for rail technologies and platforms, for an innovative pending patent application in quantum error correction owned by Ramot , the technology transfer company of the Tel Aviv University. This IP and additional know-how addresses critical challenges in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices by enabling efficient, real-time decoding of surface code errors, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to traditional methods and supporting scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Through this transaction, Rail Vision and Quantum Transportation aim to combine quantum-AI based intellectual property (IP) protection and innovation with Rail Vision’s advanced vision and railway-safety technologies.

This strategic combination is expected to create meaningful technological synergies, enhance Rail Vision’s current and future product lines, accelerate innovation, and support long-term value creation for stakeholders.

Upon the closing of the Acquisition, Rail Vision will issue ordinary shares representing approximately 4.99% of its issued and outstanding share capital, immediately prior to such issuance, to certain Quantum Transportation shareholders (the “Exchanging Shareholders”) in exchange for their full holdings in Quantum Transportation, representing 51% ownership of Quantum Transportation Ltd. and securing majority control post-closing.

Additionally, upon the closing of the Acquisition, Rail Vision will extend a convertible loan of up to $700,000 to Quantum Transportation at an 8% annual interest rate, disbursed in tranches to support Quantum Transportation's ongoing operations and development roadmap for the next 18 months. The loan, including principal and interest, shall be repayable in one payment within a 24-month term. Rail Vision will have the sole discretion to convert the outstanding amount into Quantum Transportation’s most senior class of shares, at a conversion price equal to the lower of (i) the valuation implied by the share exchange in the current acquisition or (ii) the price per share in a future equity investment in Quantum Transportation, subject to certain conditions.

Quantum Transportation’s sub-licensed, machine learning-based universal decoder pending patent represents a potential breakthrough in quantum error correction, addressing the inherent noise in qubits that limit scalable quantum computing. This technology, developed by leading computer science experts and protected as patented IP, is code-agnostic, noise-aware, and scalable. This enables it to adapt seamlessly across various hardware platforms and code sizes and empowers quantum hardware companies and labs, particularly small- to medium-sized entities, to research and select optimal error correction schemes without in-house teams.

By utilizing this IP for transportation applications, including railway, Rail Vision aims to unlock new capabilities in anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and autonomous rail operations, capitalizing on the growing quantum computing market projected to drive exponential advancements in transportation.

We believe PAD is poised for sustained expansion and value creation, and we are excited to partner with them to bring this outstanding business to the public markets. We look forward to working closely with the PAD team to support their strategic vision.”

Key Transaction Terms and Structure

Under the business combination agreement, PAD’s implied enterprise value is up to $320 million (at a $10.00 per share reference price and after giving effect to certain pending acquisitions). Key terms of the business combination include:

● Capital & Financing: In connection with the proposed business combination, PAD has entered into a non-binding indicative term sheet with BC Partners relating to a potential credit facility and equity financing of up to an anticipated aggregate amount of $80 million (the “Financing”). The Financing is subject to numerous conditions, including, without limitation, the completion of due diligence and the execution and delivery of definitive documentation. We anticipate that the Financing, together with the funds in FACT’s trust account (consisting of approximately $175 million in gross proceeds raised in FACT’s initial public offering, subject to any redemptions), would provide funding to strengthen PAD’s balance sheet, finance strategic acquisitions, and support ongoing growth. In addition, the parties may seek other sources of financing in connection with the business combination and to bolster PAD’s balance sheet and fund future growth initiatives. There can be no assurance that any definitive agreement will be entered into in relation to the Financing or that the Financing or any other financing will be completed on the terms described, or at all. ● Incoming Capital: Incoming capital would permit PAD to optimize its balance sheet, consummate existing planned acquisitions and fund its future acquisition pipeline. Any additional cash to PAD’s balance sheet is expected to be used for general corporate purposes, positioning the combined company for robust growth post-closing. There can be no assurance that any planned acquisitions will be completed or additional funding will be consummated. ● Pro Forma Ownership Structure: Following the business combination, PAD’s current shareholders are expected to own approximately 59% of the combined company’s outstanding shares. ● Governance and Leadership: We anticipate that the combined company’s board of directors will include, among others, certain current directors of PAD, one designee by FACT’s sponsor, and independent directors with relevant industry experience. The combined company will remain headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, and PAD’s seasoned executive team will continue to lead day-to-day operations.

Aerospace companies set to get more capital market support as reusable rockets make headway

Global Times

By Chu Daye Published: Nov 28, 2025 10:46 PM

Six Chinese commercial aerospace companies had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus from June 18 to November 27, the Securities Daily reported on Friday, amid faster growth in China's commercial aerospace sector and launches being scheduled for several reusable carrier rockets in the coming months.

Chinese industry insiders and financial experts said more commercial aerospace companies are set to receive further support from the capital market as China's commercial aerospace industry moves from the technological exploration phase to commercialization.

The Securities Daily reported on Friday that six commercial space companies, including Chinese private space firms LandSpace, Galactic Energy, CAS Space, Space Pioneer, Yee Space and Mino Space, have had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus.

The IPO progress has come amid China's increasing policy support for the sector. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced in June a new sci-tech growth tier on the country's Nasdaq-style Science and Technology Innovation Board, also known as the STAR Market.

The regulator also called for more support for companies in cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence and commercial aerospace, such as more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market, in light of industrial development and market demand.

Beijing-based LandSpace said in a statement sent to the Global Times that it is set to launch its ZQ-3 reusable rocket at the end of November. Industry analysts said this will be a key step in the mastering of heavy duty, low cost and reusable rockets by Chinese private space firms.

Space Pioneer, another Beijing-based aerospace company, is also preparing for a launch for its Tianlong-3 reusable rocket, according to the South China Morning Post. The rocket is expected to be used to build China's massive internet satellite constellations, the report said.

A Beijing-based venture capital investor surnamed Liu told the Global Times on Friday that there has been a marked rise in market attention toward the commercial aerospace sector, given the policy support and recent progress made in the industry. "The new policies are also a boon for earlier-stage investors looking for an exit strategy," Liu said.

Tian Lihui, professor of finance at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Friday that listing can not only address the financing challenges faced by enterprises and secure funding for continuous research and development input, but also guide capital toward companies with genuine technical strengths and commercial potential. It will also promote the healthy development of the industry, Tian noted.

The CSRC's call for more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market precisely addresses the chokepoint for commercial aerospace - high R&D investment and long profitability cycles - by opening up more capital market channels for the industry, Tian said.

Further policy support came on Tuesday, when China's space agency released an action plan to back commercial space firms and encourage them to pursue international cooperation over the next two years.

The document released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said the country's commercial space enterprises should "go global" and help developing countries to build satellite-application industries.

Among the supportive measures, the CNSA will establish a national commercial space development fund and local governments will be urged to establish technology-innovation centers focused on reusable rockets and smart satellites, and to build open platforms for advanced manufacturing, final assembly and testing.

The plan aims to achieve high-quality commercial space development by 2027. The recommendations for the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) list the aerospace sector among China's strategic emerging industries.
