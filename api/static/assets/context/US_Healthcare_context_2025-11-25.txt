[TITLE]Hartford HealthCare could acquire 2 Prospect hospitals by year end:
[TEXT]
After years of uncertainty regarding the future of the Connecticut hospitals owned by bankrupt operator Prospect Medical Holdings, two of the three facilities could have a new owner by the end of the year.

On Tuesday, Hartford HealthCare, one of Connecticut’s largest health systems, presented its case to the state’s Office of Health Strategy to purchase Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals. Under the new expedited approval timeline for hospitals in bankruptcy, state officials must issue a decision by Dec. 30.

During the public hearing, Hartford HealthCare CEO Jeffrey Flaks said the health system plans to bring all its expertise, resources and capabilities to Manchester, Rockville and the surrounding towns.

“The robust apparatus of Hartford HealthCare will be brought to these communities to make health care better. That’s why I’m so confident that we have this very unique opportunity to dramatically improve health care that will be here for generations going forward,” Flaks said.

Hartford HealthCare will spend $86.1 million to purchase the facilities and pledged to invest an additional $225.7 million towards capital improvements, like facility and IT upgrades, over the next three years.

Hartford HealthCare also plans to recruit new physicians to the Manchester and Rockville communities, as well as expand access to specialty care, like oncology, inpatient rehabilitation and vascular and orthopedic surgical services, according to the application submitted to the state.

If approved, the deal would serve as the first step towards concluding a lengthy search to find new buyers for Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals — a process that often seemed on the brink of failure.

In 2022, Prospect signed a deal to sell its three Connecticut hospitals — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury — to Yale New Haven Health for $435 million. But the deal was mired in setbacks and litigation.

In August 2023, a cyberattack crippled operations at Prospect’s facilities around the country. In 2024, Yale New Haven Health and Prospect Medical sued and countersued each other over the true value of the hospitals. In January 2025, Prospect filed for bankruptcy and, by the following month, Yale officials said a deal appeared “impossible.”

In September, Yale agreed to pay $45 million to Prospect to end all disputes over the hospitals’ sale.

Hartford HealthCare stepped in and its acquisitions of the Manchester and Rockville facilities could be finalized by the end of the year. Connecticut’s flagship academic medical institution, UConn Health, seems poised to acquire Waterbury Hospital. A judge for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas approved the UConn deal earlier this week, and now the transaction must obtain state approval.

It’s a speedy transition for the three hospitals, whose ownership had languished in uncertainty for years.

While the Yale deal was pending, Lamont and OHS received broad criticism for the lengthy approval process. That led state legislators to approve a measure earlier this year that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy.

Under the emergency certificate of need timeline, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete.

In an emailed statement, Lamont’s spokesperson Rob Blanchard said OHS “met all statutory timelines in the Yale-Prospect [certificate of need review]” and that the legal disputes between the two companies illustrate the transaction’s complexity.

“Yale’s decision to file suit against Prospect less than two months after the agreed settlement raised clear concerns

[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) between February 5, 2025 and July 23, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important December 2, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Molina securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 2, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period failed to disclose to investors: (1) material, adverse facts concerning Molina’s “medical cost trend assumptions;” (2) that Molina was experiencing a “dislocation between premium rates and medical cost trend;” (3) that Molina’s near term growth was dependent on a lack of “utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services;” (4) as a result of the foregoing, Molina’s financial guidance for fiscal year 2025 was substantially likely to be cut; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Molina’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

[TITLE]Harrow Announces Closing of Acquisition of Melt Pharmaceuticals:
[TEXT]
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Harrow (Nasdaq: HROW), a leading provider of ophthalmic disease management solutions in North America, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Melt Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Melt), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company pioneering non-opioid, non-IV therapies for sedation for medical procedures in the hospital, outpatient, and in-office settings. Melt’s product candidates, MELT-210, MELT-300, and MELT-400, are based on the proprietary Zydis® ODT (oral dissolving tablet) drug delivery platform. The closing of the Melt acquisition marks a strategic expansion of Harrow’s portfolio and reinforces its commitment to delivering innovative therapies that improve patient outcomes.

With global patent coverage and potential applications in ophthalmology, gastroenterology, dental care, and a wide range of outpatient procedures where sedation or anxiety management is needed, from diagnostic imaging to endoscopy procedures to pre-anesthesia, Melt’s drug candidates, including MELT-300, position Harrow to enter the multi-billion-dollar annual U.S. and global procedural sedation and anxiety market.

MELT-300 represents a transformative opportunity, building on more than a decade of real-world experience with MKO Melt® — a compounded sublingual sedation product sold by Harrow’s ImprimisRx subsidiary and currently administered by over 800 U.S. ophthalmic institutions, primarily for cataract surgery. As a potential FDA-approved successor, MELT-300 is a patented, sublingually delivered formulation of a fixed dose of midazolam (3mg) and ketamine (50mg) designed to provide rapid, predictable sedation without the need for intravenous administration. The MELT-300 Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical programs previously demonstrated statistical superiority to midazolam alone. The innovative approach to sedation MELT-300 offers has the potential to transform patient experiences across a wide range of office-based and outpatient procedures, addressing the healthcare system’s growing demand to reduce exposure to opioids, including fentanyl.

“The development of MELT-300 marks a defining milestone for Harrow — our first product taken from ideation to the brink of commercialization. I still remember the first call we received

[TITLE]Salarius Pharmaceuticals Cites Errors on S&P CapIQ Platform Following Merger with Decoy Therapeutics, Affirms Its Shares Continue to Trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market Under the Symbol “SLRX”:
[TEXT]
HOUSTON and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Salarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SLRX) (Salarius or the Company) cites an error on the S&P CapIQ platform and reiterates that its common stock continues to trade uninterrupted on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the stock ticker “SLRX.”

S&P CapIQ inaccurately characterized the Salarius Pharmaceuticals and Decoy Therapeutics merger and inaccurately stated that the Company had been delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company is working to have this inaccurate information corrected. Similar inaccuracies that appeared on Yahoo Finance were corrected earlier this week.

On November 13, 2025, Salarius completed an underwritten public offering raising gross proceeds of $8 million and consummated the previously announced merger with Decoy Therapeutics (Decoy). As of the date of this release, the combined company had pro forma cash of approximately $14 million and approximately 5.9 million shares of common stock outstanding. The company is focused on advancing Decoy’s pipeline of peptide conjugate therapeutics engineered through its IMP3ACT platform that reduces the complexity of drug development and manufacturing.

During the next 12 months, Decoy expects to advance its lead asset, a pan-coronavirus antiviral, to the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to make progress on other programs including a novel broad-acting antiviral to treat flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and a peptide drug conjugate targeting GI cancers.

[TITLE]Will Cogent Biosciences’ (COGT) Breakthrough Therapy Transform GIST Treatment? Analysts Think So:
[TEXT]
Cogent Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ:COGT) is among the hottest SMID-cap stocks so far in 2025. On November 13, H.C. Wainwright made a notable upward revision to its outlook on the company, more than doubling its price target from $21 to $50 while reaffirming a Buy rating, according to TheFly.

The investment firm’s increased confidence was driven by positive data from the company’s Phase 3 PEAK trial, which studied the combination of its therapy, bezuclastinib, with sunitinib. Following the announcement, the analysts believe that bezuclastinib plus sunitinib could emerge as the second-line standard of care in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).

Cogent Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ:COGT) announced the trial results on November 10, and several analysts saw them as highly positive for the company’s outlook. The company said it plans to submit a new drug application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bezuclastinib in GIST in the first half of 2026.

Cogent Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ:COGT) shares skyrocketed 119% on the day of the announcement.

Sara Rothschild, Executive Director at the non-profit organization, The Life Raft Group, which supports GIST patients, stated:

“Imatinib-resistant or intolerant GIST patients have waited nearly 20 years for a new second-line treatment option. The remarkable results of the PEAK study suggest that wait has come to an end.”

Andrew Robbins, Cogent’s President and Chief Executive Officer, called it a historic day for Cogent Biosciences and the GIST patient community. He further stated:

“We are extremely excited to announce positive results from the Phase 3 PEAK trial of bezuclastinib plus sunitinib, which have far surpassed our expectations for the activity of this combination in patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant GIST. With these incredible results, including a greater than seven-month improvement on mPFS – reducing the rate of progression or death by half – the bezuclastinib combination is poised to become the new standard of care for treatment of second-line GIST patients.”

Cogent Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ:COGT) is a biotechnology company that develops precision therapies for patients with genetically defined diseases. Their primary focus is on targeting various forms of mastocytosis and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).

While we acknowledge the potential of COGT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TEXT]
Celcuity Inc. (NASDAQ:CELC) is among the hottest SMID-cap stocks so far in 2025. Following recent clinical progress, Wolfe Research initiated coverage on Celcuity on November 17, with an Outperform rating and a $110 price target, according to TheFly.

The firm highlighted the company’s strong momentum following the recent Phase 3 success for gedatolisib in second-line PIK3CA-WT breast cancer. With that success, it believes that the upcoming PIK3CA-mt readout should be a key catalyst in 2026. In addition, Wolfe Research believes that continued clinical progress has strengthened the company’s strategic value, positioning Celcuity as a compelling acquisition target for large pharmaceutical companies.

On the same day, November 17, the company announced that it had submitted its New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for gedatolisib.

Earlier, on October 18, the company had announced detailed efficacy and safety results from the PIK3CA wild-type (“WT”) cohort of the Phase 3 VIKTORIA-1 clinical trial of gedatolisib at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. The data indicated a significant improvement through the therapy, with up to a 76% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death.

Celcuity Inc. (NASDAQ:CELC) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pursuing the development of targeted therapies for oncology.

While we acknowledge the potential of CELC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Analysts Shift to Hold as Cidara’s (CDTX) Recent Acquisition Deal Caps Upside:
[TEXT]
Cidara Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:CDTX) is the top stock in our list of the hottest SMID-cap stocks so far in 2025 with a 717% share price surge year-to-date. Following the acquisition announcement by Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Guggenheim analyst Seamus Fernandez downgraded his rating on Cidara Therapeutics from Buy to Neutral on November 17, according to TheFly. Before the deal, Fernandez had assigned a price target of $167, but after the downgrade, he raised it to the offer price of $221.5.

On November 14, Merck announced the acquisition of Cidara Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:CDTX) in an all-cash deal at $221.5 per share, valuing the transaction at $9.2 billion. The offer price represented a 109% premium over the November 13 closing price of $105.99. Under the deal’s terms, a Merck subsidiary will acquire all of Cidara’s outstanding shares through a tender offer and is expected to close the deal in the first quarter of 2026, after receiving required approvals.

With this deal, Merck plans to expand its infectious disease portfolio with Cidara’s lead drug-Fc conjugates (DFC) candidate, CD388, a late-stage, long-acting antiviral designed to prevent influenza in people at high risk of complications. CD388 is currently in Phase 3 (ANCHOR Study) and has held Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations following positive Phase 2b results.

According to reports, this addition should help Merck offset revenue declines from upcoming patent expirations of its key drug, Keytruda. Underpinning the importance of this deal, Merck CEO Rob Davis noted that CD388 is an “important driver of growth through the next decade.”

On the day of the announcement, Cidara Therapeutics Inc.’s (NASDAQ:CDTX) stock rallied by over 105% to close near the offer price. With that, the stock has rallied 717% year to date.

Apart from Guggenheim, analysts, including those from H.C. Wainwright, JPMorgan, and RBC Capital, also downgraded the stock to Hold. Morgan Stanley analyst Maxwell Skor expects the deal to sail through as per plans, and thus downgraded the stock to Equal Weight, raising his price target to the offer price of $221.5.

Cidara Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:CDTX) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. It develops anti-infectives for the treatment and prevention of fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens.

While we acknowledge the potential of CDTX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Healthcare ETFs to Buy as Big Pharma Rapidly Integrates AI:
[TEXT]
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer confined to the tech sector; it is being aggressively integrated across all industries, from defense to food processing, with healthcare being no exception. Over the past couple of years, AI integration in the U.S. healthcare industry has increased manifold. According to an IDC report commissioned by Microsoft and released in March 2024, 79% of healthcare organizations were already utilizing AI technology.

This rapid integration has been evident through strategic partnerships between major pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly LLY, Johnson & Johnson JNJ and AbbVie ABBV, and AI-centric tech giants like Palantir PLTR and Nvidia NVDA.

By accelerating drug discovery, streamlining clinical trials, and automating administrative tasks, these AI collaborations are expected to cut billions in costs, enhance operational efficiency and enable faster breakthroughs. This, in turn, is likely to bolster the underlying healthcare stocks and, by extension, strengthen the performance of healthcare exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide exposure to them.

Now, before suggesting healthcare ETFs that you may consider adding to your portfolio to benefit from AI-driven growth in the sector, let’s take a closer look at these partnerships to understand how AI is transforming the healthcare industry.

Notable Pharma-Tech Collaborations

Big Pharma's accelerated AI adoption is best illustrated by its strategic collaborations with AI-centric tech stocks:

• In October 2025, it was announced that Eli Lilly is partnering with NVIDIA to build an "AI Factory," leveraging the NVIDIA Blackwell DGX SuperPOD to power the world's most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to drug discovery. This is aimed at compressing decades of research into instantly accessible intelligence, dramatically accelerating the time from target identification to clinical candidate.

• JNJ has been working with NVIDIA for more than a year to scale AI for use in surgery. This collaboration is aimed at delivering real-time analysis and AI-powered insights within the operating room, using advanced computing platforms to enhance surgical decision-making and training.

In October 2025, the company revealed that it is using an AI-driven simulation to train clinical teams on the MONARCH robotic platform for urology. To achieve this, JNJ is leveraging NVIDIA’s Isaac and Omniverse platforms to create high-fidelity digital twins of the system and patient anatomy, enabling teams to practice robot setup and simulate kidney stone procedures in a virtual operating room. The company is also using NVIDIA Cosmos for generating accurate, physics-based synthetic data, enhancing learning and procedure planning prior to surgery.

[TITLE]Hartford HealthCare could acquire 2 Prospect hospitals by year end:
[TEXT]
After years of uncertainty regarding the future of the Connecticut hospitals owned by bankrupt operator Prospect Medical Holdings, two of the three facilities could have a new owner by the end of the year.

On Tuesday, Hartford HealthCare, one of Connecticut’s largest health systems, presented its case to the state’s Office of Health Strategy to purchase Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals. Under the new expedited approval timeline for hospitals in bankruptcy, state officials must issue a decision by Dec. 30.

During the public hearing, Hartford HealthCare CEO Jeffrey Flaks said the health system plans to bring all its expertise, resources and capabilities to Manchester, Rockville and the surrounding towns.

“The robust apparatus of Hartford HealthCare will be brought to these communities to make health care better. That’s why I’m so confident that we have this very unique opportunity to dramatically improve health care that will be here for generations going forward,” Flaks said.

Hartford HealthCare will spend $86.1 million to purchase the facilities and pledged to invest an additional $225.7 million towards capital improvements, like facility and IT upgrades, over the next three years.

Hartford HealthCare also plans to recruit new physicians to the Manchester and Rockville communities, as well as expand access to specialty care, like oncology, inpatient rehabilitation and vascular and orthopedic surgical services, according to the application submitted to the state.

If approved, the deal would serve as the first step towards concluding a lengthy search to find new buyers for Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals — a process that often seemed on the brink of failure.

In 2022, Prospect signed a deal to sell its three Connecticut hospitals — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury — to Yale New Haven Health for $435 million. But the deal was mired in setbacks and litigation.

In August 2023, a cyberattack crippled operations at Prospect’s facilities around the country. In 2024, Yale New Haven Health and Prospect Medical sued and countersued each other over the true value of the hospitals. In January 2025, Prospect filed for bankruptcy and, by the following month, Yale officials said a deal appeared “impossible.”

In September, Yale agreed to pay $45 million to Prospect to end all disputes over the hospitals’ sale.

Hartford HealthCare stepped in and its acquisitions of the Manchester and Rockville facilities could be finalized by the end of the year. Connecticut’s flagship academic medical institution, UConn Health, seems poised to acquire Waterbury Hospital. A judge for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas approved the UConn deal earlier this week, and now the transaction must obtain state approval.

It’s a speedy transition for the three hospitals, whose ownership had languished in uncertainty for years.

While the Yale deal was pending, Lamont and OHS received broad criticism for the lengthy approval process. That led state legislators to approve a measure earlier this year that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy.

Under the emergency certificate of need timeline, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete.

In an emailed statement, Lamont’s spokesperson Rob Blanchard said OHS “met all statutory timelines in the Yale-Prospect [certificate of need review]” and that the legal disputes between the two companies illustrate the transaction’s complexity.

“Yale’s decision to file suit against Prospect less than two months after the agreed settlement raised clear concerns

[TITLE]MOH DEADLINE NOTICE: ROSEN, A HIGHLY RECOGNIZED LAW FIRM, Encourages Molina Healthcare, Inc. Investors with Losses in Excess of $100K to Secure Counsel Before Important December 2 Deadline in Securiti:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) between February 5, 2025 and July 23, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important December 2, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Molina securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 2, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period failed to disclose to investors: (1) material, adverse facts concerning Molina’s “medical cost trend assumptions;” (2) that Molina was experiencing a “dislocation between premium rates and medical cost trend;” (3) that Molina’s near term growth was dependent on a lack of “utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services;” (4) as a result of the foregoing, Molina’s financial guidance for fiscal year 2025 was substantially likely to be cut; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Molina’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
