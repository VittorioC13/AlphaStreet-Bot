Trump eyes US government stakes in other chip makers that received CHIPS Act funds, sources say

Reuters ^ | August 19, 2025 | Nandita Bose and Max A. Cherney

Posted on by GrootheWanderer

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is looking into the federal government taking equity stakes in computer chip manufacturers that receive CHIPS Act funding to build factories in the country, two sources said. Expanding on a plan to receive an equity stake in Intel, a White House official and a person familiar with the situation said Lutnick is exploring how the U.S. can receive equity stakes in exchange for CHIPS Act funding for companies such as Micron Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung. Much of the funding has not yet been dispersed.

If China takes over Taiwan we’re up the creek without a paddle. That makes this different. For the first time in o our history we have critical goods coming from a potential enemy. Why is that a problem? What if all the tanks in the world were produced by Germany - and it’s 1939. Trump needs to take a major part of Intel and start the process of building larger chips. Same with companies that build large transformers.

If the purpose is limited to the return of funds doled out via the CHIPS act then this might be okay. The CHIPS act itself was probably socialism anyway, so this might cancel it out..

I guess I got my answer.

IIRC Intel was going to build a plant in Columbus, OH and backed out when Biden Admin attached DEI requirements to the money. Not sure if it’s on again or not.

Why is the government paying people to make chimps? Don't chimps make enough baby chimps on their own?

To: GrootheWanderer

In general I oppose government industry (which is called fascidm in other countries) because

1. Government doesn’t have the best track record running enterprises

And

2. We need a MUCH smaller and far LESS powerful fed govt, one more aligned with its constitutional mandate Having said all that, IF this is the only way to keep microchips alive in USA (????) then so be it. However I STILL don’t see why the shares aren’t sold to American investors

If this means the taxpayers will get reimbursed for our investment in these companies, perhaps even profit-sharing, I’m fine with it. Every grant we ever gave out for corporate R&D should have been paid back at the very least.

[TITLE]CHIPS Act funding could herald an era where the U.S. is not offering grants, but buying equity — Lutnick's semiconductor strategy might not end with Intel:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump was no fan of the CHIPS and Science Act. The U.S. President said in a March speech to Congress that he wanted to eliminate the subsidy: "Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn't mean a thing." The leader then proposed that the planned $52 billion in subsidies should be put toward reducing national debt instead.

It's worth mentioning that at this point, the President had not been clued into what Nvidia even was. Since then, the ground has shifted. The U.S. and China are in a race to build out homegrown advanced manufacturing capabilities, with giants like TSMC pledging $165 billion, and Micron pledging $200 billion to build fabs on American soil.

Amidst all of this, there is a complex web of political maneuvering, an impending threat of tariffs, and the explosive growth of purpose-built AI data centres. Now, the U.S. government is pondering the question: What if the funds put aside for the CHIPS Act became investments in businesses to bolster American manufacturing of leading-edge nodes, instead?

Could Intel become the canary in the coal mine?

(Image credit: Intel)

Between all of these factors lies Intel. The once-proud 'Team Blue' is lagging behind competitors and bleeding funds. The company's 20A node was cancelled entirely, with the business shifting its focus to the newer 18A and 14A nodes, provided it can sustain its production by attracting larger customers.

As a shot in the arm for Intel, it was granted $7.86 billion and up to $11 billion in loans under the CHIPS Act. But with the U.S. government now officially interested in a $10 billion stake in the company, it could potentially signal a new methodology for the use of funds intended for grants.

What if, instead of granting funds, the U.S. Government purchased equity in the businesses that have been granted funding? That's something that U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is looking to do. In an interview with CNBC, he said: "We need to make our own chips here. We cannot rely on Taiwan, which is 9,500 miles away from us and only 80 miles from China. So you can’t have 99% of leading-edge chips made in Taiwan. We want to make them here."

When questioning the feasibility of what CHIPS Act funds could materially do for U.S. taxpayers, he said: "...we should get an equity stake for our money. So we’ll deliver the money – which was already committed under the Biden administration – we’ll get equity in return for it, get a good return for the American taxpayer instead of just giving grants away."

Within the context of Intel, this all makes sense, but when looking at a list of CHIPS Act beneficiaries, the situation becomes more complex.

The U.S and potential equity investments

(Image credit: Samsung)

The list of awards from the CHIPS and Science Act is wide-ranging, covering smaller manufacturers of RF electronics, to funding titans like Intel, TSMC's Fab 21, Micron's 'megafab', Samsung's Taylor, Texas facility, Texas Instruments' fabs in Utah and Texas, and GlobalFoundries' manufacturing sites in New York and Vermont.

It won't be feasible for the U.S. to purchase equity in them all, nor would the owners of the businesses allow it. Take Samsung, which accounts for a significant portion of the entire South Korean GDP — its owners would not be rushing to give away a stake in the business for the sake of U.S. investment. And, even if it were, entities like the South Korean government would become closely involved in the process, convoluting the negotiations.

But the window is open, especially for private companies which might require a much-needed injection of cash. But, it would come at a great cost: It's unclear what partial state-ownership might look like, and for Intel, it might make some sort of sense, as the U.S. government might be able to assist in attracting large foundry customers.

TSMC is another private business that is partially owned by multiple states. The contested territory of Taiwan lays claim to a minority share of the company, and so does the Singaporean wealth fund. So, multiple states owning portions of large businesses isn't unheard of in the semiconductor industry. But when it comes to direct U.S. investment, shareholders will need to be informed ahead of inking any kind of deal.

Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-Huei said (via Reuters): "We will also discuss with the National Development Council, as it is a shareholder of TSMC. We will thoroughly understand the underlying meaning of the U.S. Commerce Secretary's remarks, but this will require some time for discussion and assessment".

Regardless of how things shake out for the Trump Administration's efforts in seemingly tuning CHIPS Act funds into private equity or partial ownership, it will be a significant uphill challenge, especially considering the number of complexities with the businesses potentially involved.

A genuine strategy, or is it all just American saber-rattling?

The White House's strategy for utilizing CHIPS Act funds might be becoming clear. While Lutnick and others within the U.S. government might be seeking to push this initiative, it could also merely be the U.S. attempting to gain ground over China as a dominant power within the semiconductor industry. As for whether or not these designs will prove to come to fruition, or indeed even be effective, remains to be seen.

Export controls already prevent selling high-powered AI chips to China (though B30A is reportedly in the works), and the next on America's hit list may be to nurture its homegrown semiconductor efforts through the use of wanton equity investments, almost behaving like a VC firm, rather than a government.

This chatter about partially state-owned companies might draw parallels to China, which is currently grappling with challenges regarding homegrown semiconductors. (especially as the country does not have access to ASML's patented EUV lithography tools legally).

But, regardless of how things shake out, it highlights several issues for both the U.S. and China. Neither can currently produce leading-edge nodes on the same level as Taiwan's TSMC, and lessening the reliance on semiconductors made on foreign shores is a clear goal for both countries.

[TITLE]Lutnick: Intel Will Give Government Equity Stake in Exchange for CHIPS Act Funds:
[TEXT]
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Tuesday that Intel must provide the U.S. government with an equity stake in the company in return for receiving funds from the CHIPS Act. Lutnick’s comments during a CNBC interview shed more light on how the Trump Administration may take an ownership position in Intel, saying, “We should get an equity stake for our money.”

CNBC reports that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated in an interview this week that Intel must give the U.S. government an equity stake in the company in exchange for receiving funds from the CHIPS Act. The announcement came during Lutnick’s appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street on Tuesday.

“We should get an equity stake for our money,” Lutnick said, emphasizing the government’s position on the matter. “So we’ll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We’ll get equity in return for it.”

Lutnick clarified that this arrangement would not come with governance rights in the company. Lutnick explained, “It’s not governance, we’re just converting what was a grant under Biden into equity for the Trump administration, for the American people. Nonvoting.”

The CHIPS Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022, aims to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry and reduce the country’s reliance on foreign chipmakers. In practice, it has failed to spur growth at Intel, which has undergone massive layoffs despite the funding.

Intel, along with other major U.S. chipmakers, has been actively seeking government support to expand its domestic manufacturing capabilities. The company has previously announced plans to invest heavily in new chip fabrication facilities in the United States, including a $20 billion investment in two new factories in Arizona. Despite these grand plans, Intel delayed groundbreaking on its “Silicon Heartland” in Ohio.

The move to require equity stakes in exchange for CHIPS Act funds aligns with President Donald Trump’s call for more reshoring of U.S. manufacturing. The Trump administration has been vocal about the need to reduce the country’s dependence on foreign suppliers, particularly in critical industries such as semiconductors.

Intel, along with other U.S. chipmakers like Micron Technology and Texas Instruments, stands to benefit significantly from the CHIPS Act funds. However, the requirement to provide equity stakes to the government in return for the financial support adds a new dimension to the ongoing discussions surrounding the industry’s future.

"We should get an equity stake for our money," he added. "We'll get equity in return for that... instead of just giving grants away."

The potential deal, which was first reported last week, aims to help Intel build a flagship manufacturing hub in the US state of Ohio. At the time, a White House spokesman told the BBC that the reports "should be regarded as speculation" unless officially announced.

[TITLE]Spark trading at ‘deep discount’ - analyst:
[TEXT]
“The need to ‘focus on core, shed the rest’ has been codified in the new five-year strategy, one that is eerily similar to that of a major Australian telco.” (This year has seen Telstra offload its cloud services business to Infosys and sell its share in Foxtel to DAZN).

Jarden’s Arie Dekker and Grant Lowe maintained their overweight rating but reduced their 12-month target from $2.90 to $2.82

The noted Spark had sent signals it would also exit another non-core asset, digital identity business MATTR. While full details of the new five-year strategy wouldn’t be revealed until the September 11 investor day, they saw the refocus on core business as a potential catalyst for a re-rating.

Forsyth Barr downgraded Spark to neutral, with analyst Aaron Ibbotson calling it a “slightly weaker than expected result”.

1300 staff gone

Its layoffs had been reported in dribs and drabs, but Spark’s full-year result revealed the scale of the telco’s restructure: around 1300 full-time staff were eliminated, taking its total workforce down to 4043.

The restructure included outsourcing deals with Indian giant Infosys and networking partner Nokia (which also maintains operations in India), plus efficiency gains through new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI).

Are staff now through the worst of it, or are further headcount reductions to come?

“It’s something we never take lightly, but we have to adapt to the environment around us,” chief executive Jolie Hodson told the Herald soon after the result was released.

“An operating model change in 2025 led to a significant increase in the number of people that left our business,” Hodson said.

“We do operate in an industry that is constantly changing. So I can’t say that there’ll never be further change, but of the size that we saw in FY25, that is unlikely.”

Despite the accelerated cuts in the second half, helping Spark save a full-year $85m against a target of $80m to $100m - Craigs Investment Partners analyst Mo Singh said, “Labour and operating cost savings not quite at the level we had assumed, although Spark continues to forecast further gains in FY2026.”

“It appears more cost-out benefit is still to come, and arguably Spark was slower to move on this than it should have been,” Singh told the Herald.

“It’s now playing some catch-up. They say they are on track to deliver annualised savings of $110m-$140m by the end of FY2027.”

Green shoots?

“The past year has been one of the most challenging periods in Spark’s history, as we navigated economic headwinds, materially lower customer spending, and ongoing structural change in some of our markets,” chairwoman Justine Smyth said in Spark’s results filing.

Is Hodson seeing any improvement in FY2026, which got under way on August 1?

“It’s still a pretty tough economy,” she said.

“I know OCR is out today and that might lead to some further reduction [there was a 25 basis point cut]. We are seeing a couple of small green shoots within that, but ... I think it’s still a pretty interesting time ahead as we go into this next year."

Craigs’ Singh, who saw the result as being in line with expectations and maintained his “overweight” rating, said yesterday’s OCR cut “Might not move the dial for government demand - which has stabilised - but should be supportive for enterprise and small-to-medium businesses, as well as the usual consumer benefit.”

Craigs’ Singh noted that on a conference call yesterday, Hodson had said that Spark had increased consumer and small business mobile plans by $2 to $5 a month. In the first three weeks at least, there had been low churn (customer losses).

Singh said it was good consumers and small businesses could apparently absorb a price increase, “Because given our falling migration numbers, there aren’t actually a heap more consumers to sell plans to.”

Why sell the fast-growing data centres?

Data centres were one of the few bright points of Spark’s full-year result as revenue from the segment grew 11.1% to $50 million.

Why did it recently announce a deal to offload the top-performer, or at least a 75% stake in the data centre division?

“It’s really important to have that business well-funded. We’ve got a significant pipeline of growth in the next five to seven years.”

The telco earlier laid out plans to spend up to $1 billion on expanding the capacity of its data centre business from 23 megawatts today to 130MW, which would put it toe-to-toe with the Big Tech contenders.

“What we get here is we realise some value now,” Hodson said.

“We also get to participate in that longer-term value, and our DC [data centre] business is funded to grow, which is a really important opportunity for us.”

Profit hit

Spark yesterday reported another big fall in profit, with reported net profit down 17.7% to $260 million – or a 33.6% fall to $227m, adjusting for one-offs and a “$26m impact of the government change to tax depreciation rules” on commercial buildings.

Shares closed up 3.2% to $2.56.

The profit crunch was within revised-down guidance and close to analysts’ consensus expectations.

And the telco predicted a more stable FY2026 after its recent accelerated cost-cutting – which hit $85m in the second half – and asset sales.

FY2026 dividend will be lower

The full-year dividend was 25 cents per share – in line with revised-down guidance (from the original 27.5cps) and ahead of the analyst consensus 24cps.

Spark said 100% of FY2026 free cash flow (a forecast $290-$330m) would be paid out in its dividend, which a Spark spokeswoman said translated to 15 to 17cps. Singh said that was close to the market expectation of 15 to 18cps.

New five-year plan

The telco also revealed a new five-year strategy, dubbed “SPK-30″, which it said would deliver a “capital management reset that refocuses Spark on its core connectivity business”.

SPK-30 was outlined in very broad strokes yesterday.

“The strategy includes four key focus areas – growing core connectivity, simplifying and optimising beyond the core, and delivering a better network and better customer experiences," the telco said in an NZX filing.

“These priorities are enabled by a focus on people and culture, embedding technologies such as AI across Spark, disciplined financial management, and an enduring commitment to sustainability.”

Singh said it was “fairly high level”. Hodson said details would be provided at an investor day scheduled for September 11.

She said “connectivity”, including mobile, cloud and IT and data centres, contributed 70% of Spark’s FY2025 revnue and 80% of the telco’s gross margin.

Still not at the heart of the Mattr

Spark also said a “process has commenced to introduce new investors” to Mattr, its digital identity spinout that recently won a key contract for a new digital wallet and ID system that people will use to interact with government departments.

On the conference call, Jarden’s Arie Dekker pressed (again) for more details on Mattr, including the size of Spark’s investment. None were forthcoming.

In-line operating earnings, flat guidance

Reported ebitdai was $1.053b, just a whisker shy of the analyst consensus of $1.054b.

FY2026 guidance was for operating earnings of $1.02-$1.08b or $1.01-$1.07b excluding its now spun-out data centre business.

Revenue fell 2.5% to $3.75b.

Total capital expenditure fell 17.2% to $429m. Spark said “business as usual” capex would fall to $380-$420m in FY2026 – excluding $50-$70m in “strategic capex” for data centre expansion, which will now be shared with a new majority owner.

Mobile down sharply in Govt, corporate

Mobile service revenue declined 2.3% to $987m, “driven by price competition in enterprise and Government and consumer prepaid,” Spark said in an NZX filing. Small business and consumer numbers grew in the second half, the telco said.

Mobile revenue from consumer and small-to-medium business customers was down 0.9% from $869m to $861m for the full year.

On a conference call, CEO Jolie Hodson said the telco was three weeks into $2 to $5 per month increases for the segment with “low churn”.

Mobile market share by revenue, FY2025 vs FY2024. Source/ IDC data in Spark's investor presentation

At the top end of town, there was continued pain, with mobile revenue from enterprise and Government falling 17% from $120m to $100m.

Spark said total FY2025 mobile market growth was 1.2%, which it said was lower than market researcher IDC’s 3% pick. One bright spot: Growth picked up to 1.9% in the second half.

Craigs’ Singh noted that while Spark remained over 40% in market share, it had fallen 0.4% “with 2degrees and others picking it up.”

In an investor presentation, Spark said consumer growth in FY2026 would be supported by the aforementioned $2 to $5 price increases from August 1, a new Kids Plan and a new satellite-to-mobile service scheduled to launch in the New Year - which industry insiders widely assume will be a Starlink partnership; Spark won’t comment.

In enterprise and Government, Spark said its decline stabilised in the second half of FY2025 and that around 7000 new mobile customers would be added in the first quarter of FY2026 from Summerset, Deloitte and the NZ Red Cross.

Continued weakness in IT services

IT services revenue continued to be a pain point, falling 7.7% to $144m.

Broadband revenue fell 0.8% to $608m.

Cloud revenue grew 4.4% to $235m “as public cloud uptake continued to increase”.

Data centre growth, sale

Data centres revenue grew 11.1% to $50m.

On August 12, Spark said it had sold 75% of its data centre operations to Australian Pacific Equity Partners in a deal that values the business at $705m.

The telco will get $486m cash, with a further $98m – for a total $584m – in FY2027 if performance targets are hit.

The proceeds will go to paying debt, the company said in an NZX filing. Spark had net debt of $2.74b as of December 31, 2024 and $2.13b as of June 30, 2025.

[TITLE]National suicide hotline for LGBTQ+ youth went dead. Colorado and other states are scrambling to help.:
[TEXT]
By Annie Sciacca, KFF Health News

On July 17, the option went dead for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.

Now, states such as Colorado, California, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees, and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group.

In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.

[TITLE]AI boom in Australia: Amazon investment sparks debate on artificial intelligence and housing shortage – Jason Murphy:

But what do we actually get for the money? Just data centres.

If I was making a list of things Australia should be doing with concrete and air-conditioning, it would not include making data centres. What we need desperately, what we are horribly short of, is homes.

House prices are zooming up, and not just from speculation.

We’ve had huge inflation in the cost of building. Building a house from scratch costs around A$500,000, depending on its size and location. Maybe as much as a million bucks. And the inflation data tell us that price is up 39% compared with 2020.
