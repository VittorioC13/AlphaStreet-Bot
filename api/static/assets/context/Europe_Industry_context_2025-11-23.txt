[TITLE]CRML Secures One of the Largest Strategic Stockpiles of Ultra-High-Purity Copper Powder in a US$20M All-Share Acquisition Issued at a 40% Premium to Market:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Critical Metals Corp. (Nasdaq: CRML) (“Critical Metals Corp” or the “Company”), a leading critical minerals mining company, today announced that it has acquired & secured one of the largest strategic stockpiles of ultra-high-purity critical copper powder for a consideration of US$20M at US$10 per share, in an all-share transaction acquisition strengthening CRML’s position as a key supplier to advanced defense, aerospace, and technology markets.

This transaction not only strengthens our western value chain, but also supplies our allied militaries immediately

An all-share transaction with a long-only multi-generational European based single family office Swiss Commodity RE.

The agreement provides CRML with exclusive access to one of the largest known G7 & EU-origin secured stockpiles of a fully compliant, highly sought after, traceable supply chain and ultra-high-purity (UHP) copper powder, a material so essential to many of the same advanced military applications both classified and unclassified technologies that rely on critical metals and rare earth elements. The all-share transaction (completed at a 40% premium to yesterday’s closing price) is strategic to support CRML’s broader critical-materials platform.

Supply of UHP copper powder has historically been dominated by Russia and China. This acquisition secures a G7/EU-origin, fully traceable resource at scale—supporting Western industrial resilience and giving CRML’s customers dependable access to a material central to innovation across defense and advanced manufacturing.

By integrating this asset, CRML enhances its ability to support customer R&D and production for complex systems, while continuing to advance Tanbreez and its rare earth business as planned.

Tony Sage, Chairman of CRML, commented:

“Ultra-high-purity copper powder is a core input across the advanced defense, aerospace, energy, and semiconductor technologies that also depend heavily on rare earth elements. Securing this Western traceable stockpile strengthens CRML’s role as a key partner to these industries and enhances the strategic relevance of our broader portfolio, including Tanbreez.

“This acquisition immediately expands our Department of War (“DoW”) and North American Treaty Organization (“NATO”) supply capabilities, deepens customer engagement, and supports the development of our critical metals projects through a new non-dilutive and highly commercial opportunity, that benefits our shareholders.”

Details

The Company will issue 2 million Ordinary shares at $US10 per share for 40 kilograms of the UHP 99.96% pure copper powder. This highly sought after material sells for between $US1,500 to $US2,500 per gram. A high-performance material for high-performance industries.

The acquired material is a highly specialized, non-exchange-listed UHP copper powder used only in applications where precision and reliability are paramount. Global demand is accelerating, with analysts projecting 7–8% annual growth driven by:

Defense & Aerospace: high-density electronics, satellites, guidance systems

high-density electronics, satellites, guidance systems Advanced Energy: solid-state batteries, power electronics

solid-state batteries, power electronics High Technology: semiconductor fabrication, supercomputing, additive manufacturing

In many of these applications, ultra-pure copper and rare earth elements sit side-by-side within the same high-value components, making the copper powder stockpile a natural strategic fit within CRML’s critical-metals portfolio.

[TITLE]Plug Power Nets $399 Million in Cash Following Successful Financing; Eliminates First Lien and Fully Funds Current Business Plan:
[TEXT]
SLINGERLANDS, N.Y., Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the hydrogen economy, today announced the successful closing of the previously announced offering of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% convertible notes due 2033, including the full exercise of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase an additional $56.25 million aggregate principal amount of the notes, resulting in a total aggregate principal amount of $431.25 million. Plug received total net proceeds from the offering of approximately $399.4 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses.

The proceeds allow Plug to retire all remaining high-cost 15% debt, refinance its 2026 convertible notes, and eliminate the first lien previously held by its former debt provider. These actions significantly reduce interest expense, simplify Plug’s capital structure, and enhance financial flexibility.

Importantly, the refinancing also extends Plug’s lower cost of capital through an eight-year tenor balloon note, providing stable, long-duration financing with no required amortization over that period. This structure preserves liquidity and eliminates near-term principal repayment pressure.

Together with Plug’s recently announced data center infrastructure agreement, the company now has a fully funded business plan based on its current operating expectations.

“This financing marks a major turning point for Plug,” said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power. “With $399 million in new cash, the removal of the first lien, and reduced interest costs, Plug now has one of the strongest balance sheets in years. Extending our lower cost of capital over an eight-year tenor further enhances our flexibility. We are well positioned to support sales growth in both material handling and electrolyzers as customer demand accelerates.”

Plug already has the manufacturing capacity required to meet its growth trajectory. The strengthened balance sheet provides the stability and flexibility needed to support commercial momentum across material handling fleets, distribution centers, and utility-scale electrolyzer deployments.

[TITLE]Plug Power Announces Special Meeting of Stockholders and Filing of Preliminary Proxy Statement:
[TEXT]
SLINGERLANDS, N.Y., Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG) (the “Company” or “Plug”), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the hydrogen economy, will hold a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) on January 15, 2026, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The meeting will be conducted in a virtual format only.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the upcoming Special Meeting, Plug will ask stockholders to approve an amendment to the Company’s charter to increase the authorized common stock from 1.5 billion to 3.0 billion shares. Plug currently has less than 0.4% of its authorized shares of common stock available for future issuance. The proposed increase, made in consultation with Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), was based on a sizing analysis that considered projected capital requirements, upcoming contractual commitments, equity programs, and potential strategic transactions, ensuring flexibility without excess.

Plug’s stockholders will also be asked to approve an amendment to the Company’s charter to conform the Company’s charter to recent amendments in the Delaware statute. This amendment would allow a more achievable voting standard for, among other things, future amendments to increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of common stock and align the voting standard with other Delaware companies.

The Company filed a preliminary proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 20, 2025. For additional information regarding these proposals, investors are urged to read the Company’s preliminary proxy statement.

Plug’s Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR each of these proposals as these are in the Company’s best interest.

Recent Business Progress and Operational Momentum

Plug continues to make meaningful progress across its business, reinforcing the Company’s position as a global leader in integrated hydrogen solutions:

Record Hydrogen Production. Plug’s Georgia plant delivered its best month on record in August 2025, producing 324 metric tons of hydrogen with 97% uptime and 99.7% availability, demonstrating strong performance of Plug’s end-to-end production technology.

Expanding Electrolyzer Deployments. Plug is advancing a multi-gigawatt electrolyzer development pipeline, with 8 GW+ of identified opportunities across Europe, Australia, the Middle East and North America, reflecting rising global demand for clean hydrogen.

Continued Expansion in Material-Handling Fuel Cells. Plug recently commissioned next-generation GenDrive fuel-cell systems for major logistics operators, including new deployments at Floor & Decor’s Frederickson distribution facility, reinforcing Plug’s leadership in large-scale material-handling fleets.

Strengthened Customer Ecosystem. Plug’s annual symposium convened industry partners including Amazon, Uline, Hy2Gen, and key energy developers, highlighting broad commercial support for Plug’s integrated hydrogen solutions.

Advancing Energy Transition Infrastructure. Plug is expanding hydrogen storage, delivery and fueling capabilities to support emerging industrial and data center demand, positioning the Company as a full-value-chain provider for the clean hydrogen economy.

“These proposals are essential to ensuring Plug has the resources and flexibility needed to execute on our strategy, meet contractual obligations, reward talent, and advance the hydrogen economy,” said Andy Marsh, Chief Executive Officer of Plug. “We are encouraged by the progress we’re making across production, electrolyzers, and commercial adoption, and we remain focused on driving disciplined growth and creating sustainable value for our stockholders.”

Protect Your Investment

The record date for the upcoming Special Meeting is December 4, 2025. It is important that our stockholders have the ability to vote all of their shares at the upcoming meeting. Stockholders who have pledge or loaned their shares may not be able to vote unless those shares are recalled and returned to their accounts in advance of the record date.

There is significant short interest in Plug; therefore, it is possible stockholders are not even aware that their shares had been loaned by their bank, broker or nominee. Stockholders whose shares have been lent out should instruct their bank, broker or nominee to recall their shares as soon as possible to ensure they are returned in time to be counted as of the December 4, 2025 record date.

Meeting Details

The Special Meeting is scheduled to be held on January 15, 2026 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/PLUG2026SM.

[TEXT]
Not for distribution to U.S. newswire services or dissemination in the United States

TORONTO, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Galantas Gold Corporation (TSX-V & AIM: GAL; OTCQB: GALKF) (“Galantas” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that, as a result of strong investor demand, the Company has agreed with Canaccord Genuity Corp. and Haywood Securities Inc. (together, the “Agents”) to increase the size of its previously announced “best efforts” private placement of units of the Company (each, a “Unit”) to raise aggregate gross proceeds of up to C$13.5 million (the “Offering”), consisting of 168,750,000 Units at a price of C$0.08 per Unit (the “Offering Price”). The size of the over-allotment option (the “Agents’ Option”) granted to the Agents will be upsized to permit the Agents to raise up to an additional C$2,025,000 through sales of up to 25,312,500 additional Units at the Offering Price.

Each Unit will be comprised of one common share of the Company (each, a “Common Share”) and one Common Share purchase warrant (each, a “Warrant”). Each Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to acquire one Common Share at a price of C$0.12 for a period of 36 months from the closing of the Offering.

As compensation for their services, the Company will pay to the Agents a cash commission equal to 7.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds of the Offering (including gross proceeds from the Agents’ Option, if any), subject to reduction to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of up to C$1,100,000 (increased from C$500,000 as previously announced) from purchasers on the president’s list to be agreed between the Company and Canaccord Genuity Corp. (the “President’s List”), and the Company will issue to the Agents compensation warrants (“Compensation Warrants”) in an amount equal to 7.0% of the Units sold in the Offering (including Units sold pursuant to the Agents’ Option, if any), subject to reduction to 3.0% for purchasers on the President’s List. Each Compensation Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to acquire one Common Share for the Offering Price for a period of 24 months from the closing date of the Offering.

Units sold under the Offering may be offered to purchasers resident in the provinces and territories of Canada pursuant to applicable prospectus exemptions and in accordance with applicable laws. Units may also be offered for sale in the United States pursuant to available exemptions from the registration requirements of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), and in those other jurisdictions outside of Canada and the United States, provided it is understood that no prospectus filing or comparable obligation arises in such other jurisdiction. Any securities issued under Offering will be subject to a hold period in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, expiring four months and one day following the issue date of the Units.

The net proceeds from the Offering will be used to fund exploration work on the Indiana Project (as defined below), to fund Option Payments (as defined below) in respect of the Indiana Project, and for general corporate and working capital purposes.

There is no minimum amount of Units that must be sold in the Offering as a condition to its completion. Completion of the Offering is expected to occur on or around December 10, 2025, and is subject to obtaining the required approvals of the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”) and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Any subscriber that becomes an insider of the Company will file a personal information form with the TSXV for their review and approval. The Warrants will restrict any holder from exercising any Warrants that would result in any holder owning or controlling 20% or more of the then issued and outstanding Common Shares (calculated on a partially diluted basis).

The securities to be offered in the Offering have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the applicable securities laws of any state of the United States, and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Rule 902(k) of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) or persons in the United States absent registration or any applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. No securities regulatory authority has either approved or disapproved of the contents of this news release. This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in the United States, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

Update on Acquisition of RDL Mining

The Company’s planned acquisition (the “Transaction”) of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of RDL Mining Corp. (“RDL”) in exchange for Common Shares, pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated November 13, 2025, among Lawrence Roulston, Robert Sedgemore, Dorian L. (Dusty) Nicol (collectively, the “RDL Shareholders”) and Galantas, continues to progress toward closing. The Company wishes to provide certain additional information in respect of the Transaction.

As consideration under the Transaction, each RDL Shareholder will receive approximately 44 million Common Shares, for an aggregate of approximately 132 million Common Shares (collectively, the “Consideration Shares”), which represents 49.99% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares following the issue of the Consideration Shares, before taking into account Common Shares issued under the Offering. None of the RDL Shareholders are participating in the Offering. If the maximum amount is raised under the Offering, each RDL Shareholder will hold approximately 10.2% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares.

[TITLE]China Races to Reassert Influence in Central Asia After U.S. Summit:
[TEXT]
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is in Kyrgyzstan as part of a three-country tour of Central Asia to reaffirm Beijing’s status as the region’s top trading partner following US diplomatic inroads at a high-profile summit in Washington earlier this month.

US President Donald Trump hosted the five Central Asian presidents at the White House in early November for a summit focused on tapping into the region’s abundant and strategic critical mineral wealth.

While not in the spotlight, China’s growing economic and political influence in Central Asia was in mind amid the Trump administration’s move to deepen ties to the region.

During the meeting, Washington signed tens of billions of dollars in prospective deals. That included Kazakhstan inking a $1.1 billion tungsten mining deal with the US company Cove Kaz Capital. Pini Althaus, the firm’s CEO, said afterwards that Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick helped negotiate the deal to prevent Chinese companies from developing the strategic deposit themselves.

Wang’s visit to Kyrgyzstan is his first in three years and his tour of the region will last until November 22 with additional stops in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

He landed in Bishkek on November 19 and met with Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, who praised Chinese leader Xi Jinping and said that his country’s relations with Beijing are currently at a historic high, according to a readout provided by the Kyrgyz president’s office.

Before departing Beijing, China’s Foreign Ministry said that Wang’s visit will be focused on deepening the country’s already steady ties with the region by injecting momentum into the slew of agreements worth billions of dollars signed at the China-Central Asia summit in June in Kazakhstan.

“[This visit] will enhance political mutual trust and traditional friendship, deepen high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and bring

For Japanese office furniture and supplies company Kokuyo , its biggest surprise in India has been the rapid pace of construction-something it rarely sees elsewhere."Office construction here is superfast. Customers complete full offices in 75-90 days. The schedule is tight, landlords are demanding, and everything moves at once," the company's global managing officer Masahiro Fukui told ET, adding that post pandemic, there has been a surge of overseas investment in India, which is becoming the most important market for nearly every industry.India is Kokuyo's No.1 priority market as multinationals, including several from its home country, double down on workplace investments in the subcontinent, Fukui said.The pace of change in India's corporate real-estate landscape has accelerated dramatically since the pandemic. As a result, top global executives from Kokuyo's global office-furniture business now visit India almost every quarter, up from an annual trip just a year ago.While Kokuyo benefits from multinational relationships built elsewhere, Japanese companies expanding into India often already know the brand but global accounts form a relatively small share of overall India business.As global companies race to attract talent, Kokuyo sees India entering a phase where workplace quality is no longer an optional investment."Everyone wants the same talent," the executive said. "To win them, companies are pushing for better workplaces. That's why demand in India is exploding."More than a decade ago, Kokuyo acquired a 51% stake in stationary maker Camlin, and earlier this year, bought a controlling stake in HNI India."The country is home to cost-sensitive domestic clients on one end, and global multinationals like Google Microsoft and others, who demand the same premium standards they follow in the US, Europe or Japan," he said.The company said its global strategy is now to allocate capital to growth markets, with India at the forefront, as well as leverage group-wide strengths, including design, patented technology and global supply chains. However, unlike many global companies, which dictate strategy to other markets including India, Kokuyo said it will rely on local leadership."We want partners, not a parent telling the team 'do this or do that'. They know the market better than us," Fukui said.India's corporate culture is also evolving. For instance, traditional hierarchies reflecting on oversized 'boss chairs' have blurred as companies move toward ergonomic parity across employee levels. "There are still pockets where the boss needs his big chair, but overall, the shift is happening," he said.The company's largest category in India remains workstation systems , but seating, a segment that barely existed seven years ago, is now nearly a third of its business.

[TITLE]JP Morgan is pouring $1.5T into 4 industries that are ‘critical’ for the U.S. economy. How to get in on the action:
[TEXT]

Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.

JPMorgan Chase announced a sudden increase in investments in critical U.S. industries, such as energy and defense, noting the firm will increase its previous 10-year $1 trillion commitment by 50%, to $1.5 trillion.

This initiative will begin with a $10 billion investment primarily into select American companies to help enhance growth, spur innovation and accelerate strategic manufacturing.

Must Read

“It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing — all of which are essential for our national security,” Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorganChase, said in a statement (1).

“Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America’s economy. America needs more speed and investment. It also needs to remove obstacles that stand in the way: excessive regulations, bureaucratic delay, partisan gridlock and an education system not aligned to the skills we need.”

The four key industries the company plans to focus on include supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience, and frontier and strategic technologies.

Following the Trump administration’s lead

On Oct. 10, after Beijing announced extensive new export control rules on rare earth minerals and other technologies, the Trump administration retaliated with an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. President Donald Trump also cancelled his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

In October alone, the U.S. imported 5,473 metric tons of rare earth minerals from China, according to data from the General Administration of Customs (2).

As a way to reduce U.S. dependence on China, the Trump administration has begun investing in these critical mineral industries, and the Pentagon plans to procure up to $1 billion worth of critical minerals as part of a global stockpiling spree, according to a Financial Times report (3).

“China’s ability to turn off the supply of these critical minerals would have a direct, palpable and adverse effect on U.S. ability to field the kind of high-tech capabilities that we’re going to need for any kind of strategic competition or conflict,” Stephanie Barna, a lawyer at Covington & Burling, told the Financial Times.
