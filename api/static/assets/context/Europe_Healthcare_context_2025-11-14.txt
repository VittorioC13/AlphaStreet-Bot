New analysis of etripamil clinical data presented at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2025 on November 10. Results from more than 600 unique enrolled patients showed aligned efficacy and safety of etripamil across multiple study phases, types of trial design, and geographic regions, with etripamil treatment achieving consistently greater conversion rates for symptomatic PSVT episodes compared with placebo arms.

Results from more than 600 unique enrolled patients showed aligned efficacy and safety of etripamil across multiple study phases, types of trial design, and geographic regions, with etripamil treatment achieving consistently greater conversion rates for symptomatic PSVT episodes compared with placebo arms. Recent presentations and peer-reviewed publications highlight the growing body of data supporting etripamil nasal spray as a potential rapid, self-administered treatment for PSVT and AFib-RVR. Importantly, etripamil was referenced in recent AHA ACLS Guidelines noting the potential of intranasal calcium channel blockers for future treatment algorithms. Separately, NODE-303 long-term safety data were published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology.

E tripamil for patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AFib-RVR)

Phase 3 protocol of etripamil in AFib-RVR (ReVeRA-301) finalized. Milestone is poised to enter a pivotal Phase 3 program in AFib-RVR, on the strength of the successful ReVeRA Phase 2 trial. The Company intends to follow the supplemental NDA regulatory approval pathway, discussed with the FDA, and expects to leverage data from the PSVT NDA along with the results from the planned single AFib-RVR Phase 3 study for what would potentially be a second indication for etripamil. The ReVeRA-301 study design for etripamil in AFib-RVR was presented at HRX 2025.

Third Quarter and Recent Corporate Updates

Milestone well-financed for potential CARDAMYST launch from recent public equity offering and amended Royalty Purchase Agreement (RPA). The Company completed an underwritten public offering providing immediate net proceeds of approximately $48.7 million and amended RPA in July 2025. The proceeds from the offering and RPA are expected to fund the continued development and commercial launch of CARDAMYST in its lead indication of PSVT, following potential FDA approval around the PDUFA date of December 13th.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results

As of September 30, 2025, Milestone had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $82.6 million, compared to $69.7 million as of December 31, 2024.

No revenue was reported in the third quarter ended September 30, 2025 or for the third quarter of 2024.

Research and development expense for the third quarter of 2025 was $3.9 million, compared with $4.0 million for the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, research and development expense was $12.6 million compared with $10.4 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher consulting and outside service costs that were partially offset by lower personnel-related costs.

General and administrative expense for the third quarter of 2025 was $3.3 million, compared with $3.7 million for the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, general and administrative expense was $12.2 million, compared with the $12.7 million for the prior year period. The decrease between the quarters is primarily due to a decrease in professional fees and personnel costs.

Commercial expense for the third quarter of 2025 was $4.6 million, compared with $1.9 million for the prior year period. For the nine months ending September 30, 2025, commercial expense was $20.1 million compared with $6.6 million for the prior year period. These increases are a result of additional personnel costs, professional costs and other operational expenses related to preparation for the launch of CARDAMYST. With the resolution of the Complete Response Letter (CRL) we are now ramping operational expenditures in order to launch quickly following the potential approval of CARDAMYST by the FDA.

For the third quarter of 2025, net loss was $11.9 million, compared to $9.4 million for the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Milestone's net loss was $45.6 million, compared to $29.2 million in the prior year period.

Business Update

Hydronidone New Drug Application (NDA) progressing in China, with Priority Review discussions ongoing and targeted submission following completion of regulatory interactions.

Completed patient enrollment in the 52-week Phase 3 pirfenidone pneumoconiosis (PD) trial (272 patients, 18 sites).

Plan to initiate an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial of pirfenidone in oncology-related pulmonary complications (RILI/immune-related pneumonitis) in Q4 2025.

U.S. MASH IND anticipated timeline adjusted to 2026 to allow for (i) the incorporation of the complete Phase 2 and 3 CHB-associated liver fibrosis clinical data from China; and (ii) planning and expected initiation of a hepatic impairment study under the existing U.S. IND to further inform safety, dose optimization, and regulatory discussions.

SAN DIEGO, Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gyre Therapeutics (“Gyre”) (Nasdaq: GYRE), an innovative, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to advancing fibrosis-first therapies across organ systems affected by chronic disease, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025 and provided a business update.

“Following the positive results from our pivotal Phase 3 trial in the PRC evaluating Hydronidone for the treatment of CHB-associated liver fibrosis, we are working diligently toward our NDA submission and are leveraging Hydronidone’s Breakthrough Therapy designation to bring this much-needed therapy to patients in China,” said Ping Zhang, Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Gyre Therapeutics. “With enrollment now completed in our 52-week Phase 3 trial of pirfenidone for the treatment of pneumoconiosis, we continue to advance our pipeline in China. We are also preparing for U.S. clinical activities and expect to file the U.S. IND for Hydronidone for the treatment of MASH-associated liver fibrosis in 2026, supported by the translation and regulatory-quality review of our China Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial data and an upcoming hepatic impairment study.”

Third Quarter Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones

Commercial Portfolio

ETUARY® (pirfenidone): Generated $27.7 million in sales of ETUARY® for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared to $25.3 million for the same period in 2024.

Etorel® (nintedanib ethanesulfonate soft capsules): Generated $1.5 million in sales of Etorel® for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, the first full quarter of launch.

Contiva® (avatrombopag maleate tablets): Generated $1.2 million in sales of Contiva® for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Pipeline Development Updates

Hydronidone:

New Drug Application (NDA) in China:

Building on the positive Phase 3 trial results, Gyre Pharmaceuticals is actively engaging with China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to confirm Priority Review eligibility for Hydronidone’s New Drug Application (NDA).

The Company remains on track to advance regulatory filing activities and intends to proceed with the NDA submission for Hydronidone in China upon completion of ongoing regulatory interactions and resolution of any outstanding requirements.

Hydronidone U.S. IND Timing Update:

The anticipated timeline for submitting the U.S. IND for Hydronidone for the treatment of MASH-associated liver fibrosis has been adjusted due to the delayed availability of the full Phase 3 trial data set from the completed trial of Hydronidone for the treatment of CHB-associated liver fibrosis in China. The Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial data form the core clinical safety package supporting the U.S. program, and the translation and regulatory-quality review of the Clinical Study Reports are currently in progress.

In parallel, Gyre plans to conduct a hepatic impairment study in U.S. subjects under its active U.S. IND. In light of the shifting market dynamics in the MASH landscape, this study is expected to help determine dose selection and appropriate enrollment criteria in populations with reduced hepatic function, thereby supporting a more robust Phase 2 development strategy.

With these activities underway, Gyre expects to file the U.S. IND for Hydronidone for the treatment of MASH-associated liver fibrosis in 2026, and, subject to U.S. IND clearance, initiate a Phase 2 trial.

Pirfenidone Development and Indication Expansion:

In the third quarter of 2025, Gyre Pharmaceuticals completed patient enrollment in the 52-week Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating pirfenidone for the treatment of pneumoconiosis. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 272 patients across 18 clinical research centers in China. The trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 52 weeks of pirfenidone treatment in patients with pneumoconiosis, a chronic occupational lung disease characterized by progressive pulmonary fibrosis.

Following the NMPA’s approval in March 2025 of Gyre Pharmaceuticals’ clinical trial application for pirfenidone in oncology-related pulmonary complications, Gyre Pharmaceuticals plans to initiate an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial in the fourth quarter of 2025 in the PRC, targeting radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) including cases complicated by immune-related pneumonitis across leading oncology centers.

Financial Results

Cash Position

As of September 30, 2025, Gyre held $40.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $19.6 million in short-term bank deposits, and $20.3 million in long-term certificates of deposit, totaling $80.3 million.

Financial Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025

Revenues : Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025 were $30.6 million, compared to $25.5 million for the same period in 2024. The $5.1 million increase was primarily due to $1.5 million from Etorel® sales, $1.2 million from Contiva® sales and a $2.4 million increase in revenue from ETUARY® sales. The increase in ETUARY® sales was mainly driven by a shift in marketing focus in the third quarter. We continue to anticipate revenue growth over the remainder of the year, driven by the growth of ETUARY® sales and supplemented by the commercialization of Etorel® and Contiva® in 2025.

Financial Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025

Revenues: Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were $79.4 million, compared to $77.9 million for the same period in 2024. The $1.5 million increase was primarily driven by the increase in new product sales of Contiva® by $3.0 million and Etorel® by $3.1 million, partially offset by a $4.4 million decline in ETUARY® sales and a $0.2 million decrease in generic drug revenue. The decrease in ETUARY® sales was primarily due to the allocation of marketing resources towards the launches of two new products during the first half of the year. In the third quarter, Gyre refocused marketing efforts on ETUARY® in response to market uncertainties related to Etorel® and Contiva®, both of which were included in the latest national volume-based procurement catalog. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, Gyre recorded an increase in ETUARY® sales compared to the same period in 2024, and Gyre expects ETUARY® sales will continue to grow in the three months ended December 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

We revised our full-year revenue guidance (see “Revised Full Year 2025 Financial Guidance” section below) primarily due to lower-than-expected sales of Contiva® and Etorel® relative to internal budget expectations. While both products continue to expand their commercial presence, initial rollout challenges and external market dynamics have resulted in lower than-expected sales.

For Etorel®, early-year supply chain and distribution delays moderated launch uptake, and uncertainty related to government volume-based procurement led customers to cautious purchasing behavior. While the underlying demand has started to improve, current performance remains below our original expectations for the year.

Cost of Revenues : For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, cost of revenues was $3.7 million, compared to $2.7 million for the same period in 2024. The $1.0 million increase was primarily driven by a $0.1 million increase in stock-based compensation and a $0.4 million increase in the costs of Etorel® and Contiva®, in line with the corresponding increase in their sales, as well as a $0.8 million increase in ETUARY®'s cost due to the higher plant, property and equipment depreciation from a plant renovation in 2025, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in costs related to generic drugs due to the decrease of sales.

The decrease was primarily driven by the increase in operating expenses of $3.3 million, partially offset by an increase in revenue of $1.5 million and an increase in other income of $0.7 million.

Revised Full Year 2025 Financial Guidance

Full-year revenue guidance revised from $118–128 million to $115–118 million, reflecting slower-than-expected commercialization of Etorel® (nintedanib) due to early supply chain and distribution challenges, as well as increased market uncertainty related to China’s centralized procurement policy leading to more cautious purchasing behavior in the second half of the year, partially offset by stronger-than-expected ETUARY® sales.

Please note that the revenue guidance assumes a constant foreign currency rate and no significant economic disruption or downturn.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by Gyre Therapeutics, Inc.

Gyre reports financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). This release presents the financial measure “adjusted net income,” which is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for this non-GAAP financial measure is “net income.” Adjusted net income presents Gyre’s results of operations after excluding gain from change in fair value of warrants, stock-based compensation, and provision for income taxes. This is meant to supplement, and not substitute, Gyre’s financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income as defined by Gyre may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management believes that presenting adjusted net income provides investors with additional useful information in evaluating the Gyre’s performance and valuation. See the reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income in the section titled “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

[TITLE]Longeveron Granted U.S. Patent for Method of Treating Aging-related Frailty in Patients with Inflammaging Using its Proprietary Stem Cell Therapy:
[TEXT]
The patent relates to methods of administering therapeutically effective amounts of isolated allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to patients with aging-related frailty with inflammaging

No approved treatments for aging-related frailty, a syndrome affecting older individuals that impairs human Healthspan, and is characterized by weakness, low physical activity, slowed motor performance, exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss

Laromestrocel, a mesenchymal stem cell therapy, has delivered positive initial results across two clinical trials in aging-related frailty

MIAMI, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Longeveron Inc. (NASDAQ: LGVN), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing cellular therapy for life-threatening, rare pediatric and chronic aging-related conditions, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted a patent covering administration of the Company’s proprietary Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) for the treatment of patients with symptoms of aging-related frailty.

U.S. Patent No. 12,465,620, entitled “Method of Treating Aging Frailty in Subjects with Inflammaging Using Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells,” provides Longeveron with patent rights in the United States through 2038. Further patent term extension may occur along with regulatory exclusivity extensions.

Aging-related frailty is a syndrome of multisystem physiological dysregulation occurring in older individuals which diminishes human healthspan. The symptoms of aging-related frailty include weakness, low physical activity, slowed motor performance, exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss. Many studies show a direct correlation between aging-related frailty and inflammation. Inflammaging has received considerable attention because it proposes a link between immune changes and a number of diseases and conditions (such as aging-related frailty) common in old age.

Longeveron has previously conducted Phase 1 and 2 studies in aging-related frailty designed to show improvements in the six-minute walk test and physical functioning for its lead MSC drug, laromestrocel.

[TITLE]ProKidney Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results and Provides Regulatory and Clinical Updates:
[TEXT]
Full results from the Phase 2 REGEN-007 study of rilparencel were recently presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2025

More than half of the patients required for the Phase 3 REGEN-006 (PROACT 1) accelerated approval analysis using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope have been enrolled; topline results anticipated in Q2 2027

Ended the third quarter with $272 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, supporting operations into mid-2027

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProKidney Corp. (Nasdaq: PROK) (“ProKidney” or the “Company"), a leading late clinical-stage cell therapy company focused on chronic kidney disease (CKD), today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025, and provided regulatory and clinical updates.

“The Phase 2 REGEN-007 full results recently presented at ASN Kidney Week further strengthen the body of evidence supporting our ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study and underscore the potential of rilparencel to become a novel treatment option for patients with advanced CKD and diabetes,” said Bruce Culleton, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of ProKidney. “In Group 1, which mirrored the dosing regimen being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study, treatment with rilparencel led to statistically significant and clinically meaningful stabilization of kidney function. Notably, 63% of Group 1 patients met the key PROACT 1 inclusion criteria, and similar efficacy was observed in this subgroup compared to the overall Group 1 results. We remain focused on the continued execution of PROACT 1 to bring a potential new treatment option to patients with advanced CKD and diabetes at high risk of kidney failure, an area of significant unmet need.”

Phase 2 REGEN-007 Full Results Recently Presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025

On November 6, 2025, ProKidney presented full results from the Phase 2 REGEN-007 study evaluating rilparencel in patients with advanced CKD and diabetes. The data, featured in a late-breaking clinical trials presentation, further demonstrate the potential of rilparencel to preserve kidney function in patients with advanced CKD and diabetes who are at high risk of kidney failure. Highlights include:

In Group 1 (n=24), bilateral kidney injection with rilparencel resulted in a 4.6 mL/min/1.73m 2 improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 78% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p<0.001)

improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 78% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p<0.001) Among Group 1 patients, 15 of 24 (63%) met key Phase 3 PROACT 1 inclusion criteria; in this subgroup, bilateral kidney injection resulted in a 5.5 mL/min/1.73m 2 improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 85% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p=0.005)

improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 85% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p=0.005) Post-hoc analysis of patient subgroups on standard-of-care (SOC) medications, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), suggest rilparencel had a treatment effect incremental to that observed with SOC

Rilparencel was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile

Phase 3 PROACT 1 Registrational Program Update: Alignment Achieved with FDA on Accelerated Path

In a July 2025 Type B meeting, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that eGFR slope in patients from the ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study can serve as the surrogate endpoint and primary basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission of rilparencel under the accelerated approval pathway. The FDA also confirmed that PROACT 1 may be used to support both accelerated and confirmatory approval of rilparencel. ProKidney continues to maintain its ongoing dialogue with the FDA under rilparencel’s regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation. More than half of the approximately 360 patients required for the accelerated approval analysis using eGFR slope had been enrolled as of August 2025. Topline data readout to support an application for accelerated approval is anticipated in Q2 2027. Rilparencel is the only cell therapy in a Phase 3 clinical study for the treatment of CKD and type 2 diabetes.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights

Liquidity: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2025, totaled $271.7 million, compared to $358.3 million on December 31, 2024. ProKidney expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held on September 30, 2025, will enable the Company to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2027.

R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $26.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $31.3 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of $4.4 million was driven primarily by decreases in costs for clinical operations of approximately $4.2 million driven by the wind down of activities related to REGEN-016 and our other clinical trials that have been completed or terminated. Additionally, the Company has seen decreases in spending on manufacturing process development and professional fees of approximately $1.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. These decreases have been partially offset by increases in equity and cash compensation costs of approximately $1.4 million as the Company continues to hire additional personnel to support our operations and increases in materials costs of $1.2 million to support the Phase 3 clinical program.

G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $17.7 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of $5.8 million has been primarily driven by the decrease in the amount of non-cash impairment charges of $5.0 million related to the Greensboro facility and decreases in cash and equity compensation of approximately $1.9 million. These increases have been partially offset by increases in professional fees of approximately $0.8 million.

Net Loss Before Noncontrolling Interest: Net loss before noncontrolling interest was $35.8 million and $41.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Shares outstanding: Class A and Class B common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2025 totaled 295,266,876.

[TITLE]MeiraGTx Enters into Strategic Collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company to Develop and Commercialize Genetic Medicines in Ophthalmology:
[TEXT]
LONDON and NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MeiraGTx Holdings plc (Nasdaq: MGTX), a vertically integrated, clinical stage genetic medicines company, today announced a broad strategic collaboration in the area of ophthalmology with Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”).

MeiraGTx will grant Lilly worldwide exclusive rights to its AAV-AIPL1 program for treatment of one of the most severe inherited retinopathies, Leber congenital amaurosis 4 (LCA4) owing to genetic deficiency of Aryl-hydrocarbon-interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1). Clinical data from 11 children under the age of 4 who were born legally blind as a result of mutations in the AIPL1 gene were unprecedented, with all 11 blind children gaining vision after treatment with AAV-AIPL1. Beyond the effects on vision, treatment with AAV-AIPL1 resulted in life-changing benefits in vital areas of development including communication, behavior, learning, mood, psychological benefits and social integration.

Lilly will also receive worldwide exclusive access rights to MeiraGTx’s innovative gene therapy technologies for use in ophthalmology with certain targets named by Lilly, including novel intravitreal capsids developed in-house at MeiraGTx and bespoke promoters including AI-generated promoters for specific cells in the retina. MeiraGTx also grants Lilly certain rights to its proprietary riboswitch technology for use in gene editing in the eye. MeiraGTx’s riboswitch technology platform is broadly applicable to any therapeutic protein. It allows precise, titratable in-vivo production of the therapeutic protein or gene editing nuclease from a gene template controlled by oral dosing of a small molecule inducer.

Under the terms of the agreement, MeiraGTx will receive an upfront payment of $75 million and will be eligible to receive over $400 million in total milestone payments. MeiraGTx is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on licensed products.

“We are excited to be entering into this collaboration with Lilly in ophthalmology,” said Alexandria Forbes, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of MeiraGTx. “MeiraGTx has been dedicated to treating patients with serious eye conditions since the company’s inception, and this collaboration with Lilly is a testament to our leadership in this field and the power of our broad toolkit of proprietary gene therapy technologies for both rare and prevalent ocular disease.”

Dr. Forbes continued, “I am very proud of the team at MeiraGTx who over the past decade has built one of the industry’s most comprehensive genetic medicine companies - from capsid screening, promoter engineering and vector optimization, to clinical development and in-house GMP manufacturing, allowing us to accelerate the development of next-generation genetic medicines from concept to clinic with exceptional speed and quality. We are particularly pleased that Lilly, a global leader in development and commercialization of innovative medicines, has chosen to partner with us in this area of high unmet need, and shares our dedication to bringing truly life changing therapies to patients with otherwise intractable conditions.”

“Ophthalmology is an emerging area of interest for Lilly,” said Andrew Adams, Lilly group vice president, Molecule Discovery. “We are excited to partner with MeiraGTx to bring transformative treatments to patients around the world suffering from eye diseases, starting with AAV-AIPL1, which has shown the unprecedented ability to restore vision in children who were born legally blind.”
