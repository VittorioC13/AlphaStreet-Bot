President Trump and Mohammed bin Salman concluded the Saudi crown prince's visit to the U.S. today by speaking to more than 400 business leaders.

Beyond a defense agreement and talk of the kingdom's human rights record, the visit focused on joint U.S.-Saudi adventures, including extracting Saudi minerals critical to everything from fighter jets to cell phones, and helping Saudi Arabia build a civilian nuclear program.

Nick Schifrin is here to discuss that now.

So, Nick, let's begin with that deal over rare earth minerals. Why is that so important?

Nick Schifrin:

You just said it, Amna.

These rare earth minerals and magnets that are produced by them go into everything, from electric vehicles to the world's most advanced fighter jet, the F-35. And Saudi Arabia says that it has the fourth most valuable deposit of rare earth in the world.

But, right now, China has a near monopoly on what are known as heavy rare earths. They do 90 percent of the processing, and China produces 93 percent of all those earth magnets that are required for high-end manufacturing.

So the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have agreed that an American company, MP Materials, whose biggest shareholder right now is the U.S. government, in fact, will own just

[TITLE]Eurobank Research: Greece in the role of Europe's central energy hub with the 20-year LNG deal:
[TEXT]
Newsroom November 19 12:52

Following the recent long-term agreement to supply LNG to Romania and Ukraine via Alexandroupolis and the Vertical Gas Transmission Corridor, Greece is strengthening its role as a key player in Europe’s changing energy map. As Eurobank Research notes in a study, although the deal will have little impact on Greece’s gas market in the short term, it marks an important step towards building the country’s position as a regional energy hub.

In addition, by linking Southeast Europe more closely to more stable gas suppliers such as the US, the agreement supports EU efforts to wean itself off Russian energy and strengthen its long-term energy security. Recent concessions for offshore gas exploration projects in the Northern Ionian, Southern Peloponnese and Southern Crete further highlight the country’s potentially growing importance in Europe’s future energy mix.

In addition to initiatives in the fields of secure energy supply and investment, Greece’s role in the decision-making centres for Europe’s medium to long-term energy planning is being strengthened.

A typical example is the intervention of our country that facilitated the implementation of a complete ban on Russian gas imports into the EU from 1 January 2026 (excluding those under existing supply agreements) until the end of 2027. Adopting the Greek proposal, the Council of Europe proposed on 20 October that countries exporting gas to the EU via the TurkStream pipeline should have to prove their non-Russian origin, contrary to the Commission’s proposal, which defined importers in the countries of entry as responsible for this.

[TITLE]RE sector financing doubles as outstanding loans surge 2x in Sep:
[TEXT]
Indian banks are bullish on India’s renewable energy (RE) sector with loans outstanding to the sector as of September, more than doubling year-on-year (y-o-y).

Data from RBI shows that the outstanding credit to the renewable energy sector stood at ₹14,842 crore as of September 2025 as against ₹6,778 crore in the same period last year.

The growth significantly outpaces the rate of growth in other priority sectors like agriculture, MSMEs and Housing and is also up compared to the 39 per cent y-o-y growth from the September 2023 to September 2024 period

Speaking to businessline, industry experts said the increase in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution with GST reductions and favourable policy landscape pushing projects that were previously on hold to the implementation stage.

Healthy growth

Sachin Sachdeva, Vice President, Sector Head - Financial Sector Ratings , ICRA Ltd, said the overall growth of renewable energy sector remains healthy with significant capacity additions taking place y-o-y. “Consequently, a large part of the funding goes towards the under-construction projects as the already developed project would primarily have refinancing requirements,” he added.

Sachdeva noted that large infrastructure non-banking finance companies (NBFC-IFCs), who have a big play in the RE space, have also seen their assets under management (AUM) grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 30 per cent over the last two years.

Ramneek Sehgal, Chairman & Managing Director of infrastructure firm Ceigall India Ltd, noted that the surge in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution rather than just pipeline build-up, especially in the solar energy sector.

“With the sharp reduction in solar module prices and the ramp-up of domestic manufacturing capacity, many projects that were previously on hold have now moved into the implementation stage,” he said. Sehgal added that the solar sector has opened up after a period of supply-side constraints and policy adjustments with 42 Giga Watt of solar capacity additions expected in FY26.

Overall installed RE capacity in India as of October 2025 stood at around 2 lakh Mega Watt (MW) (excluding Large Hydro Power) with 27,927 MW added in the April-Oct 2025 period.

Vivek Jain, Director, India Ratings and Research said, “When we look at the loans outstanding it is a combination of both under-construction and commissioned projects and hence we see a significant jump in loans outstanding,” he added. Jain mentions that this trend will persist if under-construction projects continue at the same pace but if their pace declines, the loan growth would appear slower than capacity growth.

Costs moderating

Experts added that the rise in financing is more reflective of expanding execution activity rather than cost inflation.

“Input and equipment costs have largely stabilised over the past year. In fact, the reduction in GST and improved domestic supply chains have helped offset earlier cost pressures. Across the industry, scale efficiencies and better value engineering are enabling developers to optimize overall project costs,” Sehgal said.

Sachdeva from ICRA says project costs have generally trended downward and the growth in funding to the sector seems to be primarily driven by capacity additions taking place at a faster pace.
