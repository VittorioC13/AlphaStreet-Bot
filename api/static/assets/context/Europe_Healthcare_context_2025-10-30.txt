R&D update - key developments from the third quarter

New approvals

Rhapsido

(remibrutinib) Rhapsido was approved by the FDA as an oral treatment for adult patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment. It is the first FDA-approved Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) for CSU. Remibrutinib is also in Phase III development for chronic inducible urticaria, hidradenitis suppurativa and food allergy, as well as multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis.

Regulatory updates

Scemblix (asciminib) The CHMP of the EMA adopted a positive opinion and recommended granting marketing authorization for Scemblix for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) in all lines of treatment.

Results from ongoing trials and other highlights

Ianalumab

(VAY736) The Phase III NEPTUNUS-1 and -2 trials evaluating ianalumab in adults with active Sjögren’s disease met their primary endpoint, showing statistically significant improvements in disease activity as measured by a reduction in ESSDAI compared to placebo. Ianalumab was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile, supporting its potential to become the first targeted treatment for this chronic autoimmune disease. Novartis plans to submit ianalumab to health authorities globally and was granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA.

In the Phase III VAYHIT2 trial, ianalumab plus eltrombopag significantly extended the time to treatment failure compared to placebo plus eltrombopag in adult patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), previously treated with corticosteroids. The safety profile was consistent with previous studies. Data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and included in regulatory submissions in 2027.

Ianalumab is also in Phase III development for systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Pluvicto

(lutetium Lu177

vipivotide

tetraxetan) In the Phase III PSMAddition trial, Pluvicto plus standard-of-care (SoC) reduced risk of progression or death by 28% versus SoC alone, with a positive trend in overall survival in patients with PSMA+ metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Safety remained consistent with PSMAfore and VISION trials. Data presented at ESMO. Kisqali

(ribociclib) The five-year analysis of the pivotal Phase III NATALEE trial in the broadest population of high-risk stage II and III HR+/HER2- early breast cancer (eBC) showed the addition of Kisqali to endocrine therapy (ET) reduced the risk of recurrence by 28.4% compared to ET alone. Data also showed a 29.1% risk reduction in distant disease-free survival, a positive trend in overall survival, and no new safety signals. Data presented at ESMO. Cosentyx

(secukinumab) The Phase III REPLENISH study met its primary endpoint, with Cosentyx demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful sustained remission compared to placebo at week 52 in adults with relapsing polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Full data will be presented at an upcoming medical congress and submitted to health authorities in 2026. Fabhalta

(iptacopan) In the Phase III APPLAUSE-IgAN final analysis, Fabhalta demonstrated statistically significant, clinically meaningful superiority compared to placebo in slowing IgAN progression measured by annualized total slope of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline over two years. Full data will be presented at future medical meetings and included in regulatory submissions in 2026. Leqvio

(Inclisiran) In the Phase IV V-DIFFERENCE study, 85% of patients with hypercholesterolemia who had not reached guideline-recommended LDL-C targets despite optimized lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) achieved their goals with Leqvio plus LLT, versus 31% with placebo plus LLT, with benefits evident in as early as 30 days. Leqvio also reduced LDL-C by 59% over 360 days, outperforming placebo plus LLT by 35%. Data presented at ESC. Entresto

(sacubitril/ valsartan) Data from the Phase IV PARACHUTE-HF study in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to chronic Chagas disease showed that Entresto outperformed enalapril on a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization or NT-proBNP change. Entresto was well tolerated, with no new safety signals identified. Data presented at ESC. Kesimpta

(ofatumumab) In the ARTIOS Phase IIIb study, patients with RMS who switched to Kesimpta after breakthrough disease on fingolimod or fumarate-based therapies showed a substantial reduction in disease activity. This was reflected in a low annualized relapse rate (ARR of 0.06 over 96 weeks), near-complete suppression of MRI activity, and over 90% of participants achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3). No new safety concerns were identified, regardless of prior disease-modifying treatment.

In the separate ALITHIOS open-label extension study, more than 90% of naïve patients receiving Kesimpta showed no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) at 7 years, with no new safety concerns, reinforcing the benefit of introducing Kesimpta early. Data from both studies presented at ECTRIMS. Selected transactions Novartis entered into an agreement to acquire Tourmaline Bio, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing pacibekitug, a Phase III-ready anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In Phase II, pacibekitug reduced median high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels by up to 86% compared to placebo, with similar incidence rates of adverse events and serious adverse events. The transaction is expected to close on October 28, 2025.

Novartis entered a second collaboration with Monte Rosa Therapeutics, in addition to the existing license agreement for VAV1 degraders, announced in October 2024. Under the new agreement, Novartis receives an exclusive license to an undisclosed discovery target and options to license two programs from Monte Rosa’s preclinical immunology portfolio.

Novartis continued its collaboration with Argo Biopharma, adding two new agreements: an exclusive license to an siRNA candidate currently in IND-enabling studies and expected to enter Phase I in 2026, and an option to exclusively license two second-generation siRNA molecules currently in development, with a right of first negotiation to the Phase II ANGPTL3 program.

Novartis entered into a global licensing and collaboration agreement with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals for ARO-SNCA, a preclinical-stage siRNA therapy targeting alpha-synuclein for the treatment of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson’s disease. The agreement also includes additional collaboration targets leveraging Arrowhead’s proprietary Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiM™) platform.

Capital structure and net debt

Retaining a good balance between investment in the business, a strong capital structure, and attractive shareholder returns remains a priority.

During the first nine months of 2025, Novartis repurchased a total of 66.4 million shares for USD 7.5 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line. These repurchases included 49.1 million shares (USD 5.4 billion) under the USD 15 billion share buyback (announced in July 2023 and completed in July 2025) and 6.6 million shares (USD 0.8 billion) under the new up-to USD 10 billion share buyback announced in July 2025. In addition, 10.7 million shares (USD 1.3 billion) were repurchased to mitigate anticipated full-year dilution related to the equity-based compensation plans of associates. Further, 1.6 million shares (equity value of USD 0.2 billion) were repurchased from associates. In the same period, 11.7 million shares (equity value of USD 0.9 billion) were delivered to associates related to equity-based compensation plans. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 56.3 million versus December 31, 2024. These treasury share transactions resulted in an equity decrease of USD 6.8 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 7.7 billion.

Net debt increased to USD 20.4 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to USD 16.1 billion at December 31, 2024. The increase was mainly due to the free cash flow of USD 15.9 billion being more than offset by the USD 7.8 billion annual dividend payment, cash outflows for treasury share transactions of USD 7.7 billion and net cash outflow for M&A, intangible assets transactions and other acquisitions of USD 3.7 billion.

As of Q3 2025, the long-term credit rating for the company is Aa3 with Moody’s Ratings and AA- with S&P Global Ratings.
