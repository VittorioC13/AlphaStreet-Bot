[TITLE]Russia starts Zapad and NATO braces for trouble:
[TEXT]
Whether or not the incursion of at least 19 Russian drones into Poland on the night of 9 September was deliberate or not, NATO’s response will provide the Kremlin with a clear indication of whether it can continue to escalate military aggression against its security members without meaningful consequences to it. This is particularly useful information for Moscow to know, as the four-yearly ‘Zapad’ joint Russia-Belarus military exercises began on 12 September and are due to end on the 16th of this month. The last time the exercises were held, they effectively formed the first phase of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with troops and equipment used in the 2021 Zapad kept in place after the drills had officially finished. This year’s Zapad will feature for the first time exercises surrounding the use of Russian nuclear weapons and nuclear-capable intermediate-range missiles. Poland – which has been ahead of the curve in identifying Russia’s deadly serious intention to invade a NATO member country within the next three to five years at most – is taking no chances, moving 40,000 of its troops to its eastern border with Belarus. For its part, the U.S. has begun its response by announcing further potential sanctions on Russia’s key liquefied natural gas (LNG) flows involving its crucial Arctic facilities.

A broad reason why Russia’s Arctic LNG projects are so important to it is the increasing importance of this form of gas to the global energy mix following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This resulted from the fact that, unlike energy moved through pipelines, LNG does not require years of negotiations and vast expense in building out a complex transportation infrastructure before it is ready to purchase and move. Instead, once gas has been converted to LNG, it can be shipped and moved anywhere within a matter of days and bought reliably either through short- or long-term contracts or immediately in the spot market. Consequently, after sanctions were eventually placed on Russia’s main oil and gas pipelines into Europe following the Ukraine invasion, LNG became -- and remains – the world’s most important swing energy source, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. This rising economic importance of LNG morphs into the second reason why Russia’s LNG business is so important to it, which is that it has replaced its oil and gas supplies as the new means by which it can build and exert power over its customers or, in the case of China, consolidate its position as a key ally of Beijing. The third reason for Arctic LNG’s importance to Russia is that the Kremlin intends for growth in its LNG business to increasingly offset the reduction of its oil and gas exports into key markets as a result of sanctions. According to Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, Russia intends its LNG market share to rise to 20% (at least 100 million tons per year) by 2030, from the current 8% or so. According to the International Energy Agency, Russia’s share of the internationally traded natural gas market is forecast to fall from around 30% in the year before it invaded Ukraine to

Mumbai: Nayara Energy may have to offer a $1-2 per barrel discount to India's state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) to sell petrol and diesel that the Russian-owned refiner cannot export due to European sanctions , people close to the development said.The Rosneft-backed company, which operates a 20-million-tonne refinery in Gujarat, has been in talks with Indian Oil Corporation Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation to place its refined fuel with them. These state-run oil OMCs have sought a discount to buy the fuel products, the people said."Generally, inter-oil-company exchanges happen at a fixed formula based on the price of crude oil. Now since Nayara is using discounted Russian crude at its refinery, it is only natural that the OMCs seek a discount," said an industry executive aware of the matter.The latest discount on Russian Urals is around $2-3 per barrel.Nayara Energy and the OMCs did not respond to emails seeking comment until press time Monday.Nayara Energy runs India's second-largest single-location refinery at Vadinar, Gujarat, delivering

[TITLE]Climate change is fast shrinking the world’s largest inland sea:
[TEXT]
Once a haven for flamingos, sturgeon and thousands of seals, fast-receding waters are turning the northern coast of the Caspian Sea into barren stretches of dry sand. In some places, the sea has retreated more than 50km. Wetlands are becoming deserts, fishing ports are being left high and dry, and oil companies are dredging ever-longer channels to reach their offshore installations.

Climate change is driving this dramatic decline in the world’s largest landlocked sea. Found at the boundary between Europe and central Asia, the Caspian Sea is surrounded by Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan, and sustains around 15 million people.

The Caspian is a hub for fishing, shipping, and oil and gas production, and is of rising geopolitical importance as it sits where the interests of global superpowers meet. As the sea shallows, governments face the critical challenge of maintaining industries and livelihoods, while also protecting the unique ecosystems that sustains them.

I’ve been visiting the Caspian for more than 20 years, working with local researchers to study the unique and endangered Caspian seal, and support its conservation. Back in the 2000s, the far north-eastern corner of the sea was a mosaic of reed beds, mudflats and shallow channels that teemed with life, providing habitats for spawning fish, migrating birds, and tens of thousands of seals that gathered there to moult in the spring.

Now these remote wild places we visited to catch seals for satellite tracking studies are dry land, transitioning to desert as the sea retreats, and the same story is playing out for other wetlands around the sea. This experience parallels that of coastal communities, who year by year are seeing the water recede away from their towns, fishing wharves and ports, leaving infrastructure stranded on newly-dry land, and the people fearful for the future.

A sea in retreat

The level of Caspian Sea has always fluctuated, but the scale of recent change is unprecedented. Since the turn of the current century, water levels have declined by around 6cm per year, with drops of up to 30cm per year since 2020. In July 2025, Russian scientists announced the sea had dropped below the previous minimum level recorded during the era of instrumental measurements.

During the 20th century, variations were due to a combination of natural factors and humans diverting water to use for agriculture and industry, but now global warming is the main driver of decline. It might seem inconceivable that a body of water as large as the Caspian could be at risk, but in the hotter climate the rate of water entering the sea from rivers and rainfall is reducing, and is now being outstripped by increased evaporation from the sea surface.

Even if global warming is limited to the Paris agreement target of 2°C, water levels are predicted to fall up to ten metres compared to the 2010 coastline. With the current global trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions, the decline could reach 18 metres, which is

[TITLE]Qatar Rethinks the U.S. Security Umbrella:
[TEXT]
After Israel’s attack on a Hamas meeting in Doha, Qatar, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed regret over the incident and directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to finalize a defense cooperation agreement with Qatar.

When Qatari officials heard that news, they probably wondered, Why bother?

Qatar is a Major Non-NATO Ally of the U.S. and a major customer for American defense equipment. In recent years Doha provided financial support to Hamas (with U.S. and Israeli connivance), mediated U.S.-Taliban peace talks, hosted America’s Afghan refugee resettlement facility; mediated ceasefire talks between Israel and the militant group Hamas; hosts the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, Al Udeid Air Base (upgraded at Qatar’s expense); gifted the U.S. a Boeing 747-8 aircraft as an interim Air Force One, agreed to purchase 210 Boeing aircraft and over 400 GE Aerospace engines, and entered an agreement that will “generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,” according to the White House.

What did Qatar get for all it did? It got the distinction of being attacked by both Iran and Israel in one year, though Trump helpfully 'assured' Qatar that Israel won't attack again, though he was immediately repudiated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Qataris reportedly received Israeli and American assurances in August that Hamas officials would not be targeted on Qatari soil, but that promise was broken.

Why did the attack happen now?

James M. Dorsey of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore noted, “In the last six weeks, Hamas has largely agreed to proposals put forward by the mediators, Qatar, Egypt, and the United States.” This may have motivated Israel to strike - before it was presented with a deal that would be hard to refuse.

Related: US Drillers See Slight Uptick in Oil Activity

The Jerusalem Post noted a recent survey: “Nearly two-thirds of the Israeli public are in support of a ceasefire deal that includes Hamas's release of all the hostages in exchange for a full IDF withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, with nearly half of right-leaning Israelis supporting such a deal…” For Netanyahu, peace will bring an uncomfortable, public airing of the security failures that contributed to the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack, and a court date over allegations of personal corruption, so it was critical to stop Hamas from saying “yes” and so keep his far-right coalition intact. Or, as, former Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says, “peace represents Israel’s only existential threat,” that is, Israel needs tension in the region to keep the Americans interested.

If the end of Qatar’s mediation condemns the Israeli hostages in Gaza, who may die at the hands of Hamas or Israeli friendly fire, or due to poor diet and lack of medical care, well, that’s a sacrifice Netanyahu is willing to make.

And what did America know and when did it know it?

The White House claimed Trump wasn’t notified in advance by Israel and learned of the attack from the Pentagon, though Israeli sources claim he was notified in advance. Trump ordered his crisis negotiator, Steve Witkoff, to notify Doha, but Witkoff’s call came as the bombs were falling.

To add insult to injury for Doha, reports on X claim United Kingdom (UK) refueling aircraft, based at Al Udeid Air Base refueled the attacking Israeli aircraft. The reports are apparently untrue as the UK and Israel use different aerial refueling systems, but the story is all over social media, and who are you going to believe?

There were reports that the Israelis breached the airspace of several Arab countries to strike Qatar, though The Wall Street Journal reports the Israelis launched the missiles from the Red Sea to avoid violating Saudi airspace and to avoid the complicated refueling process.

It doesn’t matter what the truth is; Washington looks either complicit or impotent. It got to this place by conditioning the world that it will support anything Israel does. Netanyahu is prepared to kill the Gaza ceasefire negotiations and make U.S. security guarantees meaningless, and is counting on his American Zionist collaborators to keep Trump on the right track. That may keep Bibi’s political coalition intact (and him out of jail) and the American weapons flowing but that will likely end American influence in the region for a long time, if it ever recovers.

Trump’s lassitude in the face of Netanyahu’s disrespect and the challenge to America’s influence in the Middle East likely has the conspiracy-minded and not-so-conspiracy-minded thinking that Epstein files must be red hot.

The United Arab Emirates is weighing Qatar’s request that it shutter its embassy in Tel Aviv, and Qatar’s prime minister (who is also foreign minister), Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, said Netanyahu must be brought to justice.” If Qatar goes to the International Criminal Court, what will Washington do? It is eager to sanction any party that challenges Israel at The Hague, but will sanctioning Qatar open the door to China and other competitors to the U.S.?

It's the kind of possibility that makes your head swim if your name is Xi or Putin.

Qatar’s prime minister reportedly told Witkoff: “It seems we need new security partners, we have been attacked twice and you did not defend us,” though Qatar denied it is reevaluating its security partnership with the U.S.

Al-Thani said that Qatar will not cease its efforts at mediation, so Israel may have gone to a lot of effort for nothing. Qatar’s constitution stipulates mediation as a foreign policy priority: “based on the principle of encouraging peaceful resolution of international disputes.”

Al-Thani met Trump on Friday and hopefully the president gained a more sober view of Qatar’s ability to help the U.S. and how Israel sometimes diminishes America’s influence in the region. Washington did vote to approve a United Nations Security Council condemnation of Israel’s attack on Qatar but it did not directly name Israel – as though the missiles just fell from the heavens.

The fact that Trump has refrained from his typical effusive tweeting

[TITLE]A pragmatic and flexible 2040 climate framework for a competitive industrial future:
[TEXT]
Brussels, 15 September 2025 : We welcome the European Commission’s consultation on the proposal to amend the European Climate Law to include the 2040 climate target. This target marks a critical milestone in the EU’s climate ambition and will require a regulatory framework that is not only ambitious but also flexible and competitiveness-driven - one that enables innovation, encourages investment, and allows for the scale-up of all viable solutions. Only through such a pragmatic approach can the EU ensure both climate progress and the resilience of its industrial base.

The fuel manufacturing industry plays a critical role in ensuring energy security, enhancing industrial competitiveness, and achieving the objectives of the EU Green Deal - particularly by supporting the decarbonisation of transport and other key industries that rely on our products as raw materials.

As committed partners in the energy transition, we support the EU’s goal of climate neutrality by 2050 and the 2030 target of 55% emissions reductions.

However, ambition must be accompanied by pragmatism: achieving the proposed 2040 climate target requires an enabling regulatory framework that supports both climate goals and Europe’s competitiveness. Without this, the 2040 Climate Target risks becoming unrealistic.

While the 2040 target sets an ambitious destination, it lacks the enabling measures to ensure delivery. European industries need a viable business case to drive the scale of investment required for breakthrough technologies and low-carbon solutions.

Liana Gouta, Director General of FuelsEurope, states: “Europe must keep all options on the table to reach its ambitious 2040 target. If the EU wants to achieve its climate ambitions while maintaining industrial resilience and delivering on the Clean Industrial Deal and the Draghi Report recommendations, we need a more flexible and inclusive framework that recognises both high-quality international credits and domestic removals from the outset, while ensuring equal access to compliance options for all ETS sectors.” She added “We urge the EU to establish supporting infrastructure, enhance transparency on residual emissions, and stimulate lead markets for renewable and low-carbon products. Only by combining regulatory flexibility, robust safeguards, and demand-side measures can the EU achieve its ambitious climate goals while safeguarding industrial competitiveness.”

We stress the urgent need for the following key enabling measures:

Advance the integration of international credits beyond the 3% cap and from the outset of the post-2030 framework , as they can play a role in achieving net zero and contributing to market functioning.

, as they can play a role in achieving net zero and contributing to market functioning. Strengthen flexibility in the EU ETS through removals and international credits and ensure equal access to decarbonisation options across ETS sectors , as these solutions can contribute to market functioning, especially as the framework moves towards a period of expected market shortage.

, as these solutions can contribute to market functioning, especially as the framework moves towards a period of expected market shortage. Enhance policy integrity through greater transparency on residual emissions , enabling better understanding of where further decarbonisation efforts must be concentrated and what policy instruments will be necessary to reach the target.

, enabling better understanding of where further decarbonisation efforts must be concentrated and what policy instruments will be necessary to reach the target. Support the demand for renewable and low-carbon goods to provide for a business case to invest in decarbonisation at scale , to complement the existing focus on the supply side. To unlock the full potential of industrial decarbonisation, we must go further - by actively stimulating and supporting demand for renewable and low-carbon goods.

, to complement the existing focus on the supply side. To unlock the full potential of industrial decarbonisation, we must go further - by actively stimulating and supporting demand for renewable and low-carbon goods. Enable supporting infrastructure, including electricity grids, hydrogen pipelines, CO₂ transport networks, and storage facilities.

FuelsEurope is ready to engage with the institutions to contribute to the designing of the enabling measures.

Market Overview and Industry Potential

The bioethanol market refers to the production, distribution, and use of bioethanol, which is a type of alcohol that is obtained from different types of plants rich in cellulose, like sugarcane, sugar beet, and some grains like corn. Bioethanol has many benefits, including its renewability, biodegradability, and importance in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. More complete combustion makes it a much cleaner exhaust than gasoline.

There are many sources for this fuel as long as they contain starch or sugar. According to a report published in June 2025, a pilot facility in Fukushima Prefecture to produce second-generation bioethanol from non-edible biomass was launched by Toyota in partnership with other Japanese Manufacturers. The plant is designed to generate around 60 kiloliters of ethanol annually, and uses agricultural residues like rice straw and forestry by-products.

Artificial intelligence (AI)’s role in biofuels provides an emerging and significant convergence in the relationship between advanced technology and energy produced from renewable sources. AI in biofuels is used for improving the biofuel production by adjusting irrigation and fertilizer usage to maximize yield, and conversion processes like adjusting temperature and pressure levels, to enhance the efficiency of biofuels. AI techniques in bioethanol production do not require major technological changes in current automobile engine systems. AI improves bioenergy, improves efficiency, and reduces waste.

The Science and Environmental Policy Project

Quote of the Week: “The right to search for truth implies also a duty; one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be true.” — Albert Einstein, The Ultimate Quotable Einstein (2010) [H/t Richard Lindzen and William Happer]

Number of the Week: 1.5 mm per year

THIS WEEK:

By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)

Scope: TWTW begins with a legal issue regarding the report by the Climate Working Group (CWG) to the Secretary of Energy. TWTW continues with the fourth and final discussion of key issues in the report. Then, it presents comments from physicists Richard Lindzen and William Happer to the CWG. TWTW then counters some unfavorable comments by some “leading scientists” who have no expertise in the field of atomic/molecular/optical (AMO) physics that pertains to the greenhouse effect.

*********************

Effective Criticism: According to Roger Pielke, Jr., the Climate Working Group (CWG) has been disbanded, and the Department of Energy (DOE) report will be withdrawn. It is the result of a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund and the Unition of Concerned Scientists claiming that the formation of the CWG violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). You know you are effective when your enemies become fierce.

The DOE is fighting the lawsuit, but to SEPP the issue is filing a scientifically based document to the EPA on the absurdity of the Endangerment Finding by September 22. Even though the entire CWG report is under a legal cloud, there is no reason why the work of the individuals and their references in the CWG cannot be cited. See link under Questioning the Orthodoxy.

*********************

Review of the Climate Working Group Report (Part 4): In previous weeks TWTW discussed a report to the Secretary of Energy from five independent scientists (John Christy, Ph.D. Judith Curry, Ph.D. Steven Koonin, Ph.D. Ross McKitrick, Ph.D., and Roy Spencer, Ph.D.) “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate.”

This week TWTW discusses Chapter 7 Changes in Sea Level and Chapter 8 Uncertainties in Climate Change Attributions. It will only touch on specific points in Part III Impacts on Ecosystems and Society and then present Concluding Thoughts.

The Chapter Summary for Changes in Sea Level states [Boldface added]:

[TITLE]Inside the Environmental Strategy Behind MSC Cruises’ Newest Ship:
[TEXT]
This sponsored content was created in collaboration with a Skift partner.

As cruising moves into its next chapter, sustainability is shaping the pace and direction of innovation across fleets and ports. Forward-thinking cruise operators are focusing on investment in new technology, ship design, and renewable fuels in making their sustainability commitments a reality.

For MSC Cruises, the center of gravity for this strategy is integrating innovation into its new ship designs. MSC World America, its newest and most advanced ship, demonstrates this commitment, as the ship is not only designed with the U.S. market top of mind but also integrates systems to support responsible travel. Built for LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) and future fuel compatibility, the vessel incorporates emission-reducing engines, shore power connectivity, and next-generation water treatment systems.

“MSC World America represents a major step in our sustainability journey,” said Linden Coppell, vice president of sustainability and ESG at MSC Cruises. “It’s one of the most energy-efficient cruise ships in the world, surpassing fuel efficiency requirements under the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Energy Efficiency Design Index.”

Designing for Performance

MSC World America is the cruise line’s first LNG-powered vessel to homeport in North America. The use of LNG enables the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20%, eliminates sulfur oxides and particulates, and cuts nitrogen oxides by up to 85%. The ship can also run on Bio-LNG and Synthetic Renewable LNG with no modifications needed to the ship or its engines. These renewable alternatives to conventional LNG can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions when produced and available at scale.

The ship carries an Advanced Wastewater Treatment System that meets the IMO’s “Baltic Standard,” the strictest standard for wastewater treatment in the maritime industry. This means wastewater is treated to a level that often exceeds municipal standards before being discharged. The ship can also generate a large share of its freshwater needs through onboard desalination, reducing the draw on local resources.

“We produce 87% of our freshwater needs through seawater desalination and back it up with conservation measures that cut overall consumption. This reduces pressure on the communities we visit, especially where water is scarce,” said Coppell

Solid waste management follows a reduce-reuse-recycle model across the voyage lifecycle. Led by the company’s onboard dedicated Environmental Compliance Officer, the waste management program segregates 41.5% of materials onboard so it’s ready for recycling.

Transforming Ports and Fleet Operations

On the port side, partnerships are key. Collaboration between the city, utilities, and cruise lines at PortMiami has delivered shore power across several terminals, including dedicated shore power at the MSC Cruises terminal, where MSC World America and the rest of the fleet can plug in and switch off their engines while docked. Today, 18 out of 23 of the company’s ships and all Explora Journeys ships, the company’s new luxury brand, can already plug in, with upgrades due to bring that number to 19 in the cruise division by the end of 2025.

“Sustainability in cruising doesn’t start and stop with the ship — it extends to every port we call on and every community we engage with. Our partnerships with ports and cities are important to us, and we take a collaborative approach to ensure we’re advancing together,” said Coppell.

The cruise line is also using digital tools to improve daily operations. Systems like OptiCruise, which optimizes itineraries and sailing speeds, and Oceanly Performance, which monitors energy use in real time, allow crews to adjust routes, engine loads, and hotel systems while at sea, with constant support from its onshore teams who also have complete access to this data. These tools helped the company save

[TITLE]Drought expected to continue through autumn despite recent rain:
[TEXT]
The National Drought Group has warned today (Monday 15 September) that the current drought is far from over despite the recent rain.

Even with the wet weather at the end of the month, August’s rainfall was just 42% of its long-term average and the summer has been declared the hottest since records began in 1884.

Five areas remain in drought, with more areas likely to declare drought status within the next few weeks, as groundwater and reservoir levels across England continue to recede.

A lack of rainfall has impacted harvests, navigation, and seen restrictions in the form of several hosepipe bans.

It also has a significant impact on the breeding pattern of some animals, as well as peatlands drying out and at least 3,000 hectares of SSSI land (Sites of Special Scientific Interest) destroyed by wildfire.

Today’s meeting of the NDG heard some key impacts:

Approximately 20% of the Canal & River Trust network is closed because of low water levels, concentrated mainly but not exclusively across northern and central England. This compares with 15% in 2022. Around 400 miles of the network is affected.

Some reservoirs that feed several canals run by the Canal & River Trust, including sections of the Grand Union, Leeds & Liverpool, Peak Forest, Oxford and Macclesfield are critically low. Peak Forest & Macclesfield group holdings are just 11.1% full.

The dry weather has seen an early harvest season with generally lower and poorer quality crop yields.

Reservoirs fell by 1.4% last week. They are now 56.1% full on average across England. The average for this time of year is 82.8%.

The lowest reservoirs are the Pennines group (29%), Yorkshire stocks (30.3%) and Ardingly (34.1%)

Latest dry weather information here: Dry weather and drought in England: summary reports - GOV.UK

A drought is only over when groundwater, river and reservoir levels are fully replenished, and experts have warned it will take a wet autumn and winter to reverse the impacts of seven continuous months of below average rainfall. This means flooding during a drought is possible, including flash floods as dry soils struggle to soak up intense downpours.

Alan Lovell, Chair of the Environment Agency, said:

While we have seen some recent rain, it is nowhere near enough to reverse the impact of the last seven months, which have been the driest since 1976. The environment bears the brunt of this lack of rainfall, and this summer we have seen widespread impacts from low river levels, fish needing to be rescued, and wildfires. We are calling on everyone to continue to take simple steps to reduce their water use and are grateful to people for following the restrictions imposed by water companies. By saving water, we all leave more water in the environment.

Water is finite and there are competing demands between public use, businesses, agriculture, and the environment. During drought, water still needs to be abstracted from rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater but summer rainfall typically doesn’t replenish these sources.

The NDG - which includes the Met Office, government, regulators, water companies, the National Farmers’ Union, Canal & River Trust, anglers, and conservation experts - praised the public for helping to reduce their own water use. Lowering water use means less needs to be taken from local rivers and lakes, therefore protecting the health of our waterways and wildlife.

Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Will Lang, said:

The top five warmest UK summers on record have all occurred since 2000, with summer 2025 now officially the hottest. High pressure dominated throughout the season, bringing persistent warmth, below-average rainfall, and drought conditions for many areas. Looking ahead, while the longer-range forecast suggests a trend towards wetter-than-average conditions, rainfall is expected to vary significantly across regions, with more rain expected to western and northern parts of the UK, while eastern and southern areas may remain drier. Importantly, even with the overall signal for wetter weather, and the chance for flooding in some places, this does not guarantee that current drought conditions will ease consistently across the country. Drought conditions and the potential for flooding can occur at the same time in different parts of the UK, such is the nature of our climate.

The current water shortfall situation in England has been defined as a ‘nationally significant incident’ based on the number of areas affected and the impacts being seen in the environment.

Natural England addressed today’s group, noting:

Eighty-three SSSI sites have reported fires so far, including Dartmoor and the North Yorkshire Moors that saw more than 500 hectares burnt.

Lower water levels, and a lack of rainfall to top up spawning pools, are significantly impacting the breeding success of species such as natterjack toads and Atlantic salmon.

As well as dehydration, garden animals - including hedgehogs and birds - are struggling with a lack of insects to eat because of the dry soils.

Wetland birds, such as shoveler duck and curlew, are facing decline because of a loss of wetland and open water habitat in drought.

Dr Tony Juniper, Chair of Natural England, said:

Drought conditions are having a catastrophic effect on our flora and fauna, which lasts long after rain returns. Some Atlantic salmon streams have dried up and there are declining populations of wetland birds and amphibians. Garden animals such as hedgehogs are dying because their insect-based food sources disappear during drought. Many farmers have really suffered this year because of drought, following a year when they were hit by extremely wet weather. As the impacts of climate change ramp up we will experience more of these kinds of extremes. We need to take action now to make our landscapes more resilient, including through the creation of more wetlands to help cope with the effects of both drought and flood.

The Environment Agency continues to work with Government, including Defra and the Cabinet Office, on the drought response.

It is also conducting more compliance checks on businesses who abstract water from the environment, has increased monitoring of water levels, and continues to work with farmers on water conservation.

The regulator is actively engaging with water companies on requests for drought permits and drought orders – meaning water is diverted from the environment to secure public supplies.

The EA expects all water companies to follow their statutory drought plans, which can include Temporary Use Bans (TUBs) aka hosepipe bans. Yorkshire Water has a Temporary Use Ban (TUB aka hosepipe ban) in place for all its customers. Thames, South East Water, and Southern Water have postcode-specific bans.

eNGO Waterwise used the meeting to reveal new joint research into public attitudes towards hosepipe bans – noting more than two-thirds of the public (70%) are in favour when it’s hot, dry, and sunny, with just 11 percent against.

The meeting also heard updates from the water companies and steps they are taking to conserve supplies.

Water Minister Emma Hardy said:

This year’s weather has been severe for our environment, and we are working with the National Drought Group to mitigate the impacts of this. Water companies must continue to follow their drought plans to secure water supplies - I will hold them to account if they don’t. We face a growing water shortage in the next decade and are pushing ahead with urgent reforms under our Plan for Change, including nine new reservoirs to help secure supplies.

NDG PARTNER QUOTES:

Mark Owen, Head of Fisheries at the Angling Trust, said:

Since we started feeling the impacts of drought at the beginning of March, we have seen a range of impacts on fish in rivers and still waters. Elevated temperatures and reduced oxygen have caused fish kills in still waters, while low flows on rivers have impacted migratory fish - such as salmon and sea trout - because they have not been able to move into their spawning areas. This has made them vulnerable both from predation and the impacts of low dissolved oxygen. Whilst it’s too early to say, we are concerned that this will have an adverse impact on reproduction this year and, given the endangered status of salmon, this is a concern for further fish stocks. There have been wider impacts on wildlife with the increase in wildfires impacting on habitats, decrease in capacity to store water and degradation of soils particularly in upland areas. Dried out wetlands have adversely impacted on wading birds during the nesting season.

Dr Mark Roberts, Water Management Specialist at the National Trust, said:

This year’s drought has left a clear mark on nature. Dried-up springs in the Lake District have impacted water supplies and depleted water bodies have caused the death of fish. Both our newly planted and ancient trees have struggled since early spring, with usually lush flower borders in our gardens showing real signs of stress, hampering their ability to provide food and shelter for a variety of insects including bees and amphibians such as frogs. Using our new internal app to monitor the impact of weather on National Trust places, we’ve already recorded over 40 environmental impacts since May. This is helping to give us vital data to understand where and how nature is struggling so we can begin to act earlier in the drought cycle to protect wildlife and habitats. However, with long periods of low rainfall likely to become the new ‘norm’, we desperately need more tools such as early warning systems that enable the wider public to help protect nature by making informed decisions about saving water at home.

Nicci Russell, CEO of Waterwise, said:

We surveyed more than 2,000 people across the UK at the end of August and found more than two-thirds of the public agree that during hot dry and sunny conditions it’s right to ask people not to use a hosepipe. Just 11 percent disagreed, showing that most people are supportive of restrictions when necessary. The majority of people (70 percent) are taking action to save water and there is a growing recognition that, without action, we could run out. Nothing happens without water, and we all have a part to play to help beat the current drought.

NOTES TO EDITORS:

HOW TO SAVE WATER AT HOME:

Install a rain butt to collect rainwater to use in the garden.

When it’s dry and hot, use water from the kitchen to water your plants.

Avoid watering your lawn – brown grass will grow back healthy.

Turn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving.

Take shorter showers.

Fix a leaking toilet – leaky loos can waste 200-400 litres a day.

Quote of the Week: “Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels…If it is consensus, it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus.” — Michael Crichton, Aliens Cause Global Warming, Caltech Michelin Lecture (Jan. 17, 2003) [H/t Richard Lindzen and William Happer]

Number of the Week: Minus 112°F (-80°C)

THIS WEEK:

By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)

Scope: TWTW begins with a third discussion of key issues in the report by the Climate Working Group to the Secretary of Energy. Then, it presents comments from physicists Richard Lindzen and William Happer to the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. TWTW concludes with a comment that the committee on the Endangerment Finding of the National Academies might be biased.

*********************

Review of the Climate Working Group Report (Part 3): In previous weeks TWTW has discussed a report to the Secretary of Energy from five independent scientists (John Christy, Ph.D. Judith Curry, Ph.D. Steven Koonin, Ph.D. Ross McKitrick, Ph.D., and Roy Spencer, Ph.D.) “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate.” TWTW has covered the Secretary’s Forward, the Executive Summary, the Preface, Part I: Direct Human Influence on Ecosystems and the Climate and Chapter 4 of Part II: Climate Response to CO2 Emissions. This TWTW will cover Chapter 5 Discrepancies Between Models and Instrumental Observations and Chapter 6 Extreme Weather.

The Summary and the Introduction for Chapter 5 Discrepancies Between Models and Instrumental Observations state [Boldface added, Figures are not shown here]:

“Climate models show warming biases in many aspects of their reproduction of the past several decades. In response to estimated changes in forcing they produce too much warming at the surface (except in the models with lowest ECS), too much warming in the lower-and mid-troposphere and too much amplification of warming aloft.

Climate models also produce too much recent stratospheric cooling, invalid hemispheric albedos, too much snow loss, and too much warming in the Corn Belt. The IPCC has acknowledged some of these issues but not all.

5.1 Introduction

Climate models are the primary tool used to project future climate changes in response to increasing atmospheric levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. To assess the fitness of climate models for this purpose, it is reasonable to ask how well they reproduce the current climate and its variations over the past century. The box “Climate modeling” gives some detail on how climate models work.

Of great concern is the fact that, after several decades of the climate modeling enterprise involving approximately three dozen models operated by research centers around the world, the range of future warming they produce in response to a hypothetical doubling of atmospheric CO2 extends over a factor of three, as we discussed in the previous chapter. This range of disagreement among models has not decreased for decades.

Problems with climate models are not just in their disagreement over the future, but also in their ability to replicate the recent past. Here we review some of the most important metrics of climate model accuracy: ability to reproduce historical surface, tropospheric and stratospheric temperature trends; ability to reproduce the vertical warming profile; and ability to reproduce other climate features such as snowfall. In all cases a persistent finding is that models on average err on the side of too much warming in response to estimated historical forcing.”

In a special Box the authors discuss climate and the results of climate models. The Box states [Boldface added]:

“BOX: Climate modeling

All but the simplest climate models represent Earth’s land surface using a grid of squares some 100 km [62 miles] wide. To simulate the atmosphere, typically 30 or more grid boxes are stacked above these squares. The ocean is modeled using a similar but finer grid, resulting in tens of millions of grid boxes for the atmosphere and oceans.

The computer models, based on physical laws, calculate how air, water, and energy move between grid boxes over time. The time step can be as small as 10 minutes, and repeating this process millions of times allows the simulation of climate over centuries. Running these models, even on the most powerful supercomputers, can take months. Comparing simulation results with historical climate data helps assess the accuracy of a model, while projections into the future estimate climate changes under assumed human and natural influences.

Despite sounding straightforward, climate modeling is highly complex. Many critical processes occur at scales smaller than the grid size. For instance, the flows of sunlight and heat in the atmosphere depend strongly on cloud cover. Since tracking individual clouds is impractical, researchers must make “subgrid” assumptions
