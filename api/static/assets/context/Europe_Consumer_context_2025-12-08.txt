[TITLE]S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Ulta Beauty Pops; Netflix-Warner Bros. Deal Shakes Up Streaming Stocks:
[TEXT]
Key Takeaways Strong quarterly results boosted a beauty retailer on Friday, Dec. 5, 2025, while a massive buyout sent ripples across the streaming industry.

Netflix said it agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming business, sending Warner Bros. Discovery stock higher, while Netflix slid and rival suitor Paramount Skydance tumbled.

Ulta Beauty shares surged as a recent acquisition, new store openings, and resilient cosmetics demand helped drive better-than-expected earnings.

A strong quarterly report helped drive big gains for a retailer of make-up and other beauty products, while the end of a high-profile bidding war made waves in media and entertainment.

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher Friday after a key inflation report came in lower than anticipated, reinforcing expectations of an interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve meets next week. The S&P 500 and the Dow edged 0.2% higher to near their all-time highs, while the Nasdaq rose 0.3%. See here for more from Investopedia on the day's market moves.

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares surged nearly 13%, gaining the most of any S&P 500 stock, after the cosmetics retailer reported better-than-expected earnings and hiked its full-year forecasts. The beauty category has seen resilient demand even as economic uncertainty weighs on other retail segments. An increase in transactions and average ticket values from a year ago, along with the acquisition of British luxury cosmetics firm Space NK, and new store openings helped drive Ulta's strong performance.

Moderna (MRNA), which derives the bulk of its revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine, saw its stock jumped close to 9% following the release of a long-term study in France indicating that the vaccine is safe and effective. The nationwide study reviewed data from around 28 million people and determined that those who received the Moderna or Pfizer (PFE) vaccine had an approximately 75% lower risk of dying from COVID-19 compared with those who were unvaccinated. Pfizer shares climbed

[TITLE]General Mills, Inc. (GIS): A Bull Case Theory:
[TEXT]
We came across a bullish thesis on General Mills, Inc. on The Analyst's Journal’s Substack by A_Capital. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GIS. General Mills, Inc.'s share was trading at $47.07 as of December 1st. GIS’s trailing and forward P/E were 8.90 and 12.90 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

General Mills (GIS) represents a compelling contrarian value opportunity in the consumer staples sector, trading roughly 46% below its historical peak despite stable profitability, strong cash generation, and a portfolio of iconic brands. The company operates across five segments—North America Retail, Convenience Stores & Foodservice, Europe & Australia, Asia & Latin America, and Pet—with the Blue Buffalo acquisition anchoring a high-growth pet food segment.

GIS benefits from strong brand equity, scale advantages, category leadership in cereals, refrigerated dough, and super-premium ice cream, and geographic diversification, though it faces mature core categories, private label pressure, innovation challenges, and leverage from acquisitions. The investment case is underpinned by multiple growth and operational catalysts. The pet food segment offers mid-to-high single-digit organic growth, while international expansion, health and wellness repositioning, and e-commerce acceleration provide additional upside.

The Holistic Margin Management (HMM) program targets cost optimization, and strategic portfolio actions could unlock further value. Free cash flow remains robust at approximately $2.1 billion, supporting a 4%+ dividend yield and providing flexibility for deleveraging and potential share repurchases. Financial discipline is evident through controlled capex, debt reduction, and stable operating margins, which have expanded to 21.9% despite declining revenues.

Valuation is attractive, with GIS trading at 10–12x earnings and high-single-digit FCF yields, providing downside protection and a foundation for potential multiple expansion. Base-case expectations point to 25–35% total returns over 2–3 years, driven by margin improvement, revenue stabilization, deleveraging, and dividend support, while a bull scenario could deliver 40–50% upside through accelerated pet food growth, portfolio optimization, and sector rerating.

While risks include persistent category decline, private label competition, and execution challenges, the combination of income generation, cash flow stability, and contrarian valuation creates an asymmetric risk-reward opportunity for patient, value-oriented investors. GIS merits a BUY rating with a 24–36-month investment horizon.

[TITLE]JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Says Europe Has a ‘Real Problem’:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called out slow bureaucracy in Europe in a warning that a “weak” continent poses a major economic risk to the US.

“Europe has a real problem,” Dimon said Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum. “They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”

While he praised some European leaders who he said were aware of the issues, he cautioned politics is “really hard.”

Dimon, leader of the biggest US bank, has long said that the risk of a fragmented Europe is among the major challenges facing the world. In his letter to shareholders released earlier this year, he said that Europe has “some serious issues to fix.”

On Saturday, he praised the creation of the euro and Europe’s push for peace. But he warned that a reduction in military efforts and challenges trying to reach agreement within the European Union are threatening the continent.

“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore,” Dimon said. “It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important.”

He said the US should help.

“We need a long-term strategy to help them become strong,” Dimon said. “A weak Europe is bad for us.”

The administration of President Donald Trump issued a new national security strategy that directed US interests toward the Western Hemisphere and protection of the homeland while dismissing Europe as a continent headed toward “civilizational erasure.”

JPMorgan has been ramping up its push to spur more investments in the national defense sector. In October, the bank announced that it would funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next 10 years — as much as $500 billion more than what it would’ve provided anyway.

Dimon said in the statement that it’s “painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing.”

Investment banker Jay Horine oversees the effort, which Dimon called “100% commercial.” It will focus on four areas: supply chain and advanced manufacturing; defense and aerospace; energy independence and resilience; and frontier and strategic technologies.

The bank will also invest as much as $10 billion of its own capital to help certain companies expand, innovate or accelerate strategic manufacturing.

Separately on Saturday, Dimon praised Trump for finding ways to roll back bureaucracy in the government.

“There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America,” Dimon said. “That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that.”

[TITLE]This 5-Step Budgeting Plan Can Protect You From a Recession:
[TEXT]
Key Takeaways Stay in control of your finances by creating a budget and adjusting it as needed.

Build a healthy emergency fund, which is crucial to avoiding high-interest debt in the event of an unexpected expense.

Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risk in the event of an economic downturn.

Develop multiple income streams to create financial stability and help cushion you against job loss or reduced hours.

Choose a financial institution with low fees, strong customer support, and insurance against custody-firm failure.

Bolstering your financial security ahead of a recession can save you from financial disaster. Here's a five-step plan to recession-proof your finances.

1. Create a Budget and Stick to It

Creating a budget starts with tracking all of your income and expenses. You can use budgeting apps or a spreadsheet. By categorizing expenses into needs vs. wants, you can identify expenditures that are easiest to cut if your income drops (such as unused subscriptions, dining out, and vacations).

Be sure to review your budget monthly so you can track every dollar. Make any necessary adjustments based on changes in your income, current inflation, or surprise expenses.

2. Build an Emergency Fund

As a rule of thumb, it’s best to save three to six months’ worth of monthly expenses in liquid cash for a healthy emergency fund. If you're the one who brings in more income to your home and you have a spouse, child, and mortgage, aim for 6+ months of emergency savings.

Park your emergency fund in a high-yield savings account to earn interest along the way. This can serve as a financial lifeline in a recession.

Start with a mini-goal of $500 to $1,000 to build momentum, and then scale your goal upwards. By starting small, you can avoid getting overwhelmed. This will help you stay on track to hit bigger savings goals.

Consider setting up automatic transfers from your checking account. You can align automatic transfers with your payday—this way, the money gets transferred right away, and your savings will grow on autopilot.

Fast Fact According to the Federal Reserve, in 2024, over a third (37%) of American adults couldn’t cover a $400 emergency expense with cash or its equivalent.

3. Diversify Your Investments

Investing in low-cost index funds, bonds, and ETFs can help you diversify your savings and mitigate risk. If you think the economy is headed toward a recession, it’s a good idea to reassess your asset allocation, boost your diversification, and cut back your weighting in investments that are likely to be more volatile.

In the long-term investment portion of your portfolio, it’s crucial to avoid panic-selling. The stock market may experience dips and volatility at times. However, focusing on a consistent investment strategy in the long-term portion of your portfolio historically leads to the best financial outcome.

4. Create Multiple Streams of Income

Developing multiple income streams can boost your budget and help you stay afloat in a recession. Start by identifying ways to monetize an existing skill or hobby, freelancing in your field, tutoring kids, or picking up a gig such as rideshare driving or food delivery.

At the same time, invest in dividend-yielding stocks with a strong history of growth to create a passive income stream, which can supplement your earned income.

Diversifying income streams also reduces dependency on a single employer. That’s helpful if you get laid off from your 9-to-5 job and you don’t already have one or more side hustles or passive income streams in place. You might find yourself scrambling to find new work quickly to avoid burning through your emergency fund or drowning in credit card debt to cover your expenses.

5. Make Sure Your Financial Institution Is on Your Side

Using the right bank or financial institution can be a big help during a recession. Find a bank or credit union with low fees, user-friendly tools, and good interest rates for savings accounts, all of which may help you save money.

Another option is to switch to an online bank that offers higher interest rates (which many banks refer to as annual percentage yields, or APYs for short) and budgeting tools. Some tools to look for include real-time transaction and fraud alerts, automatic savings transfers, and responsive customer service.

Lastly, be sure to verify that deposits in your institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which is especially important during a recession.

The Bottom Line

There are multiple strategies you can use to protect yourself against a recession. By creating a manageable budget, you can empower yourself to create and grow an emergency fund, diversify your investment portfolio, and add income streams. It's also important to find a financial institution that's FDIC or NCUA insured. Small steps today can lead to greater stability in the long term.

[TITLE]BasicNet Plans to Relocate Woolrich Corporate Employees to Turin, Trade Unions Push Back:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Less than a month after BasicNet acquired Woolrich from Luxembourg-based fund L-Gam in a deal that valued the storied outerwear player at 90 million euros, the new owner is facing a dispute with trade unions.

The latter are claiming that the company has decided to shut corporate operations in Bologna and Milan, where Woolrich employs 109 and 30 workers, respectively, leaving them with no other option than accept a relocation to the BasicNet headquarters in Turin to avoid being laid off.

The move would not affect retail employees in those cities, where Woolrich operates two of its 25 flagships in Europe.

BasicNet’s portfolio of brands also comprises Kappa, Robe di Kappa, K-Way, Superga, Sebago and Briko, in addition to Woolrich and beachwear specialist Sundek. The latter’s acquisition was revealed Thursday.

On Friday, BasicNet issued a statement clarifying its position, saying that “this is not a closure, but rather a strategic move aimed at revitalizing the brand and ensuring job continuity. The decision to move the headquarters and its employees to Turin is designed to strengthen Woolrich’s brand value by investing in a central hub that can support future growth and create beneficial synergies.”

The company said it is committed to safeguarding jobs and will resort to any available welfare measure to ensure a smooth transition for employees unable to relocate to Turin.

“People are the heart of the company, and we are excited to welcome all employees into the big BasicNet family,” said Alessandro Boglione, co-chief executive officer of BasicNet, in the statement. “We are committed to following all the right procedures, which is why we are working closely with trade unions to provide clear and timely answers to employees who have sought clarity.”

“We hope to find shared solutions quickly so we can provide certainty and ensure the transition respects everyone involved,” added Lorenzo Boglione, co-CEO of the company.

The BasicNet transaction, revealed in November, involved the acquisition through a wholly owned subsidiary of the rights to the Woolrich brand for Europe and 100 percent of Woolrich Europe SpA, the company managing its distribution and retail activities. Its revenues for fiscal year 2025 are expected to be around 90 million euros.

Through the deal L-Gam exited Woolrich seven years after acquiring the brand in 2018 from its former owner, WP Lavori in Corso. Last December L-Gam forged a deal with Chinese apparel group Baoxiniao Holding Co. Ltd., which acquired Woolrich’s intellectual property rights for all territories outside Europe.

Woolrich was founded in 1830 by John Rich in Pennsylvania, and is one of the oldest American producers of wool fabrics and outdoor clothing. The company was created to provide durable and functional garments for hunters, lumberjacks and railway workers.

In 1850, Woolrich introduced its signature Buffalo red and black check pattern. In 1940, responding to the needs of workers building oil pipelines in Alaska, the Arctic Parka was born — designed to withstand extreme temperatures and another signature garment for the brand.

The Woolrich Arctic Parka. courtesy image

BasicNet was founded by Lorenzo and Alessandro Boglione’s father, Marco Boglione, who created the group in 1994 as a marketplace and publicly listed it on the Milan Stock Exchange in 1999.

Stemming from the storied traditional clothing company Maglificio Calzificio Torinese, which was founded in 1916, BasicNet doesn’t produce or distribute the collections of its brands. Billing itself as a “fully web-integrated company” through a digitally advanced platform, it acts as a marketplace where manufacturers and distributors meet to do business.

In particular, BasicNet designs and develops its labels’ collections, signs licensing agreements with international producers and distributors, which receive from BasicNet all they need to manufacture and sell the products, from research and development to global marketing.

Delivered Net Sales of $1.472 Billion, a 9% Increase Versus Prior Year, Exceeding Expectations

Operating Results and Earnings Exceed Expectations

We delivered robust adjusted gross margin expansion of 170 basis points, driven by a reduced promotional approach and higher regular-priced selling, while leveraging the strength of our business model. We remain focused on managing costs while prioritizing investments in product innovation, brand strength, and customer experience.

[TITLE]PVH Stock Drops 11.8% as Wall Street Waits for Fundamentals to Improve:
[TEXT]
Updated 4:13 p.m. ET Dec. 4

Wall Street is still waiting for PVH Corp. to take off.

Shares of the company fell 11.8 percent to $77.21 on Thursday, after the company beat its third-quarter earnings estimates, but didn’t raise its outlook for the year, signaling that business will be spread out between the two quarters.

“PVH shares look cheap, but they sure aren’t making it easy for value investors to step in,” said Tom Nikic, an analyst at Needham. “Trends continue to be very volatile.”

The Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent company saw third-quarter revenues increase 2 percent to $2.3 billion, making for a drop of less than 1 percent in constant currencies. PVH expects revenues to be flat to slightly positive for the year, in constant currencies.

Nikic zeroed in on the company’s “negative inflection” in the Europe, Middle East and Africa division, which trended down 2 percent in constant currencies.

“This was expected to be one of the growth drivers of the business following last year’s reset of the market — a gross margin miss didn’t help either,” the analyst said. “We continue to believe that shares are too cheap, particularly since they can probably buy back a high-single-digit percent of the float annually at these levels, if not more.

“Third-quarter gross margin was down 200 basis points, missing guidance by 25 basis points, driven by tariffs (110 basis point negative impact), the impact of bringing licenses in-house (50 basis points) and higher promotional mix, partially due to the … Calvin Klein product shipment delays,” he said.

PVH has been busy taking back licenses for its North American wholesale business from G-III Apparel Group, absorbing some of the businesses and finding other licensees for some categories, including dresses.

In conjunction with that take-back, the company set up a “global product kitchen” for Calvin Klein in New York, a complicated switch that had an uneven start.

Stefan Larsson, chief executive officer, told analysts on a conference call Thursday that the “delays from the transitory Calvin global product challenges put extra strain on our European distribution center, impacting shipments for both Calvin and Tommy, which made us lose a few critical weeks of full-price selling.”

But Larsson, who’s been busy remaking the company since stepping into the corner office in 2021, suggested it was growing pains the company was feeling.

“We are on track both from on-time delivery coming into spring ’26 and the margin recapture that we set out to take back. On both fronts, we are on track, which is really good,” he said. “It’s painful now, but we had to do it because in order to build premium products, differentiated product franchises with innovation, we need the global capability to do that. And now we have it for both Calvin and Tommy. And so do all of our best competitors in the premium space also have it. But we had to build that. And now you start to see it.”

But Wall Street is still waiting.

Matthew Boss, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said: “While we see multiyear brand ‘unlock’ underway with the new leadership team focused on driving increased desirability of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands through improved product design and marketing, we see an elongated path to reaching management’s mid-teens operating margin target given a slower top-line recovery with continued macroeconomic challenges globally, in addition to a competitive external promotional backdrop, and foreign exchange pressures.”

This year, PVH expects its adjusted operating margin to come in at about 8.5 percent.

[TITLE]Global luxury apparel market to rebound slowly after 2024 setback – analysis:
[TEXT]
Louis Vuitton remained the largest luxury apparel brand in 2024, increasing its market share to 9.8%. Credit: Peter_Fleming/Shutterstock.

The global luxury apparel market will undergo a gradual recovery after a 2.4% contraction in 2024, analysis indicates.

According to GlobalData Global Luxury Apparel Market to 2029 report, growth will return in 2025, but it is expected to be largely fuelled by price increases rather than higher sales volumes.

Macro pressures including inflation across Europe and the US and a sharp slowdown in China dented consumer spending last year, producing the market’s first material setback in several years. GlobalData’s report forecasts that the sector will grow by 2.0% in 2025 as brands raise prices to protect margins, even as volumes continue to decline.

Over the 2024–29 period, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of 2.8% and to begin outperforming the broader apparel market from 2028 as the finances of aspirational shoppers improve.

Clothing is projected to be the strongest category through 2029, with a 3.1% CAGR driven by ultra-wealthy consumers who remain willing to spend on trend-led pieces; womenswear is expected to outperform menswear. Accessories – led by luxury handbags as enduring status symbols – should record a 2.9% CAGR. Footwear looks set to be the weakest area, with a modest 1.0% CAGR, as strong demand for trainers from premium and mass-market specialists limits growth for high-end shoe categories.

Asia-Pacific will be the growth engine, posting the strongest regional CAGR of 4.0% between 2024 and 2029, supported by the recovery of China and robust growth in emerging Asian markets. In contrast, Europe and the Americas are forecast to experience softer growth – 1.8% and 1.5% CAGRs respectively – hampered by sluggish economies and the lingering effects of US tariffs. The Middle East and Africa will increase its share of the global market, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates benefiting from tourism and strong domestic spending.

Luxury heavyweights retained power in 2024. Louis Vuitton remained the largest apparel brand, increasing its market share to 9.8%. Hermès was the standout performer, expanding share by 0.7 percentage points to 6.0% as its exclusivity and craftsmanship held strong appeal among the ultra-wealthy. Chanel also gained share, largely through strategic price increases. By contrast, brands such as Gucci and Burberry lost ground amid unclear positioning and weaker product offerings.

Luxury apparel rebound drivers

Several structural factors underpin the recovery outlook. Ultra-wealthy customers continue to provide a stabilising base for top-tier luxury houses, maintaining demand and preserving brand equity. Meanwhile, improvements in broader macroeconomic conditions and rising consumer confidence should gradually bring back aspirational shoppers – the expanding middle and upper-middle segments whose purchasing power was most affected during the downturn.

Social media and influencer marketing are playing an increasingly important role in engaging younger buyers. Luxury brands are courting content creators and leaning into platforms such as Instagram and TikTok to capture Gen Z’s appetite for luxury. Collaborations with celebrities, entertainment franchises and other brands continue to deliver cultural moments that drive excitement and sales.

At the same time, the booming resale market presents both opportunity and challenge. Resale apparel is expected to grow sharply – by nearly 48% between 2024 and 2028 – with luxury items particularly coveted as more affordable options. Some houses have partnered with resale platforms to reclaim share, but secondhand channels remain a threat to full-price sales, especially among budget-conscious aspirational shoppers.

China’s 2024 slowdown – driven in part by its real estate crisis – hit the market hard, and while stimulus should support a recovery in 2025, Chinese shoppers are likely to remain cautious, amplified by government messaging discouraging ostentatious displays of wealth. Online luxury retail also faces challenges: the collapse of major multi-brand platforms in 2024 has reinforced the importance of brick-and-mortar boutiques, where premium service and in-store experience are key to selling high-priced items.
