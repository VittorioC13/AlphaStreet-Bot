Australia’s green energy shift triggers blackout warnings as coal plant closures outpace grid stability

Australia's rapid shift from coal to renewables risks nationwide blackouts.

A government report warns the grid will lack critical stability after a major coal plant closes.

Essential stabilizing equipment may not be ready in time, leaving a dangerous gap.

Politicians from both major parties admit to a decade of failed energy planning.

This crisis serves as a global warning against shutting reliable power before replacements are ready.

Australia’s rush to replace reliable coal-fired power with volatile renewable energy is setting the stage for potential nationwide blackouts, according to a sobering new government report. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) warns that the planned closure of the nation’s largest coal plant, Eraring in New South Wales, could create critical gaps in grid stability as early as 2027, leaving millions of households and businesses vulnerable to power outages. This crisis exposes the fatal flaw in the green energy transition: prioritizing ideology over engineering reality.

The report, AEMO’s 2025 Transition Plan for System Security, outlines "confirmed system strength deficits" for Victoria and New South Wales if the Eraring plant closes on its current schedule. The shortfall isn't

[TITLE]Oil Closes Up as Peace Deal Falls Short:
[TEXT]
Oil edged up after a fresh round of US-Russia talks failed to reach a deal to end Moscow's war in Ukraine, boosting fears that restrictions on Russian oil supply could remain in place for longer.

West Texas Intermediate rose 0.5% to settle near $59, remaining within the tight range prices have been stuck in this week. The Kremlin says talks with a US delegation led by US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were "constructive," but no deal was made to end the Ukraine war.

The talks took place against a backdrop of recent attacks on Russia-linked tankers, with at least one ship manager saying it would stop sending vessels to the country. A deal to end Russia's war in Ukraine could mean the end of sanctions on Russian oil in a market already staring down concerns

[TITLE]Brazil’s Oil Sector Rallies Against Oilfield Services Merger Plan:
[TEXT]
Oil majors in Brazil have decided they’ve seen enough of the proposed Subsea7–Saipem tie-up, and they’re pushing antitrust regulator Cade to slow it down or break it up. The merger, announced earlier this year, would create a new oilfield services deepwater heavyweight called Saipem7 — a company large enough to matter in any basin, but especially in Brazil, where subsea contractors are already a small club.

Cade has now asked both firms for fresh data, saying it still doesn’t have the information it needs to assess the deal. That request landed shortly after IBP — the industry group representing Brazil’s majors — warned that a combined Subsea7–Saipem could raise costs, delay projects, and lean on operators to sign long, exclusive contracts. In other words, the exact behavior regulators are supposed to prevent.

TotalEnergies went further, filing a study arguing that no set of remedies could fully offset the competitive risks. According to Total, the merged firm would control eight of the twelve ships worldwide capable of handling the toughest SURF work — the subsea umbilicals, risers, and flowlines essential for Brazil’s ultra-deepwater fields. Exxon also raised flags, and Petrobras joined the chorus asking Cade to either block the deal outright or force asset sales.

The scale is hard to ignore. Saipem7 would launch with a €43 billion backlog and about €21 billion in annual revenue. And while the two companies insist the merger is on track for late 2026, Cade is clearly taking its time — meeting not only with operators in Brazil but with regulators in the U.S., U.K., and Mozambique. The U.K. has already approved the deal; Brazil is shaping up to be the real test.

It’s a familiar story, really. The consolidation in oilfield services accelerates, offshore activity rebounds, and operators remember why they are not keen on concentrated supplier power.

[TITLE]UK Windfall Tax Puts $20 Billion in North Sea Oil Investment at Risk:
[TEXT]
The UK government’s decision to keep the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators could wipe out as much as $20 billion (£15 billion) of potential investment in Britain’s offshore oil and gas output, according to a Wood Mackenzie estimate cited by the Financial Times.

The government last week kept the windfall tax on operators in the Budget, dealing a blow to the industry.

Keeping the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), as the windfall tax is officially known since it was first introduced by a Conservative government at the height of the 2022 energy crisis, would wipe out all non-essential investment in the UK shelf, as it would compete with friendlier tax jurisdictions, according to WoodMac.

The UK has one of the highest tax rates of all major producing basins worldwide. Together with the windfall tax, which the government kept against industry calls for reform, operators are paying a massive 78% overall tax rate.

This has prompted many companies to halt investment in the UK and move to cut workforce numbers.

The latest announcement came from one of the top independent producers, Harbour Energy, which on Monday said it expects to reduce employee numbers by another 100, on top of 600 jobs already eliminated since 2023.

The industry slammed the government’s decision, arguing that the windfall tax will eventually bury the offshore oil and gas industry and threaten Britain’s energy security.

“The future of North Sea energy depends on investment, which won’t come without urgent reform of the windfall tax,” Offshore Energies UK Chief Executive, David Whitehouse, said in a statement.

“The government turned down £50 billion of investment for the UK and the chance to protect the jobs and industries that keep this country running. Instead, they’ve chosen a path that will see 1,000 jobs continue to be lost every month, more energy imports and a contagion across supply chains and our industrial heartlands,” Whitehouse added.

The Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce said it’s “Lights out for North Sea oil and gas as Chancellor keeps windfall tax.”

The Chamber’s chief executive, Russell Borthwick, commented that instead of heeding advice from industry, “the UK Government has instead opted for a cliff-edge end to North Sea production and to tax the industry to death inside five years. Jobs will be lost in their thousands as a direct result of this government’s failure to act.”

[TITLE]Nigeria Opens 50 Oil and Gas Blocks in $10 Billion Investment Push:
[TEXT]
Nigeria has tendered 50 oil and gas blocks, eyeing $10 billion in new investments over the next ten years and 400,000 barrels daily in additional production capacity, local media report.

The blocks on offer include 15 offshore deposits, 19 frontier fields, and one deepwater block, the head of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Gbenga Komolafe, said.

“The Commission understands that in today’s volatile global energy landscape, certainty and predictability have become the true currencies of investment,” Komolafe said, adding that “Through extensive multi-client surveys, the NUPRC has reprocessed thousands of kilometres of 2D and 3D seismic data, producing sharper, higher-resolution images of our petroleum systems and reducing uncertainties that once hindered exploration decisions.”

The oil commission first announced the tender in November, when Komolafe reviewed progress already made in the investment encouragement space. Since the start of this year, 46 field development plans have been approved, the active rig count has topped 60, and crude output has climbed to 1.71 million barrels per day, peaking at 1.83 million. The official also said recent final investment decisions—including $5 billion for Bonga North, $500 million for Ubeta Gas, and $2 billion for Shell’s HI Gas project—reflect renewed investor confidence in Nigeria’s oil and gas industry.

Lately, oil majors have been boosting their presence in Nigeria, in further evidence of progress on the part of the country’s government. Last week, Shell completed the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in Nigeria’s OML 118 Production Sharing Contract, raising its stake in the deep-water Bonga field from 55% to 65% and reinforcing its commitment to growing upstream output.

TotalEnergies, meanwhile, sold a 40% stake in two exploration licenses offshore Nigeria to Chevron, retaining another 40% in the acreage, remaining operator of the projects. A senior TotalEnergies executive said the tie-up with Chevron would derisk and develop new opportunities in the West African oil producer.

[TITLE]Europe strikes a deal to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027:
[TEXT]
Brussels Reuters —

The European Union agreed Wednesday to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decade-long dependency on Russian energy.

Representatives for EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement in the early hours of Wednesday on proposals set out by the European Commission in June to end shipments from the EU’s former top gas supplier following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move toward a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.

“Today, we are stopping these imports permanently,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement. “By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

For short-term contracts concluded before June 17 this year, the prohibition will apply from April 25, 2026, for LNG and from June 17, 2026, for pipeline gas.

For long-term contracts concluded before June 17, the cut-off dates will be the start of 2027 and the start of October 2026, with a possible one-month extension for EU members facing difficulties reaching required storage levels.

As of October, Russia accounted for 12% of EU gas imports, down from 45% before its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Hungary, France and Belgium among the countries still receiving supplies.

The European Commission is also committed to phasing out remaining oil imports from Russia by the end of 2027, with a legislative proposal to be presented early next year.

Under Wednesday’s agreement, EU members will submit “national diversification plans” regarding oil and gas supplies to the commission by March 1, and will be required to notify the EU executive whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national bans in place.

The commission will issue recommendations based on this feedback.

[TITLE]Global evidence on the income elasticity of willingness to pay, relative price changes and public natural capital values:
[TEXT]
Drupp, Moritz A., Turk, Zachary M., Groom, Ben ORCID: 0000-0003-0729-143X and Heckenhahn, Jonas (2025) Global evidence on the income elasticity of willingness to pay, relative price changes and public natural capital values. Environmental and Resource Economics. ISSN 0924-6460

Abstract

While the global economy continues to grow, ecosystem services tend to stagnate or decline. Economic theory has shown how such shifts in relative scarcities can be reflected in project appraisal and accounting, but empirical evidence has been sparse to put theory into practice. To estimate relative price changes (RPCs) for ecosystem services to be used for making such adjustments, we perform a global meta-analysis of contingent valuation studies to derive income elasticities of marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for ecosystem services to proxy the degree of limited substitutability. Based on 735 income-WTP pairs from 396 studies, we find an income elasticity of WTP of around 0.6. Combined with good-specific growth rates, we estimate an RPC of ecosystem services of around 1.7% per year. In an application to natural capital valuation of forest ecosystem services by the World Bank, we show that natural capital should be uplifted by around 40%. Our assessment of aggregate public natural capital yields a larger value adjustment of between 58 and 97%, depending on the discount rate. We discuss implications for policy appraisal and for estimates of natural capital in comprehensive wealth accounts.

[TITLE]Claim: “lack of long-term revenue certainty” is Crashing Aussie Renewable Investment.:
[TEXT]
Essay by Eric Worrall

Are renewables investors worried the subsidies could cease?

Australia could miss clean energy target as solar and wind investment slumps, investors warn Expert cautions large pipeline of potential projects will not deliver required energy capacity unless companies make final investments Graham Readfearn and Adam Morton

Mon 1 Dec 2025 19.22 AEDT … Clean Energy Regulator data shows the government agency expects 2.5GW of industry-scale renewable energy capacity to reach a final investment decision this year, down from 4GW last year. The 12-month average for investment commitments on new developments is at its lowest since early 2017.

… … chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, Richie Merzian, said the lower financial investment decisions were a “symptom of deep structural issues, not just a blip”. “The structural issues include state planning delays, grid connection uncertainty, transmission constraints, rising project costs and lack of long-term revenue certainty,” he said. Merzian said the underwriting program had helped to develop a large pipeline of potential projects, but that they would not deliver the new energy capacity needed unless companies made final investments. “The contrast between the large pipeline and the limited number reaching [financial investment decision] indicates a system that is not functioning as intended,” he said. … Read more: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/01/australia-could-miss-clean-energy-target-as-solar-and-wind-investment-slumps-investors-warn

[TITLE]Shareholder Frustration Kills Massive UK Renewable Infrastructure Fund Merger:
[TEXT]
HICL's portfolio includes UK infrastructure like the High Speed 1 rail link, while TRIG specializes in renewable assets across Britain and Europe, with both boards remaining convinced of the strategic rationale for the combination.

The deal was called off because HICL's board determined it could not proceed without substantial support from its own investors, who were reportedly frustrated with the terms.

HICL Infrastructure and The Renewables Infrastructure Group (TRIG) have abandoned their planned merger, which would have created the UK's largest infrastructure investment firm.

A plan to merge two FTSE-listed funds to form the UK’s largest infrastructure investment firm has been abandoned after shareholders expressed frustration with the terms of the deal.

HICL Infrastructure said it will no longer be proceeding with its planned merger with The Renewables Infrastructure Group (TRIG) after its board “determined that it cannot progress the transaction without a substantial majority of support from its own investors”.

“Both boards remain convinced of the strategic rationale for the combination,” HICL added.

As part of the terms of the deal, TRIG shareholders would have had the option of a partial cash exit of up to £250m in aggregate, representing approximately 11 per cent of TRIG’s share capital.

Assuming full take-up of the partial cash option, HICL shareholders were expected to hold 56 per cent, and TRIG shareholders 44 per cent, of the combined company.

But the deal, first announced on 17 November, attracted significant pushback from shareholders.

“We see multiple reasons for TRIG shareholders to be excited by the proposal, but fewer for HICL shareholders, where a liquidity opportunity is lacking despite a material shift in strategy and portfolio,” analysts at Peel Hunt said.

“Whilst we applaud the boards of both companies for working on a transformative transaction, we are concerned by the balance of incentives for each set of shareholders.”

TRIG shares fell 3.8 per cent to 71p following the announcement, while HICL shares rose 4.2 per cent to 118p.

Government and energy assets

HICL was listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange in 2006 and was originally set up to invest in infrastructure projects developed under the UK’s private finance initiative (PFI).

HICL’s portfolio includes a host of UK infrastructure assets such as the High Speed 1 rail link, the Westminster headquarters of the Home Office, The Northwood headquarters of the Ministry of Defence and Lewisham hospital.

TRIG, which was formed in 2013 to specialise in renewable infrastructure, operates a portfolio comprising stakes in several dozen wind and solar projects across Britain as well as further afield in Germany, France and Spain.

[TITLE]From Soaring Energy Prices to Climate Threat to AI Bubble, Experts Warn Against Data Center Buildout:
[TEXT]
As the construction of artificial intelligence data centers expands across the nation largely unregulated, experts warn that the unrestrained buildup of these facilities is causing electricity costs to skyrocket, accelerating the climate crisis, and putting the economy at risk.

A new report out Thursday from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen highlights the "unchecked expansion" of these data centers, often with little oversight, input from communities, or even financial responsibility on the part of the Big Tech firms profiting.

“We’re watching Big Tech overlords write their own rules in real time,” said Deanna Noël, Public Citizen's climate campaigns director and one of the report's authors. “Tech giants are cutting backroom deals with utilities and government officials to build massive data centers at breakneck speed, while passing the costs onto working families through higher electricity bills, polluted air and water, and false claims

[TITLE]California regulators prioritize keeping electric bills affordable over increasing utility shareholder profits:
[TEXT]
Energy bills have been on the rise across the nation — and California is no different. A recent study highlights a variety of factors impacting Californians electric costs, including increased costs to harden the system from wildfires and more investments in fixed-capital infrastructure.

Fortunately, energy regulators in California are poised to take two steps to address energy bill affordability, while still protecting the environment. The first is a critical decision on how energy utilities structure their profits, known as the “cost of capital”, and the second is a new set of rules focused on how California measures the affordability of utility services.

EDF projects that, by bringing shareholder profits in check, these actions could result in over $300 million in annual savings for Californians.

Step 1: Regulating utility shareholder profits

In the United States, investor-owned utilities are regulated in all aspects of their business, including the amount of profit their shareholders can earn. Therefore regulators determine an upper limit of authorized profit that a utility could earn. It is up to each individual state to determine what amount of utility shareholder profit is reasonable.

In California, regulators make this determination for the four largest energy utilities — Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), Southern California Edison Company (SCE), San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) — at once, since the investment climate is the same for them as a batch.

States have a large amount of discretion to figure out what amount of potential profit and overall capital structure makes the most sense for their energy utilities. Ideally, the regulator will ensure that the shareholder profit is just high enough to project confidence in the financial soundness of the utility to enable it to raise the money necessary to ensure safe and reliable service.

The goal of regulators should be to cover the big infrastructure needed by utilities, such as poles and wires, which are very expensive and customers will pay for over a long period of time. Regulators have to determine the return on both debt and equity, and how much of each the utility should have.

The determination on the return on equity and debt should also be commensurate with alternative investments of comparable risks. In essence, a utility regulator should look to other utilities and not to unrelated sectors to help make this determination.

The four largest energy utilities in California have all argued that they are a riskier investment when compared to their peers and therefore their shareholders were entitled to earn more profit. Amongst their rationales for being riskier was that California’s suite of clean energy policies (including the renewable portfolio standard, cap-and-invest and wildfires) make California a riskier place to do business.

Regulators rightly are rejecting this argument. In fact, in the context of the extensive set of legislative and regulatory actions in these areas, they are proposing that California has been overpaying shareholders and is going to cut the profit earning potential of each utility. This will ultimately result in lower energy costs for customers.

This overpayment is not a new phenomenon. Looking over the last twenty years, as demonstrated in the chart above, California’s investor owned utilities have been receiving a premium compared to the national average. And that national average itself is trending downwards.

In the last 12 months, there has been a noticeable downwards shift in utilities’ return on equity nationally. California’s regulators are proposing to follow this downward trend, and the cut to the authorized utility profits (their return on equity) will all be below 10% for the first time in a generation.

Utility Current Authorized Utility Profit

(Return on Equity) Proposed Authorized Utility Profit

(Return on Equity) Annual customer savings from this change PG&E 10.28% 9.93% $136,378,000 SCE 10.33% 9.98% $108,021,000 SDG&E 10.23% 9.88% $24,143,000 SoCalGas 10.08% 9.73% $34,408,000 Total $302,950,000

Proposed Customer Savings by Utility

This proposed action will save customers over $300 million of dollars annually, without compromising system safety and operations. Essentially, regulators are rejecting the utilities’ claim that the state’s progressive environmental agenda made the state a riskier place to do business and are choosing to put the needs of ratepayers first.

Step 2: Monitoring electric bill affordability

In addition to the work on the authorized capital structure, regulators are separately creating a new set of rules on tracking affordability. Regulators are ordering each utility to compile new annual reports on their overall bill affordability using updated metrics. The utilities must provide a broader context for how their customer bills stack up compared to other needs. This will also include new mapping tools where we can see affordability for all utility services in a geographic area.

This action will help address energy bill affordability by helping regulators monitor changes the utility goods services, including electricity, gas and water. Given that most customers prioritize paying a utility bill ahead of other basic needs such as food and medicine, these updated metrics will be a critical tool to ensure that energy services will remain affordable in the long run.

Next steps

There is still much more work that California regulators need to do to ensure that the state’s energy system is affordable, clean and safe. These two actions are critical interim steps and will continue to set the tone for years to come.
