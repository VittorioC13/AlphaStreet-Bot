[TITLE]The software companies most likely to be acquired as AI eats the world:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The threat of AI has sent shockwaves through the software sector, hammering share prices and creating, in the words of analysts at RBC Capital Markets, a rare opportunity for "opportunistic" buyers.

Once-high-flying software companies are now trading at deep discounts as investors worry about how generative AI could upend SaaS business models. That same anxiety, the analysts argue, is laying the groundwork for a new wave of dealmaking.

According to RBC, software M&A activity has surged 78% this year, with private-equity deal volume more than doubling as sponsors hunt for bargains.

"We continue to see software underperform on concerns around AI and as this underperformance drags on in spite of better-than-expected results, we may see more buyers opportunistically step in and take advantage of dislocations, particularly in private equity," the analysts wrote in a recent note to investors.

A chart showing software M&A activity RBC Capital Markets

While noting they have no knowledge of any such deals, the analysts listed potential targets, all of which have solid customer bases and cash flow but limited AI narratives. Private-equity buyers, less constrained by quarterly earnings pressure, could move quickly to take these companies private, reset expectations, and rebuild them for an AI-first world.

While regulatory scrutiny remains a hurdle for mega-cap tech acquirers, financial sponsors are freer to strike. RBC expects deal momentum to accelerate as sentiment stabilizes and valuations remain depressed. For investors, the AI scare that crushed software stocks might soon become the catalyst for a new consolidation boom, one driven not by hype, but by hard-nosed value hunting.

Here's RBC's view on which software companies are potential mergers and acquisitions targets and why:

Asana (ASAN): Under pressure amid rising AI-native competition and ongoing industry consolidation, the workplace and project management company remains a potential takeover target despite its founder-controlled voting structure.

Box (BOX): With growth stagnating and shares undervalued, the cloud content management company could attract private equity buyers seeking to reset expectations or strategic acquirers interested in its horizontal content platform.

Confluent (CFLT): Positioned attractively in the data streaming layer, Confluent could appeal to a strategic buyer seeking deeper data infrastructure capabilities.

Coursera (COUR): Despite headwinds in EdTech, Coursera's large learner base and AI partnerships make it an appealing target for strategic buyers or as a cornerstone for a PE-led rollup.

Dropbox (DBX): Lacking the scale advantages of larger cloud storage rivals, Dropbox could become a target if new products underperform, with greater value realized as part of a bigger platform.

DocuSign (DOCU): If the e-signature company's identity access management pivot fails to gain traction, DocuSign could attract private equity interest, though its valuation may deter many bidders.

Elastic (ESTC): Elastic's GenAI momentum and leadership in search make it a logical target for strategic consolidation.

Five9 (FIVN): With strong contact-center-as-a-service (CCaaS) technology and margin improvement potential, Five9 could appeal to enterprise companies such as Salesforce or Cisco, or to private equity once leadership stabilizes.

Fastly (FSLY): Its solid edge-computing technology and reasonable valuation could make Fastly an attractive target to acquirers such as Google or Cisco.

Gen Digital (GEN): With stable margins, strong cash flow, and revenue synergies, the cybersecurity and fintech platform could be a compelling buyout candidate for private equity.

GitLab (GTLB): GitLab's growing presence in developer security operations and GenAI developer tools positions it as an appealing strategic acquisition.

ZoomInfo (GTM): This company's valuable customer relationship management data and integration potential make it a fit for large platforms such as Salesforce or a PE candidate for operational optimization.

N-Able (NABL): Its foothold in the fragmented managed service provider and small and medium-sized enterprise market makes N-Able an attractive consolidation play for private equity.

NICE (NICE): Misunderstood by markets and undervalued, NICE's CCaaS and compliance businesses could unlock value through a takeover or breakup.

Nutanix (NTNX): As hybrid-cloud adoption grows, Nutanix's scale and SaaS shift could make it a strategic target for major IT vendors.

PagerDuty (PD): PagerDuty fits as a logical acquisition to strengthen an integrated IT operations platform.

Qualys (QLYS): High margins and leadership in vulnerability management make Qualys an attractive consolidation target within the cloud security sector.

Rapid7 (RPD): Following restructuring and a pivot from cybersecurity toward DevSecOps, Rapid7's improved cash profile could appeal to private equity buyers.

Teradata (TDC): Its progress in cloud analytics positions Teradata as a potential acquisition target for large vendors or PE firms.

Varonis (VRNS): Focused on data security and governance, Varonis is well placed for a strategic GenAI-driven acquisition.

Zoom (ZM): While a sale is unlikely soon, Zoom's best-in-class video platform could entice acquirers seeking synergies in AI and collaboration.

SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics and other major South Korean companies on Sunday announced fresh domestic investment plans at a meeting with President Lee Jae Myung, who hopes the moves will counter concerns that the firms would prioritize U.S. investments under a trade deal.

Lee’s meeting with business leaders came days after his government finalized a trade deal with the United States, in which Seoul pledged to invest $350 billion in U.S. industries in exchange for averting the Trump administration’s highest tariffs.

Samsung, a global leader in computer chips, said it will invest 450 trillion won ($310 billion) over the next five years to expand its domestic operations, including building another production line at its Pyeongtaek manufacturing hub to meet surging global semiconductor demands fueled by artificial intelligence.

Samsung said the new line, set to begin operations in 2028, is part of its broader effort to secure additional production capacity in anticipation of rising mid- to long-term demands for memory chips. The company also plans to build AI data centers in the country’s southwest South Jeolla Province and the southeastern city of Gumi to support government efforts to reduce the development gap between the greater Seoul metropolitan area and other regions.

Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea’s largest automaker, said it plans to invest 125 trillion won ($86.3 billion) from 2026 to 2030 to expand domestic research and development and advance new technologies such as AI, robotics and self-driving cars.

SK Group, another semiconductor powerhouse, and shipbuilders Hanwha Ocean and HD Hyundai also announced plans to increase their domestic investments. Both are central to South Korean commitments to boost the U.S. shipbuilding industry, a sector highlighted by President Donald Trump in negotiations with Seoul.

In his meeting with the companies’ chiefs, Lee credited the business sector for helping his government negotiate the trade deal with Washington but urged the companies to maintain strong domestic investments to ease concerns they might cut spending at home to invest more in America. He said his government is exploring various policy steps, including easing regulations, to help create a more favorable business environment for the companies.

SK Chair Chey Tae-won, whose group plans to invest at least 128 trillion won ($88.3 billion) domestically through 2028 with a focus on AI, said the finalization of trade talks with the United States eases uncertainties and paves way for bolder domestic investment.

The two governments on Friday released the details of the trade agreement, including $150 billion in South Korean investments in the U.S. shipbuilding sector and an additional $200 billion in other American industries, which Seoul says will be capped at $20 billion per year to prevent financial instability.

The United States agreed to reduce tariffs on South Korean cars and auto parts from 25% to 15%, and to apply tariffs on South Korean semiconductors on terms “no less favorable” than those granted to comparable competitors in the future.

[TITLE]Chip design and AI-driven engineering emerge as niche growth bets for IT sector:
[TEXT]
India’s IT services leaders are ramping up their semiconductor design and AI-driven engineering capabilities as global chipmakers deepen their presence in the country. While analysts expect this to remain a specialised niche — centred on chip design, verification and fab-level AI systems rather than a cloud- or AI-scale breakout — the segment is steadily expanding and poised for much larger growth.

Semiconductors are the foundation of modern technology, from AI and cloud to automotive and industrial automation. Global chip shortages and the surge in demand for advanced electronics have created a strategic inflection point.

Gilroy Mathew, COO of UST, shared that semiconductors represent one of its fastest-growing verticals, alongside healthcare and the BFSI sector.

“This segment is projected to deliver double-digit growth within our ER&D portfolio over the next five years. We have been a pioneer in the semiconductor business for the last 15 years. As of today, we have a dedicated 10,000-member team serving 15 out of the top 20 semiconductor companies globally; it provides world-class engineering solutions to our clients on R&D, Hardware, Software, and ATE,” he noted.

Expertise

Globally, the company serves semiconductor companies, with expertise in design, verification and embedded systems. Domestically, India’s semiconductor mission and PLI/DLI schemes have opened new opportunities for the company, he said.

“Our recent ₹3,330 crore OSAT joint venture with Kaynes Semicon in Gujarat is aimed at strengthening India’s semiconductor value chain. This partnership enables us to provide a full ATE solution to our global clients, including OSAT. We are providing an alternative back-end manufacturing option to our clients. UST is building end-to-end capabilities, including pre-silicon design (ASIC, FPGA, SoC architecture), post silicon validation, advanced EDA automation and manufacturing process support through OSAT partnerships,” Mathew explained.

Alongside, semiconductor tools generate a vast amount of data, which can be leveraged to build efficient machine learning and AI-based predictive maintenance systems that help reduce tool downtime and improve overall fab yield.

Omprakash Subbarao, CEO at IISc’s FSID CORE Labs, highlighted that AI-driven defect inspection during wafer production and packaging will further enhance yield, benefiting both individual tools and the fab as a whole. The development of advanced digital twins of both tools and fabs will support better training for fab engineers and enable real-time remote monitoring of processes and equipment.

“This space is set to become a much larger market, and its growth is already well underway. A growing number of companies are now focusing on advanced tool development, moving beyond purely service-oriented work. Start-ups mentored by established tool makers, fabs, and VLSI design houses can accelerate innovation and strengthen the overall ecosystem far more effectively,” he said.

ISM is building a semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem that includes production, assembly, packaging, and testing at scale, which will create opportunities for IT services in enabling smart manufacturing, digital transformation and automation across semiconductor fabs and OSAT facilities. With advanced machinery, robotics, and AI-driven workflows becoming integral to these setups, technology will play a critical role in optimising operations, ensuring quality, and driving efficiency.

Biswajeet Mahapatra, Principal Analyst, Forrester, explained that while India’s IT services firms are unlikely to gain a broad competitive edge across the semiconductor value chain because core manufacturing and fabrication remain capital-intensive and dominated by global giants. However, they can carve out a niche in design, verification, and software-driven aspects of chip development, leveraging their engineering talent and experience in complex systems integration. This will likely remain a specialised play rather than a mainstream focus.

“While semiconductor design and engineering could emerge as a meaningful growth vertical, it will not match the scale of cloud or AI in the near term. The opportunity lies in high-value design services, embedded software, and verification, driven by global demand for advanced chips in AI, automotive, and IoT. Growth will depend on partnerships with semiconductor firms and building domain expertise, making it more of an adjacent vertical than a dominant pillar,” he said.

Revenue potential will be modest compared to cloud or AI, likely in the low single-digit percentage of overall IT services revenue over the next 3–5 years. For large players, this could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars rather than billions, driven by specialized design and verification projects for global semiconductor clients.

[TITLE]Samsung, Hyundai to invest $400B at home as Korea-U.S. trade deal sparks outflow concerns:
[TEXT]
Audio report: written by reporters, read by AI

Samsung pledged to invest 450 trillion won ($310 billion) in Korea over five years to sharply expand its chip manufacturing capacity as President Lee Jae Myung voiced concerns that an intensified focus on U.S. investment could come at the expense of domestic spending under the recently concluded tariff deal with Washington.The chipmaker also began structural construction of its P5 plant in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, which has been on hold since 2024 due to a market downturn, with mass production set to begin in 2028.Lee held a meeting with the chiefs of seven major conglomerates on Sunday afternoon to address follow-up measures to the tariff deal negotiations, under which Korea promised a $350 billion investment package in exchange for lower "reciprocal" tariffs of 15 percent on most exports to the United States.“It appears we have negotiated well. Yet concerns remain that a surge in U.S.-focused investment could come at the expense of domestic spending. While decisions will be guided by prevailing economic conditions, I would hope that, under comparable circumstances, greater attention would be devoted to nurturing investment at home,” Lee said during the meeting at the Yongsan presidential office in central Seoul on Sunday.A significant portion of Samsung's investment will be directed toward Samsung SDS’s large-scale AI data center in South Jeolla, where the company plans to secure 15,000 GPUs by 2028 and offer access to academia, startups and small- and medium-sized enterprises.Samsung Electronics plans to intensify its focus on the AI data center market through the establishment of a local production line for FlaktGroup, Europe’s largest heating, ventilation and air conditioning company, which it acquired in early November.Samsung SDI is eying Ulsan for its first mass-production plant for solid-state batteries, dubbed dream batteries for their high energy density.Samsung Display is set to commence full-scale production of its latest organic light-emitting diode for information technology applications next year, once construction of the facility at its Asan plant in South Chungcheong is complete.“While the current economic climate remains challenging, we remain committed, as pledged last September, to hiring 60,000 people over the next five years,” Samsung Electronics Executive Chairman Lee Jae-yong said during the meeting, adding that he will also “intensify efforts to invest in domestic facilities, including research and development [R&D].”Hyundai Motor Group also unveiled its largest-ever five-year investment plan, pledging 125.2 trillion won in Korea through 2030, a dramatic increase compared to 89.1 trillion won from 2021 to 2025.Roughly 50.5 trillion won will go into new businesses like AI, software-defined vehicles, robotics and hydrogen, while another 38.5 trillion won has been allocated to R&D for the existing mobility industry, and 36.2 trillion won for standard investment required for regular operations.Hyundai was the biggest beneficiary of the recent tariff deal, as the cut in tariffs to 15 percent from 25 percent will trim the company’s annual burden by roughly 4 trillion won, narrowing the disadvantage it had faced against major rivals such as Toyota Motor and Volkswagen.Hyundai will also shoulder the full amount of U.S.-bound tariffs imposed on its primary parts suppliers this year by tacking the levies they incur while shipping components to Hyundai’s U.S. plants directly onto the purchase price — an assistance program the company plans to extend to more than 5,000 secondary and tertiary vendors in the coming years."The centerpiece of the investment will focus on nurturing Korea’s AI and robotics industries and advancing the green energy ecosystem, with a plan to build an AI data center for global competitiveness in physical-AI fields such as autonomous driving, autonomous manufacturing and robotics, and to construct a robot manufacturing and foundry plant capable of producing a wide variety of robotic products," Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung said in the meeting.The focus is part of the partnership forged with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who vowed to supply Korea with 260,000 GPUs, some 50,000 of which will go to Hyundai, during his visit to Korea late last month."We have hired 7,200 people this year, and will ramp up that to 10,000 next year, with a concentration in software-defined vehicles and mobility," Chung added.The company aims to raise overseas shipments from 2.18 million vehicles last year to 2.47 million by 2030, with exports of electrified models including EVs and hybrids set to surge more than two-and-a-half-fold to 1.76 million over the same period.SK Group vowed at least 600 trillion won in investment in Korea for AI and chips, though specific details

[TITLE]US Sanctions Propel Chinese AI Prodigy to $23 Billion Fortune:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg) -- In 2019, Chen Tianshi was a long way from becoming one of the wealthiest people on the planet.

The largest customer for his three-year-old artificial intelligence chip startup, Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co., had abruptly cut off almost all business in favor of developing its own semiconductors. Until then, Huawei had been the source of over 95% of the company’s revenue.

But then he caught a break from an unexpected source. The US decision to cut off China’s access to cutting-edge chips and Beijing’s determination to foster homegrown technology ultimately created a halo of state sponsorship and a vast protected market for the computer prodigy’s company, which propelled him to become one of the world’s richest self-made billionaires.

Shares of his chip designer Cambricon Technologies have surged more than 765% over the past 24 months. His wealth, which is for the majority derived from his 28% stake in the Beijing-based producer of AI accelerators, has more than doubled to $22.5 billion since the beginning of the year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Chen’s meteoric rise underscores how China’s robust support for its domestic AI industry is minting a new class of state-aligned tech elites just a few years after it cracked down on its private-sector titans. As Washington’s export bans choked China’s access to advanced chips, firms like Chen’s Cambricon have emerged as national champions, shielded by policy mandates and investor zeal — symbols of a new industrial order where political favor, not market freedom, defines the winners.

Questions over how much the significant support from government protectionism has contributed to Cambricon’s surge — rather than the competitiveness of its chips — has divided observers over how long the run will last.

“Cambricon’s explosive revenue growth is mainly due to a low starting point, and its current valuation may be inflated without sustained policy support,” said Shen Meng, director at Beijing-based investment bank Chanson & Co.

While Chen is still some way off Nvidia founder Jensen Huang’s net worth, he’s already the third richest person in the world at or under the age of 40, behind Lukas Walton and Mark Mateschitz, heirs to the Walmart and Red Bull fortunes respectively, according to the index.

Shares of Cambricon — and by extension Chen’s net worth — took off in August when Beijing urged local companies to avoid using market leader Nvidia Corp.’s H20 processors, particularly for government-related purposes.

The company stepped in to cool the investor frenzy around its shares, warning in an August filing to the Shanghai stock exchange that it still labors under US sanctions and stressing the difficulties of ascending the technology ladder. It also dispelled speculation
