[TITLE]Development of Data Transfer Ethics Framework (daTEF): A participatory approach to delivering evidence-based guidelines for healthcare data transfer:
[TEXT]
Abstract Background In Nepal, insufficient healthcare infrastructure and limited funding contribute to unmet public healthcare needs and reduced quality of care. While foreign health researchers have stepped in to support local research initiatives, their involvement has sparked ethical concerns regarding the sharing and ownership of data. This study aims to develop a locally governed framework for ethical healthcare data exchange, establish an evidence base to understand local challenges in data transfer, and to identify potential solutions for data sharing with international research teams. Method This cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted in Kathmandu, Nepal, using 11 multiple-choice and 12 open-ended questionnaire models. We conducted a pre-structured questionnaire survey to best identify local ethics issues related to international data transfer and proposed solutions for these challenges. The key representatives identified from the non-governmental and not-for-profit research institute (n = 14) and the life sciences society (n = 7) were invited to one-to-one blind interviews, and their recorded transcripts were coded using the QDA Miner Lite software (version 3.0) for analysis. Result The ratio of female to male participants was 2:3, while the ratio of junior-level staff to senior staff (≥3 years of experience in the sector) was 1:9. Approximately 42.86% of participants shared both raw and analytical data, while <5% shared no data with collaborators. Concerning knowledge, attitudes, and practices, most (38.46%) preferred open-access storage, while approximately 23.1% had limited knowledge, and 15.38% opted for confidentiality. Additionally, < 10% were in the learning process and sought training in data transfer procedures. Within this group of key representatives, participants faced main challenges in the data transfer process from four key categories: (i) the lack of standardized guidelines from government or institutes for data transfer, (ii) inadequate awareness and training in data sharing, (iii) problems related to data sharing, and (iv) problems related to biological sample transfer. Conclusion In summary, this study emphasizes the importance of a standardized data-sharing platform, focusing on protecting intellectual property rights and establishing a centralized data repository in Nepal. It also recommends educational reforms, legal measures, well-defined agreements, and dedicated oversight to ensure data integrity and security, while streamlining sample transfer processes to enhance transparency and scientific progress in Nepal’s research landscape.

Introduction Data sharing in research is a fundamental practice that involves making research data accessible to other researchers within the same project or to the broader scientific community [1,2]. This practice is vital for several reasons, the most significant being its role in promoting transparency in research [3]. Transparency is a cornerstone of the scientific method, and data sharing is a tangible manifestation of this principle [3]. Data sharing allows researchers to access and scrutinize data, enhancing the credibility of research outcomes by verifying methods and results, while enabling multiple research groups to work together, often transcending geographical and disciplinary boundaries, resulting in more robust research and innovative solutions to complex scientific problems [4]. Despite the undeniable benefits of data sharing, there are challenges associated with transferring data within institutes and research groups, particularly in resource-scarce settings. Among many, data security, ethical considerations, and intellectual property rights are prominent issues [5,6]. To address these challenges, standardized guidelines and legal frameworks are crucial. These should encompass data security protocols, ethical considerations, and intellectual property agreements, providing legal protection and recourse in case of disputes or breaches [7–9]. Although international standards for data transfer and harmonizing data protection laws can simplify this process and reduce the risk of breaches or disputes, they are far from one-size-fits-all. Historically, limited resources and restricted access to international scientific communities have hindered the research ecosystem in Nepal. However, in the past decades, Nepal has made significant progress in research and scientific inquiry [10], along with the substantial growth in nationwide research institutions, and universities. Despite this promising evolution, limited funding, inadequate access to cutting-edge research equipment, and high-tech infrastructure constraints have impeded the progress of the Nepalese scientific inquiry process [11]. This inadequacy in infrastructure and funding in Nepal has led to unmet healthcare innovations, negatively impacting the quality of healthcare available to the population. The lack of government incentives for healthcare innovation, coupled with inadequate funding, has prompted non-Nepal-based international researchers to step in, providing funding and expertise for healthcare data and innovation [12]. While the increased presence of international researchers brings benefits, it also presents distinct challenges regarding data transfer and thus the ownership of research outcomes, specifically for non-profit and non-government research institutes that rely on international funding and grants to sustain. These issues include concerns

[TITLE]MeiraGTx Enters into Strategic Collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company to Develop and Commercialize Genetic Medicines in Ophthalmology:
[TEXT]
LONDON and NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MeiraGTx Holdings plc (Nasdaq: MGTX), a vertically integrated, clinical stage genetic medicines company, today announced a broad strategic collaboration in the area of ophthalmology with Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”).

MeiraGTx will grant Lilly worldwide exclusive rights to its AAV-AIPL1 program for treatment of one of the most severe inherited retinopathies, Leber congenital amaurosis 4 (LCA4) owing to genetic deficiency of Aryl-hydrocarbon-interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1). Clinical data from 11 children under the age of 4 who were born legally blind as a result of mutations in the AIPL1 gene were unprecedented, with all 11 blind children gaining vision after treatment with AAV-AIPL1. Beyond the effects on vision, treatment with AAV-AIPL1 resulted in life-changing benefits in vital areas of development including communication, behavior, learning, mood, psychological benefits and social integration.

Lilly will also receive worldwide exclusive access rights to MeiraGTx’s innovative gene therapy technologies for use in ophthalmology with certain targets named by Lilly, including novel intravitreal capsids developed in-house at MeiraGTx and bespoke promoters including AI-generated promoters for specific cells in the retina. MeiraGTx also grants Lilly certain rights to its proprietary riboswitch technology for use in gene editing in the eye. MeiraGTx’s riboswitch technology platform is broadly applicable to any therapeutic protein. It allows precise, titratable in-vivo production of the therapeutic protein or gene editing nuclease from a gene template controlled by oral dosing of a small molecule inducer.

Under the terms of the agreement, MeiraGTx will receive an upfront payment of $75 million and will be eligible to receive over $400 million in total milestone payments. MeiraGTx is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on licensed products.

“We are excited to be entering into this collaboration with Lilly in ophthalmology,” said Alexandria Forbes, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of MeiraGTx. “MeiraGTx has been dedicated to treating patients with serious eye conditions since the company’s inception, and this collaboration with Lilly is a testament to our leadership in this field and the power of our broad toolkit of proprietary gene therapy technologies for both rare and prevalent ocular disease.”

Dr. Forbes continued, “I am very proud of the team at MeiraGTx who over the past decade has built one of the industry’s most comprehensive genetic medicine companies - from capsid screening, promoter engineering and vector optimization, to clinical development and in-house GMP manufacturing, allowing us to accelerate the development of next-generation genetic medicines from concept to clinic with exceptional speed and quality. We are particularly pleased that Lilly, a global leader in development and commercialization of innovative medicines, has chosen to partner with us in this area of high unmet need, and shares our dedication to bringing truly life changing therapies to patients with otherwise intractable conditions.”

“Ophthalmology is an emerging area of interest for Lilly,” said Andrew Adams, Lilly group vice president, Molecule Discovery. “We are excited to partner with MeiraGTx to bring transformative treatments to patients around the world suffering from eye diseases, starting with AAV-AIPL1, which has shown the unprecedented ability to restore vision in children who were born legally blind.”

Our shared objective is to rapidly generate proof-of-concept data to determine whether EViv confirms its potential for clinical development.”

Drug candidate EViv leverages a proprietary exosome platform to bring an innovative regenerative therapy approach to ACLF. In the case of, and following, positive in vivo proof-of-concept results, GENFIT has an exclusive option to take an exclusive license in the field of liver disease to advance EViv into clinical development. The collaboration combines EVerZom’s exosome expertise with GENFIT’s leadership in ACLF, aiming to accelerate therapeutic progress.

Jeanne Volatron, CEO and Co-founder of EVerZom, added: “As a pioneer in the exosome field, our goal is to push the boundaries of gene and cell therapies and open new avenues for regenerative medicine. ACLF is a highly relevant indication for positioning our candidate EViv and this collaboration with GENFIT marks the first partnership for EViv in this indication. With GENFIT’s proven track record in advancing therapies in emerging areas and expertise in ACLF, we see it as the ideal partner to accelerate preclinical development and move toward the clinical stage.”

Exosomes are tiny biological vesicles (30 to 150 nanometers) naturally secreted by cells. They play a key role in intercellular communication, transporting proteins, messenger RNAs, and other functional biomolecules between cells. EVerZom leverages exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells, known for their regenerative and immunomodulatory properties. Compared to the cells themselves, exosomes offer numerous advantages: increased stability, reduced variability, enhanced patient safety, and simplified logistics (direct hospital storage and immediate availability).
