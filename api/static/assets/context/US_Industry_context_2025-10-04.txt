[TITLE]Pfizer strikes $70B deal with Trump to cut Medicaid drug prices, expand U.S. manufacturing under tariff threat:
[TEXT]
Pfizer has agreed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid under a deal struck with the Trump administration, President Donald Trump said Tuesday as he promised similar deals with other drugmakers under the threat of tariffs.

Trump made the announcement at the White House alongside Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla just hours ahead of a possible government shutdown in a partisan standoff over health care and spending.

Pfizer Inc., one of the largest U.S. drugmakers, produces the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and the treatment Paxlovid. Its products also include several cancer drugs, the blood thinner Eliquis and the pneumonia vaccine Prevnar.

Under the deal, New York-based Pfizer will charge most-favored-nation pricing to Medicaid and guarantee that pricing on newly launched drugs, Trump said. That involves matching the lowest price offered in other developed nations.

The agreement by Pfizfer builds on an executive order Trump signed in May setting a deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay. Trump said deals with other drug companies would be coming over the next week.

“I can’t tell you how big this is,” the president said Tuesday.

“We are turning the tide and we are reversing an unfair situation,” Bourla said.

Consumers are not expected to start seeing lower prices under the Pfizer deal until 2026, according to senior administration officials who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Patients in Medicaid, the state and federally funded program for people with low incomes, often pay a nominal co-payment of a few dollars to fill their prescriptions, but lower prices could help state budgets that fund the programs.

Lower drug prices also will help patients who have no insurance coverage and little leverage to negotiate better deals on what they pay. But even steep discounts of 50% or more could still leave patients paying hundreds of dollars a month toward their prescriptions, depending on the drug.

Besides committing to lowering costs, Trump said, Pfizer agreed to spend $70 billion in domestic manufacturing facilities, becoming the latest in a string of major drugmakers to announce plans to build production in the United States.

The White House did not immediately release details

Trump announces “TrumpRx” website and Pfizer deal to slash drug prices, boost U.S. manufacturing

President Donald Trump announced a landmark agreement with Pfizer to implement "most-favored-nation" pricing for Medicaid, ensuring the U.S. pays no more than the lowest prices offered to other developed nations.

The new TrumpRx direct-to-consumer platform, launching in 2026, will allow Americans to purchase prescription drugs at steep discounts (averaging 50 percent off retail prices), bypassing traditional pharmacy markups.

Pfizer committed to investing $70 billion in domestic research, development, and manufacturing, aligning with Trump’s push to bring pharmaceutical production back to America.

While the deal marks progress, experts caution that discounts may still leave expensive drugs unaffordable for many, and the full impact remains unclear due to Pfizer's confidential terms.

The administration leveraged tariff threats to secure the deal and hinted at similar agreements with other drugmakers. Critics argue systemic affordability issues persist, while Democrats and Republicans remain divided on broader healthcare reforms.

In a major move aimed at lowering prescription drug costs, President Donald Trump announced a landmark agreement with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. that includes deep discounts for Medicaid, a new direct-to-consumer drug purchasing website called "TrumpRx," and a $70 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing.

Speaking alongside Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla at the White House, Trump declared the deal a "historic" step toward ending America's role in subsidizing global pharmaceutical research while paying the highest prices for medications. Under the agreement, Pfizer will adopt "most-favored-nation" pricing for Medicaid, ensuring that the U.S. government pays no more than the lowest price offered to other developed nations. As stated by Brighteon.AI's Enoch engine, Medicaid is a government-run health insurance program primarily for low-income individuals, disabled persons and families with dependent children, funded jointly by federal and state governments.

The decentralized engine adds that while Medicaid covers essential medical services, including dental care (as seen in cases like Isaac Gagnon's unauthorized treatments), it disproportionately allocates two-thirds of its budget to long-term care for the elderly, blind, and disabled—raising concerns

The BILL Cash account, announced by the financial operations platform Ton hursday (Oct. 2), is an operating account designed to help small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) strengthen their cash positions.

“Cash flow is the lifeblood of SMBs, yet businesses are leaving thousands of dollars on the table while their operating cash sits in low- or no-yield accounts. To secure higher yields, businesses are wasting time moving funds between multiple accounts.”

BILL, the release added, is enhancing value for customers by helping them extend operating cash while they boost working capital, while earning 42 times the national average annual percentage yield (APY), and benefitting from up to $200 million in FDIC insurance.

“Idle cash sitting in low- or no-yield checking accounts not only costs businesses time and money—it costs them opportunity to grow. BILL is redefining what an operating account can do, and we’re doing it at scale because we’re trusted by nearly half a million businesses,” said Mary Kay Bowman, executive vice president and general manager of payments and financial services at BILL.

Cash Account, she added, gives growing businesses “the same enterprise-grade capabilities normally reserved for Fortune 500 companies—combining high APY on an operational account with fast speed, seamless software integration, and security all in one simple account.”

Writing about the working capital landscape earlier this week, PYMNTS argued that innovation in this space can be a “lifeline” when “SMBs find it hard to breathe.”

“Traditionally, working capital optimization was viewed as the enterprise chief financial officer’s domain as an exercise in shortening receivables, stretching payables and managing inventory,” that report said. “Today, it is emerging as a cross-functional lever for mid-sized firms that can connect procurement strategy, trade compliance and global sourcing decisions.”

Meanwhile, PYMNTS spoke with BILL’s Bowman earlier this year for a report on SMB’s use of artificial intelligence (AI) to compete with larger counterparts.

“Smaller businesses can’t compete with bigger businesses on scale — so they need to compete on smarts,” she said. “The smartest thing small businesses can do is use AI to unlock top-tier finance expertise and tools that were only ever available to enterprise companies.”

Bowman added that the best AI tools for SMBs aren’t flashy tech add-ons but are developed with the needs of small business in mind.

“Silicon Valley needs to be delivering AI that actually delivers tangible outcomes that small businesses need: saving time, improving accuracy, and freeing up bandwidth to focus on growth,” she told PYMNTS.

[TITLE]States scramble to plug transportation funding holes:
[TEXT]
By Erika Bolstad, Stateline.org

States are scrambling for the money to fill potholes, plow roads, maintain bridges and pay bus drivers as they confront inflation- and tariff-driven cost increases and declining gas tax revenues.

States also face uncertain federal funding as the Trump administration reduces the size of government and zeroes out some Biden-era transportation programs. As the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act expires next year and Congress considers its next transportation funding bill, cities are clamoring for the federal government to bypass states and give cities a larger share of federal infrastructure money distributed by formula.

Drivers will have to pay higher vehicle registration fees and gas taxes to make up for the shortfalls. Long-planned construction projects and safety improvements will be delayed. And bus riders may see fewer routes and longer wait times.

The chaos in a pair of state legislatures on either side of the country illustrates the dire state of highways and transit systems – and might foretell a bumpy road ahead.

In Oregon, nearly 500 transportation employees,

[TITLE]Offsite Construction Industry Business Report 2025-2030: Higher ROI and Faster Project Timelines Generate Investment Interest in Modular Construction Startups:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Offsite Construction - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Offsite Construction was valued at US$172.0 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$225.7 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Rapid urbanization, labor shortages in the skilled trades, and increasing project complexity are driving the global shift toward offsite methods. Countries like the UK, Sweden, Japan, and Singapore are leading adopters of offsite construction due to government incentives, housing policy reforms, and industrialized construction mandates. In the U.S., large-scale developers and general contractors are exploring prefabrication to manage rising material costs and supply chain volatility. Beyond speed and cost-efficiency, offsite construction also offers enhanced precision, structural quality, and repeatability, contributing to higher-performing buildings and reduced rework rates.

What Forces Are Powering Market Growth and Industry Transformation?

The growth in the global offsite construction market is driven by several converging trends, including rising urban density, regulatory mandates for faster housing delivery, digital innovation, and a shift toward more sustainable and resilient building practices. Governments around the world are incorporating offsite construction into national housing and infrastructure strategies. For instance, the UK's Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) policy framework and Singapore's Productivity Innovation Project (PIP) provide subsidies and fast-track approvals for offsite-based developments. Such policy support is accelerating adoption among public sector contractors and attracting private investment into modular manufacturing facilities.

Sustainability imperatives are another key growth driver. Offsite construction produces significantly less material waste, energy consumption, and on-site emissions compared to traditional methods. Modular buildings are also designed for disassembly and reuse, supporting circular economy principles. Carbon tracking via BIM tools and Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) helps developers meet green building certifications such as LEED and BREEAM, making offsite construction attractive for ESG-focused real estate investors. As global pressure mounts for decarbonized construction, offsite solutions offer a practical path toward embodied carbon reduction.

The economic and operational benefits of factory-controlled environments-including consistent quality, reduced labor costs, and scalability-are drawing interest from major developers, general contractors, and venture-backed construction technology firms. Companies like Katerra (before its dissolution), Volumetric Building Companies (VBC), Sekisui House, and Laing O'Rourke are investing in high-capacity modular plants, AI-driven design software, and supply chain optimization to scale the offsite model. With continued innovation and market validation, offsite construction is emerging as a cornerstone of the global construction ecosystem, reshaping how buildings are conceived, manufactured, and delivered.

How Are Digital Tools and Materials Advancing Offsite Building Methods?

The integration of digital technologies into offsite construction is redefining the design-build process. Building Information Modeling (BIM), digital twins, and generative design algorithms are being used to model entire structures virtually before a single component is fabricated. This digital precision allows for clash detection, construction sequencing, and real-time collaboration between architects, engineers, and manufacturers, resulting in fewer site disruptions and tighter integration of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems within modular units. BIM also facilitates greater supply chain transparency and just-in-time logistics, both of which are vital for reducing inventory and optimizing production schedules.

Advanced materials are further enhancing the performance and scalability of offsite construction. Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs), Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT), and light-gauge steel framing are increasingly used for their lightweight, durable, and energy-efficient properties. These materials simplify transport and assembly, while meeting stringent structural and fire safety codes. Additive manufacturing (3D printing) is emerging as a complementary innovation, particularly for producing complex building components or custom molds in low-volume projects. Furthermore, robotics and automated machinery on factory floors are increasing the precision and throughput of framing, welding, and component assembly, further reducing dependence on manual labor.

Which End-Use Sectors Are Adopting Offsite Construction at Scale?

Residential and commercial real estate sectors remain primary adopters of offsite construction, but the technology's reach is expanding into a broader range of industries. Affordable housing, student housing, and hospitality chains are turning to modular construction to accelerate delivery timelines and control costs. Developers are now opting for pre-finished modules complete with interior fit-outs, plumbing, HVAC, and finishes-often referred to as "plug-and-play" systems-that are simply craned into position at the job site. This model supports rapid scaling of multi-unit developments in dense urban environments, particularly where construction permits and space constraints limit traditional building activity.

Healthcare and education are also high-growth sectors for offsite construction. Hospitals and school districts increasingly require fast-track expansion solutions due to population growth or emergency preparedness needs. Modular surgical centers, clinics, classrooms, and laboratories can be rapidly deployed with minimal site disruption, making them ideal for operational facilities. In the industrial sector, data centers, warehouses, and energy plants are leveraging prefabricated mechanical and electrical rooms (commonly referred to as modular utility skids) for streamlined integration into complex systems. Government agencies and military organizations are adopting prefabricated solutions for disaster relief housing, remote workforce accommodations, and mobile command centers.

[TITLE]Low-Carbon Construction Materials Industry Analysis Report 2025: Global Market to Reach $79.2 Billion by 2030 - Net-Zero Targets, Green Building Standards and Sustainable Investment Drive Growth:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Low-Carbon Construction Materials - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Low-Carbon Construction Materials was estimated at US$66.2 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$79.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.0% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Low-carbon construction materials are gaining rapid importance in the global effort to mitigate climate change and promote sustainable urban growth. As cities expand and infrastructure demands grow, the construction sector is under intense scrutiny for its role in greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly 40 percent of global CO2 output when combined with building operations. Traditional materials such as cement, steel, and conventional concrete have particularly high carbon footprints due to energy-intensive manufacturing processes. Low-carbon alternatives are now being adopted to reduce this environmental burden without compromising performance or durability. These materials include fly ash-based cement, recycled steel, engineered timber, geopolymer concrete, and carbon-capturing bricks. They are engineered to produce fewer emissions throughout their lifecycle, from production and transport to installation and demolition.

Governments and regulatory bodies are encouraging the use of such materials through green building codes, tax incentives, and climate pledges, while international organizations advocate for net-zero construction practices. Urban planners and developers are responding by integrating low-carbon materials into the design of schools, hospitals, commercial centers, and residential buildings. These products not only reduce carbon output but also often offer benefits such as thermal insulation, moisture control, and resistance to wear and corrosion. As sustainable architecture gains cultural and economic momentum, low-carbon materials are becoming not just an environmental choice but a strategic necessity in the future of responsible construction.

What Factors Are Driving the Global Growth of the Low-Carbon Construction Materials Market?

The growth in the global low-carbon construction materials market is driven by a convergence of regulatory mandates, climate imperatives, technological readiness, and changing stakeholder priorities. One of the most significant drivers is the commitment by governments and international bodies to reach net-zero emissions targets, many of which hinge on reducing carbon in the construction sector. Legislative action in the form of stricter emissions regulations, embodied carbon reporting requirements, and green building standards is creating a policy environment that strongly favors low-carbon materials. Investment in infrastructure, particularly in regions undergoing rapid urbanization such as Asia-Pacific and Africa, is providing opportunities for the widespread adoption of new, sustainable building technologies.

Additionally, rising energy costs and material scarcity are prompting builders to consider alternatives that offer long-term economic advantages through reduced maintenance, operational efficiency, and lower lifecycle emissions. Financial institutions and investors are increasingly directing capital toward projects that meet environmental criteria, reinforcing market growth through green bonds and sustainability-linked loans. Strategic collaborations between construction firms, technology startups, and academic institutions are accelerating research and market readiness for scalable low-carbon materials.

Digital transformation in the construction industry is further enabling the integration of these materials through tools that measure, validate, and optimize carbon performance. Public awareness and advocacy are also exerting pressure on brands and developers to disclose environmental practices and adopt greener supply chains. These interlocking drivers are building a robust foundation for the expansion of the low-carbon construction materials market, ensuring it will remain a central pillar of the global transition toward a more sustainable built environment.

How Are Innovations in Material Science Transforming the Performance of Low-Carbon Alternatives?

Material science advancements are at the heart of the ongoing transformation in low-carbon construction, enabling new formulations and composites that outperform traditional materials in both sustainability and engineering terms. Researchers and manufacturers are focusing on alternative binders and aggregates that dramatically reduce the need for carbon-intensive components like Portland cement. Innovations such as alkali-activated materials, bio-cement derived from bacterial processes, and nanomaterial-enhanced concrete are emerging as high-performance, eco-conscious options. These materials can be customized for specific structural or environmental requirements, whether it`s enhancing compressive strength, improving water resistance, or increasing thermal performance.

Technologies that integrate carbon capture and utilization (CCU) directly into the production process are also being commercialized, turning construction materials into carbon sinks rather than sources. 3D printing in construction is allowing for the precise use of low-carbon material mixtures, significantly reducing waste while maintaining structural integrity. Prefabrication and modular construction methods are also gaining popularity, as they often use advanced low-carbon composites and promote resource efficiency. In addition, recycled content is being more effectively integrated into new materials, including reclaimed aggregates, crushed glass, plastic waste, and industrial byproducts like slag or fly ash. These innovations are making it possible for architects and engineers to meet strict building codes and performance standards while drastically cutting emissions. As data-driven design tools and lifecycle assessment software become more accessible, stakeholders can make informed decisions

[TITLE]Firehawk Aerospace secures $60 million investment from Presto Tech Horizons:
[TEXT]
Firehawk Aerospace has secured an oversubscribed $60 million investment round led by 1789 Capital. The venture capital firm’s partnership group includes Donald Trump Jr. Presto Tech Horizons (PTH), a defense and resilience tech fund created through a partnership between European venture capital firm Presto Ventures and Czechoslovak Group, also contributed to the round.

Firehawk is using 3D printing technology to produce propellant and solid rocket motors. The company aims to make the manufacture of advanced energetics faster, safer, and more flexible. Their approach can also be used for artillery charges, allowing ammunition production to be rapid, reliable, and scalable.

Firehawk’s method uses commercial-off-the-shelf equipment and new additive manufacturing processes to greatly reduce production times. This transforms the energetics supply chain. With this latest funding, Firehawk plans to improve Europe’s ability to locally source critical munitions supply chain elements.

Firehawk’s defense mission gains traction

This will boost resilience and ensure sustained defense readiness for NATO and allied forces. Will Edwards, CEO of Firehawk, said, “The conflict in Ukraine proves that while drones give warfighters a decisive edge, munitions like missiles and rockets are the core of combat power.

A supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and propellant and energetics production are currently the biggest constraints on missile, rocket, and artillery manufacturing. Enabling the European defense industry to produce these weapons quickly and at scale is the core of Firehawk’s mission. We’re proud to partner with Presto Tech Horizons and CSG to bolster the European energetics supply chain.”

Michal Strnad, Chairman of the Board and owner of Czechoslovak Group, stressed the importance of investing in innovative defense technologies given the current geopolitical climate.

“Firehawk can play a crucial role in the future of not only rocket propulsion but also ammunition production. This innovative project can strengthen cooperation between leaders of the American and European defense industries.”

The involved parties are already looking at opportunities for industrial application of Firehawk’s technologies. Matej Luhovy, newly appointed Partner at Presto Tech Horizons, said, “Since the early 2010s, scientists and engineers have explored 3D printing to unlock faster, safer, and more flexible solid propellant production.

Firehawk is the first to truly deliver on that promise. Their technology doesn’t just speed up propellant manufacture—it fundamentally reshapes the supply chain for missiles and rockets.”

This investment marks a major milestone for Firehawk Aerospace and its mission to revolutionize the energetics supply chain for defense industries.
