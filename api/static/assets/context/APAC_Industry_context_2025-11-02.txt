MANILA, Philippines -- Asian shares are mixed after the U.S. stock market sank from record heights as Wall Street sifted through various developments such as trade relations with China and profits of Big Tech giants.

U.S. futures advanced and oil prices fell.

President Donald Trump hailed his talk Thursday with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, but major tensions remain between the world’s two largest economies.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.7% to 52,201.05, touching fresh records after data showed industrial production rose 2.2% month-on-month in September, beating market expectations and rebounding from a 1.5% drop the previous month.

In Chinese markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 0.9% to 26,050.08 and the Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.6% to 3,963.01.

Data released Friday showed factory activity in China contracted in October for a seventh straight month. The official NBS Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.0 from 49.8 in September.

South Korea's Kospi rose 0.4% to 4,105.81, while Australia's S & P/ASX 200 added 0.2% to 8,903.50. Taiwan's Taiex gained 0.5%.

On Thursday, the S & P 500 fell 1% to 6,822.34, pulling further from its all-time high set on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2% to 47,522.12. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.6% from its record set the day before, closing at 23,581.14.

Stock markets elsewhere in the world were mixed, coming off a highly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies. Trump rated his meeting with Xi as a “12” on a scale of zero to 10, saying he would cut tariffs.

But stocks had already run to records on expectations for potentially bigger improvements in trade friction between Beijing and Washington.

Earnings of Big Tech companies were also feeling the pressure of high hopes. Meta Platforms dropped 11.3%, cutting into what had been a 28.4% jump for the year so far. It was the heaviest weight on the S & P 500. Analysts said investors were likely perturbed by how much Facebook’s parent company said it’s planning to spend in 2026. Companies across the industry have been on an investment spree to build out their artificial-intelligence capabilities, and the concern is whether it will all pay off.

“There are moments in market history when capital stops behaving like money and starts acting like obsession — when spending becomes the strategy, not the consequence. That’s exactly where we are now with artificial intelligence,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

Microsoft sank 2.9% even though it reported stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Analysts pointed to how it also expects to spend more on investments in 2026 than in 2025, while growth for its Azure business may have fallen a bit short of some investors’ expectations.

On the winning side of Big Tech was Alphabet. Shares of Google’s parent company climbed 2.5% after its profit and revenue for the latest quarter easily topped analysts’ expectations.

How such companies do matters incredibly for investors. The trio of Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft alone account for 14.5% of the total value of all the companies in the S & P 500 index, which dictates the movements for many 401(k) accounts. That means movements for them and a handful of other Big Tech companies can easily overshadow what hundreds of other stocks are doing.

In other dealings early Friday, benchmark U.S. crude oil shed 42 cents to $60.15 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 42 cents to $63.95.

The U.S. dollar fell to 153.95 Japanese yen from 154.14 yen. The euro rose to $1.1573 from $1.1566.

[TITLE]China asks U.S. to protect ‘hard-won’ results before Xi-Trump meeting:
[TEXT]
The Chinese Communist Party’s official mouthpiece called on the world’s biggest economies to “jointly safeguard hard-won achievements” from their latest trade talks, ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.

Trade negotiators from China and the U.S. announced Sunday that they’d struck a slew of agreements on issues spanning tariffs, shipping fees, fentanyl and export controls over two days in Malaysia. That marked a significant cooling of tensions, after a recent volley of tariff threats and fresh export curbs threatened to derail the bilateral relationship.

Striking a conciliatory tone, the People’s Daily said Monday the progress showed Beijing and Washington were capable of handling their differences. “Neither side was blindsided by these issues, instead they focused on solving the problems,” according to the commentary penned by Zhong Sheng, a Chinese homonym for “Voice of China” that’s often used to set out Beijing’s foreign policy views.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose as much as 1.3% on Monday, while the broader MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index advanced 1.5% to a new intraday record. China’s 10-year government bond yields edged up, as demand for safety assets ebbed following the positive results of trade talks.

Xi and Trump are expected to sign off on the terms this week in South Korea when they sit down in person for the first time since the U.S. president returned to power. That meeting could reveal details around issues such as China’s purchases of U.S. soybeans, Washington’s plans for shipping fees on Chinese vessels and Beijing’s rare earth export controls.

“We expect the leaders to approve the deal, but whether it will bring lasting relief to markets is less clear—the new reality for U.S.-China ties appears to be one of frequent ruptures and short-term fixes,” Chang Shu, David Qu and Jennifer Welch of Bloomberg Economics wrote in a note.

From Beijing’s perspective, fewer external uncertainties will buy policymakers’ time to focus on supporting the domestic economy and enhancing its tech sufficiency, they added. While Chinese industrial companies saw their earnings surge the most in nearly two years last month, the job market remains gloomy and a years long housing crash is lingering.

The People’s Daily commentary called on the U.S. to stick to the trade and economic consultation mechanism led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Export curbs announced by U.S. officials outside that framework have derailed the system several times in recent months, prompting Beijing to jam its rare earth supply chain that’s critical to American manufacturing.

Bessent said he believed China would delay its latest rare-earth restrictions “for a year while they reexamine it” after the latest talks. It had been unclear how Beijing would enforce its proposed curbs asserting control over any global shipment containing even a trace of certain rare metals from China, a move that had sparked outcry in Europe, too.

Another potential area for a quick win is the 20% fentanyl tariff the U.S. has imposed on Beijing to pressure authorities into halting the flow of precursor chemicals used to make the deadly drug. Relief on that levy—which stacks on top of Liberation Day tariffs—could be a boon for the Asian nation at a time when domestic demand is weak.

China and the U.S. have held five rounds of talks since Trump unveiled the highest U.S. tariffs since the 1930s in April, which ended with Chinese exports to America facing a 55% levy. The People’s Daily piece said those talks were proof that neither nation wanted to decouple.

“The two sides should meet each other halfway, cherish outcomes of every dialogue and continuously build mutual trust and manage differences,” the publication said.

Despite the latest dovish language from both sides, global investors are learning to embrace the new normal of “tension, escalation and truce,” Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. wrote in a Monday note.

“It’s good for the world’s top two largest economies to dial down tensions,” he added, “but we believe the superpower rivalry will likely escalate in the future.”
