[TITLE]How Delays and Bankruptcy Let a Nursing Home Chain Avoid Paying Settlements for Injuries and Deaths:
[TEXT]
This story also ran on CBS News. It can be republished for free.

Nancy Hunt arrived at an emergency room from a Genesis HealthCare nursing home in Pennsylvania in such dreadful shape, including maggots infesting her gangrened foot, that the hospital called an elder abuse hotline and then the police, her son alleged in a lawsuit.

Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a “significant” factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt’s son signed in August 2024.

Yet Genesis hasn’t paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.

Once the nation’s largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.

The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.

When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.

As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.

Nellie Betancourt, shown in a photo with her husband, Gabe, had planned a trip to Las Vegas before she fractured her hip at a Genesis HealthCare rehabilitation center — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. “When she went into that place, I said, ‘Well, she’s going to be taken care of for a few more days and I’ll take her home,’” Gabe says. (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)

“It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,” said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt’s family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.

[TITLE]MMI Wins FDA Clearance and Completes First U.S. Clinical Use of Robotic Microsurgical Dissection Instruments with Symani:
[TEXT]
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MMI (Medical Microinstruments, Inc.), a robotics company dedicated to expanding treatment options and improving outcomes for patients with complex conditions, today announced that it received U.S. Food and Drug Administration 510(k) clearance for its NanoWrist® Scissors and Forceps indicated for soft tissue dissection. This clearance enables delicate tissue manipulation and dissection in robotic microsurgery, expanding the role of the Symani® Surgical System beyond anastomosis to include additional critical steps in complex surgery.

The first U.S. clinical use of the cleared instruments was recently completed at Tampa General Hospital (TGH), home to an established microsurgical robotics program. The lymphovenous bypass (LVB) procedure, leveraging the full capabilities of Symani, represents the world’s first fully robotic-assisted microsurgical operation from initial incision to skin closure.

Dr. Nicholas J. Panetta, MD, FACS, Chair of the Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine and Chief of the Plastic Surgery Institute at TGH, specializes in microvascular reconstructive plastic surgery. For the surgery, Symani and the NanoWrist Instrument Portfolio were utilized to complete a specialized microsurgical technique that redirects tiny lymphatic vessels to nearby veins, helping relieve swelling by restoring fluid drainage. He accessed the surgical site and prepared the lymphatic vessels and veins using the NanoWrist Scissors and Forceps for delicate tissue handling, precise dissection, and vessel preparation. The bypass was then performed with the NanoWrist SuperMicro Needle Holder Suture Cut and SuperMicro Dilator. All instruments in the portfolio offer seven degrees of freedom, delivering precise robotic capabilities and the full benefits of Symani’s motion scaling and tremor reduction features.

"Robotics will define the future of microsurgery, especially in lymphedema work where sub-millimeter precision is essential. I have been able to push the limits of microsurgery to treat some of the smallest and most delicate vessels, and the impact Symani is having on our patients has been transformative,” shared Dr. Panetta. “With robotic enabled dissection, I was able to complete a fully robotic LVB, from incision to closure, with unmatched precision, control and improved ergonomics. These tools are unlocking capabilities that extend beyond the limits of the human hand to support the best possible outcomes for patients.”

MMI’s dissection instruments are the world’s first and smallest fully wristed robotic instruments designed specifically for dissection in open microsurgery. The NanoWrist Scissors and Forceps are designed to preserve tissue integrity and reduce vessel trauma to help improve patient outcomes. This level of precision and control is especially critical in complex procedures such as surgical lymphatic repair, perforator-to-perforator reconstruction, and cancer-related head & neck reconstruction.

"As we continue to evolve Symani, the first dissection instruments are a critical step in that mission,” said Mark Toland, CEO of MMI. “The addition of these capabilities to our platform is game-changing in supermicrosurgical procedures where extreme precision for the smallest vessels is essential. We will continue to develop technologies that advance the future of microsurgery with Symani and transform microsurgical care and countless lives worldwide.”

These achievements follow a string of meaningful milestones for MMI and the microsurgical sector this year, including the company’s advancement into neurosurgery, launching the largest U.S. prospective clinical trial in robotic microsurgery, additional expanded technological and digital surgery capabilities, and gaining reimbursement support for select procedures.

[TITLE]Unprecedented results from the Phase 3 MajesTEC-3 study support TECVAYLI®▼ (teclistamab) plus DARZALEX® (daratumumab) subcutaneous formulation as a potential standard of care as early as second line f:
[TEXT]
Teclistamab and daratumumab subcutaneous (SC) combination led to a statistically significant progression-free survival and overall survival advantage compared to standard treatment after three years of follow-up1

Combination regimen granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by U.S. FDA

BEERSE, BELGIUM, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Johnson & Johnson today announced new data from the investigational Phase 3 MajesTEC-3 study that demonstrate the potential of TECVAYLI®▼ (teclistamab) plus DARZALEX® subcutaneous (daratumumab SC) formulation as early as second line for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).1 Results show an 83.4 percent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to standard regimens at nearly three years follow-up (hazard ratio [HR], 0.17; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.23; P<0.0001).1,2 More than 90 percent of patients who were progression-free at six months (n=249) remained progression-free at three years.1

The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the investigational immunotherapy combination of teclistamab plus daratumumab SC versus daratumumab SC and dexamethasone with either pomalidomide or bortezomib (DPd/DVd) in patients with RRMM who have received 1-3 prior lines of therapy.1 The data were presented as a late-breaking oral presentation and in the press programme at the 2025 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, with simultaneous publication in The New England Journal of Medicine.1,2

“The combination of teclistamab and daratumumab SC offers remarkable efficacy and safety consistent with their known profiles, and, alongside robust infection management protocols, an opportunity to improve patient outcomes across academic and community settings. It has the potential to change the standard of care as a steroid-sparing combination regimen suited for outpatient administration on the familiar daratumumab SC schedule,” said Maria-Victoria Mateos, M.D., Ph.D., Consultant Physician in Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca.* “Teclistamab and daratumumab SC work in a complementary manner by targeting both BCMA and CD38 to prime and activate the immune system. The combination has shown to extend progression-free survival and overall survival versus standard of care as early as second line.”

Significant improvements compared to standard of care were observed across key secondary endpoints, including response rates, minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity, overall survival (OS), and time to worsening of symptoms – revealing the comprehensive impact of the combination across varied patient measures.1 Teclistamab plus daratumumab SC achieved significantly higher overall response rates (89.0 percent vs. 75.3 percent; 95 percent CI, 1.68-4.18; P<0.0001) as well as complete response or better (≥CR) (81.8 percent vs. 32.1 percent; 95 percent CI, 6.47-14.14; P<0.0001).1 Rates of MRD-negativity at ≥CR 10-5 among the evaluable population were 89.3 percent versus 63.0 percent (odds ratio [OR], 5.01; P<0.0001) and at ≥CR 10-6 were 87.5 percent versus 41.8 percent (OR, 9.61; P<0.0001) compared to standard of care at nearly three years follow-up.1,2 OS favoured teclistamab plus daratumumab SC (HR, 0.46; 95 percent CI, 0.32-0.65; P<0.0001) across all prespecified subgroups.1 At three years, OS rates were 83.3 percent and 65.0 percent respectively.1 Additionally, patients experienced fewer symptoms for twice as long with teclistamab plus daratumumab SC versus standard of care, underscoring a significant improvement in patient-reported quality of life outcomes.1

“Daratumumab-based regimens have played a defining role in advancing how multiple myeloma is treated. The MajesTEC-3 study builds on that legacy by evaluating the impact of an off-the-shelf combination of the bispecific antibody teclistamab with daratumumab earlier in the treatment pathway,” said Ester in ‘t Groen, EMEA Therapeutic Area Head Haematology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. “The unprecedented results we’re seeing reflect our commitment to get in front of cancer, strengthening evidence on how the novel combination of teclistamab and daratumumab SC could broaden effective options for people living with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma as early as second line, where the medical need for durable outcomes remains high.”

In the study, teclistamab plus daratumumab SC and standard of care comparators had similar rates of Grade 3/4 (95.1 percent vs. 96.6 percent) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE).1 Most common Grade 3/4 events were cytopenia and infection.1 Infections were observed with teclistamab and daratumumab SC (any grade, 96.5 percent; Grade 3/4, 54.1 percent) and DPd/DVd comparator (any grade, 84.1 percent; Grade 3/4, 43.4 percent).1 Grade 3 or higher infections with teclistamab and daratumumab SC declined after the after six months of treatment with use of established immunoglobulin supplementation and infection prophylaxis protocols, along with switch to monthly dosing.1 Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 60.1 percent of patients treated with teclistamab plus daratumumab SC; all cases were Grade 1/2, did not lead to treatment discontinuation and were effectively managed using standard guidelines.1 Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was rare and occurred in 1.1 percent of patients.1 Serious adverse events occurred in 70.7 percent of patients compared to 62.4 percent of patients treated with the comparator regimen, while treatment discontinuations due to adverse events were low (4.6 percent vs. 5.5 percent).1 Similar rates of deaths due to adverse events were observed with teclistamab and daratumumab SC and DPd/DVd comparator (7.1 percent vs. 5.9 percent).1

"With these data, we are entering a new era in treating multiple myeloma with the first immunotherapy combination to demonstrate superior overall survival as early as second line versus standard of care,” said Sen Zhuang, M.D., Vice President, Oncology Clinical Research, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. “With teclistamab plus daratumumab SC once again we have the potential to set a new standard of care for this disease. We continue to explore how regimens with our bispecifics portfolio can redefine the future for patients.”

Based on these results, Johnson & Johnson is working with regulatory bodies globally to bring the benefits of this combination regimen to eligible patients as quickly as possible. The Company has submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the use of teclistamab and daratumumab SC in combination as a treatment for RRMM to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for the combination regimen; BTD is granted to expedite the development and regulatory review of a medicine that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and is based on preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement over available therapies on a clinically significant endpoint(s).

The sBLA is being reviewed through the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) programme, which enables the agency to initiate their evaluation of the data before the full application is formally submitted. An application has also been submitted to Brazil’s health agency, ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária).

[TITLE]Ghanaian president urges private sector to co-invest in Africa's health industrialization:
[TEXT]
ACCRA, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama on Tuesday urged private sector players to collaborate with African governments in co-investing in the continent's health industrialization to enhance healthcare and service delivery.

At the opening of the two-day World Health Expo Leaders Africa Summit in Accra, the Ghanian capital, Mahama said that Africa seeks a new partnership paradigm, one that is defined not by dependency, but by co-investment, innovation, and shared values.

"So we call on vaccine manufacturers to partner with us to build African vaccine production hubs. We call on pharmaceutical companies to expand into biologics, generics, and essential medicine manufacturing in Africa," Mahama said.

He also urged diagnostics innovators, biotechnology firms, and medical device producers to establish assembly plants with research and development centers and fabrication facilities in Africa to ensure easy access for African health institutions.

Mahama said the continent has learned valuable lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, when the continent was often last to receive support during global health emergencies, underscoring the need for a paradigm shift.

Highlighting the African Continental Free Trade Area as a unified market of about 1.3 billion people, Mahama noted a growing innovation ecosystem and the African Medicines Agency's role in strengthening regulatory alignment.

[TITLE]Gut micro-organisms associated with health, nutrition and dietary interventions:

ZOE PREDICT cohorts definition

The ZOE PREDICT programme comprises several distinct studies that together constitute one of the largest multi-omic health initiatives, linking diet, person-specific metabolic responses to foods, and the gut microbiome. In this work, we considered and harmonized five ZOE PREDICT cohorts: PREDICT 1, PREDICT 2, PREDICT 3 US21, PREDICT 3 US22A, and PREDICT 3 UK22A. The PREDICT 1 cohort (NCT03479866) was described previously9,51. In brief, PREDICT 1 enrolled 1,098 participants (n = 1,001 from the UK and n = 97 from the USA) who underwent a clinical visit to collect anthropometric information and blood samples, followed by an at-home phase during which postprandial responses to both standardized tests and ad libitum meals were recorded. Stool samples were collected at home before the in-person clinical visit. The PREDICT 2 study (NCT03983733) had a similar collection protocol to PREDICT 1 but was conducted entirely remotely and included data from 975 people from 48 US states (including the federal District of Columbia and without participants from North Dakota and Hawaii). The PREDICT 3 cohorts (US21, US22A and UK22A) are research cohorts (NCT04735835) embedded within the ZOE commercial product. Participants provide informed written consent for their data to be used for scientific research purposes. In total, 32,621 samples (n = 11,798 for US21, n = 8,470 for US22A and n = 12,353 UK22A) were collected and retrieved. The studies were fully remote, participants completed health and food questionnaires at baseline, and self-collected and shipped stool samples. Cardiometabolic markers were collected as described below. Furthermore, we considered and analysed two registered clinical nutritional intervention studies, namely METHOD36 (NCT05273268) and BIOME37 (NCT06231706), focusing on the microbiome changes and their links with the two derived SGB-level rankings (ZOE MB health-ranks and diet-ranks). All study protocols are registered and available on clinicaltrials.gov through the clinical trials number and link affiliated with each trial.

Sample collection, DNA extraction and sequencing

For the PREDICT 1 cohort, sample collection, DNA extraction and sequencing were described previously9. The PREDICT 2 samples were collected in Zymo buffer, DNA extraction was performed at QIAGEN Genomic Services using DNeasy 96 PowerSoil Pro, and sequencing was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using the S4 flow cell and targeting 7.5 Gb per sample. The PREDICT 3 samples were self-collected into tubes containing the DNA-Shield Zymo buffer. Sample processing was performed by Zymo and Prebiomics. In brief, DNA extraction by Zymo used the ZymoBIOMICS-96 MagBead DNA kit, whereas Prebiomics used the DNeasy 96 PowerSoil Pro kits. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep Tagmentation kit, following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform used the S4 flow cell and targetted 3.75 Gb per sample.

All raw sequenced data were quality controlled using the preprocessing pipeline available at https://github.com/SegataLab/preprocessing, which comprises three steps: (1) removal of reads with low-quality (Q < 20), too short (length under 75 nt), or with more than two ambiguous bases; (2) removal of host contaminant DNAs (Illumina’s spike-in phiX 174 and human genomes, hg19); and (3) synchronization of paired-end and unpaired reads.

Dietary data processing

In the PREDICT cohorts, we assessed long-term food intakes using FFQs, which were largely consistent across cohorts. Specifically, for PREDICT 1 participants (UK), we used a modified 131-item European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) FFQ52. Participants in PREDICT 2 (USA) were surveyed using a similarly validated Diet History Questionnaire-III FFQ, including 135 items

[TITLE]How Delays and Bankruptcy Let a Nursing Home Chain Avoid Paying Settlements for Injuries and Deaths:
[TEXT]
This story also ran on CBS News. It can be republished for free.

Nancy Hunt arrived at an emergency room from a Genesis HealthCare nursing home in Pennsylvania in such dreadful shape, including maggots infesting her gangrened foot, that the hospital called an elder abuse hotline and then the police, her son alleged in a lawsuit.

Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a “significant” factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt’s son signed in August 2024.

Yet Genesis hasn’t paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.

Once the nation’s largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.

The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.

When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.

As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.

Nellie Betancourt, shown in a photo with her husband, Gabe, had planned a trip to Las Vegas before she fractured her hip at a Genesis HealthCare rehabilitation center — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. “When she went into that place, I said, ‘Well, she’s going to be taken care of for a few more days and I’ll take her home,’” Gabe says. (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)

“It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,” said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt’s family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.

Gabe Betancourt holds an old photograph of his wife, Nellie, that he keeps in his wallet. “I carry her with me everywhere I go,” he says. (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)

Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions
