[TEXT]
Acquisition of leading cannabis company marks major milestone in InterCure’s commercial expansion strategy, bringing access to premium American brands and state-of-the-art cultivation technologies

Transaction comes as Trump administration confirms it is exploring cannabis rescheduling, creating unprecedented potential opportunities for international operators like InterCure

InterCure encouraged by recent regulatory momentum and positioned to capitalize on evolving U.S. cannabis landscape

NEW YORK & HERZLIYA, Israel, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InterCure Ltd. (Nasdaq: INCR) (TASE: INCR) ("InterCure" or the "Company") today announced the strategic acquisition of Botanico Ltd., also known as ISHI ("ISHI"), a premium medical cannabis technology and brand company that delivers immediate access to advanced cultivation technologies and established partnerships with leading American cannabis operators. The acquisition comes as the U.S. cannabis market stands at a historic potential inflection point, with the Trump administration reportedly exploring the rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III1 – a transformative regulatory shift that could unlock unprecedented opportunities for international cannabis companies such as InterCure.

ISHI brings an exclusive partnership with a top tier indoor facility, sophisticated AI-driven cultivation optimization systems, automated production capabilities, and exclusive partnerships with premium U.S. cannabis brands, including established operators like The Flowery, a leading vertically integrated medical cannabis company. The Flowery operates state-of-the-art cultivation and GMP manufacturing facilities alongside the largest delivery system in Florida's medical market. The Flowery also operates the largest retail chain in NY state and has roadmap to continue its aggressive growth in other U.S. markets. Through these partnerships, ISHI has developed exclusive access to highly sought-after American genetics, cult brands and proven cultivation methodologies that have established loyal consumer followings across multiple U.S. markets. The acquisition provides InterCure with immediate access to these award-winning genetics consistently setting U.S. quality standards, advanced operational technologies, and creates substantial competitive advantages as the global medical cannabis market increasingly demands pharmaceutical-grade standards and regulatory frameworks evolve to favor established, compliant operators with proven international capabilities.

"This acquisition represents a significant milestone in our global expansion strategy," said Alexander Rabinovich, CEO of InterCure. "By acquiring ISHI, we gain immediate access to some of America's most sought-after cannabis genetics and proven operational technologies at exactly the moment when we are encouraged by the reported recent momentum in the U.S. around potential cannabis rescheduling. This acquisition also represents an additional growth engine for InterCure, and we expect it to become accretive to our business model already within the first year. Today, InterCure is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this historic potential regulatory shift and deliver substantial value to our shareholders."

"Joining InterCure represents the culmination of years building relationships with America's finest cannabis brands," said Omer Layani, CEO of ISHI. "InterCure's global platform and pharmaceutical-grade standards provide the perfect vehicle to scale these partnerships internationally as regulatory tailwinds create unprecedented opportunities for strategic partnerships between U.S. and international operators."

Elad Kohen, Founder and CEO of The Flowery commented: “At The Flowery, our mission is to deliver the highest expressions of Cannabis quality while creating cultural experiences that reflect and elevate the community that built us. Achieving this requires partners who share our uncompromising standards for the plant and embrace a humble, forward-thinking approach. We’ve worked alongside ISHI for years on this project and found deep alignment on the principles that matter most. Today’s announcement strengthens that partnership with greater access and resources, empowering us to expand into new markets the right way-and continue growing our community.”

The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

[TITLE]Is Artificial Intelligence Worth the Investment?:

U.S. technology firms have spent an estimated $400 billion this year on AI infrastructure. That spending is estimated to increase to $3 trillion worldwide by 2028—raising questions

[TITLE]“Earthquake” in Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia invests $5 billion in Intel, shaking up the balance:
[TEXT]
Newsroom September 18 03:34

Nvidia and Intel have entered into a “mega-deal,” with Nvidia announcing a $5 billion investment in Intel. Both companies will collaborate on developing microchips for computers and data centers, in a surprising move since it strengthens a key competitor.

Nvidia will purchase Intel shares at $23.28 each. Intel will integrate Nvidia’s graphics technology into upcoming PC chips and will supply its processors for data center products based on Nvidia hardware.

The two companies have not provided a timeline for the release of the first products and clarified that this announcement does not affect their future plans.

Intel’s stock “soared” as much as 26% in pre-market trading.

This new funding for Intel follows an approximately 10% investment by the U.S. government in August, with Donald Trump taking on a role as “backer.” In addition, Japan’s SoftBank made an emergency $2 billion investment last month, while Intel has also been raising capital through asset sales. Intel’s current operations are struggling from market share losses and cannot bear the costs of producing advanced chips.

This collaboration highlights the shifting power dynamics in the computer and artificial intelligence industries. Intel gains financial backing and access to top-tier technology from a company it once considered “second-rate.”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that the partnership links Nvidia’s AI ecosystem with Intel’s x86 architecture, creating “a foundation for the next era of computing.”

Intel will provide PC microchips that combine general processing with Nvidia’s powerful graphics in order to compete with AMD, Nvidia’s main graphics rival. In data centers, Intel will supply processors for products incorporating Nvidia’s AI units.

Nvidia continues to design its own processors using Arm Holdings technology, with no changes to its corporate roadmap. With a market cap exceeding $4 trillion, Nvidia’s investment in Intel represents less than 5% of its value.

Nvidia is largely defining the industry’s future through its dominance in AI computing. The demand for new chips to power services such as ChatGPT was anticipated and executed by Nvidia before its competitors. In 2025, Nvidia is projected to generate about $200 billion in revenue, gradually surpassing Intel’s annual performance.

Intel, which once dominated the industry through its advanced manufacturing technology, has failed to develop competitive AI accelerators and now relies on TSMC for producing its top products. Under the leadership of Lip Boo Tan, Intel is moving toward a more open strategy, seeking partnerships and offering third parties access to its manufacturing facilities.
