[TITLE]BioCryst Sells European ORLADEYO Business for $250M Upfront to Focus on US Market:
[TEXT]
BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:BCRX) is one of the best stocks to buy under $20. On October 1, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals announced the successful completion of the previously announced sale of its European ORLADEYO (berotralstat) business to Neopharmed Gentili. The transaction is valued at $250 million upfront, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, with the potential for BioCryst to receive up to $14 million in future milestones based on sales in Central and Eastern Europe.

The divestiture immediately improves BioCryst’s operating margin, as the European business was ~breakeven on a direct basis. BioCryst will now focus on driving ORLADEYO sales in the US, while Neopharmed Gentili will lead commercialization across Europe, retaining the European commercial organization built by BioCryst for operational continuity.

[TITLE]How the German government is going all in on AI – DW – 10:
[TEXT]
Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s cabinet agreed on a "modernization agenda" this week, which includes the use of AI. Critics have questioned how much of this is in the public interest.

Reducing bureaucracy costs by 25% by 2029, offering more public services online and using artificial intelligence in government and in courts are some of the projects Chancellor Friedrich Merz's cabinet agreed to this past week.

Among the plans for integrating AI into everyday use is an online platform for export-based businesses to bundle information on export regulations and credit options, and expediting visa processing by using AI to review an applicant's documents.

The "Modernization Agenda," as Digitalization Minister Karsten Wildberger has called it, comes on the heels of the similarly titled "High-Tech Agenda." Presented by Dorothee Bär, federal minister of research, technology and space, in July, the "High-Tech Agenda" highlights AI as one of the six key technologies the government will promote, alongside biotechnology and microelectronics.

AI minister makes his debut

A more visible example of the government's recent AI push is the so-called Weimatar, an AI avatar of State Minister for Culture and Media Wolfram Weimer. The Weimatar can speak 100 languages and is promised to be an example of "fair AI, that protects creativity and strengthens our democratic public sphere." Its purpose is not only to more easily reach a broader audience on social media, but also to save time internally at the ministry with, for example, training videos that can be made quickly and kept up to date.

Holger Hoos, a Humboldt Foundation Professor of AI at RWTH Aachen University, does not believe the tech is understood well enough by those in power to promise a fair and responsible use of AI.

In 2023, a group of Humboldt Professors of AI, Germany's preeminent researchers in the field, met with policymakers to prepare a list of suggestions for ethical and useful AI in government. This included the recommendation that the government be principally guided by science in its decision-making, not businesses.

"A government has a moral duty to follow competent advice. You can't just follow the advice from industry, which often has vested interests in certain outcomes," Hoos said.

At the same time, the expert in machine learning takes it as a good sign that Wildberger and the digitalization ministry have a core mission for improving Germany's lagging digital infrastructure.

For his part, Wildberger has pointed out that Germany risks becoming hopelessly left behind if it does not embrace AI more swiftly.

"AI is the key to future growth, and AI is in full swing. It will change the world more — and is already doing so — than any technology before it," he told the Funke media group. "If we don't use AI widely, we risk more jobs than if we use it bravely and responsibly."

AI is also widely used at the state and local levels. In the southern state of Baden-Württemberg, for example, a raft of offers have been made public: from AI-text streamlining to a government chatbot in the city of Ludwigsburg. The state government also touts its use of ChatGPT, owned by US-based OpenAI, to "optimize public administration."

Generative AI hype already waning

Questions are also being raised, both in traditional and social media,

By test type, the HPV testing and Pap test market is segmented into HPV testing and Pap tests. In 2024, HPV testing accounted for the dominant share of the market. This dominance is attributed to the growing global shift toward HPV testing as the primary screening method for cervical cancer, supported by its higher sensitivity and accuracy compared to Pap cytology alone. Regulatory bodies and health organizations, including the WHO, are increasingly recommending HPV-based screening protocols, which have accelerated adoption across both developed and emerging regions. The ability of HPV tests to detect high-risk viral strains before the development of precancerous lesions provides significant clinical value, driving their preference over traditional Pap tests. Additionally, advancements in molecular diagnostics, automation, and high-throughput platforms have further strengthened the position of HPV testing. While Pap tests continue to play an important role in many screening programs, the rising emphasis on early detection and prevention through molecular assays is ensuring HPV testing remains the dominant test type in the global market.

By care setting, the HPV testing and Pap test market is segmented into hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, and physicians' offices & clinics. Hospitals held the largest share of the market in 2024 and are also projected to register the fastest growth over the forecast period. This growth is driven by their ability to handle large-scale cervical cancer screening programs, supported by advanced infrastructure, trained specialists, and integrated diagnostic facilities. Hospitals are increasingly adopting molecular HPV testing platforms and automation technologies, which allow for high-throughput testing and enhanced accuracy. In addition, they serve as referral centers for complex cases and play a central role in organized national and regional screening initiatives, which continue to boost testing volumes. The increasing emphasis on preventive healthcare, coupled with hospital investments in digital pathology and data integration systems, is expected to further strengthen their role. These factors position hospitals as not only the dominant care setting but also the fastest-expanding segment in the global HPV testing and Pap test market.

By geography, the HPV testing and Pap test market has been segmented into five geographical regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. North America holds the leading position in the HPV testing and Pap test market, supported by a strong healthcare infrastructure, established diagnostic networks, and strict regulatory standards that emphasize accuracy and reliability in testing. The region conducts a high volume of cervical cancer screenings each year, driven by growing awareness, preventive healthcare programs, and adoption of early detection initiatives. This fuels steady demand for consumables, reagents, and testing platforms that provide consistent results. Market growth is further supported by the presence of major global players in HPV and Pap testing, many of which are based in or have significant operations in North America. These companies invest in advanced molecular assays, automated testing systems, and digital tools that enhance efficiency and minimize errors. High healthcare spending, continuous R&D investment, and the rapid adoption of new diagnostic technologies collectively sustain North America's leadership in the global HPV testing and Pap test market.

Abivax Announces Late-Breaking Presentation of 8-Week ABTECT Trial Results with Updated Safety Data

50 mg once-daily dose of obefazimod led to a pooled 16.4% (p<0.0001) placebo-adjusted clinical remission rate at Week 8; met primary and all key secondary endpoints in both ABTECT 1 and ABTECT 2

ABTECT trials enrolled refractory patient population with 47% of participants having prior inadequate response to advanced therapy, among whom 21% had prior inadequate response to JAK inhibitor therapy

Obefazimod treatment was well tolerated with no new safety signals identified for both the 25mg and 50mg doses

Abivax to present a second late-breaking abstract on October 6. Management to host a conference call to discuss results of both late-breaking abstracts at 9am ET / 3pm CET on October 6.

PARIS, France – October 05, 2025 – 5:00 PM CET – Abivax SA (Euronext Paris: FR0012333284 – ABVX / Nasdaq: ABVX) (“Abivax” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, today announced results from the first of two late-breaking presentations at the United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Meeting in Berlin, Germany. The presentation includes results from Abivax’s Phase 3 ABTECT 8-Week Induction Trials investigating obefazimod for the treatment of moderate-to-severely active ulcerative colitis, including previously reported findings and additional safety data at week 8.

“There is an urgent need for new therapies to treat ulcerative colitis that deliver durable efficacy, safety, and the simplicity of oral, once-daily dosing,” said Bruce Sands, MD*, Professor of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. "The ABTECT Trials enrolled individuals with advanced disease, including many who had failed multiple lines of advanced therapy and a significant percentage of patients with prior JAK inhibitor failure. The refractory nature of this population underscores the significance of the results presented today.”

A total of 1272 patients were enrolled across the ABTECT 1 & 2 trials. In the pooled full data set across ABTECT 1 & 2, no signal for serious, severe, or opportunistic infections or malignancies was observed. The most commonly reported TEAEs were headache (6%-placebo, 16%-25mg, 24.1%-50mg) with <1% of headaches leading to study discontinuation (0.3% at 25mg; 1.1% at 50mg), and nausea (1.3% in placebo, 5.0% at 25mg, 7.2% at 50mg).

Results from the ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2 trials demonstrated that obefazimod met its FDA primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 8 in the 50 mg once-daily dose regimen for both trials. Individually, ABTECT-1 showed a placebo-adjusted clinical remission rate of 19.3% (p<0.0001) and ABTECT-2 demonstrated 13.4% (p=0.0001), each at the 50 mg once-daily dose, with all key secondary efficacy endpoints being met.
