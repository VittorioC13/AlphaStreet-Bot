[TITLE]Missoni May Soon Become Part of the Authentic Brands Portfolio: Sources:
[TEXT]
Authentic Brands Group is in exclusive negotiations to purchase the Missoni brand, according to sources. If things go according to plan, a deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

Authentic, the New York-based owner of Reebok, Champion and other high-profile brands, declined to comment.

The Missoni family owns 58.8 percent of the shares of the company while an investor, Fondo Strategico Italiano, bought a 41.2 percent stake in 2018. The line is designed by Alberto Caliri. Angela Missoni, daughter of the late founders Tai and Rosita, is the president of the company while her brother Luca is in charge of special events and exhibitions.

The Missoni company, led by chief executive officer Livio Proli, had no comment Tuesday on the sale speculation.

However, according to sources, Missoni fits well into the Authentic playbook, which is to purchase brands with global potential and the ability to be licensed into an array of products.

“It fits into their business model,” one source said. “It’s global and has multiple categories.”

Although WHP Global, a smaller competitor to Authentic in the brand management space, was also interested in Missoni, its interest has waned. Instead, it is said to be pursuing a purchase of Lands’ End, which said earlier this year that it was exploring strategic alternatives. WHP did not respond to requests for comment on Lands’ End or Missoni.

Missoni is higher priced than many of the brands in the Authentic portfolio, but the company has recently been exploring a deeper move into the luxury space. It has a joint venture with Saks Global in a business called the Authentic Luxury Group, which includes a focus on its Barneys New York, Judith Leiber Couture, Hervé Legér and Vince brands.

Most recently, Authentic was in active negotiations to buy Marc Jacobs from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. But those negotiations ended recently and sources said LVMH is not currently seeking to sell the brand. “It’s on hold for now,” the source said. “It could be for a year, two years, or forever. No one knows.”

The source added that Authentic’s founder and chief executive officer, Jamie Salter, had grown quite fond of Marc Jacobs, the designer, who still has an interest in the company. Apparently Jacobs still wants to hold runway shows and develop his high-end collection and although Authentic had apparently been willing to allow that for a limited amount of time, it wasn’t going to be forever, so the deal didn’t happen.

“It had nothing to do with money,” the source said. “Authentic wasn’t asking for a discount but Marc still wanted his fashion shows and his Met Gala looks, which are very important to him and his brand. Nobody should buy Marc Jacobs without Marc Jacobs. They wanted a happy Marc and that wasn’t going to happen, so the talks ended.”

Like many deals, some may look good on paper, but just like pre-arranged marriages, they may be difficult to be accepted by the parties — and eventually fall through. One extenuating circumstance for brands such as Missoni and Etro, which has also been rumored to be for sale for years, is that the founding families are still invested in those companies and can put the brakes on any sale.

Yvonne Pengue, founder and director of London-based executive search firm Spot on Minds, said that “behind family-owned companies, there is this real, consistent effort to build the business long-term, rather than seeking a short-term win, uplift in sales, or retail expansion. It’s much more careful. On the other hand, innovation sometimes could be a little bit slower in order to preserve the brand’s founding legacy.”

Pengue believe “there could be a fear that the outside buyer will prioritize profit over purpose or dilute the brand’s essence. The most successful acquisitions are the ones where the buyer commits to heritage and maintaining the values, the identity and the codes of the brand, while evolving them and growing the brand. It takes a lot of courage to sell a company that bears your name and you want it to be in a safe pair of hands. Because with the families, it’s

[TITLE]How e.l.f. Beauty’s CFO is balancing value, innovation, and tariffs:
[TEXT]
Good morning. Amid persistent economic headwinds and shifting trade policy, e.l.f. Beauty is finding opportunity in constraint. The company’s focus on affordability continues to win over consumers, even as shoppers grow more selective, according to CFO Mandy Fields.

“We’re still a value to our consumers when people are pulling back and being more choiceful with their spending,” Fields told me. Even after a recent $1 price increase, 75% of e.l.f. Beauty’s products remain priced at $10 or less, she said.

“If a shopper only has $20 to spend, e.l.f. is a great option,” Fields said. “You can still come in, buy a couple of products, and still have money left in your pocketbook. That’s exactly where we want to be for our consumers.”

A longtime favorite among Gen Z, e.l.f. Beauty, a multi-brand beauty company, is also gaining traction with millennials and Gen X as the brand doubles down on value and trend-driven innovation.

Last week, e.l.f. Beauty reported results for the three and six months ended September 30. Quarterly net sales rose 14% to $343.9 million from $301.1 million a year earlier—slightly below analyst expectations.

After choosing not to issue full-year guidance last quarter, the company now forecasts fiscal 2026 revenue between $1.55 billion and $1.57 billion, representing 18%–20% growth. Analysts had expected closer to $1.65 billion. Even so, adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share topped consensus estimates of $0.57.

The company’s category-leading growth has now extended across 27 consecutive quarters, CEO Tarang Amin said in the company’s earnings release.

Tackling tariffs through diversification

One of the biggest challenges ahead: tariffs. The company expects more than $50 million in additional annual costs tied to higher U.S. tariffs in fiscal 2026. According to Fields, e.l.f. Beauty’s weighted average tariff rate has surged to

How Does FDA Redefine Dietary Fibers: Convenient Regulations for American Key Players

The FDA’s definition of dietary fiber has reshaped the global dietary fibers market, driving innovation, reformulation, and compliance-driven growth across the food and nutrition industry. By recognizing both naturally occurring “intrinsic and intact” fibers and select isolated or synthetic fibers with proven physiological benefits, the FDA has established a science-backed framework that redefines product labeling, consumer perception, and industry standards. This regulatory clarity is accelerating investment in research-backed ingredients, fostering demand for functional foods, and positioning dietary fiber as a central element in the evolving health and wellness economy. As manufacturers align formulations with FDA guidelines, market differentiation and consumer trust emerge as powerful growth catalysts for the dietary fibers sector.

These posts often feature the rams of fiber in delivering anecdotal reports of digestive advantages users experience for perfect regularity, developed satiety, and improved energy.

As the trend develops, it also serves as a crucial consideration, which increases fiber intake too quickly, which can lead to digestive discomfort, including gas and bloating. It includes intentionally developing any daily fiber intake that mainly gives suggested levels through fiber-rich food and sometimes supplements, too.

Challenge

Complexities Backs the Growth of Dietary Fibers

The dietary fiber industry experiences challenges linked to inconstant and developing regulatory standards, complicated extraction and processing technologies, supply chain instability, and consumer hesitation. The regulatory approval procedure for the latest dietary fibers and functional fiber products can be expensive and time-consuming. This can hide inventions and delay the industry entry of the latest products.

Dietary Fibers Market Regional Analysis

Asia Pacific Dominated the Dietary Fibers Market in 2024.

The Asia Pacific region has dominated the region in 2024, as for several Asian users, "healthier food” means less sugar, plant-based, organic, and fortified with necessary nutrients.

Dietary Fibers Market Segmental Analysis

Raw Material Analysis

The cereals and grains segment has dominated the market in 2024 as they have gained attention as a source of dietary fiber initially due to rising scientific and public awareness of their health advantages during the 20th century. In wholegrain patterns, cereals serve crucial fat, protein, minerals, and vitamins as well as dietary fibre and energy. On the other hand, wholegrains are also high in necessary dietary fibre, which is known to develop health and well-being because of probiotic characteristics and by developing the immune system.

The nuts and seeds segment is expected to rise fastest during the forecast period. Nuts are initially the seeds of plants. Many are the seeds of peanuts, trees, and hence, are the seeds of a legume. Many, that count cashews and walnuts, develop inside leathery fruits, with the nuts parallel to the peach pit within a peach. Others, such as chestnuts and hazelnuts, are differentiated as true botanical nuts (that are rigid dry fruits which do not open to consume as a separate seed.

Just like the seeds that are known as nuts, culinary seeds originate from flowers (sunflowers), vegetables ( pumpkins), or crops that are grown for a variety of uses (like flax or hemp). The advantages the seeds deliver have mostly healthy fibre, fats, and some fiber of

[TITLE]VCI Global unveils crypto treasury plan, backs Tether’s payments arm OOBIT:
[TEXT]
Malaysia-based VCI Global (Nasdaq: VCIG) announced plans to acquire $100 million in OOB tokens and oversee the digital treasury of OOBIT, a Singapore-based crypto payments platform launched in 2017.

According to a Tuesday announcement, Tether will become the largest shareholder in VCI Global through its stake in OOBIT. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, CMCC Global and 468 Capital are also investors.

VCI Global acquired $50 million in OOB tokens from the OOB Foundation at a $200 million market capitalization, or $0.20 per token, by issuing company shares as payment. The company plans to purchase an additional $50 million worth of OOB tokens on the open market after its official launch.

VCI is a technology and investment company that develops platforms spanning artificial intelligence, digital finance and data infrastructure. In February 2024, it raised $25 million in a Series A round to expand its crypto payments app.

On Tuesday, the company’s shares fell by over 20% in early trading following the announcement.

OOBIT races toward stablecoin payments

OOBIT rolled out its crypto-to-fiat payments app in April 2022. The platform enables merchants to accept crypto payments and cash out their funds in fiat currency.

Since May 2024, OOBIT has integrated with The Open Network to facilitate retail payments through Tether’s stablecoins USDt (USDT) and its gold-backed token, Tether Gold (XAUt).

The crypto payments space is crowded with traditional payment infrastructure providers and fintech companies racing to enhance stablecoin payments.

In October, Visa announced it was rolling out stablecoin support across four new blockchains. A few months earlier, in April, Stripe began testing its upcoming stablecoins payment network, Tempo.

A March report by OOBIT revealed that 70% of crypto payments in the European Union were made for food and beverage, as well as other retail purchases, with an average purchase amount of $8.36.

[TITLE]How To Survive What Comes Next:
[TEXT]
Aside from economic collapse scenarios, many countries are in the process of eliminating physical cash and coins. Instead, everyone has an account that holds their money. You cannot purchase goods or services without access to government-based cryptocurrency. Even if the currency itself is still backed by faith in the government, you have to use this electronic system.

The result is multiple problems that could leave you in a situation where you have the money in the bank to pay your bills and purchase goods and services, yet you cannot do so.

These threats include:

These hacks usually affect the bank or primary clearinghouse rather than a specific person’s account. You may be unable to purchase goods or services for hours or days. While this is inconvenient, it isn’t as bad as a full collapse, where the banks close for good.

[TITLE]Data Centers Devour Electricity. Private Equity Is Buying Utilities to Cash In.:
[TEXT]
The seizure of public utilities for the sake of profit may lead to a disaster for consumers — and the planet.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today!

Ratepayers across the U.S. are facing rising electric bills — a trend that could be turbocharged by Wall Street’s growing effort to capture the electric utilities we all depend on.

A critical turning point in this development occurred in October when Minnesota state regulators greenlit the acquisition of Allete by asset management behemoth BlackRock — set to become Allete’s majority stakeholder — and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Allete owns Minnesota Power, the main electric utility in northern Minnesota. The approval came against significant community opposition and, as Truthout previously reported, an administrative law judge’s report that strongly recommended against the deal.

With the acquisition, BlackRock will turn Allete from a publicly traded company into a private one. Moreover, BlackRock is now gunning for utility giant AES, which has utilities in Ohio and Indiana along with other extensive U.S. and international operations, while another private equity titan, Blackstone, is seeking approval to acquire TXNM Energy, with hundreds of thousands of customers in New Mexico and Texas. Private equity’s escalating run on utilities is largely driven by the boom in data centers — massive consumers of electricity — and the guaranteed rates of return that utilities offer.

Critics of the buyouts say this is a deeply alarming trend, as firms like BlackRock and Blackstone will likely impose a private equity model — opaque, extractive, laser-focused on profit — over basic services. Even well-intentioned state regulators, opponents contend, will be no match for these massively-resourced companies as they look to bulldoze through any obstacles toward enriching their wealthy investors.

Alissa Jean Schafer, climate director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said the Allete deal’s approval was “precedent-setting” for private equity’s growing incursion into utilities.

“The approval of this deal sends a signal that our critical infrastructure is now up for sale to the highest bidder,” said Schafer.

Victory for BlackRock

When BlackRock’s infrastructure arm, Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), announced a $6.2 billion deal in May 2024 to acquire Allete and take the company private, many local organizers, community members, and ratepayers in Northern Minnesota staunchly opposed the deal, which needed approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC).

Their fears that a private equity takeover of their electric utility could weaken transparency and raise rates seemed vindicated in July when, after months of comments from all sides, an administrative law judge unequivocally recommended the Minnesota PUC reject the deal. The report stated in stark terms that BlackRock would “do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

“That’s when the influence wielding and the political machinations really ramped up,” Maggie Schuppert, an organizer with CURE, a rural community advocacy group intervening against the acquisition, told Truthout.

Minnesota’s Department of Commerce, an important and influential party that participated in the review process of the acquisition, soon reversed its initial opposition to the deal after some concessions from Allete. Records obtained by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project indicate that Pete Wyckoff, the commerce department’s deputy commissioner of energy resources, had cozy communications with Allete as a deal was being worked out.

Reporting from The Lever showed that a former Minnesota PUC commissioner now working on behalf of BlackRock appears to have coordinated with building trades unions to back the deal, which a representative of the union denied, despite evidence showing the former commissioner’s digital footprint on filings from the union in favor of the takeover. Meanwhile, some “clean energy” groups came out in favor of the acquisition after developing relationships with private stakeholders and BlackRock attorneys. In one instance, a “clean energy” nonprofit held a benefit with Allete as a “VIP sponsor.”

At the PUC’s first meeting on the acquisition, Schuppert said it became clear that commissioners were intent on approving the deal, even as PUC staff warned

[TITLE]Missoni May Soon Become Part of the Authentic Brands Portfolio: Sources:
[TEXT]
Authentic Brands Group is in exclusive negotiations to purchase the Missoni brand, according to sources. If things go according to plan, a deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

Authentic, the New York-based owner of Reebok, Champion and other high-profile brands, declined to comment.

The Missoni family owns 58.8 percent of the shares of the company while an investor, Fondo Strategico Italiano, bought a 41.2 percent stake in 2018. The line is designed by Alberto Caliri. Angela Missoni, daughter of the late founders Tai and Rosita, is the president of the company while her brother Luca is in charge of special events and exhibitions.

The Missoni company, led by chief executive officer Livio Proli, had no comment Tuesday on the sale speculation.

However, according to sources, Missoni fits well into the Authentic playbook, which is to purchase brands with global potential and the ability to be licensed into an array of products.

“It fits into their business model,” one source said. “It’s global and has multiple categories.”

Although WHP Global, a smaller competitor to Authentic in the brand management space, was also interested in Missoni, its interest has waned. Instead, it is said to be pursuing a purchase of Lands’ End, which said earlier this year that it was exploring strategic alternatives. WHP did not respond to requests for comment on Lands’ End or Missoni.

Missoni is higher priced than many of the brands in the Authentic portfolio, but the company has recently been exploring a deeper move into the luxury space. It has a joint venture with Saks Global in a business called the Authentic Luxury Group, which includes a focus on its Barneys New York, Judith Leiber Couture, Hervé Legér and Vince brands.

Most recently, Authentic was in active negotiations to buy Marc Jacobs from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. But those negotiations ended recently and sources said LVMH is not currently seeking to sell the brand. “It’s on hold for now,” the source said. “It could be for a year, two years, or forever. No one knows.”

The source added that Authentic’s founder and chief executive officer, Jamie Salter, had grown quite fond of Marc Jacobs, the designer, who still has an interest in the company. Apparently Jacobs still wants to hold runway shows and develop his high-end collection and although Authentic had apparently been willing to allow that for a limited amount of time, it wasn’t going to be forever, so the deal didn’t happen.

“It had nothing to do with money,” the source said. “Authentic wasn’t asking for a discount but Marc still wanted his fashion shows and his Met Gala looks, which are very important to him and his brand. Nobody should buy Marc Jacobs without Marc Jacobs. They wanted a happy Marc and that wasn’t going to happen, so the talks ended.”

Like many deals, some may look good on paper, but just like pre-arranged marriages, they may be difficult to be accepted by the parties — and eventually fall through. One extenuating circumstance for brands such as Missoni and Etro, which has also been rumored to be for sale for years, is that the founding families are still invested in those companies and can put the brakes on any sale.

Yvonne Pengue, founder and director of London-based executive search firm Spot on Minds, said that “behind family-owned companies, there is this real, consistent effort to build the business long-term, rather than seeking a short-term win, uplift in sales, or retail expansion. It’s much more careful. On the other hand, innovation sometimes could be a little bit slower in order to preserve the brand’s founding legacy.”

Pengue believe “there could be a fear that the outside buyer will prioritize profit over purpose or dilute the brand’s essence. The most successful acquisitions are the ones where the buyer commits to heritage and maintaining the values, the identity and the codes of the brand, while evolving them and growing the brand. It takes a lot of courage to sell a company that bears your name and you want it to be in a safe pair of hands. Because with the families, it’s

[TITLE]Denim Jeans Market Trends, Opportunities, and Forecasts, 2020-2024 & 2025-2030 Featuring Levi Strauss, VF, The Gap, H&M, Kering, Pepe Jeans, PVH, Bestseller, and U.S. Polo:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Denim Jeans Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Denim Jeans Market was valued at USD 85.42 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 121.76 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 6.09%

The global denim jeans market continues to thrive, driven by changing fashion trends, rising disposable incomes, and a growing preference for casual and comfortable clothing. Denim remains a staple across demographics due to its durability, versatility, and evolving designs. Increasing urbanization and the influence of Western culture have boosted demand in emerging economies. Consumers are showing strong interest in eco-friendly jeans made from organic cotton and produced with sustainable practices. The rise of e-commerce has further expanded market access, offering diverse styles and personalized options.

Key Market Drivers

Shifting Consumer Preferences Toward Casual and Versatile Apparel

One of the most significant drivers of the global denim jeans market is the growing consumer inclination toward casual and versatile clothing. In today's fashion landscape, comfort and practicality have taken precedence, with denim jeans emerging as a preferred wardrobe staple for individuals across age groups and professions. Majority of Americans buy apparel primarily for daily wear rather than for vacations (only 29% of clothing purchases were vacation-related), underscoring a clear shift toward practical, durable, and multifunctional garments like jeans. As work-from-home culture and hybrid working models become increasingly common, especially post-pandemic, the demand for semi-formal yet comfortable attire has surged.

Denim jeans fulfill this need by offering a blend of style, durability, and comfort. The adaptability of jeans - easily paired with both casual and formal tops - has enhanced their popularity among urban youth and professionals alike. Additionally, the emergence of denim in new fits, finishes, and silhouettes has made it a year-round essential for both men and women. From slim and skinny fits to relaxed and baggy styles, evolving preferences in fashion have led brands to constantly innovate, making jeans not only relevant but integral to the modern wardrobe.

Key Market Challenges

High Environmental Impact and Sustainability Pressures

One of the most pressing challenges facing the global denim jeans market is its significant environmental footprint. Traditional denim production is resource-intensive, requiring large quantities of water, energy, and chemicals, particularly during the dyeing and finishing processes. A single pair of jeans can consume thousands of liters of water and generate chemical waste, contributing to water pollution and carbon emissions.

As consumer awareness of environmental issues grows, brands are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices, yet shifting to eco-friendly methods often involves high initial investments, changes in supply chain processes, and sourcing more expensive raw materials like organic cotton or recycled fibers. Smaller manufacturers and brands may struggle to meet these demands due to limited capital and technical expertise. Furthermore, "greenwashing" - the practice of making misleading environmental claims - has led to consumer skepticism, requiring brands to provide credible third-party certifications and transparency in their supply chains. Balancing the need for sustainable innovation with cost efficiency and scalability remains a complex and ongoing challenge for the denim industry.

Key Market Trends

Shift Toward Sustainable and Ethical Denim Production

Sustainability has emerged as a transformative trend in the global denim jeans market, driven by growing environmental awareness and increasing demand for ethical consumption. Consumers are no longer just buying jeans based on style or fit - they are actively seeking information

[TITLE]Simon Says ‘How Ya Like Me Now?’:
[TEXT]
In the depths of the pandemic just a few short years ago, malls and brick-and-mortar retail in general were in dire straits, with mounting closures (and prominent bankruptcies such as Sears and Toys R Us), disappearing foot traffic, and the seemingly unstoppable rise of e-commerce.

Even Simon Property Group, or SPG, a giant in the sector with 232 locations globally, saw a 20 percent cash flow decline during a tumultuous 2020 and sued one of its biggest tenants, Gap, for back rent.

But steady performance from this multigenerational mall concern has seen it ascend to a loftier, steadier perch since.

“Retail is a bit like Michael Myers from ‘Halloween,’” said Mark Sigal, CEO of Datex Property Solutions. “How many times has he been declared dead only to pop his head up?”

And, as retail continues to rise again, few owners and operators can claim such concentrated control of top-flight spaces as SPG. The firm’s second-quarter earnings this year showed a dramatic increase in net income — from $493.5 million during the same period a year before to $556.1 million — and an occupancy rate of 96 percent, an annual increase of 40 basis points. The performance led CEO David Simon to declare, “We’re quite bullish

[TEXT]
MILAN — Luxury Italian cashmere brand Malo is coming back Stateside, courtesy of an exclusive partnership with Saks Global.

Less than eight months after Glickman Capital — led by technology and telecoms entrepreneur David Glickman — acquired the ailing knitwear label, the relaunch strategy set in motion by newly installed chief executive officer Michelle Kessler-Sanders is hitting its first high with the debut of a capsule collection for pre-spring 2026 in the U.S. and globally.

In the country it will be available starting Tuesday at four physical Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus doors across the U.S., in addition to the respective e-commerce sites.

“I joined five months ago and the very first point on the agenda was evaluate, elevate, reset,” Kessler-Sanders said in an interview. “We have made significant changes already and improvements in bringing the quality back to where it was and…bringing Malo back to its rightful place.”

Entrusted by the new owner, Kessler-Sanders said that since her arrival in June, Malo has recruited a new creative team from around the world.

The company remains based in Florence and has opened an office and showroom in Milan where it will host its first sales campaign for the prefall 2026 collection, the first to be fully developed by the new design team.

Hinged on the reinterpretation of archival styles, the women’s only, 10-piece capsule debuting in the U.S. comprises hooded knits, oversize cardigans and crewnecks, as well as hand-embroidered numbers bearing Fair Isle and flower motifs.

“It’s based on our archives, but not looking backward,” Kessler-Sanders said. The rationale was “what should we do that reintroduces the brand to this incredible market [the U.S.] where it was so beloved for so many years?” she noted. “Let’s bring back beauty…I want beauty in the world again.”

Marking the collection’s launch, Malo conscripted young British photographer Nikolai von Bismarck to portray models against a placid seaside landscape, clad in pieces from the capsule as well as menswear carryovers. The campaign was developed under the creative direction of David Lipman and his studio, who also masterminded a new visual identity and web platform for the brand.
