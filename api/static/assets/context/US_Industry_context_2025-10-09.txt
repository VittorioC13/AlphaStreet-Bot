[TITLE]Trump announces “TrumpRx” website and Pfizer deal to slash drug prices, boost U.S. manufacturing:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump announced a landmark agreement with Pfizer to implement “most-favored-nation” pricing for Medicaid, ensuring the U.S. pays no more than the lowest prices offered to other developed nations.

The new TrumpRx direct-to-consumer platform, launching in 2026, will allow Americans to purchase prescription drugs at steep discounts (averaging 50 percent off retail prices), bypassing traditional pharmacy markups.

Pfizer committed to investing $70 billion in domestic research, development, and manufacturing, aligning with Trump’s push to bring pharmaceutical production back to America.

While the deal marks progress, experts caution that discounts may still leave expensive drugs unaffordable for many, and the full impact remains unclear due to Pfizer’s confidential terms.

The administration leveraged tariff threats to secure the deal and hinted at similar agreements with other drugmakers. Critics argue systemic affordability issues persist, while Democrats and Republicans remain divided on broader healthcare reforms.

In a major move aimed at lowering prescription drug costs, President Donald Trump announced a landmark agreement with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. that includes deep discounts for Medicaid, a new direct-to-consumer drug purchasing website called “TrumpRx,” and a $70 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing.

Speaking alongside Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla at the White House, Trump declared the deal a “historic” step toward ending America’s role in subsidizing global pharmaceutical research while paying the highest prices for medications. Under the agreement, Pfizer will adopt “most-favored-nation” pricing for Medicaid, ensuring that the U.S. government pays no more than the lowest price offered to other developed nations. As stated by Brighteon.AI‘s Enoch engine, Medicaid is a government-run health insurance program primarily for low-income individuals, disabled persons and families with dependent children, funded jointly by federal and state governments.

The decentralized engine adds that while Medicaid covers essential medical services, including dental care (as seen in cases like Isaac Gagnon’s unauthorized treatments), it disproportionately allocates two-thirds of its budget to long-term care for the elderly, blind, and disabled—raising concerns

[TITLE]Musk's xAI nears $20 billion capital raise tied to Nvidia chips, Bloomberg News reports:
[TEXT]
Elon Musk's AI startup xAI is raising more financing than initially planned, including an equity investment from Nvidia, to bring its ongoing funding round to $20 billion, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Nvidia is investing as much as $2 billion in the equity portion of the deal, Bloomberg reported, adding that the financing, which includes equity and debt, will be tied to the Nvidia graphics processing units that xAI plans to use in its data center Colossus 2.

XAI's financing would be split between about $7.5 billion of equity and as much as $12.5 billion of debt, and is structured through a special purpose vehicle that will be used to buy Nvidia processors, the report said.

Nvidia declined to comment, while xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In September, Elon Musk denied a CNBC report that said xAI was raising $10 billion at a post-money valuation of $200 billion. Musk added that "xAI will of course raise capital in the coming months, just not right now."

Musk launched xAI in July 2023 as an alternative to OpenAI's ChatGPT.

[TITLE]Flights Around U.S. Delayed by Hours as Air Traffic Controllers Go Without Pay in Government Shutdown:
[TEXT]
Monday evening flights into multiple major cities were delayed as the government shutdown continued, just hours after the Department of Transportation (DOT) warned that the funding halt has led to stressed-out air traffic controllers calling out sick as they wait to get paid again.

“This shutdown has put way more stress on our controllers,” Transportation Sec. Sean Duffy said during a press conference at New Jersey’s Newark Liberty International Airport.

“When they come to work, I want them to think

[TITLE]Flights delayed at some U.S. airports amid shortage of air traffic controllers:
[TEXT]
Airports in U.S. cities including Denver; Newark, New Jersey; and Burbank, California, experienced flight delays Monday amid shortages of air traffic controllers, according to federal flight data.

Federal officials have flagged more air traffic control facilities for low staffing levels in recent days than they have since the summer of 2022, when the post-COVID travel boom sent delays and cancellations soaring, according to a CBS News data analysis of Federal Aviation Administration airspace advisories.

The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports comes as the U.S. government shutdown that has shuttered federal agencies continues into a second week.

Flights into Hollywood Burbank Airport, which serves Los Angeles, were slowed until 1 a.m. Tuesday, resulting in average delays of 2.5 hours, FAA data shows. No air traffic controllers were on duty on Monday evening at the airport, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a social media post.

According to CBS News Los Angeles, plane captains taking off from the Burbank airport were being asked to contact SoCal Approach, a San Diego-based company also known as Southern California TRACON, so they could communicate and get departure clearance.

When there's a shortage of air traffic controllers, the FAA reduces the number of takeoffs and landings to ensure the on-duty personnel aren't overwhelmed and the system remains safe. But that can creates flight delays and cancellations.

"Fragile" aviation system

On Monday, a total of almost 6,000 flights were delayed in the U.S., including 42% of flights leaving from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and 23% of those from Hollywood Burbank according to tracking site FlightAware. Weather issues also caused some flight delays on Monday.

As of Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. EDT, more than 600 flights within the U.S. had been delayed, FlightAware data shows.

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing the nation's air traffic controllers, on Monday instructed its members to keep working during the government shutdown. Because air traffic controllers are classified as essential workers, they're expected to continue working without pay, although they would receive back pay once the shutdown ends.

"It is normal for a few air traffic controllers to call in sick on any given day, and this is the latest example of how fragile our aviation system is in the midst of a national shortage of these critical safety professionals," NATCA said in statement.

It added, "NATCA has consistently warned that the controller staffing shortage leaves the system vulnerable, and today's events underscore the urgent need to accelerate training and hiring."

The TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers calling in sick since the shutdown began last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.

"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes," he told reporters. "You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people."

Near the end of a 34-day government shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019, there were widespread flight delays because of shortages of controllers.

[TITLE]Offsite Construction Industry Business Report 2025-2030: Higher ROI and Faster Project Timelines Generate Investment Interest in Modular Construction Startups:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Offsite Construction - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Offsite Construction was valued at US$172.0 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$225.7 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Rapid urbanization, labor shortages in the skilled trades, and increasing project complexity are driving the global shift toward offsite methods. Countries like the UK, Sweden, Japan, and Singapore are leading adopters of offsite construction due to government incentives, housing policy reforms, and industrialized construction mandates. In the U.S., large-scale developers and general contractors are exploring prefabrication to manage rising material costs and supply chain volatility. Beyond speed and cost-efficiency, offsite construction also offers enhanced precision, structural quality, and repeatability, contributing to higher-performing buildings and reduced rework rates.

What Forces Are Powering Market Growth and Industry Transformation?

The growth in the global offsite construction market is driven by several converging trends, including rising urban density, regulatory mandates for faster housing delivery, digital innovation, and a shift toward more sustainable and resilient building practices. Governments around the world are incorporating offsite construction into national housing and infrastructure strategies. For instance, the UK's Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) policy framework and Singapore's Productivity Innovation Project (PIP) provide subsidies and fast-track approvals for offsite-based developments. Such policy support is accelerating adoption among public sector contractors and attracting private investment into modular manufacturing facilities.

Sustainability imperatives are another key growth driver. Offsite construction produces significantly less material waste, energy consumption, and on-site emissions compared to traditional methods. Modular buildings are also designed for disassembly and reuse, supporting circular economy principles. Carbon tracking via BIM tools and Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) helps developers meet green building certifications such as LEED and BREEAM, making offsite construction attractive for ESG-focused real estate investors. As global pressure mounts for decarbonized construction, offsite solutions offer a practical path toward embodied carbon reduction.

The economic and operational benefits of factory-controlled environments-including consistent quality, reduced labor costs, and scalability-are drawing interest from major developers, general contractors, and venture-backed construction technology firms. Companies like Katerra (before its dissolution), Volumetric Building Companies (VBC), Sekisui House, and Laing O'Rourke are investing in high-capacity modular plants, AI-driven design software, and supply chain optimization to scale the offsite model. With continued innovation and market validation, offsite construction is emerging as a cornerstone of the global construction ecosystem, reshaping how buildings are conceived, manufactured, and delivered.

How Are Digital Tools and Materials Advancing Offsite Building Methods?

The integration of digital technologies into offsite construction is redefining the design-build process. Building Information Modeling (BIM), digital twins, and generative design algorithms are being used to model entire structures virtually before a single component is fabricated. This digital precision allows for clash detection, construction sequencing, and real-time collaboration between architects, engineers, and manufacturers, resulting in fewer site disruptions and tighter integration of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems within modular units. BIM also facilitates greater supply chain transparency and just-in-time logistics, both of which are vital for reducing inventory and optimizing production schedules.

Advanced materials are further enhancing the performance and scalability of offsite construction. Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs), Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT), and light-gauge steel framing are increasingly used for their lightweight, durable, and energy-efficient properties. These materials simplify transport and assembly, while meeting stringent structural and fire safety codes. Additive manufacturing (3D printing) is emerging as a complementary innovation, particularly for producing complex building components or custom molds in low-volume projects. Furthermore, robotics and automated machinery on factory floors are increasing the precision and throughput of framing, welding, and component assembly, further reducing dependence on manual labor.

Which End-Use Sectors Are Adopting Offsite Construction at Scale?

Residential and commercial real estate sectors remain primary adopters of offsite construction, but the technology's reach is expanding into a broader range of industries. Affordable housing, student housing, and hospitality chains are turning to modular construction to accelerate delivery timelines and control costs. Developers are now opting for pre-finished modules complete with interior fit-outs, plumbing, HVAC, and finishes-often referred to as "plug-and-play" systems-that are simply craned into position at the job site. This model supports rapid scaling of multi-unit developments in dense urban environments, particularly where construction permits and space constraints limit traditional building activity.

Healthcare and education are also high-growth sectors for offsite construction. Hospitals and school districts increasingly require fast-track expansion solutions due to population growth or emergency preparedness needs. Modular surgical centers, clinics, classrooms, and laboratories can be rapidly deployed with minimal site disruption, making them ideal for operational facilities. In the industrial sector, data centers, warehouses, and energy plants are leveraging prefabricated mechanical and electrical rooms (commonly referred to as modular utility skids) for streamlined integration into complex systems. Government agencies and military organizations are adopting prefabricated solutions for disaster relief housing, remote workforce accommodations, and mobile command centers.
