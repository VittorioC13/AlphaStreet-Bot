[TITLE]Deep tech entrepreneurship – a viable response to today’s grand challenges?:
[TEXT]
The rise of “deep tech” in recent years has captured the attention of investors, policymakers and innovators alike. But what’s beyond the hype? At its core, deep tech is grounded in cutting-edge scientific discovery and technological complexity, with far-reaching consequences for industry, society and the global economy. Benjamin Cabanes writes that the rise of big tech calls for a rethinking of technology transfer mechanisms.

The term “deep tech” has become central to the domains of innovation, scientific research and public innovation policy. Popularised in 2015 by Swati Chaturvedi, founder of the Propel(x) platform, it refers to innovations grounded in major scientific breakthroughs, using disruptive technologies to address fundamental societal challenges..

In contrast to digital start-ups, which often rely on innovative business models with limited research and development (R&D) intensity, deep tech start-ups are based on advances in fundamental science or advanced engineering. These are applied in sectors such as biotechnology, artificial intelligence, energy, nanotechnology and robotics.

In 2024, approximately €9 billion were invested in deep tech start-ups across Europe, through 454 funding rounds. These investments focused on several high-tech sectors. In the field of artificial intelligence, companies such as Mistral AI raised €468 million, while Aqemia secured €30 million. The space industry also attracted significant capital, as illustrated by The Exploration Company’s €150 million. The quantum technology sector saw major deals, notably Quantinuum (€273 million) and Riverlane (€70 million).

[TITLE]Cognitive Assessment and Training Market Report 2025-2033 | Innovative Mobile-Based IT Systems Boost Expansion Amid Growing Demand for Early Dementia Detection:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Cognitive Assessment and Training Market Report by Assessment Type, and Region 2025-2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global cognitive assessment and training market size reached USD 5.7 Billion in 2024. Looking forward, the publisher expects the market to reach USD 33.1 Billion by 2033, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 20.48% during 2025-2033.

Cognitive assessment and training solutions are used for detecting the signs of cognitive impairment in the early stages. These solutions are primarily utilized for conducting a formal assessment of the patient's psychological functioning and the speed of information processing. These impairments can be caused by old age, neural disorders and exposure to drugs or medicines. The solutions integrate various tools for assessment, data analysis and management that aid in cognitive training, sports management and early detection of dementia in individuals. They are administered during clinical trials, classroom sessions, corporate teaching, research, brain training and diagnostics.

The market is primarily being driven by the growing geriatric population and increasing awareness regarding the importance of maintaining brain fitness. The rising prevalence of dementia among the elderly is facilitating the adoption of cognitive assessment and training solutions as they enable easy and effective diagnosis and treatment of the disorder. Increasing utilization of the solutions to detect learning difficulties and disabilities, such as dyslexia and dyscalculia in children, is acting as another growth-inducing factor.

Additionally, various technological advancements in the healthcare industry and the rising adoption of mobile-based IT systems are also providing a boost to the market growth. For instance, computerized cognitive assessments provide automated scoring, which aids in enhancing the detection accuracy and minimizing the chances of human error. Other factors, including rising healthcare expenditure and extensive research and development (R&D) activities, are projected to drive the market further.

[TITLE]GTCR to acquire generic drug maker Zentiva:

Czech producer of generic medications Zentiva is poised for a change in ownership as Advent has agreed to sell the company to GTCR, another private equity investor with a focus on the healthcare sector.

The sale, initially reported by the Financial Times according to Reuters, is estimated to be worth €4.1bn ($4.8bn).

Zentiva’s operations span the development, production and distribution of medicines in more than 30 countries across Europe and beyond.

The company has four completely-owned manufacturing facilities, complemented by a network of external production partners ensuring consistent supply.

With a workforce of more than 5,000, Zentiva has undergone significant growth and transformation since Advent’s acquisition from Sanofi in 2018.

Advent’s close collaboration with the management team has been instrumental in the expansion of Zentiva’s product range and manufacturing capabilities, both organically and through strategic acquisitions, positioning Zentiva as a self-reliant entity with an emphasis on research and development.

[TITLE]Apple Watch Hypertension Alerts Approved, Rollout Begins Next Week:
[TEXT]
Don't miss out on our latest stories. Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google.

The Apple Watch's new hypertension notifications feature has received FDA approval, just days after it was announced at Apple's annual fall event.

As 9to5Mac reports, hypertension alerts will become available in over 150 countries and regions, including the US and the EU, next week. It will be supported on Apple Watch Series 9 or later and Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later running watchOS 26. The software update begins rolling out Sept. 15.

Once available, the feature will use the optical heart rate sensor at the back of the Apple Watch to measure how blood vessels respond to heartbeats. "The algorithm works passively in the background reviewing data over 30-day periods, and will notify users if it detects consistent signs of hypertension," Apple says.

Apple, in line with the latest American Heart Association guidelines, then recommends logging your blood pressure for seven days using a third-party blood pressure cuff and sharing the data with your healthcare provider for further advice.

In developing hypertension notifications, Apple used advanced machine learning and training data from across multiple studies. It was tested in a clinical trial with over 2,000 participants and introduced alongside the Apple Watch Series 11 earlier this week.

The new feature "won't detect all instances of hypertension" but is expected "to notify over one million people with undiagnosed hypertension in the first year alone, empowering them to make lifesaving behavioral changes or start treatment," Apple said during its keynote.

Apple's other major announcement for the new Apple Watches was Sleep Score. It detects how well you slept overnight and provides a score out of 100. Like hypertension alerts, this feature will also be available on older smartwatches (Apple Watch Series 6 or later, Apple Watch SE 2, and the two Apple Watch Ultras), but it will require an iPhone 11 or later running iOS 26.
