[TITLE]NeoVolta Enters into Definitive Agreements Led by Infinite Grid Capital to Advance 2 GWh U.S. Battery Energy Storage System Manufacturing Initiative:
[TEXT]
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeoVolta Inc. (NASDAQ: NEOV) (“NeoVolta” or the “Company”), a U.S.-based energy technology company delivering scalable storage for resilient residential and commercial power infrastructure, today announced that it has entered into agreements for a $13 million private placement financing anchored by Infinite Grid Capital (“IGC”), in connection with a long-term relationship to support NeoVolta’s next phase of scalable growth and U.S.-based manufacturing expansion.

The investment is structured to provide both immediate and future capital support for NeoVolta’s planned domestic manufacturing initiative. In addition to the relationship with IGC, a substantial portion of the investment proceeds is intended to advance this initiative pursuant to a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with third parties to establish and operate a state-of-the-art battery energy storage manufacturing facility in Georgia. This initiative, if pursued to completion, would emphasize domestic production aligned with federal incentives supporting battery manufacturing and compliance with relevant standards.

The facility under consideration is designed for an initial annual capacity of approximately 2 GWh, with a focus on utility-level and commercial & industrial (C&I) battery energy storage systems (BESS) that are expected to significantly expand NeoVolta’s addressable market and revenue opportunity. Operations are expected to ramp up in 2026, subject to definitive agreements and successful execution. In addition, the capital raised through this financing substantially improves NeoVolta’s financial position, significantly enhancing liquidity and addressing working capital needs to support ongoing growth initiatives.

NeoVolta and IGC also plan to establish a shared framework to evaluate potential future commercial opportunities, including offtake arrangements that may align NeoVolta’s commercial channels with IGC’s grid-scale pipeline, subject to definitive agreements.

“We are thrilled to welcome Infinite Grid Capital as a long-term strategic investor with their $10 million investment,” said Ardes Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of NeoVolta. “IGC is well-capitalized and highly aligned with our vision as we advance our domestic manufacturing plans and scale our commercial and grid-aligned channels. The investment delivers the capital and support we need while preserving the flexibility essential to our next phase of growth. We are now well-positioned to pursue a manufacturing platform capable of capturing strong downstream demand in the rapidly expanding U.S. battery energy storage market.”

“IGC is proud to back NeoVolta’s U.S. manufacturing initiative,” said Frank Liu, General Partner and CEO of Infinite Grid Capital. “This partnership reflects our commitment to advancing domestic energy storage capabilities and enabling the next phase of scalable growth.”

As the relationship develops, NeoVolta and IGC will provide updates on key milestones and the continued evolution of NeoVolta’s manufacturing and market initiatives, including details on production schedules, operational dynamics, and potential strategic collaborations. The MOU is non-binding and subject to negotiation of definitive agreements. While there is no assurance that the parties will reach agreement on final terms or that the proposed manufacturing initiative will be consummated, NeoVolta and IGC remain committed to advancing strategic manufacturing opportunities.

[TITLE]US Core Capital Goods Orders Surged in September, Pointing to Manufacturing Rebound:
[TEXT]
Demand for key capital goods made in America soared in September, with orders and shipments soaring, an indication that the pace of economic growth picked up in the third quarter.

Orders for non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, considered a proxy for business spending, rose 0.9 percent, matching the upwardly revised 0.9 percent increase a month earlier, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.

Economists had forecast a slowdown from the previously reported 0.4 percent growth in August to a rise of 0.2 percent in September. Shipments of core capital goods also rose 0.9 percent.

The durable goods report was delayed several weeks by the 43-day shutdown of the federal government that began in October.

Orders for raw metals and fabricated metals products rose at a very strong pace, indicating that U.S. metals tariffs have not sapped demand.

Orders for electronics and appliances rose 1.5 percent for the month. Year-to-date, orders are up five percent, which may indicate that tariffs are shifting demand from abroad to domestic manufacturers.

Motor vehicles and parts orders rose 0.4 percent.

Overall durable goods orders rose 0.5 percent, more than economists had forecast.

Orders for defense aircraft rose 30.9 percent. Orders for defense capital goods rose 23 percent.

The strength of durable goods orders suggests that the manufacturing sector in the U.S. is rebounding.

The government said on Tuesday that its report on third-quarter GDP would be released on December 23, nearly a month after the scheduled date. The report was delayed by the government shutdown. The economy grew at a 3.8 percent pace in the second quarter. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker suggests the economy is growing at a four percent pace in the third quarter, although the delay of many economic reports due to the shutdown raises questions about the accuracy of the nowcast.

Green Hydrogen: An Alternative That Reduces Emissions And Cares For Our Planet

The decarbonisation of the planet is among the objectives that countries around the world have set for 2050. The production of green hydrogen, a technology based on the transformation of this element through electrolysis, is one of the keys. The IEA estimates that it would make it possible to save the 830 million tonnes of CO2 per year that originate when this gas is produced using fossil fuels.

Our way of life needs an increasing amount of watts to function. The war in Ukraine has caused a global energy crisis due to the lack of fossil fuels. This has led to an unprecedented rise in the price of natural gas and coal, causing Europe to import much more liquefied natural gas than usual, with the attendant problem of worsening climate change. However, decarbonising the planet suggests a different world in 2050: one that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable, and driven by clean energies such as green hydrogen.

Advantages And Disadvantages Of Green Hydrogen Market

This energy source has pros and cons that we must be aware of. Let's go over some of its most important good points:

100 % sustainable: green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production.

green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production. Storable: hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production.

hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production. Versatile: green hydrogen can be transformed into electricity or synthetic gas and used for commercial, industrial or mobility purposes.

However, green hydrogen also has negative aspects that should be borne in mind:

High cost: energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain.

energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain. High energy consumption: the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels.

the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels. Safety issues: hydrogen is a highly volatile and flammable element and extensive safety measures are therefore required to prevent leakage and explosions.

Impact of green hydrogen

Hydrogen as a fuel is a reality in countries like the United States, Russia, China, France and Germany. Others like Japan are going even further and aspire to become a hydrogen economy. Below we explain what the impact will be in the future:

Electricity and drinking water generator : These two elements are obtained by reacting hydrogen and oxygen together in a fuel cell. This process has proved very useful on space missions, for example, by providing crews with water and electricity in a sustainable manner.

Energy storage : Compressed hydrogen tanks are capable of storing energy for long periods of time and are also easier to handle than lithium-ion batteries because they are lighter.

Transport and mobility : Hydrogen's great versatility allows it to be used in those consumption niches that are very difficult to decarbonise, such as heavy transport, aviation and maritime transport. There are already several projects under way in this area, such as Hycarus and Cryoplane, which are promoted by the European Union (EU) and aim to introduce it in passenger aircraft.

NEW DELHI: The petroleum and natural gas ministry has proposed consolidating compressed biogas (CBG) policy, financial and infrastructure schemes-currently spread across multiple ministries-under a single platform to accelerate project execution, minimise overlaps and bolster investor confidence.At present, three ministries run parallel schemes across the CBG value chain: the ministry of renewable energy (MNRE) administers financial incentives, the Department of Fertilizers (DoF) oversees market development, and the petroleum ministry manages pipeline infrastructure and biomass aggregation machinery.A National Integrated CBG Promotion Scheme (NICPS) has been proposed to bring all existing central government CBG schemes under one unified framework. The petroleum ministry will "oversee scheme operation, monitoring and inter-ministerial coordination," according to a concept note, while MNRE and DoF will continue to handle the financial and administrative responsibilities of their respective programmes."This integration ensures synergy, eliminates overlaps and accelerates project implementation," the petroleum ministry said.The ministry launched the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative in 2018 to promote CBG production. However, CBG expansion has been significantly slower than that of ethanol, which has seen a quantum leap in recent years.Currently, 134 plants produce and sell CBG across India, about 70% of which are owned by Indian Oil and Gail . In the last fiscal year, 42,700 metric tonnes of CBG was sold in the country.Several private companies have also announced plans to set up CBG plants at scale, although progress has remained slow.The viability of CBG plants hinges on land availability and allocation, assured pricing and offtake for gas, reliable feedstock supply chains, access to affordable credit and financing, and pipeline connectivity and logistics infrastructure, the ministry said, adding that the integrated approach "seeks to address these challenges.""The scheme will provide end-to-end support-from project development to marketing-reducing project risk, lowering logistics costs, improving returns and accelerating the creation of a circular bio-economy in the country," it said.

[TITLE]United Construction Buys Queens Property From Madison Realty Capital for $64M – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
United Construction and Development Group, a prolific developer in Queens, has acquired an office and retail building in the borough’s Flushing neighborhood.

United Construction, run by Chris Jiashu Xu, purchased the three-story, 104,292-square-foot property at 41-60 Main Street from Madison Realty Capital for $64.25 million, according to the seller’s broker, JLL.

The building on the corner of Main Street and Sanford Avenue is fully occupied and hosts office tenants Capital One Bank, Preferred Bank and MassMutual Insurance. Retail tenants at the property include Chinese bakery Fay Da Bakery and JD Drug Store.

JLL’s Ethan Stanton, Michael Mazzara, Drew Isaacson and Brendan Maddigan brokered the deal for the seller, while no brokers represented the buyer.

Spokespeople for United Construction and Madison Realty Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Crain’s New York Business first reported the news.

News of the deal comes after Madison Realty Capital acquired the Flushing property in February 2024, as Commercial Observer previously reported.

Bankrupt developer Jeffrey Wu handed off the building to Madison Realty Capital — a creditor — for $80 million after filing a Chapter 11 petition in 2020 to initiate bankruptcy proceedings for his company, Flushing Landmark Realty. Madison Realty Capital had previously provided a $66 million bridge loan for Wu to refinance two Flushing properties in 2014.

It’s unclear what Xu intends to do with his new property, but the developer already has a lineup of projects planned for Queens.

Over the summer, Xu filed plans to build a 39-story, 387-unit residential tower at 23-07 43rd Avenue in Long Island City, as well as a two-tower, 630-unit residential property at 61-06 Junction Boulevard in Rego Park, Crain’s reported.
