[TEXT]
Washington D.C., Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The strategic partnership between two global players, Hera Enterprises and Circular Protocol, begins today with the goal of developing and promoting a unique and proprietary infrastructure, based on blockchain and AI, to scale digital traceability and data authentication in strategic sectors such as banking and finance, insurance, agri-food, and healthcare. Thanks to easy-to-integrate and scalable new solutions and applications, data and information are immutable and always available to operators, regulatory bodies, and consumers, respecting user rights and privacy, while also protecting intellectual property and company security, precisely through the use of fourth-generation technologies. Circular Protocol is a decentralized Data Trust Layer (DTL) – based in Boston and Lugano – that is a 4.0 technological infrastructure, ensuring, at scale, the truthfulness, traceability, and integrity of data, through the use of exponential technologies, including blockchain and AI. The partnership is promoted by Hera Institute – based in Washington D.C. (USA), a non-profit organization that aims to improve consumer protection, in line with the principles of “America First” and the values, shared with Italy, of safeguarding human dignity, family, and cooperation among people, to guarantee that all citizens have access to certified and verifiable information that meets the highest standards of quality, security, and responsibility.

“In the United States, the demand for accountability is growing. This partnership represents a concrete step towards the creation of technologies with a positive social impact,” states Tim Phillips, President of the Hera Institute. “Our goal is to improve the quality of life and health of Americans by connecting thought leaders in the US and worldwide, and organizing events, research programs, educational initiatives, and training, which will help revive the American Dream.”

“Circular is honored to contribute to building a world where people can trust the protection of their confidential data and access real and immutable information, as well as for companies in the healthcare, banking, and insurance sectors,” said Dr. Gianluca De Novi, Founder and CEO of Circular. “Our mission is to create a global infrastructure that brings truth and transparency to data. Hera shares this vision, and we are excited to make this collaboration and its solutions accessible to everyone.”

“I firmly believe in traditional values. I was born and raised in a region, Abruzzo, where respect, love for life, for the community, and the territory are still intact values,” declared Giovanni Sabetti, President of Hera Enterprises. “I firmly believe in a higher justice, and therefore also in the ethics and transparency of data and their communication. To strengthen the objectives of this important agreement, I have also relied on the collaboration of my friend and esteemed anthropologist, Karl Wolfsgruber.”

[TITLE]FDA approves revumenib for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with a susceptible NPM1 mutation:
[TEXT]
On October 24, 2025, the Food and Drug Administration approved revumenib (Revuforj, Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), a menin inhibitor, for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with a susceptible nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation in adult and pediatric patients 1 year and older who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.

Full prescribing information for Revuforj will be posted on Drugs@FDA.

Efficacy and Safety

Efficacy was evaluated in a single-arm cohort of an open-label, multicenter trial (SNDX-5613-0700, NCT04065399; AUGMENT-101). A susceptible mutation was confirmed in enrolled patients using next generation sequencing or polymerase chain reaction of the last exon of NPM1.

The main efficacy outcome measures were complete remission rate (CR), CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh), CR+CRh duration, and rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence. The CR+CRh rate was 23.1% (95% CI: 13.5, 35.2), and the median CR+CRh duration was 4.5 months (95% CI: 1.2, 8.1). Of the 46 patients dependent on red blood cell (RBC) and/or platelet transfusions at baseline, 8 (17%) became independent of RBC and platelet transfusions during any 56-day post-baseline period.

The prescribing information includes warnings and precautions for differentiation syndrome, QTc interval prolongation and Torsades de Pointes, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

Recommended Dosage

The recommended revumenib dose varies by patient weight and concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. See the prescribing information for specific dosage information.

Expedited Programs

This review used the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program, which streamlined data submission prior to the filing of the entire clinical application, and the Assessment Aid, a voluntary submission from the applicant to facilitate the FDA’s assessment.

This application was granted priority review. Revumenib has fast track designation. FDA expedited programs are described in the Guidance for Industry: Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics.

Healthcare professionals should report all serious adverse events suspected to be associated with the use of any medicine and device to FDA’s MedWatch Reporting System or by calling 1-800-FDA-1088.

For assistance with single-patient INDs for investigational oncology products, healthcare professionals may contact OCE’s Project Facilitate at 240-402-0004 or email OncProjectFacilitate@fda.hhs.gov.

[TITLE]BAX INVESTOR NOTICE: Baxter International Inc. Investors with Substantial Losses Have Opportunity to Lead Class Action Lawsuit - RGRD Law:
[TEXT]
SAN DIEGO, Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Baxter International, Inc. (NYSE: BAX) common stock between February 23, 2022 and July 30, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until December 15, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Baxter class action lawsuit. Captioned Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. Baxter International, Inc., No. 25-cv-12672 (N.D. Ill.), the Baxter class action lawsuit charges Baxter as well as certain of Baxter’s top current and former executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Baxter class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:

https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-baxter-international-class-action-lawsuit-bax.html

You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: Baxter, through its subsidiaries, provides a portfolio of healthcare products.

The Baxter class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Baxter’s Novum IQ Large Volume Pump (“Novum LVP”) suffered systemic defects that caused widespread malfunctions, including underinfusion, overinfusion, and complete non-delivery of fluids, which exposed patients to risks of serious injury or death; (ii) Baxter was notified of multiple device malfunctions, injuries, and deaths from these defects; (iii) Baxter’s attempts to address these defects through customer alerts were inadequate remedial measures, when design flaws persisted and continued to cause serious harm to patients; and (iv) as a result, there was a heightened risk that customers would be instructed to take existing Novum LVPs out of service and that Baxter would completely pause all new sales of these pumps.

The Baxter class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 31, 2025, Baxter announced that it had decided to “voluntarily and temporarily pause shipments and planned installations of the Novum LVP” and that it was “unable to currently commit to an exact timing for resuming shipment and installation for Novum IQ LVPs.” Defendants further stated that they had offered “customers the option of our Spectrum infusion pump as an alternative” and that Baxter’s low-end guidance assumes that Baxter does not resume shipments for Novum LVPs before the end of the year, according to the complaint. The Baxter class action lawsuit alleges that on this news, the price of Baxter common stock fell more than 22%.

THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Baxter common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Baxter class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Baxter class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a firm of its choice to litigate the Baxter class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Baxter class action lawsuit.

[TITLE]Arvinas Presents Preclinical Data for ARV-806 Demonstrating Robust and Differentiated Activity in Models of KRAS G12D-mutated Cancer at the 2025 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Ta:
[TEXT]
– In vivo, ARV-806 demonstrated robust and durable KRAS G12D degradation, leading to significant tumor growth inhibition in models of pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancer –

– Data underscore differentiation of ARV-806 from other G12D targeting agents in development and best-in-class potential for KRAS G12D mutated cancers –

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arvinas, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARVN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company creating a new class of drugs based on targeted protein degradation, today announced preclinical data for ARV-806, a PROTAC KRAS G12D degrader, at the 2025 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Boston, Massachusetts. The ARV-806 data presented show a differentiated profile based on degradation potency, antiproliferative activity, and induction of cancer cell death. ARV-806 is designed to target both the ON and OFF forms of KRAS G12D, which is the most common mutation of the KRAS protein. ARV-806 has the potential to address high unmet need in solid tumors, such as pancreatic, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer.

“These data suggest the potential of targeted protein degradation to overcome historical limitations in addressing undruggable KRAS mutations,” said Angela Cacace, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Arvinas. “ARV-806’s ability to eliminate both ON and OFF forms of KRAS G12D, combined with its potency and durability shown in preclinical models, supports our confidence in its clinical potential to deliver meaningful benefit for patients with KRAS G12D-mutated cancers.”

Key highlights from the presentation include:

In vitro, ARV-806 degraded KRAS G12D with picomolar potency across pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancer cell lines but did not induce degradation of wild-type and other mutant RAS isoforms.

ARV-806 is differentiated from other KRAS G12D targeting agents in development and has potential to be a best-in-class therapy for KRAS G12D mutated cancers due to: Catalytic activity, which allows it to overcome upregulation, a common mechanism of resistance to inhibitor treatment Compared with clinical-stage KRAS G12D ON and OFF inhibitors and another clinical-stage G12D degrader, ARV-806 demonstrated: >25-fold greater potency in reducing cancer cell proliferation, >40-fold higher potency in degrading KRAS G12D protein (versus the comparable clinical-stage G12D degrader), and >10-fold lower concentrations required to induce pro-apoptotic BIM expression.

Following a single intravenous dose in a colorectal tumor xenograft model, ARV-806 degraded >90% of KRAS G12D for seven days, with parallel suppression of c-MYC (a key driver of cancer cell proliferation) and induction of BIM (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death, a pro-apoptotic factor) for ≥5 days.

ARV-806 demonstrated robust efficacy responses at low doses in tumor models including: ≥30% tumor volume reductions in pancreatic and colorectal cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models and a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of lung cancer.

These data demonstrate sustained pharmacodynamic activity consistent with long-lasting target degradation, which we believe supports intermittent clinical dosing. Arvinas is currently evaluating ARV-806 in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with KRAS G12D–mutated advanced solid tumors (NCT07023731).

Also shown in the poster, orally bioavailable pan-KRAS degraders have been identified that potently degrade multiple variants of KRAS and spare other RAS isoforms. A tool pan-KRAS PROTAC demonstrated robust single-agent activity and superior combination efficacy with immune checkpoint blockade compared with a pan-RAS ON inhibitor (7 complete responses compared with 2 complete responses).

[TITLE]Revium Rx Advances Toward Phase 1 Clinical Development of Nano-Mupirocin to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Infections:
[TEXT]
TEL AVIV, Israel, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Revium Rx (formerly Revium Recovery Inc. (OTC: RVRC), a biopharmaceutical company developing advanced lipid-based therapeutics for infectious and oncologic diseases, today announced significant progress in its regulatory and manufacturing programs supporting the planned Phase 1 clinical trial of its lead product candidate, Nano-Mupirocin - a novel systemic formulation of the well-known and highly potent antibiotic mupirocin.

“Our novel formulation of Nano-Mupirocin is designed to overcome the inherent limitation of mupirocin’s instability in blood and to expand its use beyond topical applications into systemic treatment for severe bacterial infections”, says Amir Avraham, the CEO, - “the formulation aims to maintain therapeutic concentrations in the bloodstream and effectively target deep-tissue infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens such as Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE), and Ceftriaxone-Resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae”.

Last month, the company submitted its clinical trial application to the Israeli Ministry of Health, marking a critical milestone toward the initiation of first-in-human studies in early 2026. Concurrently, Revium Rx, in collaboration with WuXi AppTec, one of the world’s leading global CDMOs, continues to advance the scale-up and production of its GMP clinical batch, with final release expected by the end of 2025.

Addressing the Urgent Threat of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)

In 2021, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) was estimated to have caused approximately 130,000 deaths directly attributable to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) — a sharp rise from 57,200 in 1990. According to the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) Project published in The Lancet in 2022, MRSA was responsible for over 100,000 AMR-attributable deaths in 2019, making it one of the deadliest pathogens that year. Broader GRAM data indicate that bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million deaths globally in 2019. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Summit on AMR held in 2024 further underscored the escalating threat, warning that AMR-related fatalities may approach 2 million annually by 2050 without decisive global intervention. The GRAM study projects that without intervention, AMR will directly cause 39 million deaths between 2025 and 2050, with annual mortality expected to rise nearly 70 % by mid-century.

MRSA alone accounts for over 100,000 AMR-attributable deaths annually. These alarming data underscore the urgent medical need for new systemic antibiotics such as Nano-Mupirocin.

Significant and Growing Market Opportunity

The global AMR therapeutics market was valued at USD 8.7 billion in 2023 and is projected to exceed USD 12.5 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.3 %, according to Grand View Research, 2024.

Within this rapidly expanding global market, Nano-Mupirocin targets several high-value infectious disease indications, including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE), and Ceftriaxone-Resistant Gonorrhea (CR-Gonorrhea). If Nano-Mupirocin demonstrates favorable results in clinical trials, of which no assurance can be provided, the Company will seek to capture a meaningful share within this rapidly expanding market, reflecting both the urgent clinical need and the significant commercial potential of novel antibiotics effective against resistant pathogens. “By targeting these difficult-to-treat infections with a novel nano-liposomal formulation of a known highly-potent antibiotic, ReviumRx is positioned to play a meaningful role in the global fight against AMR”, adds Amir Avraham, the CEO of Revium Rx.

[TITLE]Modelling transcription with explainable AI uncovers context-specific epigenetic gene regulation at promoters and gene bodies:
[TEXT]
Transcriptional regulation involves complex interactions with chromatin-associated proteins, but disentangling these mechanistically remains challenging. Here, we generate deep learning models to predict RNA Pol-II occupancy from chromatin-associated protein profiles in unperturbed conditions. We evaluate the suitability of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a widely used explainable AI (XAI) approach, to infer functional relevance and analyse regulatory mechanisms across diverse datasets. We aim to validate these insights using data from degron-based perturbation experiments. Remarkably, genes ranked by SHAP importance predict direct targets of perturbation even from unperturbed data, enabling inference without costly experimental interventions. Our analysis reveals that SHAP not only predicts differential gene expression but also captures the magnitude of transcriptional changes. We validate the cooperative roles of SET1A and ZC3H4 at promoters and uncover novel regulatory contributions of ZC3H4 at gene bodies in influencing transcription. Cross-dataset validation uncovers unexpected connections between ZC3H4, a component of the Restrictor complex, and INTS11, part of the Integrator complex, suggesting crosstalk mediated by H3K4me3 and the SET1/COMPASS complex in transcriptional regulation. These findings highlight the power of integrating predictive modelling and experimental validation to unravel complex context-dependent regulatory networks and generate novel biological hypotheses.

Genes are turned on or off through complex processes involving many proteins that interact with DNA wrapped histones and modify their structure. These changes, known as epigenetic modifications, help control how genes are expressed without altering the DNA sequence itself. In this study, we wanted to understand how different proteins influence gene activity in mouse stem cells by looking at their positions along the genome, particularly whether they act near the gene’s start site (promoter) or within the gene body. To do this, we used machine learning models and a method called SHAP, which helps explain the model’s decisions. By comparing our predictions to data from experiments where specific proteins were removed, we found that some proteins have context-specific effects, acting not only at the promoter but also along the whole gene body. Our approach highlighted both well-known and unexpected regulators of transcription and revealed that gene body signals, which are often overlooked, can play key roles. These findings show how explainable AI can help uncover new insights into how epigenetic features shape gene regulation, and offer a powerful way to generate testable hypotheses from complex genomic data.

Since complex models generally trade off biological interpretability against statistical accuracy, so-called explainable AI (XAI) techniques are adopted to provide human interpretable explanations for specific model predictions and to hypothesize potential underpinning biological mechanisms [ 16 – 18 ]. In this paper, we set out to benchmark the efficacy of XAI approaches in identifying regulatory processes by taking advantage of the recent availability of dynamical measurements provided after rapid perturbations via auxin-inducible degron (AID) and degradation tag (dTAG) systems [ 19 ]. We set out to predict RNA Polymerase II occupancy from several chromatin associated proteins and epigenomic marks, quantifying the influence of each protein or mark on each gene using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) [ 17 ], one of the most widely used XAI approaches. We then validate the efficacy of the learnt explanations by systematic comparisons of direct target and random gene sets following degradation of one or more factors. Our findings demonstrate the utility of combining predictive modelling with SHAP analysis to uncover complex biological interactions and infer functional mechanisms in transcriptional regulation. By leveraging this integrative approach, we dissected the roles of chromatin-associated proteins, uncovered unexpected functional relationships, and validated the robustness of SHAP across datasets.

Understanding how cells regulate gene expression during physiological or disease processes remains one of the most important open problems in biology, with potentially immense implications for biomedicine and biotechnology. While the fundamental process of regulation by transcription factor binding has been extensively studied [ 1 ], the complexity of sequence-dependent signal integration in a crowded chromatin environment remains largely unknown. Through efforts to tackle this outstanding problem, the last decade has witnessed the development of several large-scale international efforts to profile multiple epigenomic marks across a variety of cellular contexts [ 2 – 4 ]. The large amounts of data made publicly available by these projects raised the prospect of a complementary, data-driven approach to understand general mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated. Numerous studies have used statistical models to predict gene expression or other molecular features from genomic sequence and epigenomic marks [ 5 – 11 ]. More recently, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) using a variety of neural architectures have been brought to bear, allowing increasingly accurate prediction and imputation of gene expression as well as other molecular features [ 12 – 15 ]. A critical limitation of this data-driven approach is its entirely correlative nature. Because the vast majority of data sets are derived from cells at steady-state, every prediction will demand independent validation via explicit perturbation experiments, a requirement that has rarely been met.

Results

Data sets used for modelling To ensure a robust and comprehensive analysis of transcriptional regulation, we utilised datasets from three independent studies spanning different experimental designs and chromatin-associated protein targets: Dobrinić et al. (2021) [20], Hughes et al. (2023) [21], and Wang et al. (2023) [22] (Table 1). Dobrinić and colleagues [20] investigated the roles of PRC1 [23,24] and PRC2 [25,26] complexes in Polycomb-mediated transcriptional repression, using ChIP-seq data for RING1B, SUZ12, and associated histone modifications such as H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub1 to evaluate their contributions. Additionally, this study included degron-based perturbation experiments for RING1B and SUZ12, enabling a direct assessment of acute transcriptional changes using nuclear RNA-seq assays. Hughes and colleagues [21] focused on transcriptional regulation mediated by SET1A [27] and ZC3H4 [28], two chromatin-associated proteins with well-characterised roles in activating and restricting transcription, respectively. This study leveraged ChIP-seq data for SET1A, ZC3H4, and H3K4me3, alongside degron-based perturbation experiments, to uncover the interplay between these factors to regulate transcription. Wang and colleagues [22] explored the role of H3K4me3 in transcription initiation and RNA Pol-II pause-release, utilizing ChIP-seq data for the SET1 complex components DPY30 and RBBP5 [27], Integrator complex member INTS11 [29,30], and factors involved in transcription elongation and Pol-II pause-release such as CDK9 [31], BRD4 [32], HEXIM1, NELFA [33], and AFF4 [34]. Transcriptional dynamics after acute perturbations were assayed using TT-chem-seq [21,22]. Together, these datasets provided a rich resource for examining the relationships between chromatin modifications and transcriptional regulation.

Modelling of protein occupancy predicts transcription output In order to understand the relationships between protein occupancy profiles and transcriptional regulation, we built deep neural network (DNN) models, specifically multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost) and linear regression to predict RNA Pol-II occupancy from ChIP-seq data (Fig 1A). MLPs are prioritised in this study for their competitive performance and efficiency in regression tasks [35,36], along with their scalability and potential for improved interpretability using XAI approaches. Since epigenomic data is not necessarily statistically independent, we also utilised gradient-boosted trees. To enhance the resolution of our predictions, normalised ChIP signals were quantified separately from promoter regions and gene body regions, enabling us to investigate the distinct contributions of chromatin proteins and marks to transcription regulation across these regions. By integrating these separate measurements, we aimed to identify specific factors or chromatin features that predominantly influence transcription at promoters or gene bodies. For all data sets, the occupancy of RNA Pol-II was predicted with high precision (R2 ranging between 0.85–0.95) (Fig 1B). Model performance was assessed with shuffled 5-fold KFold cross-validation.

(B) Model performance for predicting RNA Pol-II occupancy based on chromatin-associated protein profiles across datasets. Coefficients of determination (R2) are shown for training, validation and test datasets for 5 splits. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011908.g001 We hypothesise that the model, trained on data assayed from unperturbed conditions, captures biologically meaningful relationships between protein occupancy and transcriptional output. To interpret these relationships, we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [17,37], an XAI approach that quantifies the contribution of each input feature to the model’s predictions while potentially accounting for complex, non-linear interactions (Fig 1A). After we modelled the data using MLP and XGBoost regression, we utilise KernelSHAP, DeepSHAP and TreeSHAP algorithms from the SHAP library. Through comparing SHAP values between direct transcriptional targets (genes that exhibit significant transcriptional changes following rapid protein degradation) and random genes, we aim to assess the relative importance of specific protein occupancy features at promoter and gene body context in driving transcriptional outcomes. For robust comparison, we categorised the genes derived from data generated from nascent (TT-seq) or steady state RNA-seq experiments after acute degradation of the protein of interest. The categorisation was based on the significance threshold using p-adjusted values attributed to the confidence in estimating the fold change. We calculated the mean absolute SHAP values for each group and the error is estimated through random subsampling. Since the model is trained on data assayed before any perturbations, differences in SHAP values between direct targets (p-adjusted value < 0.05) and random genes (p-adjusted value > 0.05) may indicate SHAP’s potential to identify functional relevance. After successful training, SHAP values are computed for gene loci present only in the test dataset to prevent data leakage. Because direct targets constitute 6–28% of genes in our degron datasets, every test split was built to preserve that proportion. For each split we drew 50 balanced subsamples, each containing 50 direct-target genes (p-adjusted value < 0.05) and 50 randomly selected non-targets (p-adjusted value > 0.05). Absolute SHAP values were averaged across these repeats to minimise bias from class imbalance. SHAP value is an estimate of the original Shapley value [37] which is a unique solution that fairly distributes the difference between the model prediction and a background expectation across all features. Because these estimations possess desirable properties of local accuracy, missingness and consistency, summing all values reconstructs the predicted RNA Pol-II occupancy for each gene. These surprising and unique attributes allows direct comparison of feature contributions on a gene-by-gene or gene-set-by-gene-set basis. To benchmark SHAP’s effectiveness against traditional approaches, we also conducted separate linear regression analyses for target and random genes. To establish a challenging benchmark, a linear regression baseline was employed, deliberately leveraging outcome-related information that would be inaccessible at inference time for the SHAP-enabled models. Linear regression coefficients can provide only global insights, revealing general trends across the entire set of target or random genes. In contrast, SHAP analysis calculates feature importance scores for each gene individually, offering unprecedented resolution into how different regulatory features influence transcription in a gene-specific manner. We anticipated that this gene-by-gene analysis would reveal complex, context-dependent interactions between features that would be masked by global linear trends. The comparison of absolute mean values for different gene sets whether they are direct targets or not allows estimating whether a particular mark or multiple marks contribute significantly in predicting RNA Pol-II occupancy. This approach was designed to test whether SHAP’s ability to capture gene-specific regulatory patterns could provide deeper mechanistic insights than traditional analyses.

Strengths and limitations of SHAP analysis in resolving co-occupying transcriptional regulators To evaluate SHAP’s ability to accurately attribute importance to individual proteins in complex regulatory systems, we generated a highly accurate model (Fig 1B) to predict RNA Pol-II occupancy using PRC1, PRC2 and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data as they were sequenced together in the Dobrinić et al. study [20] (Fig 2A). PRC1, through its core subunit RING1B [23,24], functions as the primary transcriptional repressor [38], while PRC2 reinforces repression by depositing the H3K27me3 histone mark [39]. The extensive co-occupancy of PRC1 and PRC2 at target loci [40] provided an ideal system to test SHAP’s performance in disentangling overlapping regulatory inputs. As expected, RING1B promoter occupancy emerged as significantly more important at direct target gene loci ([fig:shap-prc-s1]S1A Fig) when SHAP values were calculated using DeepSHAP algorithm. When we extended the analysis using KernelSHAP and TreeSHAP across all time points (2h, 4h, 8h, and 24h; [fig:shap-prc-s1]S1B Fig) following RING1B depletion, we consistently identified RING1B as more important at direct targets. This robust finding aligns with extensive research that has established PRC1’s dominant role in early transcriptional repression. This consistency represents a significant achievement, as it demonstrates SHAP’s ability to capture biologically meaningful features, even in a highly co-linear regulatory environment. Across all time points, SHAP attributed greater importance to SUZ12 and its catalytic histone mark H3K27me3 at direct target genes of RING1B than at random genes, yet both still ranked below RING1B itself ([fig:shap-prc-s1]S1B Fig). In all our SHAP explainers except TreeSHAP at 2h and 4h, RING1B was ranked higher than H3K27me3 ([fig:shap-prc-s1]S1B Fig). It is important to note that the model was trained on unperturbed data, and thus it cannot reasonably infer or capture the temporal ordering of regulatory effects. The dynamics of feedback mechanism between PRC1 and PRC2 [25,41–43] makes it plausible for H3K27me3, which is deposited by SUZ12 to show higher importance at these time points. PPT PowerPoint slide

This observation aligns with the established roles of CFP1, a SET1 complex component that binds CpG islands (CGIs) [44], and KDM2B, a PRC1 complex recruiter which also binds CGIs [45]. These findings provide further evidence of a dynamic interplay between the SET1 and PRC complexes, wherein CFP1 and KDM2B continuously sample CGIs but ultimately yield to the reinforcing feedback mechanisms of PRC1 and PRC2 [46], maintaining transcriptionally repressed loci. These findings also raise the possibility that these loci represent “bivalent” promoters, where H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 coexist [47]. This dual marking is thought to safeguard proper and robust differentiation by maintaining genes in a poised state, balancing activation and repression until lineage-specific cues drive transcriptional commitment [47,48], further emphasizing the dynamic regulatory interplay revealed by our analysis. Another possibility is H3K4me3’s well documented association with RNA Pol-II. We reasoned that this model is relying heavily on H3K4me3 to predict RNA Pol-II occupancy. Therefore, we trained new models without incorporating H3K4me3 occupancy. Surprisingly, these new models retained similar levels of predictive accuracy with test R2 scores dropping from 0.85 (Fig 1B) to 0.8 ([fig:shap-prc-new-s2]S2A Fig) indicating that the modelling strategy does not rely heavily on the correlative relationship between H3K4me3 and RNA Pol-II. When these updated models were interpreted using multiple interpretability algorithms, absolute SHAP values for RING1B promoter occupancy were consistently higher for target gene loci across all time points (Fig 2B, C), following RING1B depletion. Surprisingly, regression coefficients obtained from linear models failed to highlight any significant difference between direct targets and random genes across all time points ([fig:shap-prc-new-s2]S2B, [fig:shap-prc-new-s2]S2C, [fig:shap-prc-new-s2]S2D and [fig:shap-prc-new-s2]S2E Fig). These results demonstrate the utility of SHAP in consistently identifying biologically validated regulators like RING1B as key players, even in complex and co-linear regulatory systems. We argue that our analysis of chromatin-associated proteins, where SHAP values are significantly higher for target genes compared to random genes, is analogous to assessing the functional impact of these proteins.

Interpretable modelling analysis aids in inferring the combined role of SET1A and ZC3H4 in transcriptional regulation A recent study [21] revealed the combined role of SET1A and ZC3H4 in transcriptional regulation, highlighting their interplay. Building on these datasets, we aimed to determine whether XAI approaches could infer relationships between these proteins directly from predictive models trained on unperturbed data. Understanding such cooperative roles demands methodologies that go beyond traditional bioinformatic techniques, which often rely on summary statistics and correlation analyses to infer biological mechanisms. For instance, SET1A, a histone methyltransferase responsible for H3K4 trimethylation [27], co-occupies promoters with H3K4me3. SET1A, in complex with WDR82, functions as a transcriptional activator, while ZC3H4, also interacting with WDR82, is part of the restrictor complex that regulates non-coding transcription [28,49]. To shed light on their roles in transcriptional regulation, we utilised our highly accurate model for Hughes et al. [21] data (Fig 1B) which predicts RNA Pol-II occupancy using the occupancy profiles of SET1A, ZC3H4, and H3K4me3 (Fig 3A). We performed SHAP analysis on gene sets following the acute degradation of SET1A, ZC3H4, and both proteins simultaneously. SHAP values were consistently higher for SET1A, ZC3H4 and H3K4me3 promoter occupancy in direct targets compared to random genes (Fig 3B), indicating that the model captures biologically relevant effects of these proteins on transcriptional regulation. Additionally, SHAP analysis highlighted a higher importance of ZC3H4 gene body occupancy in target genes, whereas SET1A showed no significant increase in gene body importance (Fig 3B). As a control comparison, we trained separate linear regression models on direct targets and random genes to evaluate whether the relationships between input features and transcriptional regulation differ across conditions. The coefficients derived from these models showed no significant differences ([fig:shap-set1a-s3]S3C Fig), indicating that the predictive relationships remain consistent between direct targets and random gene sets. These results demonstrate that XAI approaches, such as SHAP, provide valuable insights into the cooperative roles of SET1A and ZC3H4 at promoters compared to linear regression coefficients. When we extended the analysis using multiple SHAP algorithms and direct targets from ZC3H4 degron and SET1A+ZC3H4 degron, we consistently found SET1A, ZC3H4 and H3K4me3 important at promoter context and ZC3H4 at gene body context (Fig 3C, [fig:shap-set1a-s3]S3A and [fig:shap-set1a-s3]S3B Fig). The promoter context finding aligns with established experimental evidence [21], validating the robustness of our approach. Surprisingly, the distinct regulatory role of ZC3H4 at gene body represents a potentially novel phenomenon, extending beyond published conclusions and uncovering novel aspects of ZC3H4’s contribution to transcriptional regulation.

SHAP analysis validates the importance of INTS11 at target genes INTS11, a core component of the Integrator complex [29], is recruited to active promoters through H3K4me3 [22]. This interaction highlights the crosstalk between the SET1/COMPASS complex and Integrator complex in regulating transcriptional activity (Fig 4A). To further investigate these relationships, we utilised our model, employing SHAP to quantify the contributions of DPY30, RBBP5 and INTS11 along with CDK9, HEXIM1, BRD4, NELFA, and AFF4, each playing crucial roles in transcription elongation and Pol-II pause-release [31,32,34,50]. When we utilised our model trained on data from Wang et al. [22] (Fig 1B), our DeepSHAP analysis showed that INTS11 and H3K4me3 promoter occupancy exhibited high SHAP values at target gene loci, regardless of whether INTS11 (Fig 4B), DPY30 ([fig:shap-ints11-s4]S4A Fig), or RBBP5 ([fig:shap-ints11-s4]S4B Fig) was degraded. This finding underscores INTS11’s role, likely facilitated through its interaction with H3K4me3 at active promoters. Notably, H3K4me3 promoter occupancy was also identified as significant contributors to RNA Pol-II occupancy, particularly at INTS11 target gene loci (Fig 4B). Similar to our previous observations, coefficients derived from linear regression models showed little differences ([fig:shap-ints11-s4]S4C Fig) between models trained separately for direct targets (INTS11 degron) and random genes whereas SHAP values computed from multiple algorithms clearly separated target genes from random genes (Fig 4B, C). Despite DPY30 and RBBP5 being part of the SET1/COMPASS complex depositing H3K4me3, SHAP analysis revealed a lack of significant importance for DPY30 and RBBP5 (Figs 4B, [fig:shap-ints11-s4]S4A and [fig:shap-ints11-s4]S4B), an observation that stands in contrast to expectations. We also noticed that INTS11 SHAP values for direct targets of DPY30 degron ([fig:shap-ints11-s4]S4A Fig) and RBBP5 degron ([fig:shap-ints11-s4]S4B Fig) showed only marginal increase compared to random genes. Nonetheless, our analysis highlights the importance of H3K4me3 promoter occupancy in the regulation of INTS11 target genes (Fig 4B, C), supporting its role in regulating RNA Pol-II pausing [22]. Our results independently support the role of INTS11 in regulating transcription at target loci, emphasizing its critical function in transcriptional regulation through H3K4me3 recruitment.

[TITLE]FDA approves revumenib for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with a susceptible NPM1 mutation:
[TEXT]
On October 24, 2025, the Food and Drug Administration approved revumenib (Revuforj, Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), a menin inhibitor, for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with a susceptible nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation in adult and pediatric patients 1 year and older who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.

Full prescribing information for Revuforj will be posted on Drugs@FDA.

Efficacy and Safety

Efficacy was evaluated in a single-arm cohort of an open-label, multicenter trial (SNDX-5613-0700, NCT04065399; AUGMENT-101). A susceptible mutation was confirmed in enrolled patients using next generation sequencing or polymerase chain reaction of the last exon of NPM1.

The main efficacy outcome measures were complete remission rate (CR), CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh), CR+CRh duration, and rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence. The CR+CRh rate was 23.1% (95% CI: 13.5, 35.2), and the median CR+CRh duration was 4.5 months (95% CI: 1.2, 8.1). Of the 46 patients dependent on red blood cell (RBC) and/or platelet transfusions at baseline, 8 (17%) became independent of RBC and platelet transfusions during any 56-day post-baseline period.

The prescribing information includes warnings and precautions for differentiation syndrome, QTc interval prolongation and Torsades de Pointes, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

Recommended Dosage

The recommended revumenib dose varies by patient weight and concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. See the prescribing information for specific dosage information.

[TITLE]Hera & Circular Revolutionize Traceability & Transparency in Banking, Insurance, Agri-food, and Healthcare:
[TEXT]
Washington D.C., Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The strategic partnership between two global players, Hera Enterprises and Circular Protocol, begins today with the goal of developing and promoting a unique and proprietary infrastructure, based on blockchain and AI, to scale digital traceability and data authentication in strategic sectors such as banking and finance, insurance, agri-food, and healthcare. Thanks to easy-to-integrate and scalable new solutions and applications, data and information are immutable and always available to operators, regulatory bodies, and consumers, respecting user rights and privacy, while also protecting intellectual property and company security, precisely through the use of fourth-generation technologies. Circular Protocol is a decentralized Data Trust Layer (DTL) – based in Boston and Lugano – that is a 4.0 technological infrastructure, ensuring, at scale, the truthfulness, traceability, and integrity of data, through the use of exponential technologies, including blockchain and AI. The partnership is promoted by Hera Institute – based in Washington D.C. (USA), a non-profit organization that aims to improve consumer protection, in line with the principles of “America First” and the values, shared with Italy, of safeguarding human dignity, family, and cooperation among people, to guarantee that all citizens have access to certified and verifiable information that meets the highest standards of quality, security, and responsibility.

“In the United States, the demand for accountability is growing. This partnership represents a concrete step towards the creation of technologies with a positive social impact,” states Tim Phillips, President of the Hera Institute. “Our goal is to improve the quality of life and health of Americans by connecting thought leaders in the US and worldwide, and organizing events, research programs, educational initiatives, and training, which will help revive the American Dream.”

“Circular is honored to contribute to building a world where people can trust the protection of their confidential data and access real and immutable information, as well as for companies in the healthcare, banking, and insurance sectors,” said Dr. Gianluca De Novi, Founder and CEO of Circular. “Our mission is to create a global infrastructure that brings truth and transparency to data. Hera shares this vision, and we are excited to make this collaboration and its solutions accessible to everyone.”

“I firmly believe in traditional values. I was born and raised in a region, Abruzzo, where respect, love for life, for the community, and the territory are still intact values,” declared Giovanni Sabetti, President of Hera Enterprises. “I firmly believe in a higher justice, and therefore also in the ethics and transparency of data and their communication. To strengthen the objectives of this important agreement, I have also relied on the collaboration of my friend and esteemed anthropologist, Karl Wolfsgruber.”
