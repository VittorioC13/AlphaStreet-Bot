[TITLE]Kurt Geiger’s a Bigger Contributor to Steve Madden Than First Thought:
[TEXT]
From retail doors to gross margin and even wholesale opportunities, Steve Madden Ltd.’s acquisition of Kurt Geiger is looking like a prescient move to some Wall Street analysts.

BTIG’s Janine Stichter sees a “long runway for retail growth” at Geiger, particularly in the U.S. She noted that the brand has six retail stores in the U.S., which she said are “performing well and showcasing strong four-wall profitability.”

Another opportunity is in the wholesale channel across the U.S. Current U.S. wholesale accounts includes Dillards, Bloomingdales and Nordstrom. She estimated that the total number of retail doors in the wholesale channel likely is less than 500, versus wholesale door counts by peers — for example, Coach, Kate Spade, and Michael Kors — that span between 1,2000 to 2,000.

“Particularly in the case of Michael Kors, there has also been shelf space donation, which we see continuing as retailers opt to not restock the brand onto the same level after clearing through excess inventory throughout ’25. As such, we see this as an opportunity for Kurt Geiger to gain shelf space,” Stichter wrote in a research note Thursday.

Madden’s management had expected Geiger to be immediately accretive to earnings per share (EPS), initially in the range of 10 cents in 2025. That was before the company pulled its guidance estimates due to tariff headwinds and the volatility in the macro-economic backdrop. Stichter met with management recently and believes that the initial accretion range is close to being achievable. She has a share price target of $40.

For next year, presuming the brand can re-accelerate revenue growth to a low-double-digits percent range and recoup a substantial portion of operating margin lost in 2025 due to tariff headwinds, “we believe the brand should account for over 40 cents in EPS,” the BTIG analyst said. That would be achievable, she said, since the primary driver could be the leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses as the company scales into a $1 billion-plus business.

“Looking out long-term, we believe the Kurt Geiger brand can account for $1.50-$1.70 in EPS based on management’s assumptions of $1 billion in revenue and a mid-teens percent operating margin.”

Analyst Sam Poser at Williams Trading said in a research note Thursday that he’s raised the price target of Madden shares to $42 from $28, noting that “trends and channel mix moving in Madden’s favor.”

“First, there is a shift to women’s dress shoes underway, that plays into the strength of the core Steve Madden brand,” Poser said, noting that Steve Madden’s “best successes have generally come from interpreting shoes originally made by designer brands.” He said that many of the designer brands — Manolo Blahnik, Cloe, Valentino and others — have new compelling shoes, with the new dress shoes and boots generally on lower kitten or block heels, or are flats or western style boots.

Poser also thinks many retailers will allocated more of their open-to-buy to the Steve Madden and Dolce Vita brands. Also, he believes that Madden is well positioned to benefit and gain market share as other smaller private brands raise prices due to higher costs from tariffs as they do not have the scale or factory relationships that can match those of Madden.

He also expects Geiger’s pro forma Fiscal Year 2025 revenue to be $550 million, up 10 percent year-over-year. Over the longer term, Geiger had growth opportunities in the U.S. that will be “additive” to Madden over time.

“Recent checks indicate that Kurt Geiger handbags and shoes are quietly gaining a following in the southern United States,” Poser said. “Further, there are indications that some urban fashion retailers are beginning to show interest in Kurt Geiger women’s and kid’s sneakers. The women’s Kurt Geiger sneakers retail from $188 to $248, and kid’s sneakers have an average retail of $70.”

Geiger overall has a geographic revenue mis of 50 percent in the U.K., 35 percent in the U.S. and the balance from the rest of the world. Sixty percent of total revenue is from handbags and the balance of 40 percent from . “Excluding non-leather slides, Kurt Geiger women’s footwear prices range from $125 to $450, and handbags range from $75 to $395,” the Williams Trading analyst noted. That compares with Madden’s women’s footwear prices ranging from $50 to $350, and handbags between $49 to $179.

Madden in February inked a deal to acquire the Kurt Geiger brand for $360 million from Cinven. The transaction closed in May. At the time, when Madden posted first quarter earnings, the company’s brand continues to demonstrate “outstanding momentum,” adding that its differentiated and elevated positioning in the market makes it a “complementary addition” to the company. He cited strategic initiatives that include “expanding in international markets, accessories categories and direct-to-consumer channels.”

Madden in July reported second quarter profits that were down due to wholesale order cancellations and late shipments amid a backdrop of tariff uncertainties. At the time, there were indications that dress shoes and boot sales continued to gain traction.

Madded is slated to report third quarter earnings results in early November.

[TITLE]Holiday Spending: Tariffs May Nudge Prices, but Not Shoppers:
[TEXT]
Consumers are relying more on card installments and BNPL to manage higher costs.

The holiday shopping season is kicking into full gear, and this year tariffs are again shaping the economics of the checkout line. After months of shifting trade rules, merchants appear ready to navigate the turbulence without derailing demand.

Retailers Lead in Tariff Confidence

PYMNTS Intelligence data in the accompanying chart, reflecting the views of 60 firms across industries including retail, shows 80% of companies are “very or extremely confident” they can adapt to tariff-related supply-chain disruptions, while 20% are “somewhat confident.” Among goods-sector firms — which include many retailers — confidence is even higher: 85.2% very or extremely confident and 14.8% somewhat confident. Services follow at 82.6%, and tech at 60%.

Even companies expecting a strong tariff impact remain upbeat: 85.1% of “high-impact” firms describe themselves as very confident, and 80% of “medium-impact” firms echo that view. The outlier is the “low-impact” group, where 100% are only “somewhat confident.”

These results align with PYMNTS Intelligence’s September report, “Tariff Turbulence Splits the Middle Market as Confidence Rises,” which found that 29% of middle-market firms have increased prices, 21% have renegotiated supplier terms, and every goods firm surveyed has already taken at least one mitigation step.

Moderate Price Increases Ahead

Confidence does not mean profits are untouched. PYMNTS data show 9 in 10 goods firms and more than 7 in 10 services firms raised prices over the past year, yet roughly three-quarters of goods firms still experienced margin compression.

The response heading into the holidays is therefore tactical. The end result may be modest, selective price adjustments instead of broad increases. The goal: preserve consumer volume while safeguarding as much margin as possible — where the willingness to sacrifice a few basis points of profit still helps maintain traffic through the crucial December quarter.

Consumers Turn to Flexible Payments

On the demand side, consumers continue to spend but are doing so differently. Recent PYMNTS Intelligence data confirm that shoppers are expanding use of structured payment tools to absorb higher prices.

According to separate PYMNTS Intelligence research, nearly 22 million U.S. consumers used both a private-label and a general-purpose credit card for installment payments — up from 19.8 million two years ago, a 5.3% compound annual growth rate. Store-card installment users reached 30.3 million (4.8% CAGR), while general-purpose card installment users numbered 47.8 million (0.8% CAGR).

That trend shows how card networks have effectively adopted buy now, pay later (BNPL)-style features, allowing shoppers to manage spending over time rather than pulling back outright.

BNPL Cushions Tariff Pressures

BNPL remains another key shock absorber. A PYMNTS Intelligence September study, “BNPL Growth Softens Tariff Impact on Higher Retail Prices,” found that 90% of surveyed merchants said BNPL adoption helped sustain sales volumes despite incremental price adjustments. And in “43% of Consumers Bail on Purchases Without BNPL Options,” nearly half of respondents said they would abandon a purchase if installment options were unavailable.

Those findings suggest that rather than retreating from higher prices, shoppers are re-engineering payment behavior — stretching budgets through credit installments and BNPL plans that align with biweekly pay cycles. Inflation expectations remain elevated, but consumers appear confident in their ability to manage costs month to month.

A Balanced Season Ahead

The combined message from merchants and consumers is one of controlled adaptation. Retailers have diversified suppliers, tuned pricing and leaned into digital payment flexibility. Consumers, in turn, are managing price pressures through structured borrowing tools rather than scaling back entirely. There’s proof that tariffs may raise costs, but not deter the determination to shop.

[TITLE]Online Sales Growth Slowing for Holiday, Adobe Predicts:
[TEXT]
Software giant Adobe predicts U.S. online sales during the holiday 2025 stretch will increase 5.3 percent to $253.4 billion, representing some slowing in digital sales growth.

For the holiday 2024 season, online sales in U.S. grew 8.7 percent to $241.4 billion, according to Adobe.

Adobe’s projections cover the Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, 2025 period and are based on analyzing direct transactions online, covering over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million stock keeping units and 18 product categories.

Those categories combined will represent 53.7 percent of the online spend this holiday season with electronics totaling $57.5 billion, up 4 percent; apparel totaling $47.6 billion, up 4.4 percent, and furniture reaching $31.1 billion, up 6.5 percent. Grocery sales will hit $23.5 billion, up 9.2 percent and cosmetics will reach $8.4 billion, up 9.1 percent.

While online sales for holiday are seen growing midsingle digits, overall holiday sales — digital and brick-and-mortar store sales combined — are seen growing just low-single digits. As the year has progressed, industry experts have been getting increasingly more cautious and conservative in their expectations for holiday sales gains. Concerns center around rising prices from tariffs and general inflation, declining consumer confidence, economic uncertainties and potential stockouts.

In addition, holiday shopping began as early as July for some consumers, who were looking to avoid higher prices and shortages on retail shelves later in the year, inevitably depleting the sales tally for the traditional November through December holiday period. There should be a pick-up in purchasing this month with Amazon’s “Prime” sale happening Tuesday and Wednesday, and Walmart, Target and Costco launching their own sales this week to compete. That will further snatch sales from November and December.

The London Stock Exchange Group said that, every year, retailers ride the coattails of Amazon’s Prime Days. “This Prime Week it’s highly likely that retailers are banking on aggressive promotions to encourage spending, especially as shoppers continue to prioritize value,” LSEG reported on Monday. “With consumers more price-sensitive than ever, online price comparisons will be a key part of their shopping behavior. Other retailers are aiming to capitalize on this trend by offering steep discounts to stay competitive.”

Among the shopping trends that are getting stronger this year, Adobe pointed to the increased use of AI by retailers to help consumers discover products and expedite purchasing, and that purchases attributed to social traffic should rise by 51 percent year-over-year, compared to just a 5 percent gain in the 2024 season.

Vivek Pandya, lead insights analyst for Adobe, told WWD, “We’re coming into the first really major year where consumers will be able to do a lot of ideation with these generative AI platforms. They’ll lean on them to get a better sense of prices and deals, who’s offering free shipping or not, and to get their Christmas lists together. This is going to be a nice tailwind. They’re looking at the social conversation. They’re looking at what’s being said on things like Reddit about different products. We see that play in a major way for the first time this holiday season. It’s going to be a much more comfortable experience for the consumer [with] much more awareness and utilization around generative AI platforms.” It’s helping consumers be “strategic” in their purchasing, he said, which suggests spending less.

In other key trends cited by Adobe:

Buy-now, pay-later services will drive $20.2 billion in online spend, up 11 percent and roughly $2 billion above holiday 2024.

Mobile devices will drive a record 56.1 percent share of online spend, representing $142.7 billion, up 8.5 percent year-over-year.

Cyber Monday will remain the biggest online shopping day of the year, generating $14.2 billion in sales, a 6.3 percent gain over Cyber Monday 2024.

Black Friday sales are expected to rise 8.3 percent to $11.7 billion.

8.3 percent to $11.7 billion. On Thanksgiving, consumers are expected to spend $6.4 billion online, up 4.9 percent.

The deepest discounts are expected to land throughout Cyber Week, with Cyber Monday being “last call” for the best deals.

Thanksgiving Day will be the best day to shop for sporting goods; Black Friday will see the deepest discounts for TVs, toys, and appliances; Cyber Monday will be the best day to shop for electronics, apparel and computers.

[TITLE]Everything Is Becoming a Bank:
[TEXT]
Jacobin ‘s fall issue, “Borders,” is out now. Follow this link to get a discounted subscription to our beautiful print quarterly.

The US economy is turning into one giant bank. Starbucks holds nearly $2 billion of customers’ money in its rewards program. That’s more than the total deposits managed by 85 percent of chartered banks, making the coffee chain one of the biggest financial institutions in the country. Conversely, Capital One, one of the world’s top banks, now operates its own cafes on city street corners. Airlines are now little more than flying banks, given that they make more money from selling frequent-flyer points to credit card companies than they do flying passengers. More Americans than ever are in debt to their nearby grocery store due to predatory “buy now, pay later” loans offered during checkout. As you’re wheeled into an emergency medical procedure, the nurse may ask if you’d prefer to pay on a deferred-payment loan plan, an increasingly common way to finance health care expenses. And if you can’t pay your rent on time, it could soon become common for your apartment building owner to lend you the money, putting you in debt to your landlord. These are snapshots of the new wave of financialization sweeping across the country, where the lines between finance and commerce are being blurred. Upward of 40 percent of Americans now pay for basic items like groceries and health care using borrowed money — and this excludes credit cards. A third of younger Americans hold their savings on nonbank tech platforms like Venmo, and industries from retail to transportation derive anywhere from 14 percent to half of their profits from partnerships with credit card companies. While this new type of financialization takes many different forms, the endgame is the same: Most major corporations now aspire to become unregulated banks, opening up new avenues to make even more money hand over fist. Banks operating credit cards are the highest-profit-margin enterprises in the economy. Every company wants a share of the loot, amassed from high fees and low overhead costs. This development has been supercharged by the Silicon Valley investor class, under the Orwellian term “embedded finance.” Others call it “bankification.” The peddlers of embedded finance promise a world of “frictionless transactions,” providing consumers efficiency and convenience by integrating financial and nonfinancial services. Most major corporations now aspire to become unregulated banks, opening up new avenues to make even more money hand over fist. But these new profit streams come with a range of potential harms. Financial policy watchdogs warn that bankification is unleashing predatory and fraudulent practices onto consumers, workers, and smaller businesses. It may even lay the groundwork for the next financial collapse. After all, can a widget factory be trusted to manage customers’ money and make safe lending decisions without putting the entire financial system at risk? During the Biden administration, regulators launched rules and investigations to limit corporations’ new banking ambitions. But those actions have since been terminated by the Trump administration, which has signaled that it will instead open up new channels for this fusion of finance and commerce to proceed — an experiment that could prove disastrous for the country. Bankification “encapsulates so much of what we should have learned [from 2008] and what could go wrong,” said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor emeritus at George Washington University and author of the book Taming the Megabanks: Why We Need a New Glass-Steagall Act, which warns

[TITLE]Media Buying Briefing: AI’s impact on search forces agencies to rewrite the marketing script:
[TEXT]
This Media Buying Briefing covers the latest in agency news and media buying for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Monday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series →

For all the talk of generative AI upending the media agency business — I get daily pitches of this agency or that data platform rolling out a new proprietary AI system that changes everything! — it’s not as impactful as what’s happening to the search business.

Zero-click search and generative search optimization (GEO) are the new battle cries of the media planning and buying world, all because generative AI has upended search behaviors as we’ve known them the last 20 years — and with those changes, an even deeper upending of classic purchase-funnel activity.

Taken together, they’re forcing media agencies to rewire the guidance they give clients on how to ensure discoverability when AI agents and LLMs are doing the work that consumers and Google used to do. The term “Google it” just doesn’t have the same ring to this generation of consumers than even a decade ago.

Omnicom Media Group, Digiday has learned, is attacking this fundamental change head-on by combining research to uncover the new patterns in a report to its clients, as well as what it’s telling clients to do to get their online content ready to be discovered and acted on. It’s found that generative AI queries represent nearly 25% of searches, meaning that search has changed dramatically in a year.

The change has far-reaching consequences as consumers rely on generative AI-powered search for information, advice, comparison shopping and entertainment, or engage in full conversations. Increasingly they don’t click as much on publisher or brand websites, forcing all parties in the brand marketing and media landscape to re-think how brands engage consumers.

The report, authored primarily by Joanna O’Connell, Omnicom Media Group’s chief intelligence officer for North America, found major cultural shifts brought on by AI usage. The research, conducted in July, among 2,404 U.S. adults aged 18–72 asked them who’s using AI, what they are using it for, and why. Three out of four (75%) respondents said they’re using some form of AI, while 46% said they’re using it daily. Trust in generative AI overall rose from 37% to 61% from 2024 to 2025, while trust in Google’s AI Overviews (which O’Connell jokingly referred to as a “gateway drug” for AI-driven search — Google “built a bridge to this technology, and people like it”) surged from 44% to 68%. Nearly two out of three consumers (65%) now expect to get their ideal answers from AI Overviews.

The research also uncovered five cultural shifts too, including the fact that people increasingly expect “warm tech” — that machines understand them on a more emotional basis; that the gap between dreams and reality has gotten narrower; that technology adaptively learns and is capable of thought; that it’s ubiquity makes it as fundamental as electricity; and finally that it enables personalization at a scale never seen before.

In short, marketers need to learn how to market to AI to improve the likelihood of being featured in an AI prompt response. “The shift in less than a year is just absolutely remarkable,” said O’Connell.

Drilling into categories affected by the pattern and usage changes, the study noted that the types of categories consumers search for in AI corresponds to those where discovery and comparison are super-important, areas where consumers have to navigate a high volume and variety of choices. Travel (30%), personal care (27%), and groceries (25%) top the list, along with household goods (23%), clothing, (23%) and electronics (22%).

“As that generative recommendation provides utility, context, and helpful information, you’re going to use it and trust it more,” added Michael Sondak, OMG’s svp and head of search. “We’re seeing a collapse of the classic search marketing funnel, where someone looked for information, saw a list of results, both paid and organic, and might have navigated to multiple websites.”

“These things are now becoming companions in your shopping process,” added O’Connell.

Sondak is leading the charge at OMG on telling clients how to harness opportunity in this radically altered search landscape. This is where GEO comes into play. OMG is recommending what Sondak called the four Cs: consumers, content, code and credibility.

For brands to better understand consumers’ changed habits, said Sondak, they need to look at “how are people changing the way that they’re looking for information in a world where I would argue people are no longer searching, but are now asking questions, looking for answers to their problems or answers to their next product to go purchase? It’s much more active versus passive.”

Therefore, content needs to change. “Do [brands] have the right content across their owned and operated elements that are answering the new questions of how people are using these discovery engines?,” posited Sondak.

And with content tweaks, coding needs to change as well for LLMs to read it properly, he added. Finally, credibility comes with establishing trust with the LLM that the information being digested is credible.

OMG is recommending brands take five actions: understand the four Cs, starting with the consumer; audit how your brand is showing up online; refocus that audit to how a chatbot or agent might see the content; revamp the content accordingly; and then optimize and measure the impact of the changes.

And brands are taking notice and acting on the recommendations. “The report further validates that AI is transforming how consumers discover and shop, collapsing the purchase funnel,” said Eric Schwartz, svp and CMO of the Clorox Company, an Omnicom client. “As adoption accelerates, we’re making it easier to find and shop our brands through new GEO capabilities and experiments across the business. Our brands can’t afford to wait for a new ‘paradigm’ to settle — because it won’t. Winning now means embracing an always-on transformation mindset, fueled by rapid experimentation and continuous learning.”

OMG isn’t the only agency uncovering the new trends in AI’s impact on search. A new report from performance agency Net Conversion uncovered similar fundamental changes in consumer behavior. Among the 45% of consumers now using AI-powered recommendations for shopping, half report they’re spending more time researching purchases and consulting more sources compared to a year ago — not less.

This is happening more among younger shoppers: 23% of 18-29 year-olds say they use AI tools “often” or “always” when researching products, compared to just 15% overall.

The assumption has been that AI streamlines decisions. But this new research finds that consumers who us AI are behaving more like exhaustive researchers than quick decision makers. Whether AI is driving this behavior or simply attracting already thorough shoppers is unclear, but the correlation suggests the buyer journey isn’t simplifying as AI adoption grows.

Color by numbers

Forrester issued its 2026 predictions for marketing agencies in a report issued last week, authored primarily by vp and senior agency analyst Jay Pattisall. Among other predictions, the report expects further consolidation (either by Dentsu or WPP) to “spawn a dozen agency reviews.” Other stats worth mentioning:

85% of U.S. B2C marketing executives plan to review their media agencies in 2026 . Six major brands reviewed media assignments in 2021, and 20 did so in 2023.

[TITLE]Breitbart Business Digest: Six Months After Liberation Day, Every Economic Prediction About Trump’s Tariffs Was Wrong:
[TEXT]
How Economists’ Central Anti-Tariff Prediction Collapsed

In yesterday’s Breitbart Business Digest, we examined a new working paper from Jared Bernstein and Daniel Posthumus that documented the decline of U.S. manufacturing employment, particularly the devastating 2000-2010 “China Shock” period when 5.7 million factory jobs disappeared.

While the authors called this period “destructive” and urged preventing future shocks, they insisted that “sweeping” tariffs were not the right policy. Their reasoning was undermined by a significant contradiction: they claim tariffs would disrupt American manufacturing because we’re too dependent on foreign inputs, yet they simultaneously advocate for subsidies for sectors vulnerable to foreign export controls. They’ve essentially documented that our industrial base is dangerously hollowed out while arguing we’re too dependent to fix it.

As we explained, the real-world evidence further undermines their anti-tariff position. Despite President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs imposed in April 2025, the predicted “tarifflation” never materialized. Prices on tariffed imports haven’t risen as economists predicted. In fact, prices on non-tariffed domestic goods rose more than tariffed imports, while domestic goods competing with tariffed imports are actually down since Liberation Day. There certainly has not been any widespread inflation created by tariffs. The central economic case against tariffs—that they raise consumer prices—has collapsed in the face of actual data.

What we’re actually seeing is something economists have long theorized as “optimal tariff theory.“ A country with a globally dominant consumer market can employ tariffs to force foreign manufacturers to lower prices to maintain their exports. It can also successfully pressure other countries to reduce their own import barriers by threatening even higher tariffs. Finally, the household sector can force a redistribution from the corporate sector by refusing to accept the pass-through of tariff costs.

Today we look at the rest of the anti-tariff case and how it fares even worse under scrutiny. The paper warned that tariffs would spark devastating retaliation and trade wars. Six months into Trump’s tariff regime, that retaliation never materialized. Countries lined up to negotiate instead. We’ll examine why the paper’s preferred approach—targeted subsidies for “strategic sectors”—is actually more likely to provoke conflict than sweeping tariffs, and why the “strategic” label turns out to be little more than a cover for liberal policy preferences. Finally, we’ll see how the real-world evidence after Liberation Day contradicts every theoretical objection the authors raised.

The Retaliation That Didn’t Happen

The paper warns that tariffs “lower both imports and exports, through other countries’ retaliation.” This is a now-familiar trope of anti-tariff economics. Tariffs ignite trade wars and tit-for-tat escalation, the critics claim.

But six months into Trump’s tariff regime, where is the retaliation?

For the most part, it didn’t happen. Countries lined up to negotiate. The European Union cut a deal. Japan came to the table. South Korea made concessions. Rather than launching a trade war, our trading partners discovered they need the American market, often admitting that the status quo ante had been unfair to the U.S. and created unbalanced trade patterns.

This is the most important development in the entire debate. Many economists insisted that retaliation was inevitable. That never really made much sense. In the first place, many of the same economists insisted that tariffs were damaging to countries that imposed them, hurting their own consumers through higher prices and inefficient production. But if that were so, why would anyone retaliate? It would be like gouging out your own eye in retaliation for your rival gouging out his eye.

More importantly, the theory of retaliation had no basis in economics. It was a political theory that got smuggled into economics. It was

[TITLE]Trump’s tariffs are hurting farmers — and his $10-billion bailout isn't the answer:
[TEXT]
Since the day I was born in 1956, aside from the 18 years I served in the U.S. Senate, I’ve lived solely on my family’s farm in Big Sandy, Montana. Being a farmer is the best job I’ve ever had, but I have a dire warning for this country: Family farms are in trouble, and that translates to even bigger trouble for the rest of America.

When my folks turned our third-generation farm over to me and my wife, they told us never to depend on federal subsidies to make the books balanced because you simply can’t depend on the help to be there. But news reports suggest that Trump is considering giving money to farmers intended to help them offset the damage his policies have caused.

Family farms are in trouble, and that translates to even bigger trouble for the rest of America.

American farmers are the backbone of this country, but farming is taking hits on multiple fronts. At this moment, prices at the farm gate are far below the cost of production. Input costs are as high as ever, and new farm equipment is flat-out too expensive for most family farm operations to purchase. Translation: Farmers are taking a huge loss. To understand why, we can look squarely at tariffs.

For example, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, China bought $12 billion worth of American soybean products over the last calendar year, but after Trump’s tariffs, the country that was the biggest purchaser of U.S. soybeans hasn’t bought during this year’s harvest season. And China has said it will not resume purchases of U.S. soybeans until Trump lifts more tariffs.

While soybeans have gotten most of the attention, Trump’s tariffs affect nearly every food product American farmers raise.

Despite a dizzying amount of disinformation coming from the White House that suggests that exporting countries pay the costs of tariffs, it doesn’t take a Wall Street wizard to discern that it’s you, the consumer, footing Donald Trump’s extra tax on imported goods. That means increased costs for everything we buy — from clothes to food to combine parts. Farmers rely on imported parts to repair farming equipment because domestically manufactured parts are often too expensive or simply not available.

That’s just the beginning of the tariff domino effect on production agriculture. This administration’s trade policies screw up the markets that pay farmers for the food they grow. Family farmers in this country have consistently produced far more food than its people consume, which means family farmers depend on export markets to be profitable.

For what we do sell, there’s no other choice than to have a competitive market with strong demand so that we get a fair price at the farm gate for the food we grow. As prices turn downward because of these tariffs, it keeps profitability out of reach. The bottom line? It’s costing us more to plant, grow and harvest than we are getting in return. Unless the U.S. gets those foreign markets back, rural America will be further decimated.

This horrible trade policy is going to make rural America poorer and less populated. Combine these tariffs with the elimination of federal support for rural health care (see what Trump called his “Big, Beautiful Bill”) and we have a recipe for the total annihilation of rural America. The combination of these policies not only gambles with our national food security, it’s a threat to our existence. It’s pretty difficult to sustain this country’s democracy when its people are starving.

The Trump administration’s solution is to write checks to the farmers paid for by the American taxpayer, increasing the debt. According to multiple news sources, he is reportedly considering a bail out of at least $10 billion to farmers. That’s socialism, folks. I have always believed that farmers would rather get their paycheck from the marketplace, not the government. For a party that continues to stoke fears over the “radical left,” it’s enraging to this farmer that they’re literally pushing socialism on us to make up for their bad trade policies. The call is coming from inside the house.

I have always believed that farmers would rather get their paycheck from the marketplace, not the government.

The other sad reality here is that Congress continues to be absent. Our Constitution, the document that so may have performatively wrapped themselves in, is clear that the application of tariffs is the job of the legislative branch. Are we seeing congressional oversight in the form of hearings? No. Has Congress attempted to take back its authority as it applies to tariffs? Nope. How

[TITLE]Trump’s tariffs creating stiff headwinds for Colorado outdoor industry:
[TEXT]
Colorado’s outdoor industry, a marquee business sector in a state known for its committed recreationists and abundant opportunities to enjoy the outdoors, is facing rough going as the Trump administration announces tariffs, pauses them and reimposes the duties.

While economists and politicians debate the merits and drawbacks of higher taxes on imports, industry representatives, state officials and business owners say the small and mid-sized companies that make up the bulk of Colorado’s outdoor business sector are struggling with the fallout.

And the new tariffs come on top of duties that have been historically higher than for many other industries. Through the years, outdoor businesses have gone to China, Vietnam and other countries where materials and production facilities for technical gear and equipment are more available.

All those factors make it difficult for outdoor businesses to move production to the U.S. At best, they say, it would take a few years to develop the factories and necessary expertise.

Michael Mojica began moving some of the manufacturing for his business, Outdoor Element, from China to Vietnam in search of lower tariffs.

But the shift wasn’t quite fast enough in the quickly changing trade arena. He received word from his logistics company that, even though the shipment was on the water, increase in tariffs on steel and aluminum announced Aug. 18 would pile another 50% onto the 28% rate he already was paying on those goods.

Outdoor Element uses the metals for products that include multitool carabiners, stoves, knives and fire-starting equipment.

“I was planning to pay $4,200 for tariffs. I ended up paying $12,600. There went my profit,” Mojica said.

Outdoor Element, based in Englewood, had its best year in 2024. This year, Mojica is questioning whether he’ll be able to stay in business.

“The curveball of tariffs is a real thing,” Mojica said. “I have discovered that most people don’t realize that it’s these small businesses that are actually paying the tariffs, not the manufacturer if we’re making them overseas.”

Mojica left his job as a mechanical engineer in the aerospace industry in 2017 to chase his dream of turning a side hustle of designing and producing outdoor equipment into full-time work. Moving to Colorado rekindled his love of the outdoors. He remains hopeful

[TITLE]Kenneth Cole Creates CharCole Capsule for Mental Health Awareness:
[TEXT]
Is gray the color of mental health? It is to Kenneth Cole.

On World Mental Health Day on Friday, the designer will launch the CharCole Collection, a limited-edition capsule in a custom gray shade developed with Pantone that is intended to symbolize that it’s OK to live in the gray area before moving forward toward balance and well-being, according to the company.

The line of men’s and women’s outerwear, footwear and accessories in the monochromatic shade will include a trucker jacket, reversible vest, knit bomber and long-sleeve polo for men and a flannel midi dress, double-breasted jacket and wide-leg pant for women. In addition, a Pryer sneaker and Tully Cap Toe Oxford shoe for men and a Marsha Pointed Toe Boot and Jasper Flat for women will also be part of the collection. There are also cold-weather accessories including scarves, beanies, watches and belts.

To mark the launch, 100 percent of sales for CharCole on the Kenneth Cole website on Friday will be donated to the Mental Health Coalition, a nonprofit organization founded by Cole dedicated to breaking the stigma around mental health and expanding access to essential resources and support to everyone.

In addition to the apparel and footwear, Cole has also partnered with Butterfield Market in New York City to create a CharCole cruller and with Café Panna on an ice cream flavor. Twenty-five percent of the proceeds from the sale of the crullers will also be donated to the Mental Health Coalition through the month of October.

“I have always believed that to be aware is more important than what you wear,” said Kenneth Cole, chairman and chief creative officer of Kenneth Cole Productions Inc. “With the creation of CharCole, we have created not just a color but a conversation — one that symbolizes strength in complexity and encourages us to embrace every shade of how we feel. Every day, but especially on World Mental Health Day, CharCole should remind us that finding comfort in the gray is an essential step toward well-being and destigmatizing mental health.”

The collection will also be available at select retailers including Nordstrom and Macy’s.

[TITLE]Levi’s Q3 Profits Top Estimates as CEO Michelle Gass Grows More Bullish on the Year:
[TEXT]
Levi Strauss & Co. is riding the denim cycle higher — and continuing to bust out of its traditional role as a men’s jeans brand.

Adjusted third-quarter profits inched up 1.5 percent to $136 million, with earnings per share of 34 cents coming in 3 cents ahead of the 31 cents analysts forecast, according to Yahoo Finance.

Revenues for the three months ended Aug. 31 rose 7 percent to $1.5 billion, in line with analyst expectations and enough for chief executive officer Michelle Gass to boost Levi’s outlook for the year.

“Our strategies are working and this is giving us the confidence to raise our top- and bottom-line guidance,” Gass told WWD. “We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of high-single-digit organic growth. [Produced] record gross margin once again, despite the impact [of] the tariffs. This was now our 14th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth.”

Gass, who’s been CEO at Levi’s since January 2024, has been building on and sharpening the company’s efforts to expand its own direct-to-consumer business, which currently accounts for 46 percent of sales, and bring in more women shoppers.

It’s been a very step-wise approach-building quarter after quarter, but investors wanted something more at first blush and traded shares of the company down 5.8 percent to $23.10 in after-hours trading on Thursday, retrenching some after a 40 percent increase this year.

But Gass’ focus is clearly on the business.

“This pivot from being a jeans company to a head-to-toe denim lifestyle company is well underway and resonating,” Gass said. “We still have growth across genders — men’s up 5 percent, women’s up 9 percent. The brand has never been stronger.”

The company just wrapped up a yearlong marketing campaign with Beyoncé Knowles-Carter and is now featuring Grammy-nominated country artist Shaboozey in its ads, rounding out what’s been a year focused on Levi’s connection to music.

“We enter holiday with confidence,” Gass said. “It is an uncertain environment, but I will tell you that we are really focused on executing our strategy.”

That strategy has seen the company close the Levi’s footwear business, exit the lower-priced Denizen brand and sell Dockers in July.

[TITLE]At Nordstrom’s Fall Savings Event, Get 25% Off Trending Women’s Styles to Wear All Autumn Long:

Just when you thought your chance to save big on luxury fashions was over, Nordstrom unveiled its annual, much-anticipated Fall Savings Event — and we can’t believe how on-trend all of the selections, going for up to 25 percent off, really are.

Whether you’re on the market for a knit blazer to pair with your baggy jeans or maxi skirt; have a soft-spot for the viral Mary Jane style from Rothy’s, made of recycled water bottles; want to treat your face to some stylishly oval sunglasses from Celine; or are looking to stand out from the crowd with a raincoat that swaps the traditional tans and blacks for an invigorating shade of blue, all this and more is possible to shop on nordstrom.com right now.

Because the Nordstrom sale kicked off only on October 7, most of the hottest picks’ sizes are still fully in stock, but we guarantee you that by the time the shopping event wraps up (on October 15 at 11:59 p.m. PT, FYI), this will not be the case. That being said, we urge you to shop early for the very best chance at amping up your fall wardrobe with the outerwear, footwear, dresses, and even cozy pajamas that will make you even more excited for the seasonal shift.

This is a particularly great opportunity to get your hands on the luxe brands that have long been on your wishlist (but were a tad bit too pricey to invest in). Our editors, for instance, have our sights set on top-selling picks from Stuart Weitzman, Alice + Olivia, Ralph Lauren, the aforementioned Celine, Vince, and beyond. It’s not every day that these labels witness markdowns on their in-season fashions, better yet those of up to 25 percent off — so make sure you don’t miss the moment.

[TITLE]The 14 Best Ways To Turn Customers Into Brand Advocates In 2025:
[TEXT]
In the ever-changing world of online commerce, the most important indicator of a brand’s performance isn’t just selling a product, it’s the development of a loyal self-sustaining community of brand ambassadors.

They do more than simply repurchase, they actively promote your brand’s image and defend it in public forums and help to drive new customer acquisition by leveraging authentic, trustworthy word-of-mouth.

In 2025, strategies to cultivate these crucial relationships are getting more sophisticated, interconnected with technology, and crucial to long-term success. This article provides 14 most efficient ways to turn satisfied customers into your best marketing asset.

Why Brand Advocacy Is The Top Marketing Strategy？

The main reason for brand advocacy’s rise into the top of marketing strategies is the decreasing effectiveness of traditional advertisements. The majority of consumers, particularly younger ones are becoming more averse to advertising and have developed a distrust of brands’ messages. They rely heavily on reviews from their friends. Leveraging Customer Reviews boost sales.

An endorsement from a trusted friend or a favorable opinion from another shopper has more credibility than a multimillion-dollar endorsement from a celebrity.

In addition, the economic principle that is based on Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) shows that maintaining and building on an existing customer is more cost-effective than purchasing a new one. Advocates can dramatically raise CLV through repeated purchases.

Foundational Strategies For Advocacy Cultivation

Before employing innovative strategies an organization must establish its base. These fundamental principles are unchangeable for any advocacy campaign that is successful.

1. Deliver An Unparalleled Product Experience

Advocacy cannot be created and has to be earned. The foundation of building brand advocates is to create a solution or product that surpasses expectations and delights customers. Each aspect of user interaction (UX) starting from packaging to the core functions, should be carefully created.

In 2025, this will mean the use of high-quality materials, an intuitive design as well as seamless interaction with the digital world. A poor product will not in any way create real supporters.

The investment in R&D and constant enhancement based on feedback from customers is the initial and most important step.

2. Implement A Seamless And Frictionless Customer Journey

The process of purchasing and beyond must be simple. Any friction point–a sluggish checkout procedure or loading time that is slow and poor mobile responsiveness or unhelpful customer support–can smother the enthusiasm of advocacy. Use the tools of journey mapping to pinpoint and eliminate any pain points.

Make sure your customer service is empathetic, empowered and able to solve problems, not only efficiently but also in a way that is memorable. Customers who have problems resolved swiftly and effectively are often more loyal than a customer who has never faced an issue in the first place.

3. Build A Community-Centric Brand Identity

Brands are a source of pride for people who they feel part of. Instilling a sense and a shared identity is essential. This requires establishing a solid branding mission and a set of values that customers are able to align with personally.

Create spaces that are specifically designed that allow your customers to interact with each other, including Facebook groups with your brand name as well as exclusive forums and user-generated material (UGC) campaigns.

4. Deploy An Advanced Loyalty And Rewards Program

The modern loyalty program has developed way beyond the simple point-per-purchase system. The most efficient programs for 2025 are highly dynamic, providing reward levels that encourage not only spending, but also engagement.

Offer rewards to customers who perform actions that are beneficial to the brand such as reviewing, posting via social networks, sharing with friends, or even creating content.

This is when a sophisticated platform becomes essential.

A strategy that is centered on Advocacy with Yotpo Loyalty allows brands to design a seamless program that rewards transactions and purchases and seamlessly integrates these rewards to the overall shopping experience, thereby creating the cycle of interaction and reward.

5. Leveraging Technology And Data-Driven Tactics

After the foundation has been laid and the technology is in place, it will allow you to increase and organize campaigns for advocacy, which transforms satisfied customers into a tangible marketing channel.

6. Master The Art Of Leveraging Customer Reviews

Social proof is the currency of confidence in the world of e-commerce. A systematic method of gathering, curating, as well as displaying customer feedback, is essential. This is more than just adding a review widget to products’ pages.

This means actively soliciting reviews following purchase through automated email or SMS streams and responding to reviews (positive as well as negative) to demonstrate your appreciation for feedback.

Perhaps most importantly, sharing reviews across the internet. Leveraging customer reviews involves the integration of them into ads and feeds on social media, and even your homepage to establish credibility across all touchpoints.

Advanced analytics can also be utilized to gather qualitative information from reviews in order to aid the design of your product and pinpoint typical customer complaints.

7. Utilize AI-Powered Personalization At Scale

Generic marketing is no more. In 2025, experts expect brands to get to know their customers intimately. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms analyse vast data sets–purchase history, browsing history and engagement patterns to deliver highly personalized experiences.

This includes personalized product recommendations as well as personalized emails for marketing purposes and dynamic content on websites, and personalized deals. When a buyer feels confidently appreciated, their loyalty to the brand increases dramatically, transforming them from a regular customer to a committed customer.

8. Integration Of User-Generated Content (UGC) To The Shopping Experience

UGC can be described as the purest type of advocacy – customers are marketing for you. Invite customers to share photos or videos using your product by creating an appropriate hashtag. Use the UGC platform to gather the shared content and showcase it across your online real property.

Real people, not models, using your product in real-world situations is very effective for creating trust and generating social proof. Additionally, it actively engages the people who are your brand’s advocates in its narrative.

9. Strategic Engagement And Relationship Deepening

Advocacy is a relation that is not a transaction. Strategies are geared towards enhancing the relationships over time.

10. Create Exclusive Experiences And Early Access

Your advocates should feel as if they are VIPs. Give them access to brand new launches, limited-edition products, or other special occasions (virtual or in person). This makes them feel appreciated and special but also strengthens their status as a part of your brand’s community.

The feeling of exclusivity is a mighty benefit that money cannot buy, and it creates a tremendous amount of positive will and a desire to be a part of their privilege.

11. Establish A Formal Ambassador Or Advocate Program

Bring your advocacy to the next level by setting up an established ambassador program. Find your most loyal customers and offer them the proper framework for promoting which can be in exchange for incentives, commissions, or even free products.

This is a win-win for everyone as the brand’s ambassador receives the recognition and rewards they deserve, while the company gets a committed group of genuine promoters that can create information, give valuable feedback and boost sales in their networks.

11. Foster Co-Creation And Act On Feedback

True loyalty can only be built when customers feel valued and can see their feedback shaping the company’s image. Engage in a continuous process of soliciting feedback via surveys, focus groups and programs for beta testing.

Additionally, take action on the feedback you receive and then communicate changes in the public domain.

If a user suggests improvements to the product or a new feature, and later see it being implemented, they feel an appreciation for the brand and pride in the company’s growth, which cements their status in the role of an ambassador.

12. Explore Gamification And Tokenized Incentives

Include game-like elements like leaderboards, badges or challenges in your methods of engagement to make it enjoyable and addictive. The future is bright, and the application of blockchain technology to create reward tokens (e.g.

NFTs that provide exclusive access or benefits) is a new way to create unique trading, and ownable assets that recognize and reward your most loyal customers and bring the concept of advocacy with Yotpo Loyalty into the Web3 age.

13. Cchampion Authentic Values And Purpose-Driven Missions

Modern-day advocates are affixed to brands that represent something. An authentic dedication towards Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles as well as sustainable development, social justice or support for the community is no longer a luxury and is a major factor in establishing loyalty.

Be open about your initiatives, keep track of progress and engage your community in these efforts (e.g. donations-per-purchase programs). Advocacy is enhanced when consumers feel that they are helping the greater good.

14. Leverage Advocacy Data For Predictive Analytics

Make use of the data collected of your active supporters to discover others who are similar to them. Predictive analytics can analyse the behavior patterns of your advocates to pinpoint like-minded audiences within your customer base, or within the larger market.

This can be used to create extremely targeted acquisition campaigns aimed at identifying potential advocates before they have even made an initial purchase creating a self-repair growth loop.

This approach, based on data, is the final result of a program that focuses on leveraging the power of Customer Reviews in addition to advocacy statistics, turning qualitative opinions into quantitative intelligence.

Conclusion

Converting customers into brand ambassadors in 2025 requires a multi-faceted and highly integrated strategy. It begins with an exceptional product and seamless experience but is ultimately scaled through smart technology, strategic engagement, and authentic relationship-building.

By implementing these 14 strategies–from deploying sophisticated loyalty platforms that enable advocacy with yotpo loyalty to mastering the critical practice of leveraging customer reviews–businesses can build a self-perpetuating marketing engine fueled by trust, community,.
