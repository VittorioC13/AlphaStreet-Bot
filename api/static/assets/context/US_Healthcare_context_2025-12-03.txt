[TITLE]MOH DEADLINE NOTICE: ROSEN, NATIONAL TRIAL ATTORNEYS, Encourages Molina Healthcare, Inc. Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important December 2 Deadline in Securities Class Action – MOH:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Nov. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) between February 5, 2025 and July 23, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important December 2, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Molina securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 2, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period failed to disclose to investors: (1) material, adverse facts concerning Molina’s “medical cost trend assumptions;” (2) that Molina was experiencing a “dislocation between premium rates and medical cost trend;” (3) that Molina’s near term growth was dependent on a lack of “utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services;” (4) as a result of the foregoing, Molina’s financial guidance for fiscal year 2025 was substantially likely to be cut; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Molina’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

[TITLE]Longeveron New MRI Biomarker Data Linking Neuroinflammation to Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Mild Alzheimer’s Disease Presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease Conference (CTAD 2025:
[TEXT]
Results obtained in the Phase 2 placebo-controlled CLEAR-MIND clinical trial showed that treatment with stem cell therapy laromestrocel was associated with a reduction in MRI measured neuroinflammation compared to placebo across multiple key brain regions, including key Alzheimer’s disease-associated regions, most notably in the hippocampus

Reduction in hippocampal neuroinflammation, measured using MRI assessed free water, correlated strongly with preservation of hippocampal volume and with clinical outcomes

Findings suggest a sustained anti-inflammatory effect of laromestrocel, reinforcing its proposed mechanism of action in the treatment of mild Alzheimer's disease

MIAMI, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Longeveron Inc. (NASDAQ: LGVN), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing cellular therapy for life-threatening, rare pediatric and chronic aging-related conditions, today announced that its submission entitled “Reduced brain neuroinflammation after laromestrocel treatment in mild AD: results from the CLEAR MIND study” is being presented in a poster presentation at the 18th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease Conference (CTAD 2025) being held December 1-4, 2025 in San Diego, CA.

“Laromestrocel, a stem cell therapy that has multiple potential mechanisms of action to address inflammatory responses in the brain, offers the potential to address the underlying pathology of Alzheimer’s disease,” said Joshua Hare, M.D., Co-founder, Chief Science Officer, and Executive Chairman at Longeveron. “This data expands on the positive clinical information from the Phase 2a CLEAR MIND clinical trial that showed laromestrocel improved cognitive function, quality of life, and brain volume in the treatment of mild Alzheimer’s disease. We are very encouraged by the safety profile and efficacy evidence that support the differentiated therapeutic potential of laromestrocel in Alzheimer’s disease.”

Longeveron has conducted phase 1 and 2 clinical trials testing laromestrocel as a potential therapeutic for mild AD and has received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this clinical program.

From the Poster:

A hallmark feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is neuroinflammation, which is a principal driving factor in disease pathogenesis, gliosis, and neuronal death. In the CLEAR MIND study, we demonstrated that laromestrocel treatment improved clinical scores and reduced brain atrophy in multiple brain regions, including the hippocampus as well as the temporal and frontal lobes. To extend these findings, we sought mechanistic evidence of an effect on neuroinflammation in core AD-associated regions, particularly the hippocampal and temporal regions.

We examined the effects of laromestrocel treatment in patients of our CLEAR MIND Phase 2a trial on inflammation in the AD brain using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and free water analysis. In DTI imaging, although mean diffusivity provides some indication of inflammation, free water is considered a more precise measure and is used in assessing hippocampal AD pathology, although no clinically meaningful difference in free water has yet been defined. Laromestrocel is a novel, bone marrow-derived, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based investigational therapeutic that targets neuroinflammation, microvascular dysfunction, and has the potential to stimulate endogenous tissue regeneration, and has received RMAT and fast-track designations from the US FDA for mild AD.

Results:

Patients receiving laromestrocel exhibited a durable reduction in free water fraction compared with placebo (N=11) at week 39 for several brain regions, including hippocampus (Group 4: p=0.004, N=8; Group 3: p=0.037, N=8), which showed a dose response, and also temporal cortex (Group 3: p=0.032, N=8), occipital cortex (Group 3: p=0.003, N=8), and parietal cortex (Group 3: p=0.038, N=8). This new result was accompanied by clinical benefit as wells as reduced brain atrophy, as demonstrated in our study. Of the 14 brain regions, 13 (all but frontal) showed pooled treatment group responses (Groups 2, 3, and 4 combined) in the direction of improvement (reduction in free water) by week 39.

Poster Conclusion:

Overall, treatment with laromestrocel was associated with a reduction in neuroinflammation as assessed by free water compared to placebo across multiple brain regions, including key AD-associated regions—most notably in the hippocampus and temporal lobe. Importantly, rising free water was found in the placebo group, representing continued disease progression, while inflammation was stabilized with laromestrocel treatment. These findings suggest a sustained anti-inflammatory effect of laromestrocel, reinforcing its proposed mechanism of action in the treatment of mild Alzheimer's disease. This evidence supports continued clinical development of laromestrocel for this indication.

[TITLE]€150 million agreement between EIB and Angelini Ventures to finance European startups:
[TEXT]
This is the first agreement signed by the EIB with a corporate venture capital in the healthcare sector, and is part of the EU strategy to support the development of innovative companies across the continent.

Angelini Ventures and the EIB will each invest €75 million in the biotechnology, medtech, and digital health sectors.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) and Angelini Ventures – Angelini Industries’ corporate venture capital fund – have signed an agreement to provide a total of €150 million in financing for European biotechnology, medtech and digital health startups. This is the first agreement the EIB has signed with a corporate venture capital in the healthcare sector, and states that Angelini Ventures and the EIB will each invest €75 million over the next six years.

Under the agreement, the EIB and Angelini plan to co-invest in a total of seven to ten European startups developing innovative solutions particularly suited for market launch, in areas such as biotechnology, medical technology and digital health.

“Initiatives like this strengthen Europe’s ability to lead technological innovation and generate tangible benefits for people, patients and businesses,” said EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti. “Investing in biotechnology, medtech and digital health is vital, as it accelerates research, improves the quality of care, and supports the growth of companies able to bring cutting-edge solutions to market.”

Presented at the Angelini Ventures head office in Rome today, the initiative is aligned with TechEU, the EIB Group’s investment programme to strengthen the growth of innovation and technological leadership in Europe. Via TechEU, the EIB Group aims to invest €70 billion in equity, quasi-equity, loans and guarantees over the three-year period from 2025 to 2027, with the goal of mobilising €250 billion of investment in the real economy. The agreement also strengthens Angelini Ventures’ position in the sector. Founded in 2022 with €300 million from Angelini Industries (an Italian multinational in the health, industrial technology and consumer goods sectors), the company has already invested €125 million in 22 startups.

“This important agreement with the EIB enables us to bring our group’s commitment to innovation through venture capital to a European strategic context,” said Angelini Industries CEO Sergio Marullo di Condojanni. “Being chosen by the EIB for an ambitious project aiming to consolidate Europe’s role in innovation and health is an opportunity to work towards the common goal of turning researchers’ excellent ideas into products and services with a positive impact on people’s lives and the economic development of European countries.”

“The agreement with the EIB is a key step in strengthening our international presence and global vision,” explained Angelini Ventures CEO Paolo Di Giorgio. “This development path is essential to accelerating market access for talent and for innovative projects, facilitating strategic partnerships in health and offering scaling opportunities for investments and partners. These elements are fundamental to speeding up growth and creating value in the healthcare and biotechnology sector, promoting European innovation, competitiveness and social impact on an international level.”

As a first step in the new partnership, Angelini Ventures and the EIB intend to co-invest in the second financing round of Adcytherix, a French biopharmaceutical company that develops innovative ADCs (Antibody-Drug Conjugates), with the investment agreement currently being finalized. These targeted therapies combine antibodies with next-gen cytotoxic payloads, to enhance precision, reduce toxicity and address resistance to current treatments. The first round, which closed in October of this year, was led by Bpifrance through its Large Venture and InnoBio investment strategies, and co-led by Kurma Partners, Andera Partners and Angelini Ventures.

Startups in Europe and Italy

The European Commission Startup and Scale Up Strategy aims to more effectively overcome the two main obstacles that startups face as they grow: the transition from research to development and the market, and the leap from startup to established company. In this domain, the work of the European Investment Bank Group (EIB Group) with corporate venture capital companies helps to facilitate the identification and financing of innovative businesses, with the potential to accelerate the growth, scalability and competitiveness of European startups via greater availability of capital. Another goal is to stimulate a potential European initial public offering (IPO) market, which would help increase the business relevance of European stock exchanges and help to keep value generated within Europe, in Europe. This could be a particularly useful tool, given that, as the European Commission states in The EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy Choose Europe to start and scale, almost 30% of European unicorn companies moved outside the European Union between 2008 and 2021 and only 8% of global scale-ups are based in Europe.

In 2024, there were 15 000 funding rounds in the United States totalling €210 billion in investment, while there were 11 000 in Asia for a total of €70 billion. Europe, meanwhile, had 9 600 rounds with total financing of €57 billion, with the number of deals falling by 16% and total value by 8% compared to 2023.*

The United States saw a 4% increase in the number of deals and a 29% rise in total funding over the same period.

Venture capital investment in Italy in 2024 totalled €1.5 billion over 417 rounds, up 31% vs. 2023.

The Italian venture capital market is mainly focused on deeptech, software and life sciences, with €300 million invested over 62 rounds in 2024 in life sciences alone. A €12 million investment in Serenis, co-led by Angelini Ventures, was the biggest deal in the life sciences sector (and among the top five overall) in the third quarter of 2025.

Growth Drivers for the North America Biotechnology Market

Expanding Applications

The market for biotechnology in North America is growing quickly because of its many uses outside of healthcare. Despite its historical focus on medications and diagnostics, biotechnology is increasingly essential to industrial processing, agriculture, and environmental sustainability. Innovations in agricultural biotechnology, such as genetically modified crops, improve production, insect resistance, and climate resilience. By producing sustainable materials, biofuels, and biodegradable polymers, industrial biotechnology aids in the transition to a bio-based economy.

Bioremediation, pollution prevention, and waste management are all aided by environmental biotechnology. The fields of gene therapy, regenerative medicine, and vaccine development are all still expanding in the healthcare industry. Additionally, the development of tailored biological systems is made possible by synthetic biology and computer modeling. As more sectors embrace biotech-driven solutions to solve global challenges, biotechnology's cross-sector flexibility positions it as a pillar of innovation and sustainability, propelling continuous market expansion across North America.

Rising Demand for Personalized Medicine

The rising need for tailored medicine is a major factor propelling the biotechnology market in North America. This method customizes medical care for each patient according to their lifestyle, surroundings, and genetic profiles. More accurate and efficient treatments are now possible because to developments in genomics and molecular diagnostics, which enable medical professionals to pinpoint certain biomarkers and genetic differences affecting medication responses and illness risks.

To complement this trend, biotech businesses in the U.S. and Canada are progressively creating targeted medications, gene treatments, and diagnostic tools. Adoption is further accelerated by the growing prevalence of chronic and inherited disorders as well as increased patient and clinician awareness. Additionally, personalized healthcare is becoming more accessible due to the ongoing drop in the cost of genetic sequencing, which presents enormous growth prospects for biotech companies based in North America.

Advancements in Genomic and Proteomic Technologies

Proteomic and genomic technology advancements are the primary drivers of the biotechnology industry's growth in North America. Genomics focuses on examining complete genetic sequences, whereas proteomics studies the forms, roles, and interactions of proteins. Both disciplines are essential for understanding the causes of disease and developing specialized therapies. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), bioinformatics, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing have accelerated biomedical research and enabled the more rapid and accurate identification of biomarkers and therapy targets.

Customized medicine, regenerative therapy, and pharmacological development all depend on these technologies. Strategic industry relationships further illustrate the sector's momentum. Alexion and AstraZeneca Rare Disease reaffirmed their commitment to creating next-generation genomic therapeutics by combining complementary resources and state-of-the-art technology in July 2023 when they signed an agreement with Pfizer Inc. to buy preclinical gene therapy products. North American biotechnology firms will be better equipped to create precision-based treatments and increase their global competitiveness as these advancements continue.

Challenges in the North America Biotechnology Market

High Research and Development Costs

A significant obstacle confronting the biotechnology industry in North America is the remarkably elevated expense of research and development (R&D). Extensive clinical trials, sophisticated laboratory infrastructure, and qualified scientific expertise are all necessary for the development of biopharmaceuticals, gene treatments, and other biotech advances. These endeavors need a significant financial investment. Bringing a novel biotech product to market can take over ten years and cost billions of dollars on average.

Due to their inability to obtain adequate funding, smaller biotech companies frequently turn to venture capital, partnerships, or mergers with bigger pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, the high likelihood of experimental medicine failure raises financial risk, making R&D expenditures a major deterrent to innovation and market entry in the area.

Regulatory Hurdles

Another significant obstacle facing the North American biotechnology business is the presence of strict regulatory frameworks. To guarantee the safety, effectiveness, and quality of biotech products, organizations like Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implement stringent approval procedures. These drawn-out and intricate processes are necessary for public health, but they can also raise development costs and postpone the launch of products.

Biotech companies have to deal with stringent clinical testing regulations, gene editing ethics, and changing biosafety standards. Additionally, cross-border operations and product launches may be complicated by regulatory variances between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Despite the sector's great development potential, operational bottlenecks caused by lengthy clearance periods, frequent regulation modifications, and unclear outcomes impede smaller businesses and slow innovation.

United States Biotechnology Market

The U.S. biotechnology market is the largest and most advanced globally, driven by strong R&D infrastructure, abundant funding, and cutting-edge technological innovations. Key growth factors include personalized medicine, genomics, proteomics, and expanding applications in healthcare, agriculture, and industrial biotechnology. The country benefits from significant government and private investments, supportive regulatory frameworks, and collaborations between academic institutions and biotech firms.

Major companies focus on biopharmaceuticals, gene therapies, and precision medicine. However, high R&D costs, regulatory hurdles, and competitive pressures remain challenges. The market's dynamic nature, coupled with strategic partnerships and technological breakthroughs, positions the United States as a global leader in biotechnology innovation and commercialization.

Canada Biotechnology Market

Canada's biotechnology market is growing steadily, supported by government initiatives, research funding, and a skilled scientific workforce. The sector focuses on healthcare, agriculture, environmental sustainability, and industrial biotech applications. Key drivers include advancements in biopharmaceuticals, genomics, and regenerative medicine, along with increasing collaborations between research institutions and private companies. Favorable regulatory policies, such as expedited approval pathways, encourage innovation and commercialization.

Canada also benefits from strong export potential and partnerships with global biotech firms. Challenges include limited domestic funding compared to the U.S., talent retention, and competition from international markets. Despite these constraints, Canada's biotechnology market continues to expand, offering significant opportunities in precision medicine, vaccine development, and sustainable biotechnology solutions.

Recent Developments in North America Biotechnology Market

In June 2025, Eli Lilly agreed to acquire Verve Therapeutics for USD 1.3 billion, enhancing its gene-editing pipeline. The same month, Illumina completed its USD 425 million acquisition of SomaLogic, expanding its multi-omic capabilities to include proteomics.

In April 2025, Novartis announced a USD 23 billion investment over five years to strengthen its U.S. biotech and pharmaceutical operations. The plan includes seven new facilities, 1,000 direct jobs, and 4,000 additional roles, focusing on biologics manufacturing, drug packaging, a new San Diego research hub, and expanded radioligand therapy sites.

Also in April 2025, Amgen invested an additional USD 900 million to expand its Ohio biologics manufacturing site, raising total regional investment to over USD 1.4 billion and increasing site employment to 750, citing Ohio's favorable business climate.

In March 2025, Roche opened the Roche Genentech Innovation Center Boston at Harvard's Enterprise Research Campus in Allston. The center will lead R&D in cardiovascular, renal, and metabolism (CVRM) diseases, support AI-driven drug discovery, employ up to 500 people, and strengthen Roche's collaboration with Harvard.

[TITLE]MOH DEADLINE NOTICE: ROSEN, NATIONAL TRIAL ATTORNEYS, Encourages Molina Healthcare, Inc. Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important December 2 Deadline in Securities Class Action – MOH:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Nov. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) between February 5, 2025 and July 23, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important December 2, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Molina securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 2, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period failed to disclose to investors: (1) material, adverse facts concerning Molina’s “medical cost trend assumptions;” (2) that Molina was experiencing a “dislocation between premium rates and medical cost trend;” (3) that Molina’s near term growth was dependent on a lack of “utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services;” (4) as a result of the foregoing, Molina’s financial guidance for fiscal year 2025 was substantially likely to be cut; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Molina’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
