[TITLE]Disney+ is working on allowing users to share AI-generated video content:
[TEXT]
Disney+ might soon feature AI-generated video content.

During Disney’s fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 earnings conference call this week, company CEO Bob Iger teased “the biggest and the most significant changes — from a product perspective, from a technology perspective” to the platform since its launch in 2019.

One of these is pretty straightforward — content from Epic Games as part of its $1.5 billion deal with the Fortnite maker. Iger noted that most of that will still involve Disney IP coming to Fortnite, as we saw most recently with the big The Simpsons crossover event, but he suggested that “a number of game-like features” will also make their way to Disney+. That’s pretty logical and innocus.

But another of those big changes that Disney is also really bullish about, Iger said, is AI-generated content for users.

“The other thing that we’re really excited about, that AI is going to give us the ability to do, is to provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content and to consume user generated content — mostly short-form — from others,” teased Iger. Which sounds somewhat similar to the weird Meta Vibes app, but inside Disney+, and only filled with Disney content.

It’s unclear exactly what form this might take, especially given Disney’s vast catalogue of intellectual properties. Would it be limited to certain characters or franchises? Iger didn’t elaborate, although he noted there’s a “need to protect our IP.” Iger also didn’t mention when such a feature might roll out, simply noting that Disney is holding “productive conversations” with unnamed AI companies.

Of course, there are countless reasons to be put off by this news. For one, Disney is one of the pioneers of animation, a handcrafted artistic medium, so it’s gross to consider AI slop based on all of that. Disney is also one of the biggest companies of all time, so it could easily pay human artists instead of investing in this drivel.

And of course, there’s never any guarantee that generative AI has ethically sourced its content, even if Disney ended up certain that it’s “protected” its own IP (Especially since we’ve seen how easy it’s been for people to use tools like Bing to create AI-generated images of characters like Disney’s own Mickey Mouse in offensive situations like carrying out 9/11.) Beyond protecting its own IP how will disney make sure that its AI isn’t stealing from others online as well.

But hey, who cares about any of that if you can make your own AI slop featuring Spider-Man, Elsa and Luke Skywalker, right?

[TITLE]Apple TV drops its paywall for Major League Soccer:
[TEXT]
Good news, soccer fans: You’ll be paying a lot less for your Major League Soccer habit next year.

Apple has announced that, starting next year, it will do away with the add-on paywall for Apple TV’s Major League Soccer coverage, meaning all Apple TV subscribers will get to stream MLS regular season and playoff action for no extra charge.

For this past regular season of MLS Season Pass, Apple charged $14.99 a month or $99 for the full season, while Apple TV subscribers had to shell out a discounted rate of $12.99 a month or $79 for the season. Apple had already dropped its MLS paywall for Apple TV subscribers at the end of the regular season, so all 2025 MLS playoff games are included in its $12.99-per-month subscription (following a recent price hike).

“Our partnership with Apple has always been

[TITLE]Major League Soccer paywall on Apple TV is now gone:
[TEXT]
Updated November 14 with a report that Apple and MLS have revised their partnership agreement.

In 2022, Apple and Major League Soccer agreed to a big deal that made Apple TV the streaming provider for all of the league’s matches (local broadcasters still offered games on network TV). However, those matches required a paid subscription. That paywall is going away for the upcoming 2026 MLS season, according to an announcement made by Apple and MLS.

MLS matches next season will simply be part of a regular Apple TV subscription. An Apple TV subscription is $12.99/£12.99 per month, or $99 per year. Previously, Apple offered MLS Season Pass, which was $14.99 per month or $99 per year (an Apple TV subscription was not required).

While the report may seem surprising, the signs that foretold a change were apparent. The 2026 MLS playoffs (which are happening now) are not behind a paywall on Apple TV. Earlier this year, reports stated that MLS commissioner Dan Garber called Apple “a great technology partner,” but there were questions on whether Apple TV was the best venue for the league’s efforts to expand its fanbase. Apple and MLS began a ten-year deal that started with the 2023 season.

Sportico reported that the Apple/MLS deal will now end in 2029, three years earlier than the original 2032 agreement. MLS commissioner Garber told reporters that the contractual changes are all “very positive for us.” Apple will pay MLS $858 million for the remaining years of the contract.

The changes come a month after Apple and Formula 1 signed a five-year deal for Apple TV to stream all F1 races. In that deal, practices, qualifying, Sprint sessions, and Grands Prix will be available to Apple TV subscribers, and select races and all practice sessions will be available for free in the Apple TV app. F1 TV Premium will continue to be available in the U.S. via an Apple TV subscription only for $17 per month.

[TITLE]This Is What Genocide Looks Like When Silicon Valley Writes the Brochure:
[TEXT]
It’s being called the GREAT Trust. A glossy plan for Gaza’s ​“redevelopment” that includes solar plants, hospitals and an Elon Musk-branded ​“Smart Manufacturing Zone.” But, as analysts have suggested, it only works if the people of Gaza are gone.

The slides leaked over a month ago to the Washington Post spell out the game plan: Gazans will be forced to choose between dubious and iniquitous ​“voluntary” mass relocation or ​“temporary housing,” while and billionaires get their branded tech playground built on ashes and bones. This is what genocide looks like when Silicon Valley writes the brochure: ethnic cleansing dressed up as innovation. But this sickening plan by American tech oligarchs to profit off the devastation of Gaza and its people is not the first chapter of their involvement in this conflict. The truth is that many of them have helped drive, been complicit in, or profiteered off the genocide for the last two years, and they seem all too ready to continue that legacy.

Let’s start first with Palantir — Alex Karp and Peter Thiel’s secretive data-defense-tech monopoly. In January 2024, the company held a board meeting in Tel Aviv where CEO Alex Karp announced Palantir was supplying Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government with ​“different products than we supplied before” as IDF forces leveled Gaza. At the same time, independent investigations exposed Israel’s AI system ​“Lavender,” which auto-generated a kill list with tens of thousands of ​“potential targets”, rubber-stamped in seconds before bombs fell on residential apartment blocks. While Palantir’s potential role in the ​“Lavender” AI system is not publicly known, the tech giant sells ​“decision-making” software built to supercharge machinery of mass killing. While it now rakes in money from Israel’s war, Palantir has contracted with cities like New York and Chicago.

[TITLE]Verizon layoffs: American telecommunications company to cut 15,000 jobs amid restructuring — Who will get affected?:
[TEXT]
Verizon layoffs: Verizon, the leading American telecommunications company, is set to reduce thousands of roles as part of a restructuring under its new CEO Dan Schulman, reported Reuters.

The company is planning to cut about 15,000 jobs, 15% of its workforce, said the report, citing person familiar with the matter.

However, a Verizon spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.

The new CEO's first commitment was to stop the bleeding from subscriber churn, which would require subsidizing expensive handsets for a huge number of Verizon's subscribers to keep them from leaving, Craig Moffett, senior analyst at Moffett Nathanson, told Reuters.

When will layoffs start? The layoffs are set to take place as soon as next week.

Who will get affected? The job cuts are aimed at Verizon's non-union management ranks and are expected to affect more than 20% of that workforce, a source told Reuters.

He added that Verizon also plans to transition around 180 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations.

Slowdown in growth As subscriber growth slows and cautious consumers are unwilling to buy premium wireless plans, Verizon is battling rising competition. The coompany is also facing mounting pressure from rivals AT&T and T-Mobile US.

How many employees does Verizon have? At the end of 2024, Verizon had about 1,00,000 US employees.

Last year it announced a reduction of 4,800 employees through a voluntary program and took a nearly $2 billion charge.

Verizon acquisitions — Verizon spent $52 billion to acquire key wireless C-Band spectrum in a 2021 auction.

— The telecommunication company struck a $20 billion deal to acquire Frontier Communications last year.

— Verizon also spent $6 billion to acquire prepaid mobile phone provider TracFone Wireless.

Recent tech layoffs Amazon, TCS, Microsoft, IBM and several other companies have announced layoffs.

Earlier this month, tech giant IBM said that it would cut thousands of roles amid focus on software growth.

“In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” said the company's spokesperson.

According to Layoffs.fyi - a platform that tracks global tech industry layoffs — over 110,502 tech workers have been laid off across 226 tech companies in 2025 alone.

Amazon has announced that it will reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 people.

[TITLE]Apple Just Halved App Store Fees—But Only for ‘Mini Apps’:
[TEXT]
Apple today announced the App Store Mini Apps Partner Program, a new initiative that allows developers hosting mini apps or games inside their larger apps to qualify for a reduced App Store commission rate of 15%.

“Today, we’re introducing the Mini Apps Partner Program, which expands on the App Store’s ongoing support for apps that offer mini apps. Mini apps are self-contained experiences that are built using web technologies like HTML5 and JavaScript,” Apple said in its announcement.

Participating developers will earn 85% of qualifying In-App Purchase sales within eligible apps — effectively cutting Apple’s usual 30% App Store fee in half. To qualify, developers must adopt certain Apple technologies, including the Declared Age Range API and the Advanced Commerce API, both designed to ensure safer and more seamless transactions for users of all ages.

Apple describes the new program as a way to support developers hosting mini apps and games without compromising on user experience. The company says the new framework builds on its long-standing support for HTML5 and JavaScript-based mini apps, a format that’s grown popular on platforms like WeChat, Discord, and even AI chatbots.

The timing of this launch comes just as Apple reportedly struck a deal with Tencent to take a 15% cut of all mini app and game purchases made within China’s WeChat — the country’s dominant “super app” used by more than 1.4 billion people.

Apple has been slowly softening its iron-fisted 30% App Store commission structure in recent years amid mounting regulatory pressure in the U.S. and Europe. Even before facing legal opposition, though, the company introduced the App Store Small Business Program in 2020, offering a similar 15% rate to developers earning up to $1 million USD annually. Per a report from earlier this year, Apple collected more than $10 billion USD (about $14 billion CAD) in App Store commissions from the U.S. alone in 2024.

The Mini Apps Partner Program reflects Apple’s growing flexibility as it adapts to new digital ecosystems — particularly as mini apps and embedded software experiences continue to reshape how users interact with apps.

According to Apple, the program’s goal is to ensure that “developers who host mini apps grow their business and further the availability of mini apps on the App Store — all while providing a great customer experience.” Developers interested in joining the program can submit a request form via Apple’s developer portal.

[TITLE]Apple Finally Scores a Piece of WeChat’s Massive App Revenue:
[TEXT]
Apple has reportedly reached a major agreement with Tencent that will see the iPhone maker take a 15% commission on mini game and app purchases made in WeChat, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

The deal, which has been in the works for more than a year, marks a turning point in Apple’s relationship with Tencent, one of China’s biggest tech companies. Until now, Apple hadn’t received any cut of the significant revenue generated from WeChat’s mini apps — an omission that had become a sticking point between the two companies.

WeChat isn’t just a messaging app — it’s a “super app” used by more than 1.4 billion people every month for everything from banking and online shopping to playing games and paying bills. Its mini apps, which operate entirely within WeChat, contributed roughly 32.3 billion yuan ($6.4 billion CAD) in revenue for Tencent’s social network division during the September quarter alone.

Apple reportedly pushed Tencent to close loopholes that allowed app creators to funnel users to external payment platforms to avoid the iPhone maker’s traditional 30% App Store commission. The new deal cuts that rate in half, setting it at 15%, but allows Apple to finally tap into a fast-growing segment of China’s digital economy.

Developers who want to qualify for the new arrangement will need to comply with Apple’s software policies, including features like age-sharing tools for parents.

This agreement not only opens a new revenue stream for Apple but also signals improving ties with Tencent — a company it may soon collaborate with to bring Apple Intelligence to China. Earlier reports suggested Apple was considering Tencent and ByteDance as potential partners to deploy its AI features in the region.

Apple has been gradually easing its once-rigid 30% App Store fee structure in recent years amid regulatory pressure worldwide. In China, this deal could help Apple strengthen its ecosystem and deepen its foothold in one of its most important markets.

Apple even launched its own mini-app version of the Apple Store on WeChat back in 2023 to reach more online shoppers in the country — and now, with this new deal, it’s finally getting a share of WeChat’s booming in-app economy.

[TITLE]The passions over Tsipras’s book, the Owl publishing house, the new players and the Russian gas, Pierre and the 2-euro coin, the turmoil in the banks over the Swiss franc:
[TEXT]
Newsroom November 13 04:48

Hello — okay, let’s be honest, the hottest topic of the day is the dispute (or “total fallout,” as they say colloquially) between Tsipras and Vax over the book. Look, first of all, we have experience with both sides — both have adored us passionately at times when they were in power — but, as the English say, no hard feelings. After all, neither Tsipras nor Vaxevanis ever pretended to be our friends, so personally, we have no complaints. Now, if I were a “judge,” so to speak (though I loathe courts and trials), I’d say that Tsipras is rightly saying: “Hey man, don’t ruin my book, my message, and my truth.” And the other replies: “When I did the same to others, you were thrilled,” or even more cleverly, “I’m doing journalism and criticism — that’s my right.” All right, anyway, I don’t know how successful Alexis’s party will be with all this, but the book will definitely sell — even if only chapters or excerpts circulate.

The big story

Rajat Mehta, scion of Mumbai-based Mehta Group, walked out of the listing ceremony of Billionbrains Garage Ventures or Groww, on Wednesday, feeling vindicated. The company he backed in 2016 as an early-stage investor, at a valuation of roughly $1.3 million, debuted at $8.6 billion on the National Stock Exchange. The 36-year-old felt a sense of pride after his father, Rakesh Mehta, told him, "Let's find the next Groww to invest." Coming from a business family whose fortunes were built on advisory, wealth management and brokerage services, the Mehtas traditionally preferred the comfort of listed companies. But it was the younger Mehta who pushed the family toward investing in unlisted assets and startups when he joined the business in 2013. "The first startup I invested in went bust within three months," he recalled. "But I learnt from that and kept on investing." He has now invested in 35 startups, including some valued at over a billion dollars and are in the process of being listed.

The millennial is part of a broader shift among wealthy Indian families who are investing in startups. India is on the cusp of an unprecedented intergenerational wealth transfer, with an estimated $1.5 trillion expected to change hands over the next decade, according to a report by Julius Baer and EY in June this year. Between 2018 and 2024, the number of family offices in India rose more than 500% to over 300 from 45, the report said, citing a separate study. Another measure of rising wealth — the number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, or families with assets above $30 million — also increased to roughly 13,000 in the same period. The true number of family offices in India could be five to 10 times higher, according to multiple wealth managers that I interviewed for this newsletter.

The next investors

The next generation of these wealthy families is typically well educated, often with international degrees, and may be reluctant to pursue the traditional family business or remain unconvinced

[TITLE]Workhorse Group Provides Additional Time To Vote For Motiv Transaction:
[TEXT]
Adjourns 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders

Urges Shareholders Who Have Not Voted To Get Their Votes In

CINCINNATI, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Workhorse Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: WKHS) (“Workhorse” or “the Company”), an American technology company focused on pioneering the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles, today announced that it has adjourned its 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) until November 25, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to be held virtually at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WKHS2025.

The Company issued the following statement:

In order to give Workhorse shareholders ample time to vote on the 2025 Annual Meeting proposals, we are adjourning the Meeting until November 25, 2025. Although votes received thus far are strongly in favor of each of the nine proposals, quorum has not been reached.

It is crucial that shareholders submit their votes, no matter how many shares they own. By voting FOR the Workhorse – Motiv transaction, as well as the other eight proposals up for a vote, Workhorse shareholders will have the opportunity to participate in the potential upside of a leader in the medium-duty EV commercial vehicle market, with a significant ownership stake in the combined company.

By not voting, shareholders are putting their investment at risk. If shareholders do not vote for all proposals, the transaction with Motiv will not close, and Workhorse will have to continue as an independent company. Help us capture long-term growth opportunities for the combined company and deliver shareholder value creation by voting FOR all of the proposals.

As previously announced, leading independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co. have both recognized the compelling value of our transaction with Motiv and have each recommended that shareholders vote FOR the merger. We urge shareholders to submit their votes as soon as possible in order to realize the benefits of the transaction and protect their long-term investment.

Shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 18, 2025, will be entitled to vote at the meeting. If you have previously voted, there is nothing further you need to do.

Vote today by proxy card, online or by phone.

[TITLE]Applied Digital Announces Pricing of $2.35 Billion of Senior Secured Notes:
[TEXT]
DALLAS, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: APLD) (“Applied Digital” or the “Company”), a leading designer, builder and operator of high-performance, sustainably engineered data centers and colocation services for Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), cloud, networking, and blockchain workloads, today announced that its subsidiary, APLD ComputeCo LLC (“APLD Compute”), has priced a $2.35 billion offering (the “Offering”) of 9.250% senior secured notes due 2030 (the “Notes”) at an issue price of 97%.
