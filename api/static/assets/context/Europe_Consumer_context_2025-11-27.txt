[TITLE]Top consumer watchdog fines JioMart over risky walkie-talkie listings:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: India's top consumer watchdog has held Reliance JioMart guilty of misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices by allowing the sale of uncertified walkie-talkies on its platform, government officials aware of the matter said, in a first such action against an e-commerce portal.

Accordingly, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA imposed a penalty of ₹100,000 and directed JioMart to ensure that no walkie-talkies or any product requiring statutory approval is listed without full compliance with applicable laws. A compliance report has to be filed within 15 days.

The CCPA order of 21 November, reviewed by Mint, follows a months-long inquiry that began in May, when the regulator issued notices to several e-commerce platforms over illegal sales of wireless devices operating in restricted frequency bands - or radio frequencies that are reserved for emergency services like police, or ambulance communication, defence services, or aviation. Any interference with these airwaves can disrupt essential services, and also potentially raise national security concerns.

During its inquiry, the authority found that JioMart had listed walkie-talkie models without disclosing crucial information such as operating frequency, licensing requirements or proof of Equipment Type Approval (ETA) from the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing of the Department of Telecommunications.

The ETA certifies that a wireless device uses only those radio frequencies that are legally permissible in India and follows the technical standards set by the government.

May mislead buyers

The omission by JioMart could mislead buyers into assuming the devices were legal for unrestricted use, violating consumer rights under the Consumer Protection Act, particularly the right to be informed

[TEXT]
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN), a leading lifestyle products and services company which operates a portfolio of global consumer brands including the Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement, Urban Outfitters and Nuuly brands, today announced record net income of $116.4 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.28 for the three months ended October 31, 2025. For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, net income was a record $368.7 million and earnings per diluted share were $4.01.

Total Retail segment net sales increased 9.6%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 8.0%. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by high single-digit positive growth in both digital channel sales and retail store sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 12.5% at Urban Outfitters, 7.6% at Anthropologie and 4.1% at Free People. Subscription segment net sales increased by 48.7% primarily driven by a 42.2% increase in average active subscribers in the current quarter versus the prior year quarter. Wholesale segment net sales increased 7.6% driven by an 8.4% increase in Free People wholesale sales primarily due to an increase in sales to specialty customers.

For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, total Company net sales increased 11.5% to a record $4.36 billion. Total Retail segment net sales increased 8.0%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 6.1%. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by mid single-digit positive growth in both retail store sales and digital channel sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 6.8% at Anthropologie, 6.4% at Urban Outfitters and 4.7% at Free People. Subscription segment net sales increased by 53.4% primarily driven by a 47.3% increase in average active subscribers in the current period versus the prior year period. Wholesale segment net sales increased 15.7% driven by a 16.8% increase in Free People wholesale sales primarily due to an increase in sales to specialty customers.

“We are pleased to report record revenues, profits, and earnings per share for the quarter,” said Richard A. Hayne, Chief Executive Officer. “Trends observed last quarter have remained consistent with broad-based comparable sales growth and robust results in the Retail, Subscription, and Wholesale segments. These results underscore the strength of our diversified business model, which enables us to continue capturing market share, and drive consistent long-term growth,” finished Mr. Hayne.

Net sales by brand and segment for the three and nine-month periods were as follows:

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 31, October 31, 2025 2024 2025 2024 Net sales by brand Anthropologie $ 634,828 $ 587,923 $ 1,811,713 $ 1,683,408 Free People 399,272 365,857 1,167,398 1,049,677 Urban Outfitters 339,848 300,577 946,524 887,550 Nuuly 144,629 97,232 407,915 265,870 Menus & Venues 10,773 10,266 30,056 28,041 Total Company $ 1,529,350 $ 1,361,855 $ 4,363,606 $ 3,914,546 Net sales by segment Retail Segment $ 1,296,454 $ 1,182,557 $ 3,716,233 $ 3,441,698 Subscription Segment 144,629 97,232 407,915 265,870 Wholesale Segment 88,267 82,066 239,458 206,978 Total Company $ 1,529,350 $ 1,361,855 $ 4,363,606 $ 3,914,546

For the three months ended October 31, 2025, the gross profit rate increased by 31 basis points compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024, and gross profit dollars increased 13.3% to $563.3 million from $497.3 million. For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, the gross profit rate increased by 135 basis points compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024, and gross profit dollars increased 15.7% to $1.62 billion from $1.40 billion. The increase in gross profit rate for both periods was primarily due to improved Retail segment markdowns driven by lower markdowns at Urban Outfitters and Free People and leverage in store occupancy costs due to the increase in comparable Retail segment net sales, partially offset by deleverage in initial merchandise costs. The increase in gross profit dollars for both periods was due to higher net sales and the improved gross profit rate. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, the Company recorded store impairment charges of $2.0 million, and during the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company recorded store impairment and lease abandonment charges of $4.6 million.

As of October 31, 2025, total inventory increased by $46.5 million, or 5.9%, compared to total inventory as of October 31, 2024. Total Retail segment inventory increased by 6.3% and comparable Retail segment inventory increased by 7.4%. Wholesale segment inventory was flat. The increase in Retail segment inventory was due to increased sales.

For the three months ended October 31, 2025, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $50.4 million, or 13.7%, compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses deleveraged 32 basis points as a percentage of net sales compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024. For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $121.1 million, or 11.5%, compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat as a percentage of net sales compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024. The deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Subscription segments, partially offset by leverage in store payroll expenses due to the Retail segment stores net sales growth. The dollar growth in selling, general and administrative expenses for both periods was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Subscription segments, as well as increased store payroll expenses to support the Retail segment stores net sales growth.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was 23.6%, compared to 24.2% in the three months ended October 31, 2024. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, was 22.2%, compared to 23.6% in the nine months ended October 31, 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, was primarily attributable to the ratio of foreign taxable earnings to global taxable earnings and the release of certain valuation allowances.

Net income for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was a record $116.4 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.28. Net income for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, was a record $368.7 million and earnings per diluted share were $4.01.

On June 4, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 20 million common shares under a share repurchase program. During the nine months ended October 31, 2025, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 3.3 million shares for approximately $152 million. During the twelve months ended January 31, 2025, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 1.2 million shares for approximately $52 million. As of October 31, 2025, 14.7 million common shares were remaining under the program.

During the nine months ended October 31, 2025, the Company opened a total of 41 new retail locations including: 25 Free People stores (including 13 FP Movement stores), 9 Anthropologie stores and 7 Urban Outfitters stores; and closed 6 retail locations including: 4 Urban Outfitters stores and 2 Free People stores.

[TITLE]US retail sales slow as tariffs and costs hit consumer confidence:
[TEXT]
This rise was driven by a 0.9% jump in goods prices, highlighting the steeper costs that businesses face. Much of it was attributed to the volatile food and energy segments.

But for now, some retailers continue to shield customers from the full effects of higher business prices.

‘Value-hunting’

As Trump’s tariffs take hold, all eyes have been on how consumers - a key driver of the world’s biggest economy - respond to price pressures.

Affordability has emerged as a key worry, with Democrats’ victories in off-year elections in New Jersey, New York and Virginia this month fuelled by voters angry over rising costs.

Trump has since widened tariff exemptions to cover various agriculture products as costs of living weigh on American voters.

Besides the “muted growth” in September’s retail sales, Navy Federal Credit Union chief economist Heather Long flagged notable monthly declines in categories hard hit by tariffs.

These include auto parts, electronics, appliances, sporting goods and instruments.

“American consumers are in value-hunting mode,” Long said. “They are spending more on the basics and being extra choosy with where they spend their discretionary dollars.”

Rate cut ahead?

Thegap is growing between higher earners and lower-income households.

Although wealthier households continue to spend, “middle- and lower-income families are turning more cautious heading into the holiday season”, said EY-Parthenon senior economist Lydia Boussour.

She noted mounting pressures from a weaker jobs market.

The retail figures, alongside fresh evidence of soft private-sector hiring, boost the case for another Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December, Boussour added.

Data released by The Conference Board showed that consumers are not only “less sanguine” about their situations but “notably more pessimistic about business conditions six months from now”.

Its consumer confidence index dropped to 88.7 in November, from 95.5 in October, the lowest reading in seven months.

Fed officials will be digesting the newer private sector indicators and delayed federal figures as they mull the need for another rate cut in December.

Both government reports published on Tuesday had been delayed as a shutdown between October and mid-November halted data releases on inflation, jobs and others.

The stoppage hit the collection of consumer inflation and employment data for October in particular, resulting in the cancellation of full reports on both fronts. Instead, available numbers will be released with November’s figures.

On Tuesday, Commerce Department figures showed that September retail sales were still up 4.3% from a year ago.

The producer price index report, meanwhile, indicated that “the inflation impulse from the tariffs is modest and underlying services inflation is still slowing”, said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics.

Underlying PPI inflation “should ease after producers have finished passing on tariff costs in a few months’ time”.

[TITLE]US retail sales miss expectations as consumers see higher costs:

Beiyi SEOW

US retail sales grew at a slower pace than anticipated in September, government data showed Tuesday, as higher prices added to affordability concerns while firms grappled with an uptick in business costs.

Publication of official economic data has recently been delayed by a record-long goverment shutdown, and the latest figures suggest that consumer spending lost steam towards the end of the summer.

Economists warn that the softening in sales is likely to persist as President Donald Trump’s tariffs add to costs while the labor market weakens.

Overall retail sales picked up by 0.2 percent on a month-on-month basis, said the Commerce Department, slightly below analyst expectations and cooling from August’s 0.6 percent increase.

A separate report by the Labor Department showed that wholesale inflation picked up pace in September, rising by 0.3 percent, in line with forecasts.

This growth was driven by a 0.9-percent jump in goods prices, underscoring the steeper costs that businesses have been facing.

Much of it was attributed to the volatile food and energy segments.

But for now, some retailers continue to shield customers from the full effects of higher tariffs.

– ‘Value-hunting’ –

As Trump’s tariffs take hold, all eyes have been on how consumers — a key driver of the world’s biggest economy — respond to price pressures.

The US leader recently widened tariff exemptions to cover various agriculture products as costs of living weigh on American voters.

Besides the “muted growth” in September’s retail sales, Navy Federal Credit Union chief economist Heather Long flagged notable monthly declines in categories hard hit by tariffs.

These include auto parts, electronics, appliances, sporting goods and instruments.

Sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers fell in September, while those at food and drinks stores eased. Sales at clothing, hobby and electronics stores all turned negative.

“American consumers are in value-hunting mode,” Long said. “They are spending more on the basics and being extra choosy with where they spend their discretionary dollars.”

She stressed that the economy appears lopsided, with a growing gap between higher earners and lower-income households.

Both reports published Tuesday were delayed as a government shutdown between October and mid-November halted data releases on inflation, jobs and others.

Hayne, Chief Executive Officer. “Trends observed last quarter have remained consistent with broad-based comparable sales growth and robust results in the Retail, Subscription, and Wholesale segments. These results underscore the strength of our diversified business model, which enables us to continue capturing market share, and drive consistent long-term growth,” finished Mr. Hayne.

Net sales by brand and segment for the three and nine-month periods were as follows:

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 31, October 31, 2025 2024 2025 2024 Net sales by brand Anthropologie $ 634,828 $ 587,923 $ 1,811,713 $ 1,683,408 Free People 399,272 365,857 1,167,398 1,049,677 Urban Outfitters 339,848 300,577 946,524 887,550 Nuuly 144,629 97,232 407,915 265,870 Menus & Venues 10,773 10,266 30,056 28,041 Total Company $ 1,529,350 $ 1,361,855 $ 4,363,606 $ 3,914,546 Net sales by segment Retail Segment $ 1,296,454 $ 1,182,557 $ 3,716,233 $ 3,441,698 Subscription Segment 144,629 97,232 407,915 265,870 Wholesale Segment 88,267 82,066 239,458 206,978 Total Company $ 1,529,350 $ 1,361,855 $ 4,363,606 $ 3,914,546

For the three months ended October 31, 2025, the gross profit rate increased by 31 basis points compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024, and gross profit dollars increased 13.3% to $563.3 million from $497.3 million. For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, the gross profit rate increased by 135 basis points compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024, and gross profit dollars increased 15.7% to $1.62 billion from $1.40 billion. The increase in gross profit rate for both periods was primarily due to improved Retail segment markdowns driven by lower markdowns at Urban Outfitters and Free People and leverage in store occupancy costs due to the increase in comparable Retail segment net sales, partially offset by deleverage in initial merchandise costs. The increase in gross profit dollars for both periods was due to higher net sales and the improved gross profit rate. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, the Company recorded store impairment charges of $2.0 million, and during the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company recorded store impairment and lease abandonment charges of $4.6 million.

As of October 31, 2025, total inventory increased by $46.5 million, or 5.9%, compared to total inventory as of October 31, 2024. Total Retail segment inventory increased by 6.3% and comparable Retail segment inventory increased by 7.4%. Wholesale segment inventory was flat. The increase in Retail segment inventory was due to increased sales.

For the three months ended October 31, 2025, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $50.4 million, or 13.7%, compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses deleveraged 32 basis points as a percentage of net sales compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024. For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $121.1 million, or 11.5%, compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat as a percentage of net sales compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024. The deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Subscription segments, partially offset by leverage in store payroll expenses due to the Retail segment stores net sales growth. The dollar growth in selling, general and administrative expenses for both periods was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Subscription segments, as well as increased store payroll expenses to support the Retail segment stores net sales growth.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was 23.6%, compared to 24.2% in the three months ended October 31, 2024. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, was 22.2%, compared to 23.6% in the nine months ended October 31, 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, was primarily attributable to the ratio of foreign taxable earnings to global taxable earnings and the release of certain valuation allowances.

Net income for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was a record $116.4 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.28. Net income for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, was a record $368.7 million and earnings per diluted share were $4.01.

On June 4, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 20 million common shares under a share repurchase program. During the nine months ended October 31, 2025, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 3.3 million shares for approximately $152 million. During the twelve months ended January 31, 2025, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 1.2 million shares for approximately $52 million. As of October 31, 2025, 14.7 million common shares were remaining under the program.

During the nine months ended October 31, 2025, the Company opened a total of 41 new retail locations including: 25 Free People stores (including 13 FP Movement stores), 9 Anthropologie stores and 7 Urban Outfitters stores; and closed 6 retail locations including: 4 Urban Outfitters stores and 2 Free People stores.

[TITLE]Dick’s turnaround at Foot Locker includes store closures, inventory reset:
[TEXT]
Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Dive Brief:

In its first quarter reporting as a combined business, Dick’s Sporting Goods Executive Chairman Ed Stack said it was time to “clean out the garage” at Foot Locker in an effort that will span stores, inventory and other assets.

For starters, the company is focused on clearing out unproductive inventory across Foot Locker’s business and will close an unspecified number of stores. The company will also rightsize assets “that don’t align with our go-forward vision,” per a release.

Already, Dick’s is in the middle of an 11-store pilot at Foot Locker to test changes in merchandising and product. Stack said the effort has produced encouraging results and was “pretty capital light,” including adding fresher products and changing the visual merchandising walls around footwear.

Dive Insight:

Dick’s has set an aggressive turnaround timeline for Foot Locker, with plans for the newly acquired business to reach an inflection point by back-to-school next year and be accretive to the company in 2026.

The retailer also named a head of international for Foot Locker, rounding out its leadership team. In addition to Ann Freeman, a 26-year Nike veteran who is president of Foot Locker’s North America business appointed in September, Dick’s has named British executive Matthew Barnes president of Foot Locker International, effective Dec. 3. Barnes has nearly three decades of experience, including at Aldi and Tesco. He also fulfills a requirement Stack was looking for: to have a European running its European business.

There’s a lot of work to do. While Dick’s itself saw net sales rise 5.9% and comps grow 5.7% in Q3, Foot Locker’s proforma comps declined 4.7%.

“Let me be candid: Foot Locker strayed from retail 101 and did not execute the fundamentals,” Stack said on a call with analysts Tuesday, laying some of the blame at the feet of Nike’s DTC transition as well, which left Foot Locker without the right inventory to be successful. However, having worked with the business now for a number of weeks, Stack added that, “our conviction that we can turn this business around has only grown.”

That conviction is based on the idea that Foot Locker’s problems stem from the core elements of retailing, including inventory management and in-store merchandising. At the 11 test stores Dick’s has overhauled, one of the main changes was to the visual merchandising of Foot Locker’s shoe walls. In other stores, “it’s a run-on sentence of shoes,” according to Stack, whereas the refreshed stores make an effort to segment the product and showcase important styles.

Prior to the acquisition, Foot Locker was on its own journey to revamp its fleet, including refreshing some stores and rolling out new store concepts across its namesake and Kids Foot Locker businesses. Some of the elements of the reimagined stores will be kept, but others “need to be rethought,” according to Stack. In particular, some unproductive areas that were built to foster community will be taken out and replaced with a stronger apparel offering.

Some stores will be closed as well, though Stack wouldn’t go into details on how many, as the company is still evaluating that. CFO Navdeep Gupta also added that Dick’s is not looking at unprofitable stores purely to close them. The retailer is also evaluating if a location could become profitable if it had the right product, innovation and merchandising.

Dick’s, for its part, opened 13 of its experiential House of Sport locations in the quarter, the highest number it’s opened in a single quarter. Dick’s CEO Lauren Hobart also touted its “Collector’s Clubhouse” effort with Fanatics in 20 House of Sport stores, which features trading cards and other collectibles, and said they plan to add this concept to every new House of Sport store. The retailer raised its full-year guidance and expects comps to be up between 3.5% to 4%.

Hobart stressed that the combined company needed to “ring-fence” the Dick’s team and that those employees are solely focused on driving Dick’s continued success.

“Although Dick’s is firmly at the top of the league table, the newest recruit to its team is far from a star player,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. “Indeed, Foot Locker has been one of the laggards of retail for quite some time.”

Specifically, Saunders highlighted Foot Locker’s $46 million loss in the quarter, which pulled down Dick’s bottom line, and noted that Dick’s is “inheriting a business that needs a lot of training to get into shape.”

However, Foot Locker now has a date for some of its changes to take fuller effect. Back-to-school next year is the first time Dick’s will have complete control over Foot Locker’s buying process, and the retailer expects to see an inflection at that point. That timing will also give the company time to clear out unproductive inventory at Foot Locker, which it expects to finish by the end of this year.

The plan is to start fresh on inventory in the new year, though that means Foot Locker’s gross margin will take a 1,000- to 1,500-basis-point hit in Q4. Stack said he was confident that Foot Locker would see meaningful gross margin improvement next year.

[TITLE]Top consumer watchdog fines JioMart over risky walkie-talkie listings:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: India's top consumer watchdog has held Reliance JioMart guilty of misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices by allowing the sale of uncertified walkie-talkies on its platform, government officials aware of the matter said, in a first such action against an e-commerce portal.

Accordingly, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA imposed a penalty of ₹100,000 and directed JioMart to ensure that no walkie-talkies or any product requiring statutory approval is listed without full compliance with applicable laws. A compliance report has to be filed within 15 days.

The CCPA order of 21 November, reviewed by Mint, follows a months-long inquiry that began in May, when the regulator issued notices to several e-commerce platforms over illegal sales of wireless devices operating in restricted frequency bands - or radio frequencies that are reserved for emergency services like police, or ambulance communication, defence services, or aviation. Any interference with these airwaves can disrupt essential services, and also potentially raise national security concerns.

During its inquiry, the authority found that JioMart had listed walkie-talkie models without disclosing crucial information such as operating frequency, licensing requirements or proof of Equipment Type Approval (ETA) from the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing of the Department of Telecommunications.

The ETA certifies that a wireless device uses only those radio frequencies that are legally permissible in India and follows the technical standards set by the government.

May mislead buyers

The omission by JioMart could mislead buyers into assuming the devices were legal for unrestricted use, violating consumer rights under the Consumer Protection Act, particularly the right to be informed

A unique combination of super app ecosystems, cross-border commerce, and financial inclusion initiatives drives Asia-Pacific's BNPL market. Unlike in Europe, where regulatory compliance dominates the landscape in payment sector, Asia-Pacific is characterized by rapid innovation and digital-first adoption, especially among younger consumers. Super apps, SME partnerships, and education financing will continue to shape the region's BNPL growth trajectory.

However, regulatory oversight is gradually catching up as policymakers focus on preventing debt risks. Providers aligning with market-specific regulations and consumer needs will emerge as leaders in this dynamic and highly diverse market. Sector-specific growth in travel, education, and cross-border e-commerce will further drive BNPL's role as a core financial service over the coming years.

Current State of the BNPL Market

E-commerce and Super App Integration: BNPL services are widely integrated into e-commerce platforms like Lazada, Shopee, and Flipkart, as well as super apps such as Grab and Gojek. Providers offer tailored repayment options to attract tech-savvy millennials and first-time digital borrowers.

Regional Variations: In Australia, BNPL adoption is driven by early market entrants like Afterpay and Zip. Southeast Asian markets like Indonesia and Malaysia are seeing rapid growth, driven by financial inclusion initiatives and collaborations with digital wallets. India's market is expanding due to the rise of fintech players offering no-cost EMI options for essential purchases.

Growing Focus on Financial Inclusion: Providers increasingly target rural and underbanked populations in emerging markets like India and Indonesia. Flexible installment plans are designed to meet the needs of informal sector workers and small businesses, helping bridge the financial services gap.

Key Players and New Entrants

Key Players: Leading providers across the region include Afterpay (Australia), PayLater (Grab) (Southeast Asia), and ZestMoney (India). These players benefit from strong partnerships with regional e-commerce giants and super apps, providing seamless payment solutions across various sectors.

New Entrants: Fintech startups like Hoolah (Singapore) and Kredivo (Indonesia) are expanding their presence through strategic collaborations with local retailers. Global providers like Klarna are also entering key markets like Australia and India to capitalize on the growing BNPL demand.

Recent Launches, Mergers, and Acquisitions

Afterpay's Expansion in Offline Retail (Australia): In 2023, Afterpay extended its services to physical retailers across Australia, partnering with electronics and fashion chains. This move aims to strengthen its omnichannel presence and boost adoption among in-store shoppers.

Grab's PayLater Expansion (Southeast Asia): Grab expanded its PayLater service to additional markets, including Vietnam and the Philippines, offering flexible payment options for ride-hailing, food delivery, and e-commerce purchases. This initiative is designed to enhance Grab's super-app ecosystem.

ZestMoney's Partnership with Flipkart (India): In mid-2023, ZestMoney deepened its collaboration with Flipkart, allowing users to access zero-interest BNPL options for big-ticket purchases such as electronics and home appliances.

Kredivo's Funding Round (Indonesia): In 2023, Kredivo secured significant funding to support its expansion into new Southeast Asian markets, including Thailand and Vietnam. This move positions Kredivo as a regional leader in BNPL services.

Anticipated Competitive Dynamics

Super App Competition: Super apps like Grab, Gojek, and Paytm are expected to further integrate BNPL services into their ecosystems, creating bundled offerings that increase user engagement across multiple services, such as transportation, food delivery, and bill payments.

Technology and Personalization: Providers will likely invest heavily in AI-driven personalization to improve credit risk assessment and tailor repayment options. This will enhance customer experience and reduce default rates, particularly in emerging markets with limited credit histories.

Expansion into Non-Retail Sectors: BNPL providers are increasingly targeting sectors like healthcare, education, and travel. By offering installment plans for medical expenses, tuition fees, and travel bookings, they aim to diversify their revenue streams and capture a broader customer base.

With over 75 KPIs at the country level, this report provides a comprehensive understanding of BNPL market dynamics, market size and forecast, and market share statistics.

Japan's BNPL market is rapidly evolving, driven by increasing adoption among younger consumers, integration into e-commerce platforms, and the entry of international providers. Key players, such as Paidy, Zozo, and Mercari, alongside global entrants such as Afterpay, are driving the competitive landscape by offering diverse and tailored installment payment services across various platforms. Over the next 2-4 years, BNPL will likely become a mainstream payment method in Japan, with intensified competition fostering innovation and consumer benefits. Regulatory stability and cultural preferences for flexible payment options will continue to support market growth, solidifying BNPL as a key component of Japan's digital payment ecosystem.

Increased Adoption of BNPL by Younger Consumers

The BNPL market in Japan is experiencing rapid adoption, particularly among Millennials and Gen Z, who are drawn to its flexible payment structures. Domestic players such as Paidy have emerged as leaders, offering zero-interest installment payments, which resonate well with this demographic. Partnerships with major platforms such as Amazon Japan have further accelerated the adoption of BNPL, integrating it into the everyday online shopping experience.

Japan's e-commerce market, has significantly increased adoption of BNPL services. Younger consumers who prefer alternatives to credit cards find BNPL appealing, as it aligns with Japan's cultural preference for debt-averse financial products. The convenience and transparency of zero-interest installment options make BNPL a popular choice for high-frequency, small-ticket purchases.

Over the next 2-4 years, BNPL adoption is expected to intensify as providers cater to the growing demand for flexible payment options among younger demographics. BNPL providers are likely to introduce innovative features such as loyalty rewards, cashback programs, and enhanced user experiences to maintain competitiveness. These advancements will solidify BNPL's position in Japan's payment ecosystem and encourage sustained growth in consumer engagement.

Integration of BNPL Services into E-commerce Platforms

BNPL services in Japan are increasingly being integrated into major e-commerce platforms to streamline the checkout process and enhance the shopping experience. Domestic providers such as GMO Payment Gateway are embedding installment options with smaller retailers, while global players such as Klarna partner with larger e-commerce sites. This trend highlights the growing synergy between BNPL solutions and Japan's rapidly expanding e-commerce market.

Retailers are adopting BNPL as a strategic tool to reduce cart abandonment rates and increase average transaction sizes. At the same time, consumers in Japan, accustomed to seamless digital payment solutions, are demanding more flexible and convenient options at checkout. The alignment of merchant objectives with consumer expectations is fueling the adoption of BNPL in the e-commerce sector.

Over the next 2-4 years, integrating BNPL services into e-commerce platforms is expected to become a standard feature across large and small retailers. The competitive environment will likely drive providers to innovate with better terms, enhanced consumer experiences, and loyalty programs to capture market share. This integration will solidify BNPL as an essential component of Japan's digital payment ecosystem while fostering growth in the e-commerce sector.

Entry of International BNPL Providers

Japan's BNPL market is seeing a growing presence of global providers such as Klarna and Afterpay, which are entering the market to capitalize on the increasing demand for installment payment solutions. These international entrants are expanding partnerships with retailers to enhance their foothold, creating a competitive environment pushing domestic providers to innovate and refine their services. This influx highlights Japan's appeal as a high-growth potential market for BNPL services.

Japan's relatively low credit card penetration compared to other developed economies presents a significant opportunity for BNPL providers. Many consumers, particularly younger ones, seek alternative payment solutions that align with their financial habits. Additionally, the country's stable regulatory framework for financial services has attracted global providers looking to establish a presence in the Asian market without facing significant compliance challenges.

Over the next 2-4 years, the entry of global BNPL providers is expected to intensify competition, resulting in more diverse and consumer-centric offerings. Domestic players may counteract this by leveraging local expertise, forming partnerships with regional retailers, and offering tailored solutions to maintain their market share. This heightened competition will benefit consumers through improved service quality and innovative payment options, further driving BNPL adoption in Japan.

Paidy Inc.: A leading domestic BNPL provider, Paidy offers zero-interest installment payments and has partnered with major e-commerce platforms, including Amazon Japan. In 2021, PayPal acquired Paidy, enhancing its presence in the Japanese BNPL market.

Anticipated Competitive Dynamics

The Japanese BNPL market is expected to witness increased competition as domestic and international players expand their services.

Innovations in payment solutions and strategic partnerships with retailers are likely key strategies for differentiation.

Regulatory Changes

While there is no direct regulation of BNPL services in Japan, businesses offering BNPL financing may be subject to the Installment Sales Act. This act requires companies providing installment payment services over periods exceeding two months to register as businesses involved in "Intermediation of Comprehensive Credit Purchases" or "Intermediation of Individual Credit Purchases."
