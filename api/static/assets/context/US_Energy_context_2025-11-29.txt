New Delhi: The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has asked power regulator, CERC, to review its draft regulation for renewable energy projects, saying the proposed norms may discourage investments in the sector, sources said.Earlier in September, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) issued a draft framework for clean energy producers (wind and solar) within the Deviation Settlement Mechanism.The framework, planned for implementation in April 2026, aims to lessen the gap between the permitted difference between committed supply and actual generation.A source privy to the development told PTI that MNRE has shot off a letter to the CERC for reviewing the issue and has sought suggestions from the power regulator.This assumes significance in view of India's ambitious target of having 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030.According to experts, India needs to add at least 50 GW of renewable energy capacity every year till 2030 to meet the target.They said that stricter norms may affect investment in the sector.According to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), India has a renewable energy capacity of 250 GW, including 50 GW of large hydro projects (above 25 MW), 130 GW of solar, 54 GW of wind energy and 10 GW of biomass power as of October 31, 2025.Presently, the government is grappling with the issue of non-signing of power sale agreements for about 40 GW of renewable energy projects.Power sale agreements are necessary to avail finance for these projects.Earlier, on many occasions, top officials in the ministry flagged the issue and sought an earlier resolution to achieve the ambitious target of 500 GW by 2030.

[TITLE]Indian Power Regulator Urged to Delay Stricter Clean Energy Rules:
[TEXT]
India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has urged the country’s federal power regulator to delay the implementation of new rules for clean energy generators to stick to their commitments to supply electricity to the grid.

The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) earlier this year proposed to introduce stricter rules for wind and solar power generators to ensure a minimum gap between their estimates of power delivered to the grid and the actual electricity they send.

The deviation has been an issue in India’s grids as the share of renewable energy, especially solar power, is rising in the electricity mix.

However, the uncertainty in predicting power generation from renewable energy sources threatens to lead to grid imbalances.

CERC in September proposed stricter rules on generators’ planning and forecasting to take effect from April 2026, and gradually reduce the permissible gap between forecasts and actual supply.

But India’s renewable energy ministry said a recent letter to the CERC, reviewed by Reuters, that errors in forecasts cannot be avoided as they are mostly the result of the unpredictable nature of solar and wind power generation. Therefore, introducing penalties for deviations would be “imprudent”, the ministry said in the letter.

It said the deviation charges could “have a catastrophic effect” on the currently booming clean energy industry.

India’s renewables developers have also warned that CERC’s proposed stricter rules would harm investment in renewable energy.

India added a record 22 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity in the first half of 2025, up by 57% from a year earlier, according to Rystad Energy data. Solar led the newly-added capacity with 18.4 GW installations, followed by 3.5 GW of wind, and 250 megawatts (MW) of bioenergy generated from plant and animal waste.

In July, India boasted achieving five years ahead of schedule its target to have 50% of its installed electricity capacity coming from non-fossil fuel sources.

India's renewable energy ministry has urged the power regulator to delay plans for stricter rules requiring wind and solar producers to stick more closely to their grid supply commitments, warning the move could deter investment.The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), in a draft published in September, proposed tighter regulations for wind and solar power producers under the Deviation Settlement Mechanism The proposed framework aims to gradually narrow the permissible gap between the amount of electricity producers commit to supply and what they actually generate and was supposed to come into effect from April 2026.However, the renewable energy ministry said in an October 21 letter to the CERC, reviewed by Reuters, that forecasting errors for renewable plants were largely driven by unpredictable weather conditions, making penalties for deviations "imprudent" and beyond developers' control.Earlier this month, Reuters reported that many industry stakeholders had written to the regulator, saying that the proposed plan would slow investment in clean energy.The ministry said higher deviation charges could deter small and medium-sized firms and "have a catastrophic effect" on the clean energy industry.It urged the regulator to consult stakeholders and suggested mandating clean energy storage in future projects instead of imposing strict penalties. It also recommended using improved weather data to set realistic forecasting limits.India sees wind and solar as key drivers in its energy transition, where it is aiming to double non-fossil-based power capacity to 500 gigawatts by 2030.The ministry and CERC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The CERC has not set a date for its final decision.

[TITLE]Oil Markets Lackluster Amid Russia Peace Deal, China’s Stockpiling:
[TEXT]
Sentiment in oil markets remains overwhelmingly negative, driven by perceived market oversupply and negative global demand indicators. Brent crude for January delivery was trading at $63.10 per barrel in Thursday’s intraday session, little changed from $62.97 a week ago while the corresponding WTI contract ticked up slightly to $58.70/bbl from $58.46. Meanwhile, the recent rally in oil product prices has cooled off, with ICE Gasoil-Brent crack dropping from a 35.84/bbl peak on 18 November to ~$26/bbl. This is partly due to the easing of panic over the delivery specification into the ICE gasoil futures contract.

Market focus remains firmly on the supply-side, with a view that any progress towards a ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine could lead to easing of heavy U.S. sanctions on Russian producers. The Trump administration has drafted a new 19-point peace plan that’s far more favorable to Ukraine compared to the original 28-point plan. Some of the critical amendments in the new plan include no handover of the Donbas region to Russia for free, no automatic veto on Ukraine joining NATO in the future, and provision of Article 5-style protection for Ukraine, meaning the U.S. would be bound to intervene if Russia invades in the future. A proposal for full amnesty for war crimes that was part of the first plan has also been removed.

China remains the leading buyer of Russian crude, with imports increasing by 275.6 kb/d over the past two months to ~2.15 mb/d. Overall, China’s crude imports have increased by 866 kb/d Y/Y to 11.44 mb/d as the country continues to stockpile crude. Rystad Energy estimates that China has stockpiled more than 1 million barrels of crude per day in some months, socking away nearly 160 million barrels in the first nine months of 2025. The buying spree has been triggered by strategic concerns like energy security and potential conflicts, as well as taking advantage of low oil prices. China is expected to continue stockpiling crude oil at least through 2026, supported by new laws and infrastructure development that allow for greater storage capacity, though some analysts suggest the pace might slow as storage limits are reached.

Potential U.S. intervention in Venezuela has also added to the bearish sentiment after the Trump administration designated Cartel de los Soles, which it alleges is led by President Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization. The US’ Operation Southern Spear has been targeting boats suspected of trafficking drugs in the region, with the hawks linking the moves to Venezuela’s 303 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the largest of any country.

Venezuelan oil production has been on a sharp decline since 2017, with a slew of sanctions prohibiting its access to financial markets. However, production has been slowly rising, from 360 kb/d in 2020 to around 1 mb/d currently, supported by black-market sales. However, commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have pointed out that it will take years before the South American country can hit peak production of around 2.5 mb/d that it achieved in the 2011-2015 period thanks to years of underinvestment in maturing oil fields as well as a lack of exploration drilling. Shortages of equipment, supplies and labour have also taken a toll on Venezuela’s energy sector. Further, the country is likely to have a hard time attracting fresh capital after the ConocoPhilips (NYSE:COP) debacle. The Venezuelan government under the late Hugo Chávez, and continued under Nicolás Maduro, expropriated ConocoPhillips' oil assets in 2007 during a wave of nationalizations of foreign oil investments. This led to ConocoPhillips receiving two major international arbitration awards totaling over $8 billion. Venezuela's attempts to annul the awards have failed, and ConocoPhillips is now pursuing legal avenues to enforce the rulings and collect the compensation from Venezuela's remaining overseas assets, such as those related to the Citgo refinery.

On the gas front, European natural gas prices have softened, with the front-month Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) contract for December delivery settling below EUR 30 per megawatt hour

(MWh) at EUR 29.5/MWh, its lowest settlement in 18 months. European natural gas inventories drew by 3.76 billion cubic metres (bcm) to 91.97bcm on 23 November, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. This marks the largest weekly fall in inventories since late February 2025. Recent cold weather has not supported prices, and there are now mild forecasts for the rest of December.

In contrast, U.S. gas prices have continued rallying, with gas futures hitting $4.6/MMBtu on falling inventories coupled with expectations of higher demand. Weather forecasts suggest temperatures will remain mostly below normal over the next two weeks, boosting demand. Further, U.S. LNG exports are rising, with flows averaging a record 18 bcfd in November, up from October’s 16.6 bcfd.

[TITLE]Oil Prices Sink as Ukraine Agrees to Peace Deal:
[TEXT]
Traders anticipate that a peace deal could lead to the easing of sanctions on Russia's energy exports, compounding existing concerns about an already oversupplied oil market.

The agreement, which still has minor details to be sorted out, was confirmed by a U.S. official and a statement from Ukraine's Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, Rustem Umerov.

Oil prices, with WTI dropping below $60 per barrel, extended losses following reports that Ukraine has mostly agreed to a peace deal with the U.S.

Oil prices extended losses early on Tuesday after news broke that Ukraine has mostly agreed to a peace deal, with “minor details” to discuss and settle.

As of 8:35a.m. ET on Tuesday, the U.S. benchmark crude futures, WTI Crude, dropped by 1.29% to further slip below $60 per barrel, at $58.08.

The international benchmark, Brent Crude, was trading down by 1.23% at $62.59.

Prices reacted to reports early on Tuesday that the U.S. plan for peace in Ukraine has received support from Ukrainians. The development added to persistent concerns about an already oversupplied oil market.

“The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal,” a U.S. official told CBS News today.

“There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal,” the U.S. official added.

Rustem Umerov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, posted on X early on Tuesday “We appreciate the productive and constructive meetings held in Geneva between the Ukrainian and U.S. delegations, as well as President Trump’s steadfast efforts to end the war.”

“Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,” Umerov added.

“We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine’s President to the US at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump.”

A peace deal that President Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could agree on as early this week is weighing on oil prices as traders expect that some sanctions on Russia’s energy industry and exports could be eased.

While Ukraine and the U.S. were negotiating in Geneva, U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Abu Dhabi for discussions with Russian officials, sources told CBS News.

As of early Tuesday, there was no reaction or comment from Russia on a peace deal.

[TITLE]Stewardess disease: 5 natural home remedies to deal with Perioral Dermatitis:
[TEXT]
Perioral dermatitis or Stewardess disease may sound like a complicated skin condition, but if you’ve ever noticed tiny bumps, redness, or a rash-like patch around your mouth, nose, or even eyes, you already know exactly how annoying it feels. It’s one of those stubborn skin issues that shows up uninvited and simply refuses to leave. And winter makes it worse - dry air, heavy creams, and constant touching of the face can easily trigger flare-ups.

While severe cases do need a dermatologist’s intervention, many mild to moderate episodes can actually be calmed at home with simple, natural remedies. These aren’t magical overnight fixes, but they help soothe inflammation, reduce redness, and prevent irritation from getting worse.

Here are five natural, gentle home remedies that your skin will genuinely thank you for.

[TITLE]Norwegian billionaire left to rue Mainstream Renewable deal as losses hit €1.2bn:
[TEXT]
Mainstream has racked up huge losses amid turbulence in its main market Chile and challenges in the green energy development sector

For Aker ASA, the Norwegian industrial powerhouse that began life as a boat builder, a deal to buy Eddie O’Connor’s Mainstream Renewable Power in January 2021 was a springboard to float one of its portfolio companies weeks later.

“Combining Mainstream’s global organisation and renewable assets with Aker’s 180-year track record of building and developing industrial companies is another step in line with our long-term strategy for value creation,” said Øyvind Eriksen, chief executive of Aker ASA.

Aker Horizons, the unit going through the initial public offering (IPO), was handed Mainstream, after the group agreed to buy a 75 per cent stake, in a deal that valued the Irish business at €900 million.

A 20 per cent spike in Aker ASA’s own shares within days of the Mainstream deal suggested investors in Oslo thought it had snapped up a bargain in the wind and solar energy developer, with projects spanning Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific.

But it was a moment many of the 600 wealthy Irish individuals who backed O’Connor when he set up the company in 2008 – with hopes he could replicate the stunning €1.8 billion achieved for Airtricity, his previous venture – had long doubted would ever arrive.

Theirs had been a hair-raising ride. The financial crisis battered initial plans, and for a decade the company survived by selling developments early – and on the cheap – to keep the lights on. Things finally turned with the transformational sale of a large wind farm project off the coast of Scotland for more than €600 million in 2018.

For O’Connor, who died early last year, the 2021 deal delivered a fifteenfold gain on the €30 million he had put into Mainstream. He and a handful of others rolled over a 25 per cent stake.

However, 60 cent of the small Irish investors opted to sell out entirely in 2021, rather than reinvest some money in the Aker Horizons deal – walking away with

[TITLE]The AI Gold Rush Is Redrawing America’s Energy Map:
[TEXT]
As industry concerns over an AI bubble mount, the scale of data center ambitions continues to grow. As of mid-October, the US data center pipeline reached 245 GW of planned capacity, driven by a handful of enormous, speculative projects. These projects, and the renewable deals hyperscalers are signing, skew heavily toward Texas. More than a quarter of pipeline capacity targets the state, whose pipeline nearly doubled from 35 GW in Q1 to 67 GW in Q3.

Data Center Alley gives way to Data Center Prairie

It is conventional wisdom that for data center developers, ‘access to power’ has become the mantra. That is, the importance of fiber proximity to end customers and other data centers has been superseded by the imperative to secure power from utilities. The giga-scale campuses that have been announced this year, sited in Pennsylvania, Wyoming, and particularly West and North Texas, signal yet another pivot in strategy. Developers have increasingly given up confidence that utilities can meet their power and timeline demand and instead seek to build their own generation based on local natural resources.

Most frequently, this resource is natural gas, with a particular focus on the Permian in Texas. Pacifico Energy’s 5-GW GW Ranch, poolside’s 2-GW Project Horizon, and FO Permian’s 5-GW campus in Midland County are examples. The gas network in the US is at capacity, and building new gas generation far from supply means paying for and - perhaps more importantly for developers - waiting for new pipeline capacity.

In some cases, it should be noted, campuses are being leveraged for their scale and solar or wind resource, such as Tract’s data center parks in Nevada and Utah, and Quantica’s Big Sky Digital Infrastructure campus in Montana. While more headlines have made

From Powerline:

But there is a broader point here that is more important. It is true that the cost of electricity has been rising steadily. The reason is the expenditure of many billions of dollars, perhaps into the trillions by now, that have been wasted on “green” energy, with the costs charged to ratepayers–i.e., all of us. The Democratic Party is responsible for those price increases. The Trump administration, which has turned its back on the Green New Deal, is doing everything possible to bring down the cost of electricity by promoting reliable, affordable power. For Democrats to blame the high cost of electricity on the Trump administration is a special kind of dishonesty. https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2025/11/how-desperate-are-the-dems.php
