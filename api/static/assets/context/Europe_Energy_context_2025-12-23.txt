[TITLE]Indigenous operators now power Nigeria’s energy future – IPPG:
[TEXT]
The Independent Petroleum Producers Group has marked its 10th anniversary, celebrating a decade of resilience, collaboration, and transformative impact in Nigeria’s oil and gas industry.

Speaking at the milestone event, the IPPG Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aradel Holdings, Mr Adegbite Falade, described the journey as “a decade defined by purpose, partnership, and impact,” according to a statement from IPPG on Sunday.

He said the anniversary was not merely a celebration of longevity, but a reaffirmation of the Group’s shared commitment to strengthening indigenous leadership and advancing Nigeria’s energy sector.

“This anniversary marks a decade in which indigenous operators have demonstrated their capacity to lead, deliver value, and shape the future of Nigeria’s energy sector,” Falade said.

Over the past 10 years, IPPG has evolved into a leading industry voice and a credible partner in sector development.

Through sustained advocacy and collaboration with government and regulators, indigenous operators now account for over 50 per cent of Nigeria’s crude oil and gas production, an achievement widely regarded as evidence of IPPG’s growing influence and effectiveness.

Falade commended the administration of President Bola Tinubu for reforms aimed at repositioning the sector for growth and investment. He also acknowledged the support of the Ministers of State for Petroleum Resources, the Special Adviser to the President on Energy, and the leadership of key institutions, including the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board, and the NNPC Limited.

Reflecting on the anniversary theme, “Building on a Decade of Impact,” Falade reaffirmed IPPG’s commitment to supporting government efforts to achieve energy security, particularly in the wake of International Oil Company divestments. He stressed that responsibility now rests squarely on indigenous operators to deliver sustainable production growth.

Representing President Tinubu at the event, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Oil), Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, described IPPG as a critical force in the industry and “one of the best things to have happened to Nigeria’s oil and gas sector.” He also cited the appointment of Mr Ademola Adeyemi-Bero as Nigeria’s OPEC Governor and Chairman of the OPEC Board of Governors for 2025 as global recognition of indigenous capacity.

The celebration featured a high-level fireside chat focused on indigenous leadership and the future of the industry, alongside Leadership Recognition Awards honouring distinguished members and sector leaders.

Looking ahead, IPPG reiterated its resolve to contribute meaningfully to Nigeria’s targets of producing three million barrels of oil per day and 12 billion standard cubic feet of gas by 2030. Over the next five years, the Group said it would prioritise infrastructure expansion, host community engagement in the Niger Delta, capacity building, strong governance, and responsible resource development.

As IPPG enters its second decade, the Group reaffirmed its commitment to act as a catalyst for Nigeria’s economic transformation and industrialisation by harnessing the nation’s vast oil and gas resources to create viable linkages between the industry and the broader economy.

[TITLE]EXCLUSIVE: Sens. Cruz, Kennedy Urge Trump Admin To Resist European Power Grab Threatening All American LNG Exports:
[TEXT]
Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and John Kennedy of Louisiana sent a letter Wednesday urging the Trump administration to block a stringent European climate regulation they warn threatens the American oil and gas export industry.

The letter, exclusively shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF), urges relevant cabinet members to block the European Union (EU) from imposing “new and arbitrary” methane targets on American energy companies that export to the EU. Amid ongoing trade adjustments, Cruz and Kennedy warn that the European Union Methane Regulation (EUMR) is a devastating non-tariff trade barrier which could “effectively end U.S. LNG [liquefied natural gas] exports to Europe.”

The senators addressed the letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.

“As you meet with your European counterparts to finalize the trade deal implementation action plan, we ask that this administration use all available legal, diplomatic, and economic tools to ensure that the EUMR is repealed in full,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter. “Regulating aspects of the EU’s own oil and gas production is within the authority delegated to it by member states — any attempt to extend such regulations to U.S. producers represents a clear and provocative attempt to supersede America’s sovereign right to regulate, through laws passed by the U.S. Congress, its own energy supply.” (RELATED: How Trump Can End Europe’s Reign Of Terror On American Oil And Gas)

Cruz Eu Methane Regulation Letter by audreystreb

The EUMR entered into force in August 2024 and is being phased in over several years. Methane monitoring and reporting requirements will tighten over time for energy companies operating in the EU. The regulation also applies to imports, meaning importers must eventually demonstrate that energy resources entering the EU comply with rules and regulations established by the European Commission.

As a result of the EUMR, U.S. companies exporting LNG to Europe may need to adopt additional methane-management practices to remain competitive in the EU market, a development Cruz and Kennedy argue could have detrimental consequences and advance the “European Green New Deal.”

“When fully phased in, the EUMR will set a new, yet-to-be-defined methane intensity standard for U.S. imports of oil and natural gas. This provision, if allowed to go into effect, would mean that regulators in Paris, Berlin, and Brussels would tell operators in Midland and Pittsburgh how, when, and where to produce energy,” the letter reads. “Already, the current reporting requirements — which are ostensibly the easiest to comply with — not only impugn America’s sovereignty but are nonsensical and create unnecessary burdens on American businesses.”

Though the Trump administration struck a major trade deal with the EU in July to benefit the American energy industry, the EU still imposes harsh climate regulations on U.S. energy companies that drive up costs for Americans, some energy policy experts and insiders previously explained to the DCNF.

Cruz and Kennedy went on to argue in the letter that the EUMR betrays the July trade deal, as the EU agreed to address “burdensome” non-tariff barriers to American exporters.

“The insinuation that European countries could directly regulate American producers is a gross overstep and breach of bilateral relations — especially in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where American LNG exporters helped fend off the worst-case scenarios by surging cargoes to the region,” Cruz and Kennedy wrote. “The delayed phase-in is a common tactic of European bureaucrats hoping to change corporate practices via regulatory fiat.”

The lawmakers also argue in the letter that European regulators may not consider the nuances of America’s vast natural gas resources, which produce “different emissions profile[s]” depending on origin, and that “EU demanded [sic] emissions data is infeasible.” Nonetheless, “failure to comply may result in significant financial penalties for American companies,” Cruz and Kennedy warned.

Strategic energy analyst Tammy Nemeth told the DCNF previously EU climate regulations like the EUMR increase costs on U.S. businesses — and thereby Americans — as companies hoping to compete in the European market have to navigate layers of red tape and adopt a net-zero transition plan. Though it is difficult to calculate a precise estimate, complying with EU climate regulations and directives add significant costs for American energy companies that will likely be passed on to consumers in the U.S. and abroad, according to Nemeth.

Nemeth also said that if U.S. oil and gas companies decide to defy the EU’s climate regulations, they risk hefty fines or being effectively barred from trading with the region, Nemeth said.

Some U.S. officials do staunchly oppose the EUMR and are working behind the scenes to convince the EU to exempt American oil and gas companies from penalties, according to multiple reports. Notably, during the previous week the EU offered simpler EUMR compliance rules for importers in response to American pressure, according to Reuters.

Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is among 10 Best Performing Electrical Infrastructure Stocks in 2025.

JPMorgan Maintains Overweight Rating On Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG)

On December 16, 2025, TheFly reported that JPMorgan reduced its price objective for Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) from $422 to $410 and maintained its Overweight rating. As per the firm, the modification is a result of revisions made to its financial model following the release of its third-quarter report.

Separately, on December 5, 2025, Reuters reported that Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had achieved a settlement on the requirements needed to finalize the $16.4 billion acquisition of Calpine Corporation. According to Reuters, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accepted the purchase, subject to Calpine selling four generating assets in the Mid-Atlantic region.

Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) would divest three natural gas-fired power plants under the terms of the agreement with the DOJ: the York 2 facility in Pennsylvania, the Jack Fusco Energy Center near Houston, Texas, and a minority interest in the Gregory Power facility near Corpus Christi. According to the DOJ, these divestitures ease concerns that the transaction may lessen competition and increase power costs in the PJM Interconnection and Electric Reliability of Texas markets.

The Calpine acquisition came to light in January and is one of the largest transactions in the US power industry. Reuters reported that the agreement coincides with increased electrification in buildings and transportation, as well as growing electricity demand associated with AI data centers.

Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is a supplier of energy products and services as well as a manufacturer of carbon-free energy.

While we acknowledge the potential of CEG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Defense and energy at the trilateral Greece–Cyprus–Israel meeting tomorrow in Jerusalem spark “nerves” in Ankara:
[TEXT]
Newsroom December 21 07:49

The “encirclement syndrome” is once again hovering over Turkey, triggered by the new strategic environment taking shape through the deepening cooperation between Greece, Cyprus and Israel—with the blessing of the United States—as well as by efforts to improve relations between Tel Aviv and Cairo, influencing Ankara’s overall strategic choices.

Turkey, by its own responsibility, has ruptured relations with both Israel and Egypt and, by maintaining its revisionist policy toward Greece and Cyprus, remains outside major realignments in the Eastern Mediterranean. At the same time, in Libya it sees the absolute influence it once exercised beginning to wane.

Meanwhile, significant developments following the Zappeion Agreements on the Vertical Corridor—with Greece assuming a pivotal role in supplying Eastern Europe and Ukraine with U.S. LNG—are challenging the role Turkey had and sought to expand as a key hub for transporting energy from Russia and the Caspian to Europe.

The new landscape taking shape does not, of course, neutralize Turkey’s ability to react. Ankara clearly means what it declares at all levels: that “plans to bypass Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean will fail” and that it will not allow the implementation of projects that ignore and marginalize it.

The Greece–Israel agreement for the procurement of PULS missiles marks the first step in building the “Achilles’ Shield.”

The Greece–Cyprus–Israel Trilateral, taking place tomorrow, Monday, in Jerusalem, demonstrates the strategic resilience of this cooperation. It is the first such meeting after October 7 and confirms the depth this relationship has acquired as a factor of stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The electricity interconnection

The Trilateral, which enjoys strong U.S. support—evidenced by the recent 3+1 meeting of energy ministers at the Zappeion—now expands into an extremely sensitive yet crucial chapter: cooperation in defense and armaments.

Closing

At a time of extremely delicate balances in the region, messages will also be sent to Ankara, which consistently adopts anti-Israeli rhetoric and seeks to gain a foothold in Gaza through an international stabilization force, while also aiming to legitimize its military presence in Syria.

Of particular interest are the discussions at the Trilateral regarding the continuation of energy cooperation among the three countries. At the very least, the GSI electricity interconnection has the support of all three countries and the EU. However, potential investors must now be convinced that there is no geopolitical risk stemming from Ankara’s threats, so that new capital can be secured for the project and a positive viability report produced—something announced by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides.

PULS and diplomacy

Athens is moving toward building the “Achilles’ Shield,” with a core of Israeli-made armaments—the first such procurement being the agreement for Elbit’s PULS missile systems. Joint training exercises between Greek and Israeli forces are frequent, including in areas of the Eastern Mediterranean, as are exercises between Israeli and Cypriot forces. As revealed by Israel’s Kan network, a meeting was held in Cyprus last week between the Chiefs of the Air Force of Greece and Israel and a representative of the National Guard, where cooperation and security threats in the Eastern Mediterranean were discussed.

Cyprus has already equipped itself with Israel’s Barak MX air-defense systems, strengthening its air defense for the first time since the failed 1998 attempt to acquire the S-300s, which ultimately ended up in Crete due to Turkish threats and U.S. pressure. The decision to lift the embargo on U.S. arms sales has also been renewed.

On the diplomatic front, Cyprus made a decisive move by completing and signing the agreement on the delimitation of maritime zones with Lebanon, a development that strongly irritated Ankara.

According to reports in the Turkish press, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met with the Lebanese prime minister on the sidelines of the Doha Forum and conveyed Ankara’s view that this move constitutes an unfair violation of regional balances and a disregard for countries that believe they are directly involved in determining maritime boundaries in the region, such as Turkey.

Over the past week, the Cypriot government and President Christodoulides—who will assume the EU presidency for the first half of 2026 in 11 days—hosted the president of the United Arab Emirates, upgrading the strategic cooperation between the two countries. In Paris, Christodoulides also signed an agreement with French President Emmanuel Macron to upgrade Cyprus’s strategic relationship with France, moves that strengthen Nicosia’s diplomatic arsenal.

Israel–Egypt agreement

In the same context, it is of great interest that Israel gave the green light for the signing of the largest natural gas export agreement to date, worth $34.7 billion, with Egypt. This agreement, pushed by Washington, is believed to have been one of the major obstacles prior to arranging a Netanyahu–Sisi meeting, with U.S. mediation and presence—an event expected to reshape the landscape and have decisive consequences for the implementation of the second phase of the Trump Plan for Gaza.

Blow to the Turkey–Libya memorandum

Further west, Turkey—having just renewed the presence of its military forces in Libya under agreements with Tripoli—viewed as a negative development the statement by House Speaker Aguila Saleh that the Turkey–Libya Memorandum is invalid, not binding on the country, and therefore not subject to parliamentary ratification. Eastern Libya’s opposition to the memorandum has been known since 2019, arguing that the al-Sarraj government lacked legitimacy to sign such an agreement. However, Saleh’s statement is particularly significant given Turkey’s recent intense efforts in Benghazi—toward both parliament and General Khalifa Haftar—to secure ratification of the memorandum.

While the seasoned Libyan politician does not entirely close the door to Turkey—proposing dialogue between Libya, Greece, Egypt and Turkey on maritime delimitation, even adopting Turkish positions on delimitation between opposing continental coasts and ignoring islands—the renewed repudiation of the memorandum nonetheless dealt a blow to Ankara’s regional policy.

Energy losses

In Turkey, alarm bells are also ringing over the push by the Americans for the Vertical Corridor, which turns Greece into an energy transport hub along a route that bypasses the Black Sea and weakens Turkey’s former monopolistic role in transporting natural gas from Russia and the Caspian.

Although Turkey has developed a strong network with five LNG terminals and has already signed agreements to purchase U.S. LNG, it sees that the U.S. has made a clear strategic choice in favor of the Vertical Corridor—not only for natural gas transport, but also for goods and for supplying NATO forces in Central and Eastern Europe—something of particular importance given developments in Ukraine.

All these developments have created a heavy atmosphere, as the Turkish press rushes to magnify any news, such as the recent “report”

[TITLE]Modi lays foundation stone of Rs 10,600-crore Namrup Fertiliser Project in Namrup:
[TEXT]
Modi lays foundation stone of Rs 10,600-crore Namrup Fertiliser Project in Namrup

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday laid the foundation stone of the ammonia-urea fertiliser project of Assam Valley Fertiliser and Chemical Company Limited at Namrup in Dibrugarh, calling it a historic step that places farmers’ welfare at the heart of national development and signals a new phase of industrial revival in Assam and the Northeast.

Addressing a large gathering, the Prime Minister said the project reflects the government’s commitment to “keeping the interests of farmers and annadatas at the centre of all policies.” He described the day as historic for Assam, noting that the long-cherished aspiration of Namrup and Dibrugarh for a modern fertiliser unit was finally being realised.

Modi began by paying tribute to Assam’s legacy of valour and sacrifice, recalling iconic figures such as Chaolung Sukapha, Lachit Borphukan, Kushal Konwar, Bhimbar Deuri and Sati Sadhani. Bowing to the “sacred soil of Ujani Assam”, he said the strength and pride of the region would once again play a decisive role in India’s growth story.

He also acknowledged the warmth of the crowd, particularly women who had gathered in large numbers. Referring to the “fragrance of Assam’s tea gardens”, the Prime Minister said it symbolised his deep emotional bond with the state.

Calling the foundation stone-laying a turning point, Modi said the new brownfield ammonia-urea plant, to be set up within the existing premises of Brahmaputra Valley Fertilizer Corporation Limited (BVFCL), would restore Namrup’s historic role as a backbone of fertiliser supply in the Northeast.

He recalled that Namrup was once a beacon of hope for farmers across the region, even when fertiliser shortages plagued other parts of the country. However, outdated technology and neglect by previous governments had led to the shutdown of several units, hurting farmers and local livelihoods. “Today, we are correcting those mistakes,” he said.

The project involves an investment of over Rs 10,600 crore and will produce more than 12 lakh metric tonnes of fertiliser annually. Modi said local production would ensure faster supply, lower logistics costs and greater price stability for farmers in Assam and neighbouring states.

He added that the project would generate thousands of employment and self-employment opportunities, including permanent jobs and indirect work in repair, supply chains and ancillary services, offering fresh hope to local youth.

Highlighting the broader national context, the Prime Minister said India is steadily moving towards self-reliance in urea production. He noted that urea output has risen from 225 lakh metric tonnes in 2014 to nearly 306 lakh metric tonnes today, with new plants commissioned in Gorakhpur, Sindri, Barauni and Ramagundam.

Despite high global prices, Modi said farmers are shielded from cost burdens through subsidies. “A bag of urea costs farmers around Rs 300, while the government pays nearly Rs 3,000 for the same bag internationally,” he said, urging farmers to use fertilisers judiciously to protect soil health.

The Prime Minister reiterated that the government stands with farmers from seed to market, citing initiatives such as PM-Kisan, under which nearly Rs 4 lakh crore has been directly transferred to farmers’ accounts, crop insurance schemes, improved procurement systems and expanded access to Kisan Credit Cards, including for livestock and fish farmers.

He also highlighted the promotion of natural farming, formation of 10,000 Farmer-Producer Organisations, and special focus on the Northeast through initiatives like the oil palm mission, aimed at raising farm incomes and reducing import dependence.

Modi said Assam is witnessing rapid progress across sectors—from modern infrastructure and airports to industry, agriculture, tourism and technology. He underlined that the new Namrup plant will not only serve Assam but also supply fertiliser to Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and eastern Uttar Pradesh, strengthening the Northeast’s contribution to national food security.

“In a developed India, Eastern India and the Northeast will be the growth engines,” the Prime Minister said, describing the Namrup project as a symbol of that transformation and of the Northeast’s emergence as “Asthalakshmi in the true sense.”

Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and other senior leaders were present at the ceremony.

The Namrup fertiliser project is expected to act as a cornerstone of industrial revival, farmer welfare and regional economic growth, reaffirming Assam’s central place in India’s journey towards a self-reliant and developed future.

[TITLE]Guyana Is Using Its Oil Revenues to Spark a Renewable Energy Boom:
[TEXT]
Since the discovery of vast oil reserves in Guyana around a decade ago, the South American country’s oil industry has grown significantly following investment from several international oil majors and the beginning of offshore production. As Guyana begins to see the revenue from its black gold, the government is reinvesting some of the money in renewables to diversify the energy mix and strengthen the country’s energy security. Guyana’s government aims to achieve 80 percent renewable energy in the electricity grid by 2040.

In February, the United Nations (UN) in Guyana announced the launch of the Just Energy Transition (JET) Seed Funding Initiative with financing from the Joint Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Fund. The initiative will provide funding to help Guyana undergo a green transition by implementing its Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) 2030. Investments will be made in expanding Guyana’s renewable energy capacity and promoting sustainable mobility. The UN will also provide technical and policy support.

The initiative will support the development of three solar-powered EV charging stations in strategic locations and the delivery of a technical training programme to develop a Guyanese workforce in the renewable energy sector. The UN aims to use the initiative to empower youth, women, and marginalized groups and ensure equitable access to opportunities.

The UN Development Programme’s Officer-in-Charge, Nadira Balram, stated, “The anticipated impact of this initiative is far-reaching. This initiative will create jobs and new economic opportunities. By equipping a new generation of technicians with specialised skills, we are fostering a workforce that is prepared for the transition to a green economy.”

At the national level, the President of Guyana, Mohamed Irfaan Ali, said in a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine that Guyana is using its newfound oil revenues to drive a green transition.

“Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatonnes of carbon,” said Irfaan Ali. “We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, and wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.”

One of the renewable energy industries that Guyana is looking to advance is solar power. Several companies have shown interest in the country’s solar potential, with multiple new solar projects expected to launch in the coming years. The government has gradually been expanding its solar energy capacity, with around 4.8 MW of solar power having been installed under the Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Home Energy Systems. The off-grid solar power project launched in 2023 and aims to expand clean electricity access in the hinterland and riverine communities of the country that do not have access to the national grid. The government aims to supply and deliver 30,000 solar PV home energy units as part of the scheme.

In August, the Guyana Energy Agency commissioned a 0.6 MW grid-forming solar farm on the island of Leguan, at a cost of $1.4 million. The project will include a 1.2 MWh battery energy storage system. This follows the installation of a similar solar power system on Wakenaam Island in 2023 and is aimed at providing rural populations with greater energy security.

In November, the Indian green energy firm Oriana Power Limited announced it had been approved by the Guyana Energy Agency to develop a solar energy project in Guyana consisting of the design, supply, installation, and commissioning of a 3 MW grid-tied solar PV system at the Cheddi Jagan International Airport. The contract is valued at almost $2.5 million, and it is expected to be completed within three years.

In July, the government commissioned a 1.5 MW hydropower project, the Kumu plant, in Lethem. This follows the development of the 0.7 MW Moco Moco Hydropower Plant. While Guyana’s hydropower projects are relatively small-scale, the gradual development of the industry demonstrates the government’s commitment to diversifying Guyana’s energy mix.

Prime Minister Mark Phillips stated, “From 2020 to now, we’ve delivered 14.5 megawatts of renewable energy through solar and hydro projects. Today’s commissioning of the 1.5 MW Kumu Hydropower Station builds on that foundation, expanding our renewable energy portfolio while improving quality of life for residents in Region Nine.”

Guyana has transformed from a little-known South American country that was highly dependent on fossil fuel imports less than a decade ago to a growing global oil power. The exploitation of its oil resources is allowing the government to increase spending on green energy to diversify the country’s energy mix from the outset, a feat that has not been possible in most oil-rich countries. Meanwhile, additional technical and funding support from the UN is expected to help Guyana diversify its energy mix and enhance its energy security in the coming years.

[TITLE]The Battery Boom Is Reshaping Power Markets:
[TEXT]
The uptake of utility-scale battery storage has grown significantly in recent years as more countries switch to renewables. Battery storage ensures that grids powered by less reliable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, can continue to deliver a stable supply of clean energy through the day and night.

The battery storage boom of recent years has been driven largely by the falling costs of lithium-ion batteries, which have made it possible for utilities worldwide to invest in more batteries. The cost of batteries has fallen by around 90 percent in the last 15 years, as commercial production has expanded. China is currently the world’s biggest battery producer, but several other regions are developing their manufacturing capacity, such as Europe, India, and the United States.

Energy storage additions worldwide are expected to break another record this year, driven by China and the U.S. Global annual energy storage deployment (excluding pumped hydropower plants) is expected to reach 92 GW in 2025, which is 23 percent higher than in 2024. China will contribute more than 50 percent of this capacity increase, while the U.S. will account for around 14 percent. The U.S. contribution of energy storage is impressive, given the difficult year faced by the wind and solar energy industries under the Trump administration. BloombergNEF expects cumulative energy storage capacity in 2035 to reach 2 terawatts, at eight times higher than the level in 2025.

In the United States, battery expansion has been met with mixed success. It is still difficult to convince utilities in certain areas of the country to invest in battery storage. Meanwhile, policymakers are often lukewarm

[TITLE]India hits climate milestone five years early with 50% non-fossil power capacity:

While major powers slowed their push on renewable energy, India — often portrayed as a champion of fossil fuels — did the unthinkable. In 2025, it achieved a major climate milestone, with 50 per cent of its installed power generation capacity now coming from non-fossil fuel sources, five years ahead of its 2030 target under the Paris Agreement signed in December 2015.

The world's fastest-growing economy now has a total installed generation capacity of

[TITLE]These 15 Coal Plants Would Have Retired. Then Came AI and Trump.:
[TEXT]
By Joe Fassler, a writer and journalist whose work on climate and technology appears in outlets like The Guardian, The New York Times, and Wired. His novel, The Sky Was Ours, was published by Penguin Books. Cross posted from DeSmog.

Since the second Trump administration took power in January, at least 15 coal plants have had planned retirements pushed back or delayed indefinitely, a DeSmog analysis found.

That’s mostly due to an expected rise in electricity demand, a surge largely driven by the rise of high-powered data centers needed to train and run artificial intelligence (AI) models. But some of the plants have been ordered to stay open by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), despite significant environmental and financial costs. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former fracking executive, has frequently cited “winning the AI race” as a rationale for re-investing in coal.

The fossil fuel facilities are located in regions across the country, from Maryland to Michigan and Georgia to Wyoming. Together, their two dozen coal-fired generators emitted more than 68 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2024. That’s more than the total emissions of Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. combined.

Nearly 75 percent of the coal plants were on track to shutter in the next two years.

The delays buck the overall trend in the U.S., where coal’s importance as an energy source has diminished rapidly over the past two decades. Coal’s critics say this broad-based phaseout is an urgent matter of public and environmental health. Often called the “dirtiest fossil fuel,” coal creates more climate emissions per gigawatt-hour of electricity than any other power source. And the human impacts of its pollution have been profound: A 2023 study in Science attributed 460,000 extra U.S. deaths between 1999 and 2020 to sulfur dioxide particulate pollution belched out by coal plants.

Cara Fogler, managing senior analyst for the Sierra Club, called the recent spate of delayed closures “unacceptable.”

“We know these coal plants are dirty, they’re uneconomic, they’re costing customers so much money, and they’re polluting the air,” said Fogler, who co-authored a report showing many utilities have backtracked on climate commitments, including coal phaseouts, often citing data centers as a cause. “They need to be planned for retirement, and it’s really concerning to see utilities becoming so much more hesitant to take those steps.”

DeSmog identified the 15 plants by examining changes to the planned retirement dates listed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a DOE agency that compiles data on energy providers, as well as public statements from utilities and the Trump administration. Some of the voluntary delays appear to directly contradict previous net-zero pledges made by several companies.

Neither the Department of Energy nor American Power, a trade association representing the U.S. coal fleet, responded to requests for comment.

What Led to Coal’s Decline?

Not long ago, coal really did keep the lights on. In 2005, it provided roughly half of America’s electricity, making it by far the dominant power source nationwide. But in the past two decades, coal’s market share has rapidly waned. No new coal plants have come online since 2013. These days, its footprint has dwindled, with just 16 percent of the overall energy mix.

In March 2017, President Trump appeared to blame environmental regulations for coal’s poor fortunes — a trend he promised to reverse.

Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is among 10 Best Performing Electrical Infrastructure Stocks in 2025.

Duke Energy Corporation (DUK) Proposes New Investments In North Carolina

According to TheFly, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) submitted requests for updated rates at its two utilities in the state, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, to the North Carolina Utilities Commission on November 21.

In the submission, Duke Energy Carolinas requests a $1 billion yearly revenue boost, which would include $727 million in 2027 and $275 million in 2028. This would be a rise of 15% above current revenues. The $729 million request for Duke Energy Progress includes $200 million in 2028 and $528 million in 2027, a 15.1% growth above current revenues. Subject to regulatory approval, the demands depend on a 53% equity capital structure and a proposed 10.95% return on equity.

The expected advantages associated with nuclear production tax credits are also stated in the filing. Through 2032, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK)’s nuclear plants are anticipated to produce tax credits worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Customers of Duke Energy Carolinas receive $150 million in nuclear production tax credits in 2025–2026 at current rates. The fresh proposal would extend nuclear production tax credits to Duke Energy Progress customers while also introducing solar and hydro tax incentives for both utilities. Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) also stated that a proposed merger of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress will save customers over $1 billion in future expenses.

Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is one of the largest utilities in the United States, having regulated utilities in the Carolinas, Indiana, Florida, Ohio, and Kentucky.

While we acknowledge the potential of DUK as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]AI Boom Brings Flood of Debt to Ultrasafe Market: Credit Weekly:
[TEXT]
The great artificial intelligence boom that’s fueling US economic growth now depends heavily on credit markets to finance the investments, and utilities are among the key borrowers.

In the process, they could potentially turn one of the safest parts of the corporate-bond market into a slightly riskier one. Companies will borrow more, boosting the supply of the bonds and potentially weighing on valuations. At the same time, industry profits could face pressure as regulators try to keep a lid on rate increases.

Bond sales by US utilities grew 19% this year to a record $158 billion, funding rampant growth in power demand driven by the artificial-intelligence boom. A lot more is coming: electric companies are expected to spend more than $1.1 trillion on power plants, substations, and other grid infrastructure over the next five years, according to industry group Edison Electric Institute, up

[TITLE]3 Nuclear Power Stocks Set to Flourish in 2026 on AI Data Center Boom:
[TEXT]
Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered data centers are now booming. The AI infrastructure space remains rock solid, supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. Research firm McKinsey & Co. has estimated that global AI-powered data center infrastructure capex will reach around $7 trillion by 2030.

The energy-hungry AI space has made nuclear energy one of the hottest industries on Wall Street over the past year. Nuclear energy is increasingly recognized as a key solution to meeting rising global electricity demand and shifting toward cleaner energy sources. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reported that the U.S. data center electricity demand is expected to climb to 35 gigawatts (GW) in 2030 from 19 GW in 2023.

To strengthen the nation’s nuclear sector, President Donald Trump has issued four executive orders aimed at modernizing regulatory frameworks, expediting reactor testing and approvals, leveraging nuclear technology for national security, and expanding the domestic nuclear industrial base. These measures target an increase in U.S. nuclear capacity from
