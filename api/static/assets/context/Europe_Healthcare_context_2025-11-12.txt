Financials

As of September 30, 2025, Tonix had $190.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $98.8 million as of December 31, 2024. Net cash used in operations was approximately $60.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $46.3 million for the same period in 2024.

Based on its current operating plan, the Company believes its cash on hand as of September 30, 2025, together with $34.7 million in net proceeds received from equity offerings during the fourth quarter 2025, will fund planned operating and capital expenditures into the first quarter of 2027.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Net product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was approximately $3.3 million, compared to $2.8 million for the same period in 2024; revenue reflected combined net sales of Zembrace® SymTouch® (sumatriptan injection) and Tosymra® (sumatriptan nasal spray). Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was approximately $1.4 million, compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2024.

Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 were $9.3 million, compared to $9.1 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was predominately due to increased manufacturing expenses of $2.3 million, offset by a reduction in clinical expenses of $2.1 million, as a result of pipeline prioritization period over period.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 were $25.7 million, compared to $7.7 million in 2024. The increase is predominately due to spending on sales and marketing relating to Tonmya.

Net loss available to common stockholders was $32.0 million, or $3.59 per share (basic and diluted), for the third quarter 2025, compared to a net loss of $14.2 million, or $22.68 per share, for the same period in 2024.

$280.7 million cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities supports runway into late 2027

SAN DIEGO, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zentalis® Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZNTL), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a potentially first-in-class WEE1 inhibitor for patients with ovarian cancer and other tumor types, announced financial results for the third quarter 2025 and highlighted recent operational progress.

"We are pleased with our continued disciplined execution of the DENALI clinical trial this quarter, supporting late-stage development of azenosertib as a potential treatment for Cyclin E1-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and positioning us for an anticipated topline data readout by year end 2026. Our engagement with trial investigators and presence at medical conferences is very encouraging and continues to support our development strategy," said Julie Eastland, Chief Executive Officer of Zentalis. "With $280.7 million in cash providing runway into late 2027, we maintain a robust financial foundation to deliver on our azenosertib objectives."

Business Updates

Phase 2 DENALI clinical trial remains on track and has the potential to support an accelerated approval, subject to FDA feedback. Enrollment is ongoing in DENALI Part 2a of the Phase 2 DENALI clinical trial (NCT05128825) of azenosertib in patients with Cyclin E1-positive PROC. DENALI Part 2a is designed to confirm the primary dose-of-interest with a target enrollment of up to approximately 30 patients at each of two dose levels: 400mg QD 5:2 (intermittent daily dosing with a five days on, two days off dosing schedule) and 300mg QD 5:2. DENALI Part 2b is designed to enroll approximately 70 patients at a single dose, the selection of which will be informed by the Part 2a results. The Company expects to disclose topline data from DENALI Part 2 (Part 2a and Part 2b) by year end 2026. We believe that DENALI Part 2, if successful, has the potential to support an accelerated approval, subject to FDA review.

Poster Presentations at AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics support Cyclin E1 biomarker-driven strategy for azenosertib.

Presentations feature data from first-in-human Phase 1 study, including Cyclin E1 biomarker findings, supporting late-stage development of azenosertib.

TETON Phase 2 trial in uterine serous carcinoma (USC) completed enrollment. Consistent with the Company's previously announced strategic prioritization of azenosertib for the treatment of patients with Cyclin E1-positive PROC, further development in USC will be limited to partnering or the Company's ability to allocate capital to this indication. The Company will continue to support an ongoing investigator-initiated study to explore potential biomarker enrichment strategy in USC. Results from the TETON trial are planned for publication in the first half of 2026.

[TITLE]ProKidney Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results and Provides Regulatory and Clinical Updates:
[TEXT]
Full results from the Phase 2 REGEN-007 study of rilparencel were recently presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2025

More than half of the patients required for the Phase 3 REGEN-006 (PROACT 1) accelerated approval analysis using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope have been enrolled; topline results anticipated in Q2 2027

Ended the third quarter with $272 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, supporting operations into mid-2027

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProKidney Corp. (Nasdaq: PROK) (“ProKidney” or the “Company"), a leading late clinical-stage cell therapy company focused on chronic kidney disease (CKD), today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025, and provided regulatory and clinical updates.

“The Phase 2 REGEN-007 full results recently presented at ASN Kidney Week further strengthen the body of evidence supporting our ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study and underscore the potential of rilparencel to become a novel treatment option for patients with advanced CKD and diabetes,” said Bruce Culleton, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of ProKidney. “In Group 1, which mirrored the dosing regimen being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study, treatment with rilparencel led to statistically significant and clinically meaningful stabilization of kidney function. Notably, 63% of Group 1 patients met the key PROACT 1 inclusion criteria, and similar efficacy was observed in this subgroup compared to the overall Group 1 results. We remain focused on the continued execution of PROACT 1 to bring a potential new treatment option to patients with advanced CKD and diabetes at high risk of kidney failure, an area of significant unmet need.”

Phase 2 REGEN-007 Full Results Recently Presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025

On November 6, 2025, ProKidney presented full results from the Phase 2 REGEN-007 study evaluating rilparencel in patients with advanced CKD and diabetes. The data, featured in a late-breaking clinical trials presentation, further demonstrate the potential of rilparencel to preserve kidney function in patients with advanced CKD and diabetes who are at high risk of kidney failure. Highlights include:

In Group 1 (n=24), bilateral kidney injection with rilparencel resulted in a 4.6 mL/min/1.73m 2 improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 78% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p<0.001)

improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 78% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p<0.001) Among Group 1 patients, 15 of 24 (63%) met key Phase 3 PROACT 1 inclusion criteria; in this subgroup, bilateral kidney injection resulted in a 5.5 mL/min/1.73m 2 improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 85% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p=0.005)

improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 85% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p=0.005) Post-hoc analysis of patient subgroups on standard-of-care (SOC) medications, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), suggest rilparencel had a treatment effect incremental to that observed with SOC

Rilparencel was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile

Phase 3 PROACT 1 Registrational Program Update: Alignment Achieved with FDA on Accelerated Path

In a July 2025 Type B meeting, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that eGFR slope in patients from the ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study can serve as the surrogate endpoint and primary basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission of rilparencel under the accelerated approval pathway. The FDA also confirmed that PROACT 1 may be used to support both accelerated and confirmatory approval of rilparencel. ProKidney continues to maintain its ongoing dialogue with the FDA under rilparencel’s regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation. More than half of the approximately 360 patients required for the accelerated approval analysis using eGFR slope had been enrolled as of August 2025. Topline data readout to support an application for accelerated approval is anticipated in Q2 2027. Rilparencel is the only cell therapy in a Phase 3 clinical study for the treatment of CKD and type 2 diabetes.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights

Liquidity: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2025, totaled $271.7 million, compared to $358.3 million on December 31, 2024. ProKidney expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held on September 30, 2025, will enable the Company to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2027.

R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $26.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $31.3 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of $4.4 million was driven primarily by decreases in costs for clinical operations of approximately $4.2 million driven by the wind down of activities related to REGEN-016 and our other clinical trials that have been completed or terminated. Additionally, the Company has seen decreases in spending on manufacturing process development and professional fees of approximately $1.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. These decreases have been partially offset by increases in equity and cash compensation costs of approximately $1.4 million as the Company continues to hire additional personnel to support our operations and increases in materials costs of $1.2 million to support the Phase 3 clinical program.

G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $17.7 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of $5.8 million has been primarily driven by the decrease in the amount of non-cash impairment charges of $5.0 million related to the Greensboro facility and decreases in cash and equity compensation of approximately $1.9 million. These increases have been partially offset by increases in professional fees of approximately $0.8 million.

Net Loss Before Noncontrolling Interest: Net loss before noncontrolling interest was $35.8 million and $41.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Shares outstanding: Class A and Class B common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2025 totaled 295,266,876.
