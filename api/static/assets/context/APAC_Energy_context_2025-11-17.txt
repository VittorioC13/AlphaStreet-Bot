Asian markets trod water Thursday as euphoria over the end of a record US government shutdown petered, with focus back on Federal Reserve interest rates and tech bubble worries.

Lawmakers in Washington voted Wednesday night to send Donald Trump legislation to end the 43-day stoppage that shuttered key services and suspended the release of data crucial to gauging the state of the world’s top economy.

However, even with the US president expected to sign the bill, the mood on trading floors was less upbeat than earlier in the week, when a deal was announced.

Investors will now be able to get a long-awaited glimpse of the reports that have been held up by the closure, particularly the Fed as it decides whether or not to meet expectations and cut rates next month.

Even then, the White House said figures on jobs and consumer prices for October were not likely to be released as statistics agencies were unable to collect the necessary data.

“Reopening also doesn’t mean an instant snap-back to normal for the real economy. When you starve a system of staffing and pay for six weeks, the backlog doesn’t vanish just because a bill passed at 8 pm,” wrote Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.

“The shutdown ends with a vote and a signature; the aftershocks show up in queues, call centres and cash-flow stress far away from the Capitol dome.”

Meanwhile, concerns continue to mount that this year’s AI-led market rally may have pushed valuations too high and led to a bubble in the tech sector that could burst at any time.

Some have warned that the hundreds of billions invested in artificial intelligence has been overdone and the return could take time to come through.

Observers suggested that the recent tepid performance in several high-flying firms may be a sign of that, with the Nasdaq dropping for two days.

The S&P 500 has also struggled of late, though the Dow on Wednesday ended at a record amid speculation that traders are shifting from tech into industrials.

The mixed showing on Wall Street was reflected in Asia, where Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Manila and Wellington fell.

Tokyo edged up while Jakarta and Shanghai were flat.

Oil prices extended losses after plunging around four percent Wednesday after OPEC’s monthly crude market report forecast an oversupply in the third quarter.

That came just a month after it had predicted a deficit in the period.

The commodity has come under pressure of late amid easing tensions in the Middle East and increasing output by OPEC and other key producers.

And the International Energy Agency earlier this year estimated a record surplus in 2026.

Attention is also on Tokyo after Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said Wednesday the government was keeping an eye on currency markets as the yen continued to weaken.

She told parliament that “the government is watching for any excessive and disorderly moves with a high sense of urgency”.

Since her remarks, the unit has weakened further to around 155 per dollar, prompting speculation that authorities could step in to provide support.

The currency has come under pressure following dovish comments from Japan’s central bank that tempered best on another interest rate hike and as the US moved towards reopening its government.

TOKYO -- World shares have advanced, with markets in Europe and most of Asia higher after the Dow industrials hit a fresh record as technology shares appeared to recover from last week’s swoon over the future of artificial intelligence.

France's CAC 40 climbed 0.5% to 8,193.98, while the German DAX surged nearly 1.1% to 24,357.28. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.1% to 9,906.82.

The future for the S & P 500 rose 0.4% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2%.

In Asian trading, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.4% to finish at 51,063.31.

SoftBank Group's shares fell 3.5%, plunging as much as 9% earlier in the day after it said Tuesday that it sold its entire stake in the AI chip company Nvidia for $5.83 billion last month, raising funds for other investments.

A big question has been whether investors will push the craze for AI stocks further. Their sensational growth has been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and still-high inflation. But their prices have shot so high that critics say they’re reminiscent of the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S & P 500 down by nearly half.

Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.9% to 26,922.73, while the Shanghai Composite edged down less than 0.1% to 4,000.14.

Australia’s S & P/ASX 200 shed 0.2% to 8,799.50. South Korea’s Kospi added 1.1% to 4,150.39.

On Tuesday, the S & P 500 added 0.2%, bouncing a bit following a vigorous rebound Monday that followed its first losing week in four.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1.2%, to a record close of 47,927.96, surpassing its prior all-time high set two weeks ago.

The Nasdaq composite lagged the market as Nvidia slipped 3% due to continued concerns that stocks caught up in the artificial-intelligence frenzy may have become too expensive.

In the U.S. bond market, trading was closed for the Veterans Day holiday.

What’s making the Federal Reserve's job potentially more difficult is that the U.S. government’s shutdown has delayed important updates on jobs and other areas of the economy. The Senate has made moves to end what’s become the longest-ever shutdown, but it’s not assured.

In other dealings early Wednesday, benchmark U.S. crude declined 34 cents to $60.70 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 31 cents to $64.85 a barrel.

The U.S. dollar edged up to 154.76 Japanese yen from 154.16 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1579 from $1.1583.

Asian shares mostly gained in cautious trading Wednesday after most U.S. stocks rose, settling back to where they were before last week’s swoon over the future of artificial intelligence.

U.S. futures edged higher while oil prices declined. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.4% to finish at 51,063.31.

SoftBank Group's shares fell 3.5%, plunging as much as 9% earlier in the day, after it said Tuesday that it sold its entire stake in the AI chip company Nvidia for $5.83 billion last month, raising funds for other investments.

A big question has been whether investors will push the frenzy around AI stocks further. Their sensational growth has been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and still-high inflation. But their prices have shot so high that critics say they’re reminiscent of the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S&P 500 down by nearly half.

Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.8% to 26,913.90, while the Shanghai Composite edged up less than 0.1% to 4,006.17.

Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.2% to 8,799.50. South Korea’s Kospi added 1.1% to 4,151.36.

On Tuesday, the S&P 500 added 0.2% to 6,846.61. It’s been bouncing around lately, coming off Monday’s vigorous rebound following its first losing week in four.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1.2%, to a record close of 47,927.96, surpassing its prior all-time high set two weeks ago. The Nasdaq composite lagged the market as Nvidia slipped 3% due to continued concerns that stocks caught up in the artificial-intelligence frenzy may have become too expensive. The Nasdaq dipped 0.3% to 23,468.30.

Helping to lead the market was Paramount Skydance, whose shares jumped 9.8% even though the entertainment giant reported revenue and profit for the latest quarter that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. It was the company’s first earnings report since Skydance closed its acquisition of Paramount in early August.

Close behind was FedEx, which climbed 5.4% after it increased its forecast for profit in the current quarter. Instead of expecting growth from just the summer, the delivery company now also expects profit to rise in this year’s holiday-shopping season from last year's.

In the U.S. bond market, trading was closed for the Veterans Day holiday.

What’s making the Federal Reserve's job potentially more difficult is that the U.S. government’s shutdown has delayed important updates on jobs and other areas of the economy. The Senate has made moves to end what’s become the longest-ever shutdown, but it’s not assured.

In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude declined 21 cents to $60.83 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 21 cents to $64.95 a barrel.

In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 154.67 Japanese yen from 154.04 yen. The euro cost $1.1583, down from $1.1587.

[TITLE]Shares rise on optimism over potential end to US government shutdown:
[TEXT]
By Rae Wee

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Global shares rose on Monday on optimism that an end to the historic U.S. government shutdown could be in sight, while the dollar was nursing losses from last week.

The U.S. Senate on Sunday moved towards a vote on reopening the federal government,​ a day after Senate Majority Leader John Thune said bipartisan talks in the chamber to end the shutdown have taken a positive turn.

The developments helped push Nasdaq futures ‌up 1.1% while S&P 500 futures rose 0.65%.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.9% and Japan's Nikkei advanced 1%.

"Markets may see short-term ‌relief, but headline-driven volatility is likely to continue until there's a clear resolution," said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo.

If the Senate eventually passes the bill, the package must still be approved by the House of Representatives and sent to President Donald Trump for his signature, a process that could take several days.

The shutdown has taken a growing toll on the U.S. economy, with federal workers from airports to law enforcement and the military going unpaid while the central bank flies blind with limited government reporting of economic data.

White House economic adviser Kevin ⁠Hassett said in an interview that the nation's fourth-quarter ‌GDP could be negative if the shutdown drags on. Data on Friday also showed that U.S. consumer sentiment slumped to near a 3-1/2-year low in early November as households worried about the economic fallout.

"While a deal would be market-friendly by restoring confidence and liquidity,‍ it doesn't undo the growth dent from what's now the longest shutdown in U.S. history," said Chanana.

Still, overall risk sentiment remained upbeat on Monday.

EUROSTOXX 50 futures and DAX futures were up nearly 1.4% each, while FTSE futures gained 0.8%.

In China, the CSI300 blue-chip index was down 0.14%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.​6%.

Data on Sunday showed China's producer price deflation eased in October and consumer prices returned to positive territory, as the government steps up efforts to curb over-capacity ‌and cut-throat competition among firms.

U.S. Treasury yields edged higher, with the benchmark 10-year yield up 3.5 basis points to 4.1278%. The two-year yield rose roughly 3 bps to 3.5886%. [US/]

In currencies, the dollar recovered some of its losses from last week, as investors assessed the outlook for the U.S. economy against a more hawkish Federal Reserve. [FRX/]

While recent data stoked worries about a weakening U.S. labour market, a slew of Fed officials last week reiterated their preference for going slow on further rate cuts.
