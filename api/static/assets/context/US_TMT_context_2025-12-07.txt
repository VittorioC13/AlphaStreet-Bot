[TITLE]SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son wants to build ‘Trump Industrial Parks’ across the nation, report claims — project proposes using federal land to build manufacturing sites for data center infrastructure:
[TEXT]
SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has been in talks with the Trump administration to build Project Crystal Land, Son’s grand vision for a U.S. competitor to Shenzhen, China’s electronics manufacturing hub, with a population of over 17.5 million people, often dubbed as China’s Silicon Valley or the Silicon Valley of Hardware. According to the Wall Street Journal, the plan was originally for a single $1 trillion high-tech industrial city that encompasses the size of Los Angeles and will be built to the north of Phoenix, Arizona. This was supposed to house chip fabs, packaging plants, and processing facilities — basically, an entire semiconductor supply chain — while also providing housing to all the people working within it.

However, the administration’s plan has reportedly since changed from one mega site into several “Trump Industrial Parks” that will be built on federal land across the nation. Son then revised his proposal and said that the funding for the first phase of the plan would be part of Japan’s investment commitment to the U.S. as part of the trade deal the country struck with President Donald Trump in July. This updated plan tracks closely with Washington’s list of potential investments that Japan can fund, including nuclear power plants, energy infrastructure, and AI projects.

Despite Son’s enthusiasm, there is still no clear answer from the U.S. government on whether it would proceed with SoftBank’s proposals. The WSJ says that the required investment on the various sites would likely exceed Japan’s $550 billion commitment to U.S. manufacturing, plus it would also have to go through a lot of hoops to use federal land.

There’s also the complicated planning process to determine what kind of industries will be built on them, as well as which companies will be allowed to do so. Taiwan is set to help the U.S. build its own industrial parks, including assisting it with “science park management, attracting companies, integrating academic research with industry,” Taiwan National Science and Technology Council Minister Wu Cheng-wen to the Financial Times. “No other country has done what we have done.”

However, TSMC has already declined to work with SoftBank on its Project Crystal Land, so unless the U.S. government compels it to work with the Japanese investor, Son would have to find another partner to help him build his industrial parks. Aside from that, he has also been in talks with other Japanese tech companies like Toshiba, Murata Manufacturing, and Fujikara, discussing projects that would support Washington’s push to develop local semiconductor manufacturing.

SoftBank has been betting big on semiconductors, investing billions of dollars in Arm, OpenAI, and, more recently, Intel. The U.S.’s push for AI supremacy thus would go well with the company’s strategy of going all-in on AI after it missed out in the early years of the LLM boom.

[TITLE]Google Is Riding the AI Wave Higher, but the Real Winner of Gemini 3 Is This Stock:
[TEXT]
Google, the crown jewel of Alphabet (GOOGL), is riding the artificial intelligence (AI) wave higher with a kind of momentum that feels almost effortless. On Nov. 18, it unveiled Gemini 3, its most advanced family of LLMs yet, earning an early verdict of clear and overwhelming dominance. Gemini 3 Pro shot straight to the top of LMArena’s leaderboard by Nov. 25 and sits firmly at No. 1 on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index with a score of 73, earning praise from evaluators as the best LLM.

But behind Google’s soaring AI story, the semiconductor and software powerhouse Broadcom (AVGO) is the quiet winner stepping into the spotlight. Investors have been connecting the dots fast, realizing that the semiconductor giant has been Google’s behind-the-scenes partner for years, building the tensor processing units (TPUs) that power Google’s biggest AI leaps. With Google’s latest deal with Anthropic and rising TPU demand, analysts are already naming Broadcom a top pick, even over Nvidia (NVDA).

Plus, Gemini 3 was trained entirely on Broadcom-linked TPUs, and the jump in Broadcom’s shares lately makes perfect sense. As Gemini 3 asserts its dominance, Broadcom’s role expands. With AVGO stock already soaring and analysts growing increasingly bullish, Broadcom is riding Google’s momentum and gearing up for an even bigger breakout ahead. Let’s take a closer look.

About Broadcom Stock

Founded in 1961 and headquartered in Palo Alto, California, Broadcom has evolved into a global technology leader with a market capitalization of approximately $1.8 trillion. The company’s portfolio spans advanced semiconductors and enterprise software, forming a critical foundation for cloud computing, high-performance data centers, mobile devices, and industrial automation.

Its consistent revenue and earnings growth reflect a durable competitive position across networking, wireless technologies, and specialized chip design. Today, Broadcom stands among the world’s most valuable and influential technology companies, recognized for its pivotal role in enabling modern connectivity and driving innovation across the digital infrastructure landscape.

AVGO shares have been advancing with remarkable force, firmly establishing the stock as one of Wall Street’s standout performers. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has rocketed 126%, leaving the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 13% climb and the Semiconductor iShares ETF’s (SOXX) 41% uptick far behind.

The backdrop is a roaring demand environment, and Broadcom is sprinting ahead of the pack. In just the past three months, the stock has ripped 15%, touching a fresh high of $403 recently. Momentum really kicked in after third-quarter earnings in September revealed a massive $10 billion custom-chip order, instantly lighting up trader enthusiasm.

The sparks kept flying on Nov. 24, when shares jumped 11% after reports confirmed Alphabet’s heavy reliance on Broadcom-designed TPUs to power its Gemini 3 model — a narrative investors loved. Layer on upbeat analyst calls and swelling expectations for AI-driven growth, and the sentiment around Broadcom has only grown stronger.

Technically, the 14-day RSI hovers around 59.7, retreating from overbought levels, signaling the stock has room to run before hitting resistance. The MACD line is turning upward, crossing above its blue signal line, suggesting bullish momentum is building. Together, these indicators point to a potential continuation of the recent uptrend, with momentum steadily picking up after short-term consolidation.

After a powerhouse rally, AVGO’s valuation sits firmly in the premium lane. The stock trades at 49 times forward adjusted earnings and nearly 31 times forward sales — levels far above sector averages. Yet investors are not blinking. That's a sign of strong belief in Broadcom’s ability to keep growing and defending margins. Such elevated multiples often signal a business built for durability, not just short-term momentum.

And even with all that growth, Broadcom still takes care of its shareholders. The company offers a forward dividend of $2.36 per share, yielding 0.62%, backed by years of hikes. The latest $0.59 per-share dividend was paid on Sept. 30. While Broadcom is pushing hard on expansion, it is also keeping its promise of steady returns and long-term stability.

Broadcom Tops Q3 Earnings Estimates

Broadcom’s stellar Q3 2025 earnings, released on Sept. 4, got Wall Street talking. The market reaction was immediate, as AVGO stock jumped 9.4% the next day and added another 3.2% after that. Revenue climbed 22% year-over-year (YOY) to $16 billion, topping expectations as the company’s two big engines — AI chips and VMware software — kept pushing growth higher.

The quarter also showed just how central Broadcom has become in the AI hardware race. Demand for its XPUs — the advanced custom chips built for heavy AI workloads — kept accelerating. AI revenue surged 63% annually to $5.2 billion, now making up a full third of the company’s sales. Management doesn’t see this slowing anytime soon.

XPUs alone accounted for 65% of Broadcom’s AI revenue, and the company’s total backlog swelled to $110 billion. On top of that, Broadcom has already locked in more than $10 billion in AI rack orders tied to XPU demand. Networking standouts like Tomahawk 5/6 and Jericho4 added even more lift. Big names like Alphabet, Meta Platforms (META), Nvidia, Dell (DELL), and others continued leaning on Broadcom’s tech, giving the company steady momentum.

Profitability kept the same strong rhythm. Adjusted EBITDA jumped 30% YOY to $10.7 billion, hitting 67% of revenue. Non-GAAP EPS came in at $1.69, and free cash flow surged 47% annually to $7 billion. With $9.47 billion in liquidity, Broadcom is in a comfortable spot. And it did not forget its shareholders — the company paid $2.8 billion in dividends during the quarter, showing it can grow fast while still returning plenty of cash to investors.

Broadcom is gearing up to report its fiscal Q4 results on Dec. 11, after the market closes, and expectations are running high. Management is calling for $17.4 billion in revenue, with adjusted EBITDA holding strong at 67% of sales. AI chip demand keeps rolling, too, and Broadcom expects AI semiconductor sales to hit $6.2 billion in Q4, marking the company’s 11th-straight quarter of AI growth.

Analysts are feeling upbeat as well. They are looking for Q4 EPS of about $1.49, up 19.2% YOY, and revenue of around $17.5 billion. For fiscal 2025, Wall Street sees EPS jumping 46% to $5.42, with another 42% surge to $7.68 in 2026. With AI chips flying off the shelves and VMware’s software engine adding steady fuel, Broadcom keeps stacking wins.

The Hidden Boost Broadcom Gets From Gemini 3

Google’s Gemini 3 is not just a headline-maker, but a direct revenue pipeline for Broadcom. Beyond the TPU partnership, every AI upgrade, every new model Google rolls out, pushes demand for more of Broadcom’s specialized chips. It's like a recurring engine — as AI workloads scale, TPUs also need to scale, and Broadcom is in the driver’s seat.

The Anthropic deal adds another layer, signaling that Google’s AI ecosystem is expanding, which could translate into multi-year TPU contracts and higher margins for Broadcom. Analysts are eyeing this closely, noting that Broadcom’s chips, while competitive, are becoming indispensable in a space that was until now dominated by Nvidia.

Combining that with Broadcom’s strong balance sheet and existing enterprise reach, the company is more than just a component supplier. It is positioning itself as a cornerstone of AI infrastructure. Every Gemini 3 update reinforces this, giving Broadcom a long runway of growth that’s hard to ignore.

What Do Analysts Expect for Broadcom Stock?

Analysts believe Broadcom has been the quiet builder behind the AI boom, making custom AI accelerators — XPUs — for giants like Google and OpenAI, which now drive most of its AI sales. With AVGO stock up 65% year-to-date (YTD) and nearing a $2 trillion value, the pressure is rising, too.

Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider recently hiked his price target from $380 to $435, praising Broadcom as the ultimate “arms dealer” of the AI boom. Still, he stresses that expectations for Q4 are sky-high — investors want a beat, a raise, and a 2026 guide that surpasses $11 billion in AI revenue. In his view, when a stock runs this hot, even strong numbers can underwhelm.

Yet Schneider remains bullish, pointing to three investor flashpoints — Broadcom’s 2026 AI revenue outlook, the contributions from Google and OpenAI, and whether its soaring margins can hold as XPUs scale. With Google’s Gemini 3, trained entirely on Broadcom-linked TPUs, setting new performance bars, expectations have only intensified. And while the stock now trades at a premium, the analyst still frames Broadcom not as hype but as the hardware backbone on which the entire AI ecosystem depends.

AVGO stock carries a solid "Strong Buy” consensus rating, and analysts keep backing it. Of the 40 analysts tracking the stock, 34 have a “Strong Buy,” three advise a “Moderate Buy,” and three sit on the sidelines with a “Hold” rating.

AVGO’s massive run has already carried it close to the Street’s average target of $410.78. That has some investors questioning how much near-term upside is left. Still, the most bullish target on Wall Street of $535 points to a possible 40% climb. That basically shows how much confidence there is in Broadcom’s growing role in the AI chip world and the steady demand for its custom silicon.

[TITLE]Nexperia spat shows automotive supply chains vulnerable to geopolitics:
[TEXT]
Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

The semiconductor shortage created over the ownership of the chip manufacturer Nexperia in the Netherlands is not just a governance dispute, it’s a warning shot across the bow for the automotive industry.

That’s the view of Moody’s Supply Chain Director Sapna Amlani, who believes automakers have to build more varied and robust supply chains to avoid similar disruptions.

The crisis at Nexperia began when the Dutch government seized temporary control of the China-owned company citing security concerns. China responded by stopping exports of semiconductors to the company until a settlement was reached in November.

However, the risk to supply chains for automakers remains an active threat to vehicle production, said Amlani in an email to WardsAuto.

“For procurement leaders, this is more than a temporary disruption,” she said. “It signals a structural risk: geopolitical decisions can instantly reshape sourcing economics. Even with China easing restrictions, governance breaches and quality concerns persist. Future risks could come from tighter EU controls or retaliatory measures from Beijing.”

[TITLE]Exclusive-Baidu's Kunlunxin, valued at close to $3 billion, eyes Hong Kong IPO, sources say:
[TEXT]
Dec 5 (Reuters) - Kunlunxin, the AI chip unit of Chinese internet search giant Baidu, is planning an initial public offering in Hong Kong, having recently completed a fundraising that valued it at 21 billion ​yuan ($2.97 billion), three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The move comes as China pushes to develop ‌domestic alternatives to U.S. semiconductors amid escalating Washington export restrictions on advanced chips, and follows several other Chinese AI chip companies eyeing public market debuts.

In ‌a sign of massive appetite for AI chip stocks, on Friday Moore Threads, which makes graphics processing units (GPUs) used for artificial intelligence computing, debuted on the Shanghai Stock Exchange at more than five times its IPO price.

Investment materials reviewed by Reuters showed that Kunlunxin wanted to complete an IPO by early 2027. Two of the sources said the company was communicating that it ⁠aims to file a listing application to ‌the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as early as the first quarter of 2026.

Kunlunxin completed its latest funding round in the past six months, raising over 2 billion yuan from a China ‍Mobile fund and other private investors, the two people and a third source said.

The round valued Kunlunxin at around 21 billion yuan, up from 18 billion yuan in its previous fundraising, the people said.

[TITLE]Small Business Saturday: £35 million defence funding boosting innovation across the UK:
[TEXT]
As the nation marks Small Business Saturday, MOD reveals innovative ideas across the UK which are being scaled into frontline military solutions, through dedicated defence funding.

SMEs are expanding, creating hundreds of high-skilled jobs nationwide, strengthening supply chains and making defence an engine for growth.

£400 million annual ringfenced budget for harnessing commercial innovation, including dual-use technologies.

Small and medium UK firms are being supported to bring innovations, from blast protection blocks to laser detection cameras, to market as the Armed Forces strive to be at the leading edge of innovation in NATO.

The Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA), underpinned by the deep scientific and technical expertise at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), has today unveiled how their financial backing for smaller companies has helped take innovations from the drawing board to military deployments. Many of the funded technologies have dual-use potential, serving defence needs while transforming sectors like healthcare, transport, and telecommunications.

These projects have been backed by £35 million funding nationwide since July 2024. This work will be driven forward through the new UK Defence Innovation (UKDI) organisation - created as part of the Strategic Defence Review - which will be focused on harnessing commercial innovation, including dual-use technologies, backed by a ringfenced annual budget of at least £400 million.

Examples of DASA’s impact include:

In Scotland, QuickBlock’s innovative building block system, which started its life as a civilian product, has been adapted for military use to be a highly effective tool for ballistics and blast protection.

In Wales, Swansea University spin-out Trauma Simulation has developed ground-breaking whole-body training models that transform how Combat Medics and Medical Emergency Response Teams prepare for life-saving interventions.

In the South West of England, Sentinel Photonics has been supported to grow from a founder-led startup of former Dstl scientists to a 20-strong team, whilst their attachments for rifle scopes – which shield users’ eyesight from lasers and prevent detection by laser surveillance – have now been integrated into the Armed Forces’ KS1 rifles entering service.

Earlier this year, a new report revealed that companies funded by DASA have generated nearly £1 billion in economic value and created 1,800 jobs across the UK, underlining how defence is an engine for growth. In 2024 alone, DASA-funded firms raised £174 million - defying wider market trends and making defence an engine for growth, delivering on the government’s Plan for Change.

The MOD is a major investor in innovation and technologies through the Defence Industrial Strategy that drives productivity and growth across the economy. The creation of the Defence Office for Small Business Growth will boost opportunities and access, supported by a target to increase spending with SMEs by £2.5 billion by May 2028.

Minister for Defence Readiness and Industry, Luke Pollard MP said:

We are backing small businesses up and down the UK that are the backbone of our economy, creating good jobs across the regions and the UK and easing the cost of living. Our government is committed to supporting businesses to grow and prosper – supporting British security and local communities. From advanced satellite systems developed in Oxford to innovative ballistic defence structures in Scotland, defence funding is helping these businesses bring transformative technologies into service. Through our Defence Industrial Strategy, we are supporting local businesses, creating high-skilled jobs and ensuring our Armed Forces have the best tools to keep our nation secure at home and strong abroad.

Innovation thrives in every region of the United Kingdom, from established tech clusters to industrial heartlands, historic urban centres to rural communities. Reflecting this, the Strategic Defence Review set out that 10% of the MOD’s equipment procurement budget will be spent on novel technologies each year.

By investing across the breadth of the nation, DASA ensures defence and security benefit from the unique perspectives, specialised knowledge, and industrial traditions that characterise different regions. This approach delivers cutting-edge technologies for defence and security while creating high-skilled jobs and strengthening local economies.

Head of DASA, Anita Friend said:

Innovation knows no boundaries, and these case studies demonstrate that breakthrough defence and security solutions are being developed in every corner of the UK. UKDI-DASA is committed to finding and funding the best ideas, wherever they originate. By investing across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we’re not only delivering cutting-edge capabilities, but also strengthening local economies and building a resilient, nationwide innovation ecosystem.

DASA is part of UKDI and are proud to fund and nurture this nationwide ecosystem of creativity, recognising that breakthrough ideas can emerge anywhere. Today’s progress reflects DASA’s mission to ‘find and fund exploitable innovations to support UK defence and security quickly and effectively, and support UK prosperity’.

This year the number of small businesses in the UK grew for the first time since 2020, to 5.64 million.

This is Ripple Fiber’s first step in a plan to bring fiber broadband to more than 200,000 Washington homes in the areas of Grays Harbor County and King County.

The first customers should start receiving service sometime in the first quarter of 2026, the company said, adding that it plans to open a local office soon.

Washington offers an outstanding opportunity for this type of service, according to Ripple Fiber, which cited a Reviews.org report saying that nearly two-thirds of the state’s residents don’t have access to fiber internet.

“Ripple Fiber’s expansion into Washington state represents our network’s ninth state and a notable achievement for our growth strategy, reflecting the significant progress our team has made in building a coast-to-coast network,” company founder and CEO Greg Wilson, said in a prepared statement.

“As we approach the start of construction in the coming weeks, we look forward to serving as a catalyst for expanding digital access in communities throughout the state.”

Though Ripple Fiber didn’t receive any provisional awards from Washington in the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program, it did received provisional awards in North and South Carolina. In North Carolina, Ripple Fiber has provisionally been awarded $597,177. In South Carolina, the company was provisionally awarded $296,227.

South Carolina was among the first states to have its BEAD Final Proposal approved by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in November.

[TITLE]Elizabeth Warren Slams Netflix-Warner Bros. Deal as ‘Anti-Monopoly Nightmare’:
[TEXT]
Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) slammed the impending Netflix-Warner Bros. Discovery acquisition on Friday after news broke that WBD had accepted the streaming giant’s $82.7 billion bid, arguing that the merger would be an “anti-monopoly nightmare.”

“A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market. It could force you into higher prices, fewer choices over what and how you watch, and may put American workers at risk,” the Senator said on X.

“Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption,” she continued. “The Justice Department must enforce our nation’s anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery.”

Netflix on Friday announced that it was “highly confident” that it will receive and “running full speed” toward regulatory approval for its acquisition of Warner Bros. streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion.

“This deal is pro consumer, pro innovation, pro worker, it’s pro creator, it’s pro growth, and our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but we’re really confident that we’re going to to get all the necessary approvals that we need,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told analysts on Friday. “These two businesses are complementary, and they’re also loved businesses, which is really fantastic.”

Warren previously spoke out against Paramount’s attempt to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, calling it “a trap to set higher prices.”

In a joint letter to the Department of Justice in November, Warren, Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) asked the DoJ that any regulatory review be “conducted transparently, independently and in accordance with federal antitrust and anti-corruption laws.”

“Unbiased enforcement of antitrust and telecommunications laws is necessary to promote market growth and economic security for working families,” they wrote. “The DOJ must ensure that review of any potential transaction involving Warner Bros. is grounded in the law, not President Trump’s political favoritism.”

Warren was not the only senator to speak out against the deal on social media. Sen. Bernie Sanders also made a Friday statement on X about Netflix’s acquisition.

“Netflix is swallowing Warner Bros. Discovery. This is not just another corporate merger,” Sanders said on X. “This is about the growing, out-of-control concentration of ownership over the media. At a time when six major conglomerates control what 90% of Americans see, hear and read, oligarch control is getting even worse.”

He continued: “The Justice Department must step up, enforce our antitrust laws, and break up these monopolies. The future of our democracy depends on it.”

[TITLE]Layoff Rumors And Metaverse Cuts Push Meta Shares Higher—Details:
[TEXT]
Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure

Meta Platforms Inc. shares climbed after reports that the company is weighing deep reductions to the budget behind its metaverse projects. Investors pushed the stock higher as traders reacted to the possibility that one of the company’s most costly bets could be scaled back.

Metaverse Budget Faces A Major Trim

Based on reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, Meta is considering cuts of up to 30% to the unit that builds its virtual reality and metaverse products, a move tied to planning for the company’s 2026 budget. The change would mainly affect Reality Labs, the division that makes Quest headsets and Horizon virtual spaces.

Reality Labs Has Been Losing Billions

Reality Labs has posted heavy losses since 2020. Reports put the total at more than $60 billion and, by some counts, closer to $70 billion in cumulative losses over recent years. Those sums have kept pressure on management to rethink where the company puts its money.

Investors Reward A Smaller Bet

The market response was swift. Meta’s share price jumped roughly 4%, and some outlets calculated that the move added about $69 billion to the company’s market value as traders reacted positively to a pullback from costly metaverse spending. That reaction signals investors prefer money steered toward projects with clearer near-term returns.

Layoffs Could Follow Early Next Year

Reports have warned that the cuts could bring staff reductions inside Reality Labs, with layoffs possibly starting as early as January 2026. Company leaders reportedly discussed budget scenarios during recent planning meetings. Any job cuts would mark a sharp change after years of heavy investment in virtual reality and related software.

A Bigger Push Toward AI And Wearables

At the same time, Meta has been moving money into artificial intelligence and related hardware. The company finalized a multibillion-dollar deal this year to take a large stake in Scale AI — a pact reported at roughly $14 billion for a near-half ownership — and then hired talent from that startup to help run a new AI effort. That tradeoff shows where Meta’s priorities now lie.

What This Means For Users And Competitors

For people who own or use Meta’s VR gear, this does not mean every project will end. But several initiatives could see slower progress and smaller teams. For rivals and suppliers in the AR/VR space, the cut may reshape who wins short-term device and platform business.

Analysts say the move narrows one major uncertainty for Meta while opening another: how well the company can compete in AI after so many dollars flowed into virtual worlds.
