[TITLE]Wells Fargo Raises Ovintiv (OVV) PT to $42, Cites Superior Montney Assets from NuVista Energy Acquisition:
[TEXT]
Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) is one of the most undervalued NYSE stocks to buy right now. On November 18, Wells Fargo analyst Hanwen Chang raised the firm’s price target on Ovintiv to $42 from $38 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares. This upgrade was announced as Chang noted that the NuVista Energy acquisition provides Ovintiv with superior Montney assets, boosting productivity and unlocking the potential for over 5% oil growth without significant midstream capital expenditure.

Earlier this month, on November 5, Ovintiv signed a definitive agreement to acquire Canadian company NuVista Energy for ~$2.7 billion (CAD 3.8 billion) in a cash-and-stock transaction. Ovintiv already holds 9.6 percent of NuVista’s outstanding shares, which it obtained in a private transaction at CAD 16 per share. The total consideration for the remaining NuVista shares is structured as a blend of 50% cash and 50% Ovintiv common stock. The total acquisition price for NuVista is ~CAD 17.8 per share.

[TITLE]Oil Prices Sink as Ukraine Agrees to Peace Deal:
[TEXT]
Traders anticipate that a peace deal could lead to the easing of sanctions on Russia's energy exports, compounding existing concerns about an already oversupplied oil market.

The agreement, which still has minor details to be sorted out, was confirmed by a U.S. official and a statement from Ukraine's Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, Rustem Umerov.

Oil prices, with WTI dropping below $60 per barrel, extended losses following reports that Ukraine has mostly agreed to a peace deal with the U.S.

Oil prices extended losses early on Tuesday after news broke that Ukraine has mostly agreed to a peace deal, with “minor details” to discuss and settle.

As of 8:35a.m. ET on Tuesday, the U.S. benchmark crude futures, WTI Crude, dropped by 1.29% to further slip below $60 per barrel, at $58.08.

The international benchmark, Brent Crude, was trading down by 1.23% at $62.59.

Prices reacted to reports early on Tuesday that the U.S. plan for peace in Ukraine has received support from Ukrainians. The development added to persistent concerns about an already oversupplied oil market.

“The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal,” a U.S. official told CBS News today.

“There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal,” the U.S. official added.

Rustem Umerov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, posted on X early on Tuesday “We appreciate the productive and constructive meetings held in Geneva between the Ukrainian and U.S. delegations, as well as President Trump’s steadfast efforts to end the war.”

“Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,” Umerov added.

“We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine’s President to the US at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump.”

A peace deal that President Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could agree on as early this week is weighing on oil prices as traders expect that some sanctions on Russia’s energy industry and exports could be eased.

While Ukraine and the U.S. were negotiating in Geneva, U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Abu Dhabi for discussions with Russian officials, sources told CBS News.

As of early Tuesday, there was no reaction or comment from Russia on a peace deal.

[TITLE]Global oil prices drop to multi-month lows amid optimism for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal – NaturalNews.com:
[TEXT]
Global oil prices drop to multi-month lows amid optimism for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal

Brent crude fell to $62.67 and WTI to $58.29 after rumors of a U.S.-brokered Russia-Ukraine ceasefire, reflecting traders' premature optimism despite unresolved geopolitical tensions.

The drop reveals how quickly oil prices react to diplomatic rumors, erasing the war-driven "risk premium" while ignoring deep-seated conflicts and political hurdles to actual peace.

Analysts warn of a projected 4 million barrel/day surplus by 2026 due to rising non-OPEC production, further pressuring prices regardless of geopolitical developments.

Proposed terms favoring Russia are politically untenable for Ukraine, while a strong U.S. dollar and weak PMI data threaten global demand, trapping oil in a volatile lower range.

New U.S. sanctions on Russian oil firms and the potential for sudden supply disruptions mean prices could spike again, exposing the fragility of the current market optimism.

In a dramatic shift that has stunned energy markets, global oil prices have plummeted to multi-month lows—a descent fueled not by a fundamental improvement in global stability, but by the fragile hope of peace.

On Friday, Nov. 21, the international benchmark Brent crude fell to $62.67 per barrel, while the U.S. standard West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dropped to $58.29, as traders bet on a U.S.-endorsed agreement to end the protracted Russia-Ukraine war. The drop in oil prices served as a welcome respite for consumers at the gas pump.

However, this sharp decline underscores a perilous gamble by financial markets on a geopolitical detente that remains far from certain. It also reveals the profound vulnerability of the global economy to the whims of war and diplomacy.

The immediate catalyst for the sell-off was a widely leaked draft peace plan, reportedly brokered by the U.S. administration, which proposes an end to the devastating conflict. The mere suggestion of a truce was enough to trigger a massive recalculation by traders.

For months, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has acted as a substantial risk premium baked into the price of oil, a fear tax paid by the world for the constant threat of supply disruptions from one of the planet's largest energy producers. The potential for a deal caused this premium to rapidly evaporate, as markets priced in the possibility of normalized Russian crude exports returning to global markets without the friction of wartime logistics and shadow sanctions.

Beyond the headlines of peace, a more mundane but equally powerful force is driving prices down: the fear of too much oil. Analyst Nadir Belbarka of XMArabia pinpointed rising expectations of oversupply as a core reason for the price collapse.

The International Energy Agency has projected a significant surplus of approximately four million barrels per day by 2026, driven by robust oil production growth from non-OPEC nations. This fundamental shift in the supply-demand balance suggests that even without peace, the market was already tilting toward a state of plenty, a bearish signal that has been amplified by the prospect of a geopolitical resolution.

Market mirage: Between false peace and geopolitical chaos

However, this market optimism appears dangerously premature. The proposed peace terms, which would require Ukraine to cede contested territories like Crimea and abandon its ambition to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,, have been met with profound skepticism by analysts and European allies.

The plan, widely seen as favoring Russian interests, faces monumental political hurdles in Kyiv. The notion that such a complex and painful resolution could be swiftly implemented is a triumph of hope over the grim realities of a hardened conflict. The market's celebration is, in essence, a bet on a deal that has not yet been struck, between parties whose fundamental positions remain miles apart.

Compounding the bearish sentiment are powerful macroeconomic headwinds. A strengthening U.S. dollar, driven by fading expectations of an immediate interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies, thereby dampening international demand.

Furthermore, traders are anxiously awaiting key economic indicators, known as flash Purchasing Managers' Indexes (PMIs), from major economies. These PMIs are a crucial barometer of economic health; weak readings could signal a looming recession, destroying demand for energy and pushing prices even lower.

In this volatile climate, analysts warn that oil is likely to remain trapped within a new, lower trading range for the remainder of the year. The market is caught in a tug-of-war between bearish fundamentals—the threat of oversupply and economic slowdown—and the ever-present potential for a bullish shock.

The recent imposition of new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil is a stark reminder that the geopolitical risk has not vanished. Rather, it has merely been temporarily overshadowed by peace talk headlines. BrightU.AI's Enoch engine warns that U.S. President Donald Trump's sanctions on the two entities risk destabilizing global energy markets by triggering secondary and third-order sanctions that could punish unintended targets, including businesses and individuals tangentially linked to Russian oil transactions.

This moment is a painful echo of past energy crises, where short-term price relief blinded policymakers and the public to underlying structural fragilities. A single breakdown in diplomacy or an unexpected supply outage could reverse the current price plunge in a matter of hours.

Watch as President Donald Trump and Hungarian PM Viktor Orban discuss Ukraine war, Russian oil and immigration.

[TITLE]Oil Extends Slump As Traders Assess Outlook For Deal On Ukraine:
[TEXT]
Crude has slumped this year, with futures on course for a fourth monthly loss in October, in what would be the longest losing streak since 2023. The decline has been driven by expanded global output, including from OPEC+, with the International Energy Agency forecasting a record surplus for 2026. Traders are closely monitoring whether a deal on Ukraine will materialize, and if sanctions on Russia will be lifted — developments that could inject more supply.

“If we do reach an agreement here, and it’s a very big if, the global glut gets a lot worse once sanctions are removed,” said Robert Rennie, head of commodity research at Westpac Bank Corp. “We see Brent capped above $65 — and see it headed lower into 2026 — though this week will all be about the ebb and flow of European, Ukrainian and US commentary on how the peace plan is evolving.”

[TITLE]Norwegian billionaire left to rue Mainstream Renewable deal as losses hit €1.2bn:
[TEXT]
Mainstream has racked up huge losses amid turbulence in its main market Chile and challenges in the green energy development sector

For Aker ASA, the Norwegian industrial powerhouse that began life as a boat builder, a deal to buy Eddie O’Connor’s Mainstream Renewable Power in January 2021 was a springboard to float one of its portfolio companies weeks later.

“Combining Mainstream’s global organisation and renewable assets with Aker’s 180-year track record of building and developing industrial companies is another step in line with our long-term strategy for value creation,” said Øyvind Eriksen, chief executive of Aker ASA.

Aker Horizons, the unit going through the initial public offering (IPO), was handed Mainstream, after the group agreed to buy a 75 per cent stake, in a deal that valued the Irish business at €900 million.

A 20 per cent spike in Aker ASA’s own shares within days of the Mainstream deal suggested investors in Oslo thought it had snapped up a bargain in the wind and solar energy developer, with projects spanning Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific.

But it was a moment many of the 600 wealthy Irish individuals who backed O’Connor when he set up the company in 2008 – with hopes he could replicate the stunning €1.8 billion achieved for Airtricity, his previous venture – had long doubted would ever arrive.

Theirs had been a hair-raising ride. The financial crisis battered initial plans, and for a decade the company survived by selling developments early – and on the cheap – to keep the lights on. Things finally turned with the transformational sale of a large wind farm project off the coast of Scotland for more than €600 million in 2018.

For O’Connor, who died early last year, the 2021 deal delivered a fifteenfold gain on the €30 million he had put into Mainstream. He and a handful of others rolled over a 25 per cent stake.

However, 60 cent of the small Irish investors opted to sell out entirely in 2021, rather than reinvest some money in the Aker Horizons deal – walking away with

[TITLE]Alberta introduces new plan to incentivize data centres to power themselves:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

New Alberta legislation would allow electricity hungry data centres to generate their own power, should the legislature approve the changes.

Staring down a glut of applications for access to Alberta’s power grid to build the processing hubs, the provincial government hopes to change legislation to incentivize data centres to bring their own power supplies.

“We've been hard at work trying to make Alberta a destination of choice in North America for this type of investment,” Technology and Innovation Minister Nate Glubish said at a news conference Tuesday morning.

“We see this enormous opportunity to grow our tax base, to grow domestic demand for our natural resources.”

Bill 8, the Utilities Statutes Amendment Act, would also require the builders of data centres to pay for any upgrades to the electrical transmission system to support the vast quantities of power that could be consumed by the centres.

Affordability and Utilities Minister Nathan Neudorf, who introduced Bill 8, said at a separate news conference that the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) will prioritize applications from data centres that bring their own power sources.

Neudorf said the government needs to ensure a reliable source of power is available for all consumers.

"The advancement of innovative new technologies like AI will bring new industry, jobs and economic growth to the province," he said. "A successful future depends on a utility system that keeps adapting to these changes."

Finance Minister Nate Horner also introduced a finance bill on Tuesday that would create a new levy on data centres.

The government first signalled in August that a new levy would apply to data centres consuming at least 75 megawatts of power or more starting at the end of 2026.

Glubish said the levy is structured to reward companies that pay more corporate income taxes in the province.

He said some of the companies proposing to build data centres in Alberta are international players with sophisticated plans to generate profits in other jurisdictions to keep tax costs lower.

“And we don't think that's OK,” he said.

Should the province’s Bill 12 pass, a two per cent levy would apply to the value of computer equipment in large data centres, starting Dec. 31, 2026.

Those levies will be deducted from any corporate income taxes paid in Alberta, Glubish said.

Data centres that generate their own power but are connected to the electrical grid will pay a one per cent levy on the value of computer equipment, and off-grid operations will not pay a levy.

Neudorf said Alberta doesn't expect any off-grid data centres soon, but wanted to leave the door open, should such a project arrive.

Data centres a big demand on power

Since the province unveiled a data centre attraction strategy last year, AESO has received 37 applications for large projects.

AESO has chosen two developers of three potential projects to use a first tranche of 1,200 MW the system operator is making available to power data centres, CEO Aaron Engen said at a Tuesday afternoon news conference.

Those projects must also get development and water permits to proceed. If they go ahead, the data centres should be running by 2028, Engen said.

If AESO approved access to the grid for all 37 large projects, they would consume a combined 19 gigawatts of power, Engen said. That is

[TITLE]Data Centers, AI, and Energy: Everything You Need to Know:
[TEXT]
The primary bottleneck for AI expansion has shifted from power generation to physical infrastructure, with long lead times for grid upgrades, a global transformer shortage, and geopolitical vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chain (copper, lithium, rare earth elements) creating acute risks.

Despite major tech companies' net-zero pledges, the sheer velocity of the AI buildout forces a reliance on reliable baseload power from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas through 2030, with nuclear power viewed as the long-term, carbon-free solution.

The exponential energy demand of AI-driven data centers, particularly from high-performance accelerated servers (GPUs and ASICs), is rapidly outpacing global energy efficiency trends, leading to a projected doubling of data center electricity consumption by 2030.

For the past decade, the defining narrative of the global energy sector has been the transition of supply. Governments, utilities, and investors have focused almost exclusively on shifting generation assets from fossil fuels to renewables, retiring coal plants in favor of wind farms and solar arrays....

The narrative for the next decade, however, is currently being rewritten by a structural shift in demand that few predicted would happen this quickly: the exponential rise of the data center.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) transitions from theoretical models in research labs to wide-scale commercial deployment, data centers have evolved. They are no longer passive warehouses for email storage and website hosting; they are now active, energy-intensive industrial engines. These facilities have become the "refineries" of the digital age, processing raw data into economic value, and in doing so, they are exerting unprecedented pressure on electricity grids, water resources, and critical mineral supply chains.

The implications for the energy market are profound. We are witnessing a collision between the digital economy's exponential growth curve and the physical economy's linear constraints. This guide provides a comprehensive analysis of how data centers utilize resources, the specific energy mixes powering them across different geopolitical regions, and the systemic risks posed by the integration of hyperscale compute infrastructure with legacy power grids.

Part I: The Anatomy of Consumption

To understand the macro-level impact of the sector on global energy markets, it is necessary to first understand the micro-level physics of the data center itself. These facilities are complex aggregations of IT equipment, environmental controls, and power management systems, each with distinct energy profiles that contribute to the total load.

From CPU to GPU and Custom Silicon

The fundamental driver of increasing energy density is the changing nature of the silicon chip. For decades, the industry relied on Central Processing Units (CPUs) for general-purpose computing. While powerful, CPUs operate within a relatively predictable energy envelope. The rise of Generative AI has necessitated a wholesale shift toward "accelerated servers."

The GPU Explosion

The initial phase of the AI infrastructure buildout has been defined by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). To understand the energy implications, one must understand the architecture. A traditional CPU is designed to do a few complex tasks very quickly in sequence. A GPU, conversely, is designed to do thousands of simple mathematical tasks simultaneously. Since AI training is effectively one giant matrix multiplication problem, the GPU is exponentially more efficient at the task than a CPU.

However, this computational density comes at a severe thermodynamic cost. As the industry packs more transistors onto silicon wafers to process larger models, the power draw per chip has skyrocketed. We have moved from an era of "general purpose" computing to "high-performance" computing, where energy consumption is the primary constraint on performance.

The market for these high-performance chips is currently dominated by a few key players driving the energy intensity of the sector:

Nvidia H100 "Hopper": Currently the industry standard for AI training. A single H100 chip can consume up to 700 watts at peak utilization. When installed in a server rack of 8 to 16 GPUs, the power density exceeds anything legacy data centers were built to handle.

Nvidia B200 "Blackwell": The next-generation architecture. It promises massive performance gains but raises the thermal stakes significantly, with a single chip capable of drawing up to 1,200 watts.

AMD Instinct MI300X: The primary competitor to Nvidia, offering high-density memory configurations that also require significant power and cooling infrastructure.

The deployment of these chips is fundamentally altering the physical requirements of the data center building. A legacy server rack typically draws 5 to 10 kilowatts (kW) of power. A modern rack packed with Blackwell or H100 GPUs can draw between 50 and 100 kW.

This tenfold increase in power density forces a transition from air cooling (fans blowing over metal heatsinks) to liquid cooling. Air is simply not a dense enough medium to carry away the waste heat generated by a 100kW rack. Consequently, the next generation of data centers is being plumbed like industrial chemical plants, with coolant loops running directly to the silicon die to prevent thermal throttling.

The Hyperscaler Rebellion

As energy constraints tighten and power costs rise, the major technology giants—the "Hyperscalers"—are seeking to reduce their dependence on general-purpose GPUs. While GPUs are excellent for AI, they still include legacy graphics logic that AI models do not need. This "silicon bloat" equates to wasted watts.

To solve this, companies are evolving toward Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These are custom chips designed from the ground up to do exactly one thing: run neural networks. By stripping away general-purpose features, these chips achieve significantly higher performance per watt, allowing data center operators to get more compute out of the same grid connection.

The major players have all launched proprietary silicon strategies:

Google (TPU): Google’s Tensor Processing Units are the veterans of this space. The latest 6th-generation "Trillium" TPU is explicitly engineered for energy efficiency, offering a 67% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the previous generation.

AWS (Trainium & Inferentia): Amazon Web Services has bifurcated its silicon. Trainium is built for the heavy lift of training models, while Inferentia is designed for the low-cost, low-energy task of "inference" (running the model for end-users).

Microsoft (Maia): Microsoft has introduced the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator, custom-designed to run large language models on the Azure cloud. It features a unique "sidekick" liquid cooling setup that fits into existing data center footprints.

Meta (MTIA): The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator is designed specifically for Meta's recommendation algorithms, optimizing for the specific math heavily used in social media ranking rather than generative text.

This shift toward ASICs represents the industrialization of AI. Just as the automotive industry moved from general workshops to specialized assembly lines, the data center industry is moving from general-purpose servers to specialized AI pods.

These custom chips allow Hyperscalers to decouple their growth from the broader supply chain constraints of the merchant GPU market. More importantly, they allow for a holistic system design. Because Google designs the TPU, the server rack, the cooling loop, and the data center shell, they can optimize the cooling flow to match the exact thermal profile of the chip, squeezing out efficiency gains that are impossible with off-the-shelf hardware.

Beyond the Silicon Limit

Looking further ahead, the industry recognizes that even custom silicon has a physical limit. As transistors shrink to the size of atoms, electrical resistance creates heat that cannot be easily mitigated. To break this energy curve, R&D labs are exploring exotic architectures that abandon traditional electronics entirely.

Two specific technologies are currently moving from theory to prototype:

Silicon Photonics: Current chips use copper wires to move data. Copper has resistance, which generates heat. Companies like Lightmatter and Ayar Labs are replacing copper with light (photons). Light generates virtually no heat compared to electricity and travels faster, potentially solving the data movement energy bottleneck that currently plagues large clusters.

Neuromorphic Computing: Traditional computers separate memory and processing, wasting energy moving data back and forth (the Von Neumann bottleneck). Neuromorphic chips are designed to mimic the human brain’s architecture, using "spiking neural networks" where processing and memory happen in the same location. These promise orders-of-magnitude reductions in power for specific sensory processing tasks.

This architectural pivot from CPU to accelerated silicon—and eventually to photonics—is not merely a technical detail; it is creating a two-speed energy market. The "old" internet of email and web hosting will continue to run on efficient, low-growth CPU servers. The "new" economy of AI will run on power-hungry accelerated infrastructure.

According to 2024 data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), this split is already visible in the data. Conventional servers are projected to see electricity consumption grow at a modest rate of 9 percent annually. In stark contrast, electricity consumption for accelerated servers (GPUs, TPUs, and ASICs) is projected to grow by 30 percent annually. By 2030, these accelerated servers will account for almost half of the net increase in global data center electricity consumption.

The Breakdown of Power Usage

A data center’s electricity consumption is distributed across five primary categories. Understanding this breakdown is critical for investors and analysts trying to identify where efficiency gains—and energy wastes—are located.

Source: IEA

Servers: Servers account for approximately 60 percent of total demand in a modern facility. This is the electricity actually doing the "work" of computation. As chip density increases, this percentage is rising relative to auxiliary systems, meaning the grid is becoming more directly coupled to the computational workload. When an AI model is training, the load is constant and high; when it is idle, it drops. This variability introduces new challenges for grid operators accustomed to steady industrial loads.

Cooling and Environmental Control: Cooling represents the single largest variable in data center efficiency, accounting for anywhere between 7 percent and 30 percent of total electricity intake. This massive variance highlights a divided market.

"Hyperscale" data centers—those massive campuses owned by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft—utilize advanced techniques to keep cooling demands near that 7 percent floor. They employ hot-aisle containment, free-air cooling, and increasingly, direct-to-chip liquid cooling. The shift to TPUs and high-end GPUs has made water cooling a necessity rather than a luxury, as air alone can no longer dissipate the heat generated by modern silicon.

In contrast, smaller enterprise data centers and legacy facilities are far less efficient. Many of these older facilities burn up to 30 percent of their total electricity intake just fighting the laws of thermodynamics, using energy-intensive air conditioners to keep servers from overheating. This sector is also the primary driver of water usage in data centers.

Storage, Network, and Infrastructure: The remainder of the power wedge is split between storage systems (5 percent), network equipment like switches and routers (5 percent), and general infrastructure like lighting and physical security. While individually small, the sheer volume of data being retained for AI training datasets means that storage energy demands are growing in absolute terms.

This internal distribution of energy—heavily weighted toward the silicon itself—explains why the industry is so focused on chip efficiency. Every watt saved at the server level cascades through the system, reducing the need for cooling, power distribution, and backup infrastructure. However, as the breakdown illustrates, the "low hanging fruit" of cooling efficiency has largely been harvested by the hyperscalers. The next frontier of efficiency gains must come from the compute load itself.

Ultimately, understanding the micro-level physics of the server rack is only the first step. While an individual GPU or TPU is a marvel of engineering, the aggregation of millions of these chips into global fleets creates a macro-economic force. The efficiency gains at the chip level are currently being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of deployment, leading us from the physics of the rack to the physics of the grid.

To grasp the full impact on global energy markets, we must move beyond the walls of the facility and look at the aggregate demand these components are placing on national power systems. The internal struggle between heat and compute is now spilling over into a global struggle for capacity.

Part II: The Scale of Demand

Data centers currently occupy a relatively small niche in global energy usage compared to heavy industry or transportation, but their growth velocity is outpacing almost every other sector in the global economy.

Current Baseline and Future Trajectories

In 2024, global data centers consumed an estimated 415 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. To put that in perspective, 415 TWh is roughly equivalent to the total annual electricity consumption of France. This represents approximately 1.5% of global electricity consumption. While this figure may appear marginal to the casual observer, the rate of change indicates a looming crunch.

Over the last five years, consumption has grown at 12 percent annually. Looking forward to 2030, the IEA projects this demand to accelerate, outlining three distinct scenarios that market watchers should monitor.

The Base Case: In the most likely scenario, global electricity consumption for data centers is projected to double, reaching roughly 945 TWh by 2030. In this future, the sector would consume just under 3 percent of the world’s total electricity. This doubling in just six years would require the addition of power generation capacity roughly equivalent to the entire current grid of Germany.

The "Lift-Off" Case: This scenario assumes that current supply chain constraints are resolved rapidly and that AI adoption accelerates unchecked by regulation or economics. Under these conditions, demand could surge to 1,700 TWh by 2035—consuming nearly 4.5 percent of the world's electricity. This would place data centers on par with the energy footprint of the entire country of India.

The Headwinds Case: Conversely, if technical bottlenecks, geopolitical fracturing, or slow AI adoption prevail, demand may plateau around 700 TWh. Even in this conservative view, the sector remains a massive industrial consumer, but one that stays below 2 percent of global demand.

The Carbon Footprint

Beyond raw electricity usage, the carbon implications are significant. Today, data centers account for roughly 180 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 emissions annually, which is roughly 0.5% of global energy-related emissions. While this is currently lower than aviation or shipping, the trajectory is steeper.

If the "Lift-Off" scenario comes to pass, these emissions could rise to 1.4% of the global total. While hyperscalers are offsetting this with renewable purchases, the "location-based" emissions (the actual carbon emitted by the local grid powering the facility) often remain higher than the "market-based" emissions (the net figure after offsets). This discrepancy is key for ESG investors: a data center in a coal-heavy region like Inner Mongolia or West Virginia has a physical carbon footprint that no amount of paper credits can fully erase.

The End of the Efficiency Era

Regardless of which scenario plays out, the trajectory is undeniable: the digital economy is decoupling from the energy efficiency trends of the past decade. For years, global data center energy use remained relatively flat even as internet traffic exploded, thanks to massive improvements in server efficiency and cloud consolidation. That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends. Unlike electric vehicles, which distribute load across millions of endpoints and can charge during off-peak hours, data centers are concentrated, baseload consumers. A single hyperscale campus can consume as much power as a mid-sized city, demanding that power 24/7 with zero tolerance for intermittency. This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Contextualizing the Surge

Regardless of which scenario plays out—Base, Lift-Off, or Headwinds—the trajectory is undeniable: the digital economy is decoupling from the energy efficiency trends of the past decade. For years, global data center energy use remained relatively flat even as internet traffic exploded, thanks to massive improvements in server efficiency and cloud consolidation. That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition, creating a wedge of new demand that the grid was not built to accommodate.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends. Unlike electric vehicles, which distribute load across millions of endpoints and can charge during off-peak hours, data centers are concentrated, baseload consumers. A single hyperscale campus can consume as much power as a mid-sized city, demanding that power 24/7 with zero tolerance for intermittency. This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Part III: The Energy Mix and Carbon Reality

There is a significant divergence between the stated decarbonization goals of major technology companies and the physical reality of the grids powering their facilities. Most hyperscalers have aggressive "Net Zero" targets, often aiming to run on 100% carbon-free energy by 2030. However, the physical electrons flowing into their servers largely come from fossil fuels and will likely continue to do so through the medium term due to the mechanics of baseload power.

1. Coal

Despite global efforts to phase out coal, it remains the silent workhorse of the digital economy. Coal is currently the largest single source of electricity for data centers globally, accounting for approximately 30 percent of the sector's power.

This reliance is heavily skewed by geography, specifically China. As the world's second-largest market for data infrastructure, China derives nearly 70 percent of its data center power from coal. However, even in Western markets, the baseload requirements of data centers often necessitate reliance on grid mixes that still contain coal generation, particularly during periods of low renewable output. The IEA projects that while coal's share will eventually decline, it will remain a critical pillar of supply until at least 2035, challenging the "green" narrative of the AI revolution.

2. Natural Gas

Natural gas currently meets 26 percent of global data center demand, but its role is arguably more critical than the raw percentage suggests. Gas is expected to be a primary beneficiary of the AI boom in the short term, particularly in North America.

Data centers operate on a standard of "five nines" (99.999%) of reliability. A power outage is not an inconvenience; it is a catastrophic financial event. Intermittent renewables like wind and solar cannot yet provide this level of uptime without massive battery storage, which is not yet deployed at sufficient scale. Consequently, natural gas serves as the dispatchable generation source of choice.

In the United States, natural gas is already the largest fuel source for data centers, accounting for over 40 percent of demand. Between 2024 and 2030, natural gas and coal combined are expected to meet over 40 percent of the additional electricity demand generated by data centers. For natural gas investors, the data center boom represents a new, durable source of industrial demand that is largely price-insensitive.

[TITLE]Hawaii’s LNG Detour: Why A Fossil Bridge Arriving In The 2030s Makes No Sense:
[TEXT]
Hawaii is re-evaluating its electricity system again and LNG is back on the table as a proposed bridge between oil dependence and a renewable future. The idea is simple at first glance. Hawaii burns more oil for electricity than any other state and Oahu still relies on oil for most of its generation. LNG is cleaner than residual fuel oil at the smokestack and often cheaper per kWh after modern gas turbines extract more energy from the same heat. The argument is that a temporary shift to LNG creates breathing room while the islands continue to build wind, solar, and batteries. The appeal is easy to understand. A familiar thermal solution promises reliability and a measurable reduction in local air pollution. The problem is that the framing leaves out the full system picture and the lifecycle emissions I have been assessing for LNG supply chains for years.

Hawaii’s current electricity landscape makes the pressure to choose something immediate understandable. Most of Oahu’s electricity still comes from low sulfur fuel oil and diesel. Statewide consumption sits around 10 TWh a year, with Oahu dominating demand. Maui and Hawaii Island have higher renewable shares, but they also have lower total loads. Power prices remain the highest in the United States. Solar on rooftops is significant and increasingly central to daytime demand, but there is still a large thermal backbone under those panels. When the last coal plant closed, the gap was filled entirely with oil generation. The state’s legal requirement for 100% renewable electricity by 2045 means every new fossil asset must retire early or convert to something cleaner before it has delivered a full economic life.

Proponents of LNG tend to argue that oil dependence is too expensive, too polluting, and too volatile to maintain. They worry that relying heavily on solar and batteries before the system is fully reshaped risks reliability issues. They point out that residual fuel oil produces sulfur dioxide, particulates and heavy metals at levels that matter for public health. They argue that oil-fired generation is inflexible and that LNG in combined cycle turbines could reduce emissions while keeping firm capacity online. There is truth in all of this. Residual fuel oil is a dirty and expensive fuel. Meeting peak demand with existing oil plants is difficult. The utility does need dispatchable capacity to cover evening ramps and contingencies. These concerns justify a careful assessment of LNG, not a dismissal.

The infrastructure required for LNG in Hawaii is significant. The concept usually centers on a floating storage and regasification unit moored off Oahu, a set of pipelines to shore, and a new gas plant near the old Barbers Point coal site. Existing oil plants would be converted to dual fuel. The total capital cost of all associated facilities is often estimated at more than $1 billion. LNG creates new fixed charges that ratepayers fund regardless of how much the resource is used. Any LNG system built in the 2020s must recover its costs before 2045 or find a way to run on low carbon fuels that are still expensive and scarce. LNG promises lower fuel costs, but comes packaged with new debt and a new fossil interface that competes directly with renewables for dispatch.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are central to this debate. I have assessed LNG production and export chains in the United States for several years. The picture is rarely what the glossy brochures present. Methane leakage from upstream fields, gathering systems, compressors, and pipelines changes the climate math. Liquefaction requires large amounts of electricity and natural gas. Shipping LNG 3,000 miles across oceans is energy intensive. Regasification adds more losses. Combustion at the plant ends the chain, but everything before the plant stacks up behind the CO₂ coming out of the stack. For US LNG export facilities feeding Asian or Pacific markets, the full lifecycle emissions often reach levels close to heavy fuel oil when methane leakage is high. In the best cases, lifecycle LNG is cleaner than oil, but the difference is narrower than many assume when upstream emissions come from basins with known leakage problems.

Hawaii’s potential LNG sources would include British Columbia and the US mainland. BC’s upstream methane performance is better than some US basins, but the liquefaction plants there still impose an energy penalty that shows up in lifecycle emissions. With US LNG exports, the upstream methane issue is likely larger. Data from independent satellite surveys and academic work on the Permian and other basins demonstrates that leakage is not well controlled. When methane leaks, the climate impact grows fast. LNG might deliver a 20% to 40% lifecycle reduction compared to residual fuel oil in a best case supply chain. It might deliver much less in a realistic case. The gap depends on upstream practice and not on anything Hawaii controls.

Local air pollution is one area where LNG delivers clear and measurable improvements. Residual fuel oil produces sulfur dioxide at levels that no modern grid should accept. It also produces particulates and metals that create real health impacts. Natural gas contains very little sulfur and burns more completely. Switching a significant share of Oahu’s generation from oil to gas would cut sulfur dioxide by orders of magnitude. It would reduce particulates and eliminate heavy metal pollution related to fuel chemistry. The health benefit is real. The same benefit also appears when oil generation is displaced by wind, solar, and battery storage, because clean generation does not produce any stack emissions at all. The local pollution case for LNG is
