[TITLE]MeitY clears Rs 5,500 crore electronic parts manufacturing investment:
[TEXT]
The Centre on Monday approved Rs 5,532 crore of investments from several companies, including Kaynes Circuits India and SRF, under the electronic component manufacturing scheme (ECMS).Among the other companies getting the federal nod include Syrma Strategic Electronics and Ascent Circuits.The companies selected in the first tranche of ECMS have committed to cumulatively produce Rs 36,559 crore of electronic components, including multi layer printed circuit boards, copper clad laminates (CCLs), optical transceivers and other electronic components, from seven projects.The approved units are spread across Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, and will create over 5,100 direct jobs. Products from these units will establish trusted supply chains for the defence, telecom, electric vehicles, and renewable energy sectors.In a key development, the new electronics manufacturing units will meet the 100% of the domestic demand for CCLs, electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said. Providing the insulating substrate and conductive copper layers, these form the basic structure for electronic circuits. Mostly imported from China, its price is now rising by 8-9% every alternate month, ET reported last month."Once we add the design input that is going into domestic value addition, combined with all the plants planned under ECMS, domestic value addition will go to about 40% over the next few years," Vaishnaw said.Upto 20% of the demand for printed circuit boards (PCB) and 15% of the demand for camera modules will also be met from the upcoming units, Vaishnaw said. Overall, 60% of the production from the approved projects is set to be exported, he added.Kaynes Circuits India Pvt Ltd, the wholly owned subsidiary of Mysuru-based Kaynes Technology Ltd has committed the highest investment, at Rs 3,280 crore for four projects. Kaynes will set up a factory in Chennai, construction for which is set to finish by March, 2026, Ramesh Kannan, Executive Vice Chairman of Kaynes Technology India Ltd said. "We will be producing multi-layered and HDI-PCBs, as well as camera modules at this unit. Copper laminates are about 24 months away, but we have lined up the partnership to set up a unit for it in Tuticorin," he said.Syrma Strategic Electronics Pvt Ltd, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Mumbai-based Syrma SGS Technology Limited will invest Rs 765 crore to produce multi layer PCBs. The investment is based in Syrma's upcoming factory in Andhra Pradesh, the groundbreaking of which will take place next month, Jasbir Singh Gujral, Managing Director of Syrma SGS said.A Rs 991 crore investment proposal by Amber group-subsidiary Ascent Circuits Pvt Ltd to manufacture PCBs in Tamil Nadu, and a Rs 496 crore proposal by SRF Limited to manufacture polypropylene film, used to produce capacitors, in Madhya Pradesh, make up the first batch of ECMS approvals.Officials said other winning applications will be announced in multiple batches going forward. "It's an ongoing process. The applications are being cleared expeditiously, based on the demand-supply dynamics in the global economy for the components in question," a MeitY official said.The Centre received 249 applications with proposed investments surpassing Rs 1,15,351 crore under ECMS, buoyed by interest from smaller manufacturers, the MeitY had announced in early-October, two days after the application deadline for ECMS closed on September 30. The response was nearly double the targeted Rs 59,350 crore under the scheme. Approved with an outlay of Rs 22,919 crore, the scheme is set to yield electronics components of about Rs 10,34,700 Crores in the next six years, 2.2-times the targeted Rs 4,56,000 crore worth of production.

[TITLE]Google expects 'significant increase' in capital expenditure in 2026, execs say:
[TEXT]
Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, June 4, 2025.

Google parent Alphabet is planning a "significant increase" in spend next year as it continues to invest in AI infrastructure to meet the demand of its customer backlog, executives said Wednesday.

The company reported its first $100 billion revenue quarter on Wednesday, beating Wall Street's expectations for Alphabet's third quarter. Executives then said that the company plans to grow its capital spend for this year.

"With the growth across our business and demand from Cloud customers, we now expect 2025 capital expenditures to be in a range of $91 billion to $93 billion," the company said in its earnings report.

It marks the second time the company increased its capital expenditure this year. In July, the company increased its expectation from $75 billion to $85 billion, most of which goes toward investments in projects like new data centers.

There'll be even more spend in 2026, executives said Wednesday.

"Looking out to 2026, we expect a significant increase in CapEx and will provide more detail on our fourth quarter earnings call," said Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet's finance chief.

The latest increases come as companies across the industry race to build more infrastructure to keep up with billions in customer demand for the compute necessary to power AI services. Also on Wednesday, Meta raised the low end of its guidance for 2025 capital expenditures by $4 billion, saying it expects that figure to come in between $70 billion and $72 billion. That figure was previously $66 billion to $72 billion.

Google executives explained that they're racing to meet demand for cloud services, which saw a 46% quarter-over-quarter growth to the backlog in the third quarter.

"We continue to drive strong growth in new businesses," CEO Sundar Pichai said. "Google Cloud accelerated, ending the quarter with $155 billion in backlog."

The company reported 32% cloud revenue growth from the year prior and is keeping pace with its megacap competitors. Pichai and Ashkenazi said the company has received more $1 billion deals in the last nine months than it had in the past two years combined.

In August, Google won a $10 billion cloud contract from Meta spanning six years. Anthropic last week announced a deal that gives the artificial intelligence company access to up to 1 million of Google's custom-designed Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs. The deal is worth tens of billions of dollars.

The spend on infrastructure is also helping the company improve its own AI products, executives said on the call.

Google's flagship AI app Gemini now has more than 650 million monthly active users. That's up from the 450 million active users Pichai reported the previous quarter.

Search also improved thanks to AI advancements, executives said. Google's search business generated $56.56 billion in revenue — up 15% from the prior year, tempering fears that the competitive AI landscape may be cannibalizing the company's core search and ads business.

AI Mode, Google's AI product that lays within its search engine, has 75 million daily active users in the U.S., and those search queries doubled over the third quarter, executives said. They also reiterated that the company is testing ads in that AI Mode product.

[TITLE]Meta forecasts bigger capital costs next year as Zuckerberg lays out aggressive AI buildout:
[TEXT]
Meta on Wednesday forecast "notably larger" capital expenses next year thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push.

The Facebook and Instagram parent reported third-quarter revenue growth of 26 per cent that beat market estimates, but that jump was outpaced by a 32 per cent increase in costs.

Shares of the company - that have risen 28 per cent so far this year - fell 8 per cent after the bell, as Wall Street digested Zuckerberg's even bigger capital plans to build out AI data center capacity that will pressure margins.

Meta also recorded a nearly $16 billion one-time charge related to U.S. President Donald Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' that pummeled its third-quarter profit. Excluding the charge, net income in the quarter would have increased to $18.64 billion, compared with the reported net income of $2.71 billion.

After a late start, Meta has doubled down on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence, a theoretical milestone where machines outthink humans. To that end, it has pledged to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build several massive AI data centers for superintelligence and is planning for bigger financial outlays to meet big compute needs.

"There's a range of timelines for when people think that we're going to get superintelligence," CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call with analysts. "I think that it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load building capacity, so that way we're prepared for the most optimistic cases."

If superintelligence takes longer than expected, then Meta will use the extra compute to accelerate its core business, and in the worst-case scenario, the company would slow building new infrastructure for some periods, he said.

"After a few years of existential hand-wringing, the company has found its rhythm again by doing what it does best: scaling attention and monetizing it with ruthless efficiency," said Jeremy Goldman, a senior director at Emarketer.

"While everyone else is still pitching AI moonshots, Meta has quietly turned AI into margin. Its ad tools are sharper, its targeting smarter, and its short-form video business is finally paying off."

HIRING SPREE BOOSTS EXPENSE OUTLOOK

Meta, determined to catch up with rivals including Microsoft and Alphabet's, has accelerated spending on AI, reorganizing its AI efforts under a "Superintelligence Labs" unit in June. Zuckerberg has personally led an aggressive spree to hire talent. The company is among the top buyers of Nvidia's sought-after AI chips.

"Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a strong start," Zuckerberg said. "I think that we've already built the lab with the highest talent density in the industry ... We're also building what we expect to be an industry-leading amount of compute."

Employee compensation costs will be the second largest contributor to the increase in costs next year to account for the compensation of employees hired throughout 2025, particularly AI talent, Meta CFO Susan Li said in a statement.

Between the three companies, plus Amazon and ChatGPT owner OpenAI, construction of AI datacenter capacity has skyrocketed. The costs to build these centers have fueled fears of an AI bubble, putting pressure on CEOs to deliver measurable results, and prompting them to find partners to help finance these outlays.

On Wednesday, Alphabet and Microsoft also signaled higher AI investments. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Tuesday said he would eventually like the company to be able to add 1 gigawatt of compute every week - an astronomical sum given that each gigawatt currently comes with a capital cost of more than $40 billion.

Meta also boosted the lower end of its capital expenditure outlook to between $70 billion and $72 billion this year, compared with its prior forecast of $66 billion to $72 billion.

"Meta's earnings reveal the growing tension between the company's massive AI infrastructure investments and investor expectations for near-term returns, with rising spending on artificial intelligence capabilities weighing on sentiment despite solid underlying business performance," said Jesse Cohen, a senior analyst at Investing.com.

MASSIVE USER BASE FUELS AD REVENUE

Meta continues to benefit from its massive user base. The company's powerful AI-optimized ad platform helps marketers automate campaigns, improve the quality of video ads, translate ads and generate persona-based images to target different customer segments.

The company estimates that more than 3.5 billion people used at least one of its apps on a daily basis last month.

The company has launched ads on its messaging platform WhatsApp and social network Threads, directly competing with platforms such as Elon Musk's X, while Instagram's Reels continue to jostle with ByteDance's TikTok and YouTube Shorts for ad revenue in the short-video market.

Meta said it expects fourth-quarter revenue between $56 billion and $59 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $57.25 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

[TITLE]Transportation awards Google major contract after ‘OneGov’ deal:
[TEXT]
The Department of Transportation has inked a deal for Google’s Workspace software suite using discounted rates made possible through the company’s April ‘OneGov’ agreement with the General Services Administration.

According to contracting documents obtained by Nextgov/FCW, Transportation awarded the five-year enterprise license agreement on Sept. 27 to deliver Google Workspace across the department via prime contractor Carahsoft.

The contract has a total ceiling value of up to $89 million and will ultimately provide the department — which has more than 50,000 employees across the country — access to Google Workspace’s cloud-native apps like Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Meet and more, as well as popular AI tools Gemini and NotebookLM.

Google declined to comment for this story and the Transportation Department was unable to comment due to the government shutdown.

In early April, Google became the first company to negotiate an agreement with GSA through its OneGov strategy, which essentially treats government customers as a single large purchaser. Google offered a temporary 71% discount on Workspace through Sept. 30 for government customers, a discount Transportation took advantage of in this deal. More than a dozen tech companies followed Google’s lead in negotiating OneGov deals and discounting billions of dollars’ worth of software to government customers, many for a limited period of time.

“We’re excited to see agencies using the OneGov offerings to help deliver on their missions while also saving taxpayer dollars,” Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum said in a statement to Nextgov/FCW. “This outcome shows how diversity in the federal marketplace yields efficiency, prioritizing American taxpayers first.”

Transportation’s Workspace deal could be a harbinger of more widespread government adoption for Google, which launched its Google Public Sector division more than three years ago specifically to target government business.

While the Google Workspace suite is used by several large agencies, including GSA, the Energy Department and Air Force Research Laboratory, Microsoft’s 365 suite has been the dominant productivity and communications software across the federal government for more than a decade. Contracting documents indicate Transportation and its component agencies, like the Federal Aviation Administration, have long used Microsoft 365 for collaboration and communication needs. It’s unclear how this new deal with Google will impact its Microsoft relationship.

In a late June interview with Nextgov/FCW, Transportation Chief Information Officer Pavan Pidugu laid out his vision for the department's IT operations, focusing on process improvements, people and products. Pidugu said he wanted to remove shadow IT across the department, get rid of redundant IT systems, speed up acquisitions and shift the department and its it staff toward becoming a product-focused organization.

Karoline Leavitt Calls Indian Trucker Illegal Alien After Deadly California Road Accident Kill Three

US transportation secretary Sean Duffy warned Sunday that he is about make good on a threat to revoke millions in federal funds for California because he says the state is illegally issuing commercial driver's licenses to non-citizens.In an appearance on Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures," Duffy said governor Gavin Newsom has refused to comply with department of transportation rules that require the state to stop issuing such licenses and review those already issued. His statement came after investigations into two recent fatal crashes involving Sikh drivers showed widespread malpractice in issuance of commercial driving licences (CDLs)."So, one, I'm about to pull $160 million from California," Duffy said. "And, as we pull more money, we also have the option of pulling California's ability to issue commercial driver's licenses."Eva Spiegel, a spokesperson for California's department of motor vehicles, said the Trump administration "has no legitimate basis" to withhold federal highway transportation funds. "The federal govt previously allowed commercial driver's licences for asylum seekers and refugees and on Sept 26 announced emergency regulations to cease this practice that went into effect on Sept 29.California is in compliance with these regulations and will remain in compliance with federal law. "When Duffy threatened to revoke funds last month, a spokesperson for Newsom dismissed the attack and noted that CDL holders from California have a significantly lower rate of crashes than both the national average and that of Texas, which is the only state with more licenced commercial drivers.Duffy said California has unlawfully issued tens of thousands of these licences to non-citizens. Duffy said earlier he would withhold $40 million from California as it is failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers. agencies

Iran, Russia to sign key deal on construction of Rasht-Astara railway next month: Minister

Iran Press TV

Monday, 27 October 2025 6:12 AM

Iran's Minister of Roads and Urban Development Farzaneh Sadeq says Iran and Russia are to sign a long-anticipated agreement on the construction of the Rasht-Astara railway.

Sadeq said on Sunday that the agreement will be signed next month, marking a major step in advancing the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC).

The 162-kilometer strategic transport corridor is expected to facilitate freight and cargo transit between Iran, Russia, and Azerbaijan.

On October 2, Iran and Russia started officially to implement a 20-year Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty, signed by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Moscow on January 17, 2025.

The deal signaled a significant step towards deepening bilateral ties between the two countries in various fields.

The minister noted that she paid visits to Azerbaijan and Pakistan over the past two weeks in line with Iran's active diplomacy to promote interactions with the neighboring countries, particularly through the key role of transportation in regional interaction.

Sadeq said her recent talks in Baku on transit guarantees, particularly in the Rasht-Astara railway project, were well beyond initial expectations.

She further noted that her recent talks in Pakistan centered on establishing a connection between Pakistan and Eurasian and Caucasian countries via Iran, and a connection between China and Iran through Pakistan and transportation of goods from China to Iran and finally to Europe via Pakistan.

The minister said that transport infrastructure plays a role in the development of regional relations, adding, "The expansion of highways and railway infrastructure can play an effective role in facilitating Iran's relations with neighboring countries," she emphasized.

She said restrictions and tough sanctions have failed to hinder development projects over the past year.

[TITLE]Bridger Aerospace Secures $331 Million in New Financing Commitments to Fuel Growth and Fleet Expansion:
[TEXT]
BELGRADE, Mont., Oct. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings, Inc. (“Bridger”, “the Company” or “Bridger Aerospace”), (NASDAQ: BAER, BAERW), one of the nation’s largest aerial firefighting companies, today announced a significant financial milestone with a new senior secured facility of up to $331.5 million led by Bain Capital’s Private Credit Group (“Bain Capital”). In addition, in a separate announcement filed yesterday, the Company said it finalized its previously announced sale-leaseback of its Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport campus facilities.

Together, these transactions refinance Bridger’s $160 million municipal bond with Gallatin County, consolidate the Company’s existing debt, and provide significant capacity and financial flexibility through a delayed draw facility designed to fund future fleet expansion.

“This financing marks a turning point for Bridger,” Sam Davis, Bridger’s CEO shared. “Our strong quarterly results and our expectations for a second record year have made it possible for us to refinance our existing debt and enter into a new expanded debt facility with increased capacity. We believe this new facility significantly enhances our ability to grow organically. It provides financial flexibility for new aircraft purchases to support contract expansion that will drive EBITDA growth and long-term shareholder value. Bridger’s federal, state, and defense contracts have established our revenue model on a year-round basis. As a result, this financing and the simultaneous sale-leaseback of our campus demonstrates Bridger’s focus on financial resilience to address the evolution of our business.”

The $331.5M Senior Secured Credit Facility consists of a $21.5M Revolving Credit Facility, $210M Senior Secured Term Loan, and a $100M Fleet Expansion Facility.

Davis added. “As we expand our contracts and optimize our fleet, we are grateful for our strategic partners Bain Capital, Crestline, Power Sustainable, and Foundation Credit who are helping us take decisive steps towards making our vision for Bridger Aerospace a reality. Bridger continues to build on its long-term vision, and we believe this financing strengthens our ability to innovate and deploy the most advanced technology in our industry; yet, most importantly, this transaction equips us to continue delivering on our mission to protect lives, property, critical infrastructure, and the environment.”

“We are proud to support Bridger’s next phase of growth as they continue to lead the way in innovative wildfire solutions,” said David Healey, a Managing Director at Bain Capital. “Our investment reflects our confidence in the Company’s long-term vision, leadership, and ability to deliver value-added and mission-critical services to federal, state, and local governments while helping to revolutionize how our country fights wildfire.”

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated served as Sole Debt Placement Agent and Financial Advisor on the transaction, and Crestline Direct Finance, L.P. (“Crestline”) served as Joint Lead Arranger on the transaction.

Australian company Hypersonix secures major defence and aerospace investment for green hydrogen hypersonic flight

by Simon Mansfield

Sydney, Australia (SPX) Oct 28, 2025

Hypersonix Launch Systems, based in Brisbane, recently completed a $46 million Series A funding round led by High Tor Capital of the UK, with support from Saab and RKKVC, as well as participation by the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation (NRFC) and Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC). The investment will accelerate the development of reusable hydrogen-powered hypersonic aircraft designed for defence and aerospace missions. Hypersonix employs 45 specialists in engineering, manufacturing, and testing.

The Series A round marks NRFC's first investment in the defence sector and aims to strengthen domestic capability in hypersonic and counter-hypersonic technologies for Australia and allied nations. QIC Ventures described the company's technology as a significant advancement for allies requiring faster, more frequent flight capability through hydrogen propulsion.

Founded in 2019, Hypersonix develops flight systems powered by green hydrogen. Its SPARTAN scramjet engine, which reaches Mach 12 and has no moving parts, was invented by co-founder Dr Michael Smart. Unlike kerosene-fuelled engines, SPARTAN eliminates CO2 emissions and reduces maintenance by relying on hydrogen fuel. Dr Smart emphasized the importance of building clean and reusable aerospace platforms with applications in real operational environments, while co-founder David Waterhouse stated the capital raise marks a pivotal moment for Australian aerospace development.

CEO Matt Hill highlighted that this funding supports both national and allied defence priorities and enables Hypersonix to launch the world's first hydrogen-powered hypersonic aircraft. Chairman Arthur Sinodinos, former US Ambassador and Australian Minister, said the investment demonstrates support for local leadership in next-generation aerospace and sovereign industrial capability.

Proceeds from the round will fund a NASA-backed test flight of the DART AE vehicle, powered by SPARTAN, with operations under the US Department of Defense HyCAT program via the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). Hypersonix was selected as the first contract for HyCAT from a pool of more than 60 companies. The project aims to demonstrate the world's first sustained hypersonic flight using green hydrogen.

Additional funds will build advanced manufacturing facilities in Queensland and advance development of VISR, an 8-metre-long, reusable hydrogen-fuelled aircraft equipped with four SPARTAN engines and ceramic matrix composites for sustained hypersonic flight, supporting intelligence, surveillance, rapid delivery, and space system testing.
