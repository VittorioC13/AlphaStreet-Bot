[TITLE]J.P. Morgan Doubles Down on 2 Healthcare Facility Stocks:
[TEXT]
The first JPM pick we’re looking at here is Concentra Group Holdings, the largest outpatient provider of occupational health services in the US market. The company’s services include physical exams, physical therapy, tests and screenings, and onsite workplace clinics. Concentra traces its roots to 1979, and in its current incarnation boasts a market cap of $2.65 billion, employs a network of 11,000 health professionals, physicians, clinicians, and support personnel, and its network can see more than 50,000 patients every day.

We’ve turned to the TipRanks database to see how the broader Wall Street community views them as well. Let’s dive in.

Building on this thesis, Rossi has highlighted two healthcare facility stocks he sees as well-positioned to thrive under these conditions. These companies, the analyst argues, can protect their business models while capitalizing on strong secular demand.

“The group shares favorable secular tailwinds derived from 1) an aging population in the U.S. that is increasing in aggregate acuity; 2) payer preference given cost savings potential on the lower cost of care within outpatient settings vs traditional inpatient; and 3) patient preference given ease of access. Collectively, these names also operate in fragmented industries possessing sizable market opportunities, with M&A serving as a meaningful growth lever and lower leverage allowing for greater optionality on upside opportunities,” Rossi noted.

Against this backdrop, J.P. Morgan analyst Benjamin Rossi sees the current outpatient landscape as especially favorable for healthcare facility stocks with less exposure to federal reimbursements, given both the OBBBA-driven changes to Medicaid and the continuing rate pressure in Medicare.

In fact, the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ that Trump recently signed into law contains several provisions that cut back on Medicaid spending, including stricter checks on eligibility, as well as work requirements for eligibility, along with reductions in federal Medicaid grant funding to the states. Medicaid isn’t likely to disappear, but the program is likely to see substantial changes.

[TITLE]Billions in congressional funding stalled as White House delays threaten healthcare, education, and social programs:
[TEXT]
Executive overreach and congressional authority

Reuters

Hidden cuts and political strategy

Reuters

Impact on communities

US federal agencies are facing a crisis as billions of dollars approved by Congress for healthcare, education, and social services remain unspent, raising concerns over executive overreach and potential disruption to essential programs. Advocacy group Protect Democracy warns that these withheld funds could undermine initiatives designed to support vulnerable communities and critical public services.The frozen allocations include over $2.5 billion for higher education programs aimed at low-income, first-generation, and community college students, as well as $2.6 billion for substance abuse prevention and recovery initiatives. Experts say delays in disbursing these funds strain local systems, leaving communities scrambling to meet urgent needs.Critics contend that the Trump administration’s approach, effectively delaying or redirecting funds without congressional approval, violates the Constitution’s allocation powers. “If you allow the president to override the will of Congress with their funding bills, that can come back to haunt you as soon as the next administration comes in,” said Dr. Casey Burgat, director of George Washington University’s Legislative Affairs programme to theSenators across party lines, including Susan Collins and Cory Booker, have urged the administration to release funding for State Department educational and cultural programs already approved by Congress. US Senator Tammy Baldwin called the delays “illegal withholding” of taxpayer money, warning that vital services in healthcare and education could suffer severe setbacks.According to Protect Democracy, the administration is using a “backdoor” strategy to enact cuts preemptively, bypassing congressional debate. Cerin Lindgrensavage, the organization’s legal counsel, explained to, “The cuts fall in areas where the administration has proposed reductions for next year, but they are making them happen now without going to Congress.”Republican leaders, controlling both chambers, have largely remained silent on these last-minute spending delays, focusing political energy instead on blaming Democrats for potential government funding standoffs. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are working to safeguard federal grants while negotiating broader healthcare and education funding measures.Program directors and advocacy groups highlight the immediate consequences of stalled funds. “These funds are a lifeline for communities on the front lines of the overdose crisis,” said Libby Jones of the Global Health Advocacy Incubator. Without timely disbursement, programs designed to prevent substance abuse, support college enrollment, and assist low-income students face unprecedented operational stress.With billions of federal dollars effectively in limbo, legal experts warn that the administration’s tactics set a dangerous precedent for future governance, potentially eroding Congress’s authority over spending while putting essential public services at risk.

[TITLE]Harrow to Acquire Melt Pharmaceuticals:
[TEXT]
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Harrow (Nasdaq: HROW), a leading provider of ophthalmic disease management solutions in North America, today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Melt Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company pioneering non-opioid, non-IV therapies for sedation for medical procedures in the hospital, outpatient, and in-office settings. The closing of this acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by Melt stockholders, excluding Harrow and Harrow-affiliated parties.

Melt’s lead investigational therapy, MELT-300, is a patented, sublingually delivered formulation of a fixed dose of midazolam (3mg) and ketamine (50mg) designed to provide rapid, predictable sedation and analgesia without the need for intravenous administration. This innovative approach has the potential to transform patient experiences across a wide range of office-based and outpatient procedures and address the healthcare system’s growing demand to reduce exposure to opioids.

In November 2024, Melt announced positive topline results from its pivotal LOUISE ( L ower O pioid U se and I mprove the S edation E xperience) Phase 3 Study, which demonstrated that MELT-300 was statistically superior to both sublingual midazolam alone (P=0.009) and placebo (P=<0.0001) in providing successful procedural sedation. In addition, the proportion of patients requiring rescue sedation was nearly twice as high for sublingual midazolam compared with MELT-300 (P=0.003).

The LOUISE Phase 3 Study was conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), which confirmed the study design would adequately support a future regulatory submission. Further, results from a recently completed cardiac safety study indicated that MELT-300 did not alter normal heart rhythm, supporting the therapy’s safety profile.

Harrow plans to submit a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA in 2027, with a potential U.S. commercial launch in 2028.

Strategic Rationale

Immediately Accretive Launch : Harrow, through its ImprimisRx subsidiary, has successfully marketed the MKO Melt ® , a compounded sublingual sedation product widely used by ophthalmologists for more than a decade, with the product used in over 500,000 cataract surgeries. This long-standing, positive experience, by over 700 U.S. ophthalmologists, provides a strong foundation of physician trust and market familiarity with this mode of sedation delivery. Upon FDA approval of MELT-300, Harrow intends to ensure customer access to an FDA-approved product and discontinue the MKO Melt.

Upon FDA approval of MELT-300, Harrow intends to ensure customer access to an FDA-approved product and discontinue the MKO Melt. Market Opportunity : Entry into the multi-billion-dollar U.S. procedural sedation market. MELT-300’s novel formulation has the potential to replace and/or supplement IV sedation in medical interventions, with applications in ophthalmic surgery and potential label expansion opportunities into tens of millions of other procedures annually, including claustrophobia during MRIs, sedation for colonoscopies, dental procedures, gastroenterology procedures, and other interventions.

Added Diversification : Strengthens Harrow’s perioperative portfolio of surgical solutions and diversifies Harrow’s business as MELT-300 is utilized outside of its core US ophthalmic business.

: Harrow’s existing commercial and regulatory infrastructure provides the scale to accelerate Melt’s market introduction and potential to replace opioid-based intravenous sedation during the more than 4,000,000 annual U.S. cataract surgeries. Improved Patient Experience : MELT-300's under-the-tongue delivery, using Catalent’s ZYDIS ® oral dissolving tablet technology – which is used in over 35 FDA-approved products – offers a less invasive, needle-free, non-opioid option that could reduce anxiety, improve comfort, and simplify care.

Expanded Accessibility : Enables physicians to perform procedures comfortably in office and outpatient settings, reducing reliance on operating rooms.

: Enables physicians to perform procedures comfortably in office and outpatient settings, reducing reliance on operating rooms. Global Application: The MELT 300 product candidate has patents issued in North America, Australia, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Harrow intends to identify suitable development and commercialization partners to make this technology available outside the U.S. market.

“We are excited to welcome Melt Pharmaceuticals back into the Harrow family. This acquisition represents another important step in our mission to deliver innovative, patient-focused ophthalmic disease management solutions that go beyond the limitations of traditional care,” said Mark L. Baum, Chief Executive Officer of Harrow. “MELT-300 has the potential to redefine the standard of care for millions of patients by providing a convenient, non-opioid alternative for procedural sedation. By reducing reliance on opioids, MELT-300 not only addresses a critical public health need but also opens the door to significant market expansion opportunities across a wide range of medical procedures. With this acquisition, Harrow continues to strengthen its pipeline of transformative therapies and reinforces our commitment to improving outcomes for patients and providers alike.”

Larry Dillaha, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Melt Pharmaceuticals, added, “Sedation hasn’t changed much over the past few decades. Having demonstrated the clinical superiority of the MELT-300 drug candidate over its individual components, including midazolam, we believe the standards of care for sedation will change when the MELT-300 drug candidate is FDA-approved. By re-joining Harrow, we gain the resources and expertise needed to accelerate our programs and bring MELT-300 closer to the patients and physicians who need it most. Together, we are committed to transforming the state of the art in the massive US and global procedural sedation market.”

[TITLE]Sparrow Pharmaceuticals Announces $95 Million Series B Financing to Advance Targeted Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes:
[TEXT]
PORTLAND, Ore., Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sparrow Pharmaceuticals, a targeted cardiometabolic therapeutics company, today announced the close of a $95 million Series B financing. The round was co-led by RA Capital Management and Forbion with participation from existing investors including OrbiMed, RiverVest, and US Venture Partners. In conjunction with the financing, Zach Scheiner from RA and Nanna Lüneborg from Forbion have joined Sparrow’s Board of Directors.

The proceeds will support development of the company’s lead candidate clofutriben for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with elevated cortisol (EC). Based on strong biological rationale and rising clinical recognition, Sparrow is deploying a new mechanism to target a distinct population whose poor response to current T2D treatments is linked to excess cortisol. The company has advanced clofutriben into a Phase 2b trial in T2D with EC (CAPTAIN-T2D) with results expected in 2027.

“Nearly half of patients with difficult-to-control diabetes display increased cardiometabolic risk associated with elevated cortisol, yet there are no therapies approved for the vast majority of patients with T2D that address this underlying etiology,” said Frank Czerwiec, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer. “Prospective studies confirm what endocrinologists have long believed: excess cortisol can drive hyperglycemia by increasing gluconeogenesis, decreasing glucose uptake and disposal, and decreasing insulin synthesis and sensitivity, and thereby also impair the effectiveness of standard-of-care treatments. By directly targeting this causal and multifaceted biology, clofutriben may offer new hope for patients underserved by current therapies.”

“We are grateful to our investors whose support reflects strong conviction in Sparrow’s strategy and the clinical promise of clofutriben,” said Robert Jacks, President & Chief Executive Officer. “Elevated cortisol is now recognized as a key driver of disease progression and treatment resistance in millions of patients with type 2 diabetes worldwide. Our decision to focus on this patient population reflects a convergence of emerging biological insights, immense clinical opportunity, and payer and clinician receptivity. This significant financial commitment could enable the next big breakthrough in the management of metabolic syndrome.”

Clofutriben is a once-daily, oral HSD-1 inhibitor that modulates intracellular cortisol production in key metabolic tissues, a novel mechanism of action that has the potential to complement existing anti-diabetic therapies. In clinical trials, the candidate has shown improved glycemic control, including in individuals with elevated cortisol, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile and no evidence of adrenal insufficiency or requirement for dose titration. As an added possible benefit, HSD-1 inhibitors, including clofutriben, have also shown potential in clinical trials for improvement in weight and body composition, lipids, blood pressure, and markers of bone metabolism, as well as sleep and quality of life, as elevated cortisol contributes to a spectrum of metabolic dysfunction beyond poor glycemic control.

[TITLE]Billions in congressional funding stalled as White House delays threaten healthcare, education, and social programs:

Executive overreach and congressional authority

Hidden cuts and political strategy

Reuters

Impact on communities

US federal agencies are facing a crisis as billions of dollars approved by Congress for healthcare, education, and social services remain unspent, raising concerns over executive overreach and potential disruption to essential programs. Advocacy group Protect Democracy warns that these withheld funds could undermine initiatives designed to support vulnerable communities and critical public services.The frozen allocations include over $2.5 billion for higher education programs aimed at low-income, first-generation, and community college students, as well as $2.6 billion for substance abuse prevention and recovery initiatives. Experts say delays in disbursing these funds strain local systems, leaving communities scrambling to meet urgent needs.Critics contend that the Trump administration’s approach, effectively delaying or redirecting funds without congressional approval, violates the Constitution’s allocation powers. “If you allow the president to override the will of Congress with their funding bills, that can come back to haunt you as soon as the next administration comes in,” said Dr. Casey Burgat, director of George Washington University’s Legislative Affairs programme to theSenators across party lines, including Susan Collins and Cory Booker, have urged the administration to release funding for State Department educational and cultural programs already approved by Congress. US Senator Tammy Baldwin called the delays “illegal withholding” of taxpayer money, warning that vital services in healthcare and education could suffer severe setbacks.According to Protect Democracy, the administration is using a “backdoor” strategy to enact cuts preemptively, bypassing congressional debate. Cerin Lindgrensavage, the organization’s legal counsel, explained to, “The cuts fall in areas where the administration has proposed reductions for next year, but they are making them happen now without going to Congress.”Republican leaders, controlling both chambers, have largely remained silent on these last-minute spending delays, focusing political energy instead on blaming Democrats for potential government funding standoffs. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are working to safeguard federal grants while negotiating broader healthcare and education funding measures.Program directors and advocacy groups highlight the immediate consequences of stalled funds. “These funds are a lifeline for communities on the front lines of the overdose crisis,” said Libby Jones of the Global Health Advocacy Incubator. Without timely disbursement, programs designed to prevent substance abuse, support college enrollment, and assist low-income students face unprecedented operational stress.With billions of federal dollars effectively in limbo, legal experts warn that the administration’s tactics set a dangerous precedent for future governance, potentially eroding Congress’s authority over spending while putting essential public services at risk.

The #1 Waster of Healthcare Dollars and How to Stop It

American Thinker ^ | 09/26/25 | By Deane Waldman

Posted on by SeekAndFind

As Democrats threaten government shut-down over Medicaid cuts; as Americans are bracing for another increase in their healthcare costs; and as patients wait an average maximum of 132 days to see a primary care doctor, Americans can’t seem to wake up from the nightmare called U.S. healthcare.

The rise in insurance premium costs is estimated at 7–10 percent next year. This is on top of already unaffordable family spending with the average American family expending $32,066 on healthcare in 2024 according to Milliman Medical Index.

Faced with increasing pressure on their bottom lines, employers are passing these additional expenses on to employees with reduced benefits, narrower medical panels (which means longer wait times), plus higher deductibles and copays.

Republicans plan cuts to Medicaid that Democrats and the complicit media say these cuts will “hurt families,” “increase uncompensated care,” “and lead to thousands of deaths.” Biden’s 2021–2023 lockdowns threw millions of people out of work. Unemployment made them ineligible for employer-supported health insurance. Biden then expanded eligibility, adding 17 million Americans to Medicaid rolls. More than 60 percent of these individuals have returned to work and become (again) eligible for employer-provided insurance. Cutting them from Medicaid rolls will actually increase funds available to pay for those who truly need Medicaid.
