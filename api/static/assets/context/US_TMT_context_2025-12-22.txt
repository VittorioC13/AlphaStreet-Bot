Trump Media & Technology to merge with fusion energy company TAE in $6 billion deal. Here's why.

CBS News ^ | 12/18/2025 | Alain Sherter, Aimee Picchi

Posted on by SeekAndFind

Trump Media & Technology is merging with fusion energy company TAE Technologies in a deal worth more than $6 billion, aiming to harness the fledgling technology to power energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.

TAE, which is privately owned, is developing technology aimed at producing energy by fusing atomic nuclei. Trump Media & Technology owns President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform.

The merger comes amid a difficult year for Trump Media shares, which trade under the ticker DJT — the same as Mr. Trump's initials. Through Wednesday, the stock was down 69% for the year, even as the S&P 500 had gained 14%.

After the merger was announced Thursday morning, Trump Media shares jumped $3.37, or 32%, to $13.84.

Trump Media's strategic shift

More recently, the company has pivoted beyond its roots as a tech business. Earlier this year, Trump Media struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency, and it has also rolled out investment funds with "America-first" strategies.

The merger with TAE represents a continuation of Trump Media's "America first" principles, former California lawmaker Devin Nunes, now chief executive of Trump Media, said in a Thursday conference call with investors.

"Fusion power will lower energy prices, bolster our national defense and secure the energy needed to guarantee America's dominance of AI technology," Nunes said on the call.

He added, "This combination positions the combined company to help lead the global AI revolution and kickstart an American energy renaissance."

I think this is a bridge tooooo far Westinghouse already solved the problem Westinghouse isn't putting a big reactor in a trailer, but they're developing eVinci™ Microreactors, which are factory-built, small nuclear batteries about the size of a school bus or shipping container, designed for remote power, mining, data centers, and even space, offering clean energy for 10+ years without refueling, relying on heat pipes and passive safety for deployment in containerized units that can power off-grid locations or supplement grids, a key step towards mobile nuclear power

We have Fusion Power available locally on da Erf at night? Yeah, fusion exists on the Sun, and the Sun shares the power during the day, we grab it into batteries for night. The way I see it, the merger is Trump's quest to use fusion to create gold from lesser elements. He needs more to decorate his accomodations.

A powerful rebound in tech dealmaking

Despite a forbidding backdrop of geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty, technology M&A has hit the accelerator. In the third quarter of 2025, transactions in the tech, media and telecom (TMT) sector reached $256 billion, a 51% jump on the previous quarter. The scale of the rebound is significant in a market that only recently seemed stuck in neutral.

The resurgence has been led by very large transactions. Deals worth $1 billion or more accounted for $220 billion of Q3 2025 value, spread across 37 mega-deals. The largest of these was the $55 billion takeover of Electronic Arts by a consortium including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, which alone absorbed more than a fifth of quarterly tech deal value. Buyers are once again prepared to commit serious capital. Yet, in an age of anxiety

The suspension of the “technology prosperity deal” comes amid rising frustration in Washington over the progress of trade discussions with the U.K., the Financial Times reported Monday (Dec. 15).

The deal, announced in September during President Donald Trump’s trip to the U.K., is designed to promote collaboration between the countries on artificial intelligence, nuclear energy and quantum computing, according to the report.

The U.S. suspended the deal last week, the report said, citing unnamed U.K. officials. The White House is lobbying for concessions from the U.K. on trade areas beyond the scope of the agreement, formed in response to tariffs on U.K. goods.

The U.S. became frustrated with the lack of willingness from the U.K. to deal with “non-tariff barriers,” such as rules and regulations on food and industrial goods, the report said, citing unnamed sources.

Although the U.K. agreed to allow 13,000 tons of U.S. beef to enter the country free of tariffs each year, the trade deal said the two sides would continue to work together to improve market access for more U.S. agricultural products, according to the report.

The U.S. has for years pushed the U.K. to recognize American food and agricultural product standards, although there were no specific commitments included in the deal, per the report.

Meanwhile, Trump has criticized the digital services tax imposed on tech companies by U.S. trading partners. However, one U.K. official denied that this tax, which affects American tech companies, was a serious issue, according to the report.

“The digital services tax is a red herring,” the official said, per the report. “We are down to negotiating some of the most difficult issues. Both sides expect this to take some time. But the dialogue remains open, active and constructive.”

The trade deal was accompanied by a $1.6 billion investment from financial companies, including PayPal, Bank of America and Citigroup, with commitments to create 1,800 jobs in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

“Strengthening ties with the U.S. boosts our economy, creates jobs and secures our role in global finance, delivering on our Plan for Change,” U.K. Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said in September. “These investments reflect the strength of our enduring ‘golden corridor’ with one of our closest trading partners, ahead of the U.S. presidential state visit.”

[TITLE]Nvidia buys AI software provider SchedMD to expand open-source AI push:
[TEXT]
Dec 15 (Reuters) - Nvidia said on Monday it acquired AI software firm SchedMD, as the chip designer doubles down on open-source technology ​and steps up investments in the artificial intelligence ecosystem to fend off ‌rising competition.

The chip designer built its reputation on speedy chips, but it also offers a range ‌of its own AI models, from physics simulations to self-driving vehicles, as open-source software that researchers and companies can use.

Its proprietary CUDA software, a standard among most developers, is a major selling point for its chips, making software key to ⁠maintaining its dominance in the ‌AI industry.

Nvidia shares were up 1.35% after the news and an earlier announcement of new open-source AI models.

SchedMD provides software ‍that helps schedule large computing jobs that can occupy a big share of a data center's server capacity.

Its technology, called Slurm, is open source, meaning developers and firms can ​access it for free, while the company sells engineering and maintenance support.

Financial terms ‌of the deal were not disclosed. Nvidia said it would continue to distribute SchedMD's software on an open-source basis.

"Slurm, which is supported on the latest Nvidia hardware, is also part of the critical infrastructure needed for generative AI, used by foundation model developers and AI builders to manage model training and inference ⁠needs," Nvidia said in a blog post.

Earlier ​on Monday, Nvidia unveiled a new family of ​open-source AI models that it says will be faster, cheaper and smarter than its previous offerings, as it faces a growing wave ‍of rival open-source ⁠models from Chinese AI labs.

SchedMD was founded in 2010 by Slurm software developers Morris "Moe" Jette and Danny Auble in Livermore, California, and the company ⁠currently employs 40 people, according to its website.

Its customers include cloud infrastructure firm CoreWeave and ‌the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, among others.

[TITLE]Nigeria's ICT Sector Generates N9.44tn in Broadband Push:
[TEXT]
The Information and Communication Technology sector contributed N9.44tn to the economy in the third quarter of 2025, indicating heightened conversation around broadband expansion.

This came as stakeholders called for improved subsea capacity with inland distribution, elimination of wasteful infrastructure duplication, and a commitment to local manufacturing.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics’ Gross Domestic Product report, under the ICT industry, the telecommunications and information services subsector led with N7.47tn, representing a 1.22 per cent year-on-year growth from the N7.38tn recorded in Q3 2024. However, the Q3 2025 performance fell 3.95 per cent from the N7.78tn recorded in the second quarter of 2025.

Other significant contributors include broadcasting, which generated N1.04tn, and the motion pictures, sound recording, and music production subsector, which contributed N911.77bn. Publishing recorded N18.6bn. These figures highlighted the sector’s immense economic weight as stakeholders increasingly demand aggressive broadband expansion to sustain growth and drive national development.

Despite these multibillion-naira contributions, stakeholders have noted that Nigeria still needs to bridge the digital divide to realise the full potential of the sector and spur widespread growth.

Notably, urban centres like Lagos enjoy relatively stable connectivity, while vast swathes of the country struggle with digital connectivity. Industry leaders argue that the current economic output represents only a fraction of what the nation could achieve if the government successfully bridges the infrastructure gap between the coastal landing points and the hinterland.

In an interview with The PUNCH, the President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Leye Kupoluyi, described broadband penetration as a fundamental economic infrastructure for the youth and the broader economy. He noted that while Lagos maintains a fair level of connectivity, the sub-national governments must ensure that the “hinterland” benefits from similar investments.

“Broadband penetration is a form of economic infrastructure for young people and for the whole economy, too. It’s good in Lagos, but how much of it has gone to the hinterland? The sub-national governments have to see that broadband penetration in every nook and cranny of Nigeria is very important to economic growth, including our input on agriculture, security, and food production,” Kupoluyi said.

He linked digital connectivity to the survival of the agricultural sector, which remains one of Nigeria’s largest employers. He argued that the value-added potential of Nigerian cash crops, which currently stands at

[TITLE]US tech enabled China’s surveillance empire. Now Tibetan refugees in Nepal are paying the price:
[TEXT]
The white dome of Boudhanath rises like a silent guardian over the chaotic sprawl of Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, crowned by a golden spire that pierces the sky. Painted on each of the spire’s four sides are the benevolent eyes of the Buddha — wide, calm, and unblinking — said to see all that unfolds below.

Those eyes have served as a symbol of sanctuary for generations of Tibetans fleeing the Chinese crackdown in their homeland. But today, Tibetan refugees are also watched by far more malevolent eyes: Thousands of CCTV cameras from China, perched on street corners and rooftops to monitor every movement below. This intense surveillance has stifled the once-vibrant Free Tibet movement that had resonated around the world.

Nepal is just one of at least 150 countries to which Chinese companies are supplying surveillance technology, from cameras in Vietnam to censorship firewalls in Pakistan to citywide monitoring systems in Kenya. This technology is now a key part of China’s push for global influence, as it provides cash-strapped governments cost-effective, if invasive, forms of policing — turning algorithms and data into a force multiplier for control.

The irony at the heart of this digital authoritarianism is that the surveillance tools China exports are based on technology developed in its greatest rival, the United States, despite warnings that Chinese firms would buy, copy or outright steal American designs, an investigation by The Associated Press has found.

For decades, Silicon Valley firms often yielded to Beijing’s demands: Give us your technology and we will give you access to our market. Although tensions fester between Washington and Beijing, the links between American tech and Chinese surveillance continue today.

For example, Amazon Web Services offers cloud services to Chinese tech giants like Hikvision and Dahua, assisting them in their overseas push. Both are on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Entity List for national security and human-rights concerns, which means transactions with them are not illegal but subject to strict restrictions.

AWS told AP it adheres to ethical codes of conduct, complies with U.S. law, and does not itself offer surveillance infrastructure. Dahua said they conduct due diligence to prevent abuse of their products. Hikvision said the same, and that they “categorically reject any suggestion that the company is involved in or complicit in repression.”

Chinese technology firms now offer a complete suite of telecommunications, surveillance, and digital infrastructure, with few restrictions on who they sell to or how they’re used.

China pitches itself as a global security model with low crime rates, contrasting its record with the United States, said Sheena Greitens, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.

“It’s got a set of solutions that it’s happy to share with the world that nobody else can offer,” she said. “(But) they’re certainly exporting the tools and techniques that are very important to authoritarian rule.”

The AP investigation was based on thousands of Nepali government procurement documents, corporate marketing material, leaked government and corporate documents, and interviews with more than 40 people, including Tibetan refugees and Nepali, American and Chinese engineers, executives, experts and officials.

While thousands of Tibetans once fled to Nepal every year, the number is now down to the single digits, according to Tibetan officials in Nepal. In a statement to AP, the Tibetan government in exile cited tight border controls, Nepal’s warming ties with China and “unprecedented surveillance” as reasons for the drastic plunge.

A 2021 internal Nepali government report, obtained by AP, revealed that China has even built surveillance systems within Nepal and in some areas of the border buffer zone where construction is banned by bilateral agreements. In a statement to AP, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied coercing Western companies to hand over technology or working with Nepal to surveil Tibetans, calling it a “sheer fabrication driven by ulterior motives.”

“Attempts to use Tibet-related issues to interfere in China’s internal affairs, smear China’s image, and poison the atmosphere of China-Nepal cooperation will never succeed,” the statement said.

The Nepali government and the Chinese-controlled Tibetan authorities did not respond to requests for comment.

Under pressure, many Tibetans are responding the only way they can: Leaving. The Tibetan population in Nepal has plunged from over 20,000 to half that or less today.

Former activist Sonam Tashi gave up protesting years ago. Now 49, today he’s just a father trying to get his 10-year-old son out — before the net pulls tighter. The boy was born in Nepal but has no document proving he is either a refugee or a citizen, a result of Chinese pressure.

Tashi described how those considered likely to protest are picked up in advance around key dates — like March 10, which marks the 1959 Tibetan uprising, or July 6, the Dalai Lama’s birthday. In 2018, Nepal’s police magazine confirmed that it was building predictive policing, which allows officers to watch people’s movements, identify in advance who they think will protest and arrest them preemptively.

“There are cameras everywhere,” Tashi said, sitting on a bus winding toward the Indian border. “There is no future.”

‘They gave us all the hardware’

After China crushed a Tibetan uprising in 1959, thousands fled across the Himalayas to Nepal, carrying only what they could: Religious paintings, prayer wheels and the weight of families left behind.

Their exodus, led by the charismatic Dalai Lama, captured the American imagination, with Hollywood films and actor Richard Gere’s congressional appeals putting Tibet in the spotlight. Washington trod a careful line, defending the rights and religious freedom of Tibetans without recognizing independence.

Today, the future of the Free Tibet movement is in question. Without refugee cards that grant basic rights, Tibetans in Nepal can no longer open bank accounts, work legally or leave the country.

Cameras are now everywhere in Kathmandu, perched on traffic lights and swiveling from temple eaves. Most link back to a four-story brick building just a few blocks down from the Chinese embassy, where officers watch the country in real time.

The building hums with the low breath of cooling fans. Inside, a wall of monitors blinks with feeds from border towns, busy markets and clogged traffic crossings.

Officers in crisp blue uniforms and red caps sit in the glow, scanning scenes. Beneath the screens, a photo published in a Nepali daily shows, a sign in English and Chinese reads: “With the compliments of the Ministry of Public Security of China.”

Their reach is vast.

Operators can track a motorbike weaving through the capital, follow a protest as it forms, or patch an alert directly to patrol radios. Many cameras are equipped with night vision facial recognition and AI tracking — able to pick a single face out of a festival crowd or lock onto a figure until it disappears indoors. The system not only sees but is learning to remember, storing patterns of movement, building a record of lives lived under its gaze.

A 34-year-old Tibetan cafe owner in the city watched the city change in quiet horror. “Now you can only be Tibetan in private,” he said. He and other Tibetans in Nepal spoke to AP anonymously, fearing retaliation.

The first cameras in Boudhanath were installed in 2012, officially to deter crime. But after a Tibetan monk doused himself in petrol and set himself ablaze in front of the stupa in 2013, police added 35 night vision cameras around it.

The Chinese embassy in Kathmandu worked closely with the police, said Rupak Shrestha, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada who studied surveillance in Nepal. He said the police received special training to use the new cameras, identify potential symbols associated with the Free Tibet movement and anticipate dissent.

In 2013, a team of Nepal Police officers crossed the northern border into Tibet for a seemingly straightforward mission: Collect police radios from Chinese authorities in Zhangmu, a remote border town,

[TITLE]India's New Spyware Mandate Sets A Dangerous Precedent:
[TEXT]
The government of India released an order that all smartphones manufactured for Indian citizens must come with a pre-installed government app. This app, known as Sanchar Saathi, is supposed to protect against phone-based crime such as stealing smartphones or miscellaneous telecom scams. India's Department of Telecommunications (DOT) specified that this app cannot be disabled or restricted by users, and that phone manufacturers would have to submit a comprehensive compliance report within 120 days of the order.

This was met with backlash, with some feeling that this was a privacy infringement and that this app could easily be used to track people's movements and collect data from the phone. In response, a few days later, the DOT released a new statement stating that because users are already accepting this app, the pre-installation mandate does not need to be imposed on phone manufacturers.

This entire situation has caused a great deal of concern regarding the government infringing on the privacy of its citizens under the guise of wanting to prevent crimes. Though there are ways to find and remove spyware from your Android phone, this app won't be so simple. It may bring to mind Big Brother from the novel 1984 by author George Orwell, where citizens were constantly under surveillance. It also sets a dangerous precedent for individual rights being limited based on a culture of fear and protection.

Mumbai: The department of telecommunications (DoT) collected ₹79,121 crore from telecom operators between April and November, up 47% from the year-ago period, as per data on its website.Analysts said the jump in collection was driven by steady payments from telecom operators for licence fees and headline tariff increase, which increased the amount these companies pay to the government as revenue share "The surge in receipts is primarily due to the 'denominator effect', as operators raised tariffs in mid-2024 and mid-2025, their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) expanded significantly, automatically increasing the absolute value of the government's revenue share," said Peeyush Vaish, partner and TMT industry leader, Deloitte India. "Robust tax collections are actually a positive indicator of the sector's operational health," he said.Additionally, we are seeing the normalisation of the fiscal calendar. As the moratoriums on past auction payments conclude, operators are resuming standard deferred payment schedules, Vaish said."The increase in DoT receipts appears largely structural rather than operator specific," said Prashant Bawa, partner and telecom sector leader at PwC India."Regular licence fee and spectrum usage charge payments from the sector's stronger balance sheet operators continue to anchor collections, while stressed operators remain on defined repayment frameworks. The data suggests compliance stability across the sector, rather than a sudden step change by any single player," he said.Meanwhile, capital spending on telecom infrastructure more than tripled to ₹18,032 crore, up from ₹5,424 crore last year, as the government increased investment in BharatNet fibre rollouts. This rise in receipts pushed net cash flow to ₹55,290 crore, more than double the previous year's ₹26,060 crore."The acceleration in BharatNet capex reflects execution catch-up and a renewed push to translate past approvals into on-ground rollout. Large public digital infrastructure programmes typically see phased disbursements, and FY25 appears to be an execution-heavy year rather than a correction for missed targets," Bawa said.However, moving from "funding" to "fibre" involves last-mile challenges such as right of way clearances. While capital is actively flowing into BharatNet phase II, the "cash pile" narrative overlooks the complexity of physical execution, Deloitte's Vaish said.

[TITLE]The Dangerous Influence of AI Chatbots on Minors:
[TEXT]
Since 2018, when generative AI began to develop, a new phase of digital technology has reshaped how young people around the globe interact with technology.

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, or video, by learning patterns from large amounts of data.

When packaged into chatbots, it turns that capability into fluid, humanlike conversations that answer questions, offer guidance, and provide highly personalised interactions.

This technology has rapidly gained ground among teenagers. A recent report by the nonprofit Common Sense found that 72 per cent of teens have used AI companions, chatbots designed to hold personal or emotionally supportive conversations, and more than half rely on them regularly. According to The Guardian (United Kingdom), new research carried out by the charity Youth Endowment Fund has shown that a quarter of teenagers in the UK have turned to AI chatbots for mental health support in the past year.

A study of 11,000 children aged 13 to 16 in England and Wales found that more than half of teenagers have used some form of online mental health support in the last year, with 25 per cent having used AI chatbots.

The research also found that young people affected by serious violence were even more likely to seek help online.

Some 38 per cent of children who were victims of serious violence said they would turn to AI chatbots for support, while 44 per cent of children who had been perpetrators of serious violence said they had done the same, Yahoo News reported.

The YEF said AI chatbots could appeal to struggling young people who feel it is safer and easier to speak to an AI chatbot anonymously at any time of day rather than speaking to a professional.

Statistics from the Pew Research Centre show a significant rise in teen AI chatbot use for schoolwork, with a 2024 Pew survey finding that 26 per cent of US teens (aged 13 to 17) used ChatGPT for assignments, doubling from 2023.

Although there are no readily accessible polls or surveys in Nigeria, some teachers have told Sunday PUNCH that some students with internet access use AI for research, essay writing, literacy, and health tips.

The dark sides of AI

Although the rapidly evolving AI landscape has created opportunities for children to have personalised emotional support, active learning, and creative exploration, a dark reality has begun to emerge in some developed countries.

Two years ago, 13-year-old Juliana Peralta took her life inside her Colorado home after her parents said she developed an addiction to a popular AI chatbot platform called Character AI.

According to CBS News, her parents, Cynthia Montoya and Will Peralta, said they carefully monitored their daughter’s life online and offline but had never heard of the chatbot app.

After Juliana’s suicide, police searched the teenager’s phone for clues and discovered the Character AI app was open to a “romantic” conversation.

“I didn’t know it existed,” Montoya was quoted as saying. “I didn’t know I needed to look for it.”

She reviewed her daughter’s chat records and discovered that the chatbots were sending harmful, sexually explicit content to her daughter.

Juliana had confided in one bot named Hero, based on a popular video game character. CBS News 60 Minutes said they read through over 300 pages of conversations Juliana had with Hero.

At first, her chats were

[TITLE]DevOps and Cybersecurity: Building a New Line of Defense Against Digital Threats:
[TEXT]
Cyberattacks are growing more sophisticated every year, from mass phishing campaigns to targeted data breaches against corporate infrastructure. In a world where every minute of delay can cost millions, organizations are under pressure to release updates faster while keeping systems secure. One of the most effective strategies to balance speed and protection is DevOps.

From DevOps to DevSecOps

DevOps emerged to break down silos between developers and operations teams, enabling faster product delivery through automation and collaboration. As cyber threats escalated, speed without security became a liability. This shift gave rise to DevSecOps, a model where security is embedded into every stage of the software lifecycle.

According to Gartner, more than 70% of enterprises are expected to adopt DevSecOps practices by 2026, nearly double the rate seen in 2022.

Why speed equals security

The 2020 SolarWinds Orion compromise demonstrated the devastating impact of supply chain attacks. Malicious code inserted into software updates gave attackers access to thousands of organizations, including government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. The lesson was clear: delays in patching or a lack of integrated security can lead to catastrophic breaches.

That is why more organizations are turning to DevOps development companies to integrate security into every stage of development. DevSecOps is no longer optional. It is becoming the standard for industries where resilience is critical.

DevSecOps in practice

DevSecOps ensures that security is not a final checkpoint but a continuous process. Automated testing, monitoring, and code analysis help identify vulnerabilities before release.

As GeeksforGeeks notes, the benefits include faster time-to-market, fewer vulnerabilities, and a security-first culture. SentinelOne adds that DevSecOps fosters closer collaboration between developers, operators, and security teams, improving both product quality and release speed.

Automation and rapid response

Automation is at the heart of DevOps. Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines allow organizations to push updates quickly and consistently. In cybersecurity, this speed is critical. The faster a vulnerability is patched, the lower the risk of exploitation.

Fortinet emphasises that DevSecOps shifts security left, embedding protection at the earliest stages of development to prevent vulnerabilities before they reach production.

Industry perspective

According to Neklo, a company providing DevOps development services since 2009, integrating DevOps and security is not just a trend but a necessity. “Organizations that adopt DevSecOps reduce incident response times dramatically and minimize the risk of data breaches,” Neklo experts explain.

Their experience shows that well-implemented DevOps practices accelerate development while building resilient infrastructure capable of withstanding modern threats.

Case studies

Real-world incidents prove why DevSecOps matters. Breaches caused by misconfigurations, delayed patching, or overlooked flaws show the cost of neglecting security.

Capital One (2019): A misconfigured cloud environment exposed data of over 100 million customers. Automated configuration checks, a core DevSecOps practice, could have prevented the breach.

Equifax (2017): Failure to patch Apache Struts led to the compromise of 147 million records. Automated patching pipelines could have reduced exposure.

These examples show that even industry leaders are vulnerable when security is treated as an afterthought. DevSecOps offers a proactive approach that reduces risks and builds trust.

The success of DevSecOps depends on tools that integrate security without slowing delivery. They automate checks, enforce compliance, and provide visibility across the lifecycle.

CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and testing

Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes for isolation and secure deployment

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to scan source code

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to test running applications

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with built-in security checks

The goal is not only to catch vulnerabilities but also to create a culture where security is continuous, automated, and proactive.

The future: AI and security automation

Artificial intelligence is set to play a major role in DevOps. Research (PDF) from Monash University and Atlassian shows AI can automate vulnerability detection and reduce the burden on security teams.

Real-world applications are already proving effective. AI-driven tools detect anomalies, predict threats, and respond automatically. WebAsha highlights that AI-powered DevSecOps is becoming the new standard, shifting organizations from reactive defense to proactive protection.

Practical steps for adoption

Transitioning to DevSecOps can feel overwhelming. The key is to treat adoption as a structured process, not a sudden overhaul.

Assess current workflows to identify weak points Train teams to embrace a security-first mindset Automate testing with SAST and DAST integrated into CI/CD Implement monitoring using SIEM systems for real-time analysis Scale gradually, starting with pilot projects before full rollout

These steps provide a roadmap for embedding security into development culture. Success depends on tools, training, leadership support, and a willingness to evolve. Companies that adopt DevSecOps incrementally are better positioned to respond quickly to threats.

Building a security culture

Technology alone is not enough. DevSecOps requires cultural change. Developers, operators, and security professionals must collaborate seamlessly. Without this shift, even the most advanced tools will not deliver results.

DevOps is no longer just about faster releases. It has evolved into a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that helps organizations stay competitive and resilient in the face of escalating digital threats.
