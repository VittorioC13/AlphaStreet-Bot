[TEXT]
NEW DELHI: India’s consumer and retail sector witnessed a decisive rebound in the Sept quarter, with deal volumes rising to 132 and values crossing $3.4 billion, nearly four times higher than previous quarter.The recovery was led by renewed investor focus on textiles, apparel and accessories, and sustained activity in food processing and e-commerce , Grant Thornton Bharat’s Q3 2025 Consumer and Retail Dealtracker report showed.A total of 97 PE/VC deals worth $1.3 billion were registered during the third quarter, more than doubling in value QoQ. Investors focused on festive-led categories — apparel, e-commerce, and consumer electronics — with notable rounds for VIP Industries, Zepto, Jumbotail, and Miko, it said.The quarter also witnessed a revival of outbound M&A, with Indian consumer players pursuing cross-border acquisitions to expand product portfolios and strengthen global footprints. There were 24 M&A deals worth $955 million, led by domestic consolidation in food processing and apparel. Big-ticket transactions such as Tilaknagar’s acquisition of Pernod Ricard’s Imperial Blue and Titan’s purchase of Damas Jewellery anchored the rebound, while outbound activity revived with five cross-border acquisitions.With policy tailwinds and festive demand, investor confidence remains strong across consumption-linked sectors. Six IPOs and five QIPs raised over $1.1 billion, led by Urban Company, Bluestone Jewellery, Tilaknagar, and Lenskart, reflecting renewed investor appetite for consumer names. Naveen Malpani, consumer industry leader Grant Thornton Bharat, said: “The festive quarter reaffirmed e-commerce’s role as a structural engine of consumption. Online festival sales have already crossed Rs 60,700 crore in the opening week, up about 29 % YoY, with more than half of the Rs 1.2 lakh crore projected festive GMV logged early.”

[TITLE]Consumer and retail sector recorded deal activity valued at $3.4 billion in September quarter:
[TEXT]
Consumer and retail sector witnessed robust deal momentum recording a total of 132 transactions valued at $3.4 billion in Q3 CY2025 marking a rebound.

According to Grant Thornton Bharat’s Consumer and Retail Dealtracker, the sector witnessed robust deal momentum in Q3 2025, recording a total of 132 transactions valued at $3.4 billion, up 6 per cent in volumes and 9 per cent in value compared to Q3 2024, including public market activity. Excluding public market deals, M&A and PE deal activity accounted for 121 deals worth $2.3 billion, marking a 168 per cent increase in value quarter on quarter, it added.

“The surge was driven by five high-value deals above $100 million and 26 deals above $10 million, together contributing $2 billion or 89 per cent of total deal value, signalling strong investor confidence in scale, brand strength, and growth-oriented consumer businesses,” it added.

Naveen Malpani, Partner and Consumer Industry Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat said, “Q3 marked a decisive rebound for India’s consumer and retail sector. The recovery was led by renewed investor focus on textiles, apparel & accessories, and sustained activity in food processing and e-commerce. These categories reflect the intersection of traditional strengths and digital disruption shaping India’s consumption story. The quarter also witnessed a revival of outbound M&A, with Indian consumer players pursuing cross-border acquisitions to expand product portfolios and strengthen global footprints.”

Festive season

While textiles, apparel, and accessories remained a top focus, attracting significant M&A and private equity inflows, food processing and e-commerce segments benefited from festive season momentum, with online sales surging and quick commerce capturing growing consumer attention.

“The rise in average deal size to $18.8 million from $7.2 million in Q2 highlights a shift toward value-driven transactions, underpinned by larger, capital-intensive deals and selective strategic investments across the sector,” it added.

Meanwhile, food processing, FMCG and textile sector lead M&A deal activity. “These sectors drove deal activity, accounting for 67 per cent of volumes and nearly 94 per cent of values. Large-ticket transactions such as Tilaknagar’s acquisition of Pernod Ricard’s Imperial Blue ($488 million) and Titan’s acquisition of Damas Jewellery ($283 million) anchored the rebound,” the report added.

[TITLE]Prada Group CEO Andrea Guerra on Potential Growth as Sales Top 4B Euros:
[TEXT]
MILAN — The Prada Group hit the 4 billion euro sales mark in the first nine months of the year, a performance that reflected 19 consecutive quarters of growth.

In the period ended Sept. 30, revenues rose 6 percent to 4.07 billion euros compared with 3.83 billion euros in the first nine months last year. At constant exchange rates, sales were up 9 percent.

While acknowledging the challenges and volatility of the current global scenario, the group’s chief executive officer Andrea Guerra sounded pleased with the performance during a call with analysts on Thursday at the end of trading in Hong Kong, where the company is publicly listed.

“Our performance has been solid, on the same pace as last year, against very tough comps,” said Guerra. “Hopefully, we all know by now that we’re all working in a different world and a different industry. To continue with this rhythm after two years of the beginning of this new world means that we have been able to attract and please clients with our brands and products, considering the extent and duration of our like-for-like improvement during so many quarters now.

[TITLE]Why the L’Oréal-Kering Tie-in Could Change the Playbook for Armani:
[TEXT]
Updated 3:24 p.m. ET Oct. 21

The playbook for Giorgio Armani could change now that L’Oréal has a blooming partnership with Kering.

As previously reported, news broke Sunday night that Kering Beauty is being sold to L’Oréal for 4 billion euros. Concurrently, Kering and L’Oréal are forming a long-term strategic partnership in beauty and wellness.

Might this partnership expand into fashion? Only time will tell. But it could make good sense when it comes to Armani.

Wills of the late designer Giorgio Armani, who died on Sept. 4 at age 91, opened the possibility of L’Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and EssilorLuxottica as potential buyers of his namesake company.

RELATED: L’Oréal’s Sales Growth Accelerated in Q3

L’Oréal and EssilorLuxottica are licensees for fragrance and beauty, and eyewear, respectively.

“I continue to expect L’Oréal and EssilorLuxottica as the most probable acquirors of their respective Armani businesses,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein. “With apparel and leather goods likely licensed to a third party long-term — same as Estée Lauder has done with Tom Ford.

“I wonder if in this context Kering could be the third-party licensee,” Solca continued. “Having said that, Kering is more likely to concentrate on getting its core business back on an even keel.”

Armani’s two wills, dated March 15 and April 5, were made public Sept. 12. After 12 months from their opening and within 18 months at the most, an initial 15 percent of his company could be sold to either L’Oréal, LVMH or Essilor Luxottica, they stipulate. Armani did not rule out other companies, as long as they are operating in the world of fashion and luxury, and of equal standing.

The same buyer would have the right to purchase a 30 percent to 54.9 percent stake in Armani between the third and fifth years, or in five years and within eight to consider a public listing in Italy as a priority or on other markets of equal standing.

Following even a potential listing, the Armani Foundation would keep a 30.1 percent stake of the group to ensure its control.

Regarding the Armani company, Nicolas Hieronimus, chief executive officer of L’Oréal, during a call Tuesday evening with analysts and journalists to discuss third-quarter and nine-months results reiterated sadness in the passing of Giorgio Armani, with whom the group collaborated for 40 years.

“We are very honored that in his success and in the instructions that he left with his heirs, L’Oréal is considered as a potential acquirer, at least of the first 15 percent,” Hieronimus said. “We said we would consider all the options. It’s a bit too soon. The family is mourning and focused also on driving this business.

“The only important thing that I can confirm today is that the deal we just did with Kering does not prevent us from considering any of the options that are on the table with Armani,” he continued. “So we will rediscuss it in the future.”

L’Oréal generally sticks with its core competency of beauty, but has ventured into fashion in the past — first with Lanvin, which it owned between 1994 and 2001, and more recently with Mugler, which became part of the French giant’s portfolio as part of the deal when it acquired the Mugler brands and Azzaro fragrances from Groupe Clarins in 2020.

Most recently, in early February, L’Oréal joined forces with Jacquemus, linking a long-term beauty license and taking a 10 percent stake in the fashion business.

Fashion and beauty are very different animals, even if they share some brand DNA, so it is considered unlikely L’Oréal would want to run Armani fashion itself.

No doubt, L’Oréal desires to keep the Armani fragrance and beauty license past 2050. That’s where the partnership with Kering could come in. And in the late ’90s, rumors swirled for years that Gucci wanted to buy Armani, although a deal never materialized.

The Armani fragrance and beauty license is a jewel in the crown of L’Oréal’s Luxe division, where it has been a “billionaire” brand since 2017. Blockbuster Armani products such as Sì fragrances and Maestro foundation have attracted A-list brand ambassadors like actress Cate Blanchett and Hanni, the lead singer of NewJeans, who helped transform Armani beauty into a sustainable, global powerhouse.

In March 2018, L’Oréal and Armani renewed that license until 2025, after having worked together since 1988. It was among Armani’s first licenses.

At the time of the renewal, Giorgio Armani said in a statement that “over the years our mutual trust has constantly generated excellent results.”

Kering, for its part, could merit from adding at least one more powerful fashion holding at this time when it’s struggling to turn around its star Gucci brand. Gucci has Demna as a new designer, which energized buyers with his debut display there at the recent Milan Fashion Week in September. But a turnaround at Gucci will take time.

Meanwhile, Kering’s newly appointed CEO Luca de Meo has sprung into action to revive the ailing company. The Kering Beauty announcement — coming just one month after his official arrival — was a surprise to the beauty and fashion industries. But financial analysts have lauded the move.

The Kering Beauty deal will be a windfall for Kering, whose net debt amounted to 9.5 billion euros on June 30. However, whether Kering would want to make a major acquisition like Armani remains to be seen.

HSBC cited 2024 filings that show Armani generated 2.3 billion euros in sales from fashion and

[TITLE]Thanks to Trump’s Shutdown, Food Stamps Funding Is About to Run Out:

“Congratulations, they didn’t burn any buildings down. That’s a big achievement for the left, to have some kind of gathering where they don’t have looting and rioting and burn a building down,” Johnson said.

By and large, the multi-month protest series has advocated for Americans’ First Amendment rights and rejected Trump’s agenda. Signage related to the event has emphasized the fight for democracy and against dictatorships. In the same political vein, No Kings participants have used their enormous visual footprint to fight against ICE’s unchecked authority, turn out for universal health care, condemn the release of disgraced former Representative George Santos, and raise national awareness to the rise of American fascism.

Somewhere between five and eight million people participated in the nationwide protest over the weekend, and it was remarkably peaceful. Organizers said that more than 2,500 individual events had been planned across the country for Saturday. Despite premature mobilizations of the National Guard in red states such as Virginia and Texas, there was no violence.

[TITLE]SNAP recipients told to buy shelf-stable food or go to food banks as funding deadline looms:
[TEXT]
Recipients of SNAP food assistance benefits across the country face a looming deadline: Come Nov. 1, their cards may not get refilled because of the government shutdown in Washington.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which serves nearly 42 million people each month, allocates money to states on a monthly basis. Benefits were largely uninterrupted over the past three weeks because funding for October was allocated to states before the shutdown began on Oct. 1.

But in a letter to SNAP state agency and regional directors on Oct. 10, the Department of Agriculture warned that there would not be enough funding to pay full SNAP benefits — also known as food stamps — in November if the shutdown persists.

Many states have announced that they plan to suspend SNAP benefits if the shutdown continues into next month. That could upend people’s ability to buy food on an unprecedented scale — the program has not lapsed during any government shutdown in recent history.

As Nov. 1 approaches, some state leaders are recommending that people turn to food banks or use their remaining benefits to buy non-perishable items.

“If you have accrued SNAP benefits from previous months on your account, use those funds now to buy shelf-stable foods that can last through November and beyond,” the Arkansas Department of Human Services says on its website.

But food banks say it will be impossible to fill the gap.

“There’s no way that our charitable food network or the system in this country can provide that much food overnight or quickly. It’s an impossible task,” said Catherine D’Amato, CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank.

Her organization is already receiving calls from people asking where they can go to feed their families, she said. D’Amato estimated that suspending SNAP benefits would create a deficit of up to 56 million meals in Massachusetts in November.

At least one state, Pennsylvania, has already stopped issuing SNAP benefits. The state announced that “starting October 16, SNAP benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA.”

Texas, meanwhile, said next month’s SNAP benefits won’t be issued if the shutdown continues past Oct. 27. And in Wisconsin, SNAP recipients got a letter this week informing them that even their remaining funds from October may not carry over.

“Benefits may not be available in November,” the letter said. “This may include any funds remaining on your card at the end of October. You may want to use your benefits to stock up on food before the end of October.”

The state treasurers of Oregon and Massachusetts said Thursday on a press call that their states have no contingency plans for SNAP if the federal government doesn’t provide the funding. State budgets can’t afford to cover the full cost of people’s benefits, they added.

“At a time when the cost of groceries continues to go up, SNAP makes the difference between having enough and going hungry,” said Elizabeth Steiner, the Oregon state treasurer. “This decision on behalf of the federal government is an absolute abdication of its responsibility to families in Oregon and across the United States who are struggling to make ends meet.”

She added that “up until now, every administration, Republican or Democrat, has understood that feeding Americans is a fundamental responsibility of the federal government.”

[TITLE]Deckers Outdoor beats Q3 earnings expectations:
[TEXT]
Deckers Outdoor beats Q3 earnings expectations

The maker of HOKA and UGG beats analyst expectations as revenue and EPS climb, signaling steady growth despite retail headwinds.

Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE: DECK) delivered a strong third-quarter performance for 2025, outpacing Wall Street expectations on both earnings and revenue. The outdoor footwear and apparel leader reported an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.82, surpassing consensus estimates by $0.24, while quarterly revenue reached $1.43 billion, slightly higher than the expected $1.42 billion.

This performance underscores Deckers’ ability to navigate a volatile retail landscape through brand strength, operational discipline, and digital innovation. Despite broader challenges in consumer spending and inflationary pressures, the company continues to post robust results fueled by growing demand for its core products, particularly HOKA running shoes and UGG lifestyle footwear.

Sustained Strength in Brand Portfolio

Deckers Outdoor’s success this quarter is largely driven by the resilience of its key brands. HOKA, known for its high-performance running shoes, has become a growth engine for the company, continuing to attract new customers across global markets. The brand’s mix of comfort, design, and performance has positioned it as a top choice for runners and lifestyle consumers alike.

UGG, another flagship brand, has also maintained its relevance through innovative designs and expanded seasonal offerings. While the brand is traditionally known for its iconic boots, Deckers has successfully diversified UGG’s product range to include sandals, sneakers, and outerwear—helping sustain year-round sales momentum.

The company’s ability to strengthen both high-performance and lifestyle categories highlights its strategic balance between innovation and brand legacy. This diversification continues to buffer Deckers from market volatility and shifting fashion trends.

Focused Digital and Direct-to-Consumer Strategy

Deckers has leaned heavily into its direct-to-consumer (DTC) strategy, a move that continues to pay off. By strengthening its e-commerce channels and integrating digital experiences into the customer journey, the company has built stronger brand loyalty and improved margins.

Through its digital platforms, Deckers has been able to personalize marketing efforts, optimize pricing, and reduce dependency on third-party retailers. The result is a more agile business model capable of responding to real-time consumer data and market conditions.

Additionally, the brand’s social media and influencer partnerships have contributed to greater visibility among younger audiences—particularly for HOKA—fueling continued growth in a competitive footwear landscape.

Fiscal 2026 Guidance Reflects Confidence

For fiscal year 2026, Deckers Outdoor has set an EPS forecast between $6.30 and $6.39, aligning closely with analyst expectations of $6.33. Revenue is projected to reach $5.35 billion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $5.46 billion.

While the company’s guidance suggests a cautious approach to economic uncertainty, it also reflects management’s confidence in sustainable profitability. Deckers continues to prioritize margin protection through cost control, supply chain efficiency, and product innovation—key elements that have helped it outperform many of its peers.

The company’s strong operational cash flow and improving gross margins indicate healthy fundamentals. Executives remain focused on balancing growth investments with shareholder returns, reinforcing long-term stability.

Market Reaction and Investor Sentiment

Following the Q3 announcement, Deckers Outdoor’s stock rose 1.63% to close at $102.53 on October 23, 2025. Despite this short-term uptick, the stock remains down 12.26% over the past three months and 32.56% over the last year.

This performance mirrors broader challenges across the consumer discretionary sector, as investors remain cautious amid global inflation and fluctuating demand. However, Deckers’ improving fundamentals and consistent earnings beats have begun to shift sentiment. Notably, analysts have issued 18 positive EPS revisions in the past 90 days, compared to only three negative ones—a signal that market confidence may be on the rise. The company’s strong balance sheet, steady cash flow, and disciplined management continue to make it an attractive long-term play for investors seeking stability in the retail and apparel space.

Innovation Driving Long-Term Growth

Deckers continues to invest heavily in product innovation, sustainability, and operational efficiency. From advanced footwear materials to environmentally responsible sourcing, the company is positioning itself for long-term success in a rapidly evolving industry.

Its focus on premium quality and comfort has allowed Deckers to stand out from lower-cost competitors while maintaining customer loyalty. The company’s agile manufacturing approach and ongoing expansion into international markets further enhance its competitive edge.

Looking ahead, Deckers plans to leverage its data-driven insights to expand its product mix, optimize pricing, and explore new retail experiences. These efforts will not only sustain growth but also solidify the company’s place among top global footwear and apparel brands.

Conclusion

Deckers Outdoor’s Q3 2025 results reaffirm its resilience and strategic discipline in a challenging retail environment. With strong brand momentum, solid financial performance, and a clear roadmap for sustainable growth, the company appears well-positioned for fiscal 2026 and beyond.

While headwinds persist in consumer spending and supply chain dynamics, Deckers’ consistent execution and focus on innovation suggest a promising outlook. Investors and analysts alike will be watching closely as the company continues to build on its success story in the quarters ahead.

[TITLE]Consumer and retail sector recorded deal activity valued at $3.4 billion in September quarter:
[TEXT]
Consumer and retail sector witnessed robust deal momentum recording a total of 132 transactions valued at $3.4 billion in Q3 CY2025 marking a rebound.

According to Grant Thornton Bharat’s Consumer and Retail Dealtracker, the sector witnessed robust deal momentum in Q3 2025, recording a total of 132 transactions valued at $3.4 billion, up 6 per cent in volumes and 9 per cent in value compared to Q3 2024, including public market activity. Excluding public market deals, M&A and PE deal activity accounted for 121 deals worth $2.3 billion, marking a 168 per cent increase in value quarter on quarter, it added.

“The surge was driven by five high-value deals above $100 million and 26 deals above $10 million, together contributing $2 billion or 89 per cent of total deal value, signalling strong investor confidence in scale, brand strength, and growth-oriented consumer businesses,” it added.

Naveen Malpani, Partner and Consumer Industry Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat said, “Q3 marked a decisive rebound for India’s consumer and retail sector. The recovery was led by renewed investor focus on textiles, apparel & accessories, and sustained activity in food processing and e-commerce. These categories reflect the intersection of traditional strengths and digital disruption shaping India’s consumption story. The quarter also witnessed a revival of outbound M&A, with Indian consumer players pursuing cross-border acquisitions to expand product portfolios and strengthen global footprints.”

Festive season

While textiles, apparel, and accessories remained a top focus, attracting significant M&A and private equity inflows, food processing and e-commerce segments benefited from festive season momentum, with online sales surging and quick commerce capturing growing consumer attention.

“The rise in average deal size to $18.8 million from $7.2 million in Q2 highlights a shift toward value-driven transactions, underpinned by larger, capital-intensive deals and selective strategic investments across the sector,” it added.

Meanwhile, food processing, FMCG and textile sector lead M&A deal activity. “These sectors drove deal activity, accounting for 67 per cent of volumes and nearly 94 per cent of values. Large-ticket transactions such as Tilaknagar’s acquisition of Pernod Ricard’s Imperial Blue ($488 million) and Titan’s acquisition of Damas Jewellery ($283 million) anchored the rebound,” the report added.

[TITLE]Target needs a win. Will the holidays deliver?:
[TEXT]

For even the most well-positioned retailer, this holiday season is shaping up to be complex.

The Q4 period is always the most important time for the industry and this year has brought its own unique macroeconomic challenges. Increasing costs from tariffs and mixed consumer sentiment are posing a challenge to seasonal festivities.

“This season, consumers are value-driven but emotionally fatigued,” Katherine Black, a partner at Kearney leading food, drug and mass market retail, told Retail Dive. “Forty percent say they’re switching the retailers they shop, double the rate we saw in May. That signals both volatility and opportunity. Shoppers will gravitate toward big sales, loyalty stacking, and cross-channel convenience.”

Many consumers are extra value-conscious this season, with some potentially pulling back on holiday spending budgets. A growing reliance on higher-income shoppers is even keeping some retail executives up at night.

This all comes at an especially pivotal moment for Target.

The company came into 2025 dealing with a mix of consumer backlash and declining sales, a pattern that’s persisted over the course of the year. Incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke has a plan to address those issues, which relies on regaining merchandising authority through newness and making consistent, reliable shopping experiences.

Can the company achieve that this holiday season?

Holiday newness

Major changes, including a dedicated turnaround strategy, are underway to help Target return to growth.

One of those changes was the news in August that Fiddelke would take over the CEO role next year, though his presence has already become much more prominent as Brian Cornell transitions out of the position.

Fiddelke gave a look into his turnaround priorities during an August call with analysts, highlighting the importance of fresh product.

“Target’s obviously had some challenges in the last couple of years,” UBS analyst Michael Lasser told Retail Dive. “The key will be, is it able to show improved performance this holiday season, which may give the market a bit more confidence that the worst is behind.”

Over the past few months, the mass retailer has unveiled a series of holiday-related announcements aimed at achieving Fiddelke’s goals — specifically around newness, consistency and accessibility.

Target in September kicked off the season, announcing 20,000 new products — double the amount in 2024 — with half of them being exclusive to the company.

The retailer also announced the expansion of its next-day delivery service to the 35 top metro areas in the U.S. by the end of October. And while Target didn’t provide a specific number for new seasonal hires, the retailer stressed the value of its team and the existing “flexible” on-demand workforce that can pick up shifts as needed.

Recent exclusive merchandising moves have included a Stranger Things campaign, a collaboration with Woolrich and a collection with Champion.

For Target to win back shoppers, Kearney’s Black believes it needs to return to its roots of making a premium lifestyle accessible and the store experience inspiring.

“The company has announced that half of their holiday assortment is exclusive product, but the strategy around that feels mixed,” Black told Retail Dive. “In many cases, they are leaning into pop culture releases, which will likely perform well in the short-term, but do not reinforce long-term brand distinction.”

Expanded delivery services are valuable, but Target should remain focused on creating a frictionless in-store experience and capitalize on the Target Circle 360 paid membership ecosystem, Black added.

But it’s early in terms of holiday, and whether the company’s execution is successful remains to be seen, Lasser noted.

The company’s pricing position is likely to be a key differentiating factor for shoppers, one way or another.

Is value a vibe?

Attracting price-conscious shoppers may be important, but Target’s positioning in some categories means it doesn't have to be the cheapest.

“Walmart tends to be the price setter in many, many categories,” Lasser said. “So [Target’s] historically been 2% to 4% above Walmart on a like-for-like basket of items. It's been successful when it's been at that level. So being in that range would be important this year.”

This can especially be true with key categories like beauty and apparel, Lasser added, noting that those are areas where Target tries to differentiate itself.

In its September holiday merchandising announcement, the retailer leaned into marketing its value. The company used the word “affordable” four times in that release. Target said thousands of its holiday-related gifts start at $5, and most items are priced under $20.

It also highlighted pricing for specific products, such as $6 exclusive lip charms and men’s personal care gift sets for $20.

Company executives have also stressed the importance of value this season, with Target Vice President of Experiential Store Operations Michael Scrafford telling Retail Dive during a live event that value is critical to the consumer.

“It’s always important during the holiday season. It's going to be of paramount importance this year,” Scrafford said, adding that value can show up for the consumer in many ways. “It’s about the digital experience making it easy to find a great deal. It's about in-store navigation that helps the guests find what he or she is looking for, but also maybe a surprise-and-delight deal here or there.”

While value can sometimes be directly about price, Scrafford said it is often about what it feels like to get a great deal as a consumer.

That feeling consumers have when shopping, even with economic pressures, is certainly a vital aspect this season, Black told Retail Dive.

“Consumers want to feel that they’re living an elevated lifestyle even as budgets tighten,” Black said. “In Kearney’s research, 57% of shoppers said they want to feel like savvy consumers and in many cases, that feeling matters more than the dollars saved. That ‘smart-style’ confidence is what Target delivered in its heyday.”

Can Target achieve that under Fiddelke’s direction this holiday?

The executive certainly feels confident.

“Q4 is the perfect time to begin writing this new chapter for Target,” Fiddelke said in a LinkedIn post. “And to anyone who doubts what this team can do, I say: Watch us.”

[TITLE]Gold glitters online as festive shoppers turn to e-commerce, quick commerce platforms for auspicious buys:
[TEXT]
Luxury and prosperity are shining bright this festive season, with online platforms like Amazon and BigBasket witnessing record demand for gold, silver, and fine jewellery purchases ahead of Diwali and Dhanteras.

Premium fashion on Amazon Fashion and Beauty has seen a sharp uptick, led by fine jewellery and luxury watches.

“This festive season, premium fashion is seeing remarkable growth, with luxury watches and gold and diamond jewellery — including lab-grown diamonds — driving demand,” said Siddharth Bhagat, Director, Amazon Fashion and Beauty, India.

Amazon reported a 96% year-on-year surge in gold jewellery sales, driven by brands such as CaratLane, PN Gadgil Jewellers, Joyalukkas, PC Chandra, KISNA, and Malabar Gold & Diamonds. The platform now offers more than five lakh styles across silver, gold, and diamond jewellery, making it the largest fine jewellery destination among online marketplaces.

Bhagat said the company is also seeing strong traction in affordable fine jewellery — with customers buying pieces starting at ₹2,000 for silver and up to ₹40,000 for gold and diamond. Demand for 14K daily-wear jewellery has grown 50 per cent year-on-year, while 18K styles are also gaining popularity.

In line with global trends, Amazon has expanded into lab-grown diamonds, offering jewellery starting at ₹1,699 across more than 50,000 styles. “Amazon is the first and only online marketplace focusing on this whitespace,” Bhagat said.

Gold coins remain a festive favourite, with the most purchased denomination being 2 grams. “Customers continue to prefer Amazon for their auspicious purchases of gold and silver coins during Akshaya Tritiya, Dhanteras and more,” Bhagat added.

Complementing this, Tata-owned bigbasket also recorded a strong Dhanteras, with gold coin sales rising 146 per cent and silver coins up 234 per cent from last year. Demand for pooja essentials — including diyas, flowers, and festive décor — grew 54 per cent year-on-year.

“Dhanteras is a time for prosperity, devotion, and togetherness. This year, bigbasket ensured our customers could celebrate without compromise, whether it was purchasing auspicious coins or getting the perfect gifts and pooja items in minutes,” said Seshu Kumar, Chief Buying and Merchandising Officer, bigbasket.

With 10-minute delivery and curated festive assortments, bigbasket blended technology and tradition, meeting last-minute festive needs — from auspicious buys to celebratory gifting.

Both platforms are capitalising on India’s accelerating shift toward online festive shopping, where authenticity, convenience, and trust are emerging as the new hallmarks of prosperity.
