[TITLE]OpenAI may move forward with new business structure, partnership with Microsoft, regulators say:
[TEXT]
By MATT O’BRIEN and THALIA BEATY

OpenAI said Tuesday it has reorganized its ownership structure and converted its business into a public benefit corporation after two crucial regulators, the Delaware and California attorneys general, said they would not oppose the plan.

The restructuring paves the way for the ChatGPT maker to more easily profit off its artificial intelligence technology even as it remains technically under the control of a nonprofit.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a call Tuesday that “the most likely path” for the newly formed business is that it becomes publicly traded on the stock market, “given the capital needs that we’ll have and sort of the size of the company,” though a Wall Street debut was not a part of the announcements detailed Tuesday.

Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings and California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in separate statements that they would not object to the restructuring, seemingly bringing to an end more than a year of negotiations and announcements

[TITLE]Australian Government Rejects Proposal to Allow Text and Data Mining by AI Companies:
[TEXT]
On Monday, Michelle Rowland, the attorney general of Australia, confirmed the federal government’s decision preventing tech companies from utilizing text and data mining in order to train artificial intelligence models. The decision comes after a group of tech companies advocated for a change in Australia’s Copyright Act, as reported by Billboard. The decision is a win for musicians, writers, artist, and other creatives.

The rejected proposal was initially presented to the Australian government’s Productivity Commission in August, in a report titled “Harnessing Data and Digital Technology.” The report estimated that AI could deliver a $116 billion boost to the economy over a decade, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).

“We are making it very clear that we will not be entertaining a text and data mining exception,” Rowland told ABC’s morning news show, AM, on Monday.

The proposal faced immediate backlash from a wide range of Australian creatives, from First Nations rapper Adam Briggs and author Anna Funder to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Recording Industry Association, according to the Guardian.

None were swayed by pro-AI and anti-copyright arguments from tech executives like Scott Farquhar, a cofounder of the software company Atlassian and currently chair of the Tech Council of Australia. In an address to the National Press Club in July, Farquhar described himself as a “tech optimist” and advocated for changes in the country’s copyright laws to be more like those in the United States and Europe, which “have fair use exceptions for text and data mining.”

Fixing this, he argued, “could unlock billions of dollars of foreign investment into Australia.” For now, at least, those billions of dollars will have to come at the expense of someone other than Australian creators and their hard-earned copyright.

[TITLE]Tata Group - the divided empire facing boardroom drama:
[TEXT]
Tata Group - the divided empire facing boardroom drama

1 day ago Share Save Nikhil Inamdar BBC News, Mumbai Share Save

Getty Images The Tata Group, headed by N Chandrasekaran, is facing severe business headwinds

A year after the death of Ratan Tata, the Tata Group - a gigantic Indian salt-to-steel conglomerate which he steered into a global, modern, technologically advanced enterprise - finds itself facing a plethora of crises. The business empire, which owns iconic British brands such as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and Tetley Tea and makes the iPhone for Apple in India, is, yet again, a divided house. For months, a boardroom power battle between trustees has exposed internal rifts that forced the government to step in and prevent a repeat of the very public legal tangle that engulfed the Tata empire in 2016, when its former chairman Cyrus Mistry was ousted from the group. While ministers in Delhi appeared to have brokered an uneasy truce weeks ago, latest reports suggest that Mehli Mistry, a close confidant of Ratan Tata and a trustee on the board of Tata Trusts, has been ousted from his position. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Prof Mircea Raianu of the University of Maryland who's written a seminal history of the corporation, views the tussle as a "resurfacing of unresolved business" - or the core question of who runs the show at Tata, and how much control majority shareholders (the philanthropic arm Tata Trusts which owns 66% of the parent company, Tata Sons) can wield in making business decisions. The Tata Group is uniquely structured, with controlling shares of the unlisted commercial holding company (Tata Sons) vested in a philanthropic organisation (Tata Trusts). While this has given the group tax and regulatory advantages, and allows it to carry out charitable activities, experts say it has also led to governance issues given its dual non-profit and commercial objectives. The latest rift comes at a time when the Tatas are facing severe business headwinds while trying to expand into new growth areas like semiconductors and electric vehicles, as well as attempting to revive Air India - the ailing carrier they bought from the government in 2021 - following a tragic crash earlier this year. So, what's gone wrong?

The Tatas have not publicly commented on the discord, but it is widely reported to stem from differences among trustees over board nominations, funding approvals and the public listing of Tata Sons - the holding company of 26 publicly listed Tata firms with a market capitalisation of some $328bn. A source close to the Tata Group told the BBC on condition of anonymity that some of the trustees' desire for greater influence in making strategic decisions at Tata Sons and picking nominees on its board is at the centre of the tussle. Tata Trusts has three nominees on the Tata Sons board. "The Tata Trusts nominees have a veto right in major company decisions, but it is understood that theirs is basically a supervisory role, not an assertive one," said the source. "However now, some of the trustees want more power to make commercial decisions." Another more significant point of contention is the desire of the SP Group - the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons, with an 18% stake - to take the company public. While the former has been pushing hard for it, most Tata trustees are against the idea. "There is fear that going public would dilute the trust's decision-making capacity and long-term focus and expose Tata Sons to quarterly market pressures," said the source. "This is especially because there are so many new businesses at a very nascent stage." But the SP Group has called its prospective public listing a "moral and social imperative" that would unlock value for Tata shareholders and improve transparency and governance at the company. Neither Tata Sons not Tata Trusts have responded to detailed questions from the BBC. But according to Prof Raianu, the tussle highlights a very real dilemma for the group. A public listing, he says, would be counter to what many giant conglomerates in the United States and Europe are increasingly doing - "opting for foundation ownership to promote stability and sustainability", ironically, by looking to the Tatas as an example. "But at the same time, private or closely held companies are indeed subject to less outside scrutiny, which can fuel conflict and harm reputation," Prof Raianu adds.

The conflict has already raised governance concerns and hit the brand image of what is arguably one of India's oldest and most revered business houses, says publicist Dilip Cherian, who once worked closely with former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry. "This just adds to the series of blows the Tata image has taken recently," Mr Cherian told the BBC, referring to the devastating Air India crash earlier this year and the cyber-attack on a key unit of JLR which plunged the UK's car production to a 70-year-low this September. Devastating crash threatens Air India's ambitious turnaround Further, TCS, the flagship software outsourcing company that contributes to nearly half the group's revenues, has been plagued with its own set of challenges, including mass layoffs and the recent ending of a contract by retailer Marks & Spencer. "These boardroom battles create further confusion. There will not only be anxiety about share performance, but questions among investors about who exactly they are dealing with at the Tatas," said Mr Cherian.

[TITLE]What’s up with… BT, VodafoneThree, Nokia:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: In a bid to challenge rising competition from MVNOs, BT is reportedly planning to launch a low-cost mobile brand; early network sharing between Vodafone and Three is already improving connectivity in the UK and is expected to boost coverage and 5G experience significantly for both user bases; Nokia secures a five-year deal to modernise E.ON’s German telecom network, improving automation, efficiency and sustainability, with plans to extend the model across Europe; and much more!

UK-based telco BT returned to the mobile services market back in 2016 when it completed the acquisition of EE in a £12.5bn deal. Since then, it has turned EE into its flagship consumer brand, while the BT brand does the heavy lifting in the business-to-business (B2B) segment and Openreach concentrates on building infrastructure. The group also operates a “value brand” in the form of Plusnet, although the latter now only provides no-frills broadband services after it axed its mobile offering. That leaves EE as the group’s only mobile brand, with a focus on the premium segment. According to a report in the Financial Times (subscription required), BT is now exploring the launch of a low-cost mobile brand in order to combat the growing number of new mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), including Revolut and Monzo. BT rivals Virgin Media O2 (VMO2) and VodafoneThree already offer low-cost mobile services via sub-brands, such as O2’s Giffgaff, Vodafone’s VOXI and Three’s Smarty. Citing sources close to the matter, the FT said BT is understood to be considering options including creating a new brand or buying an existing MVNO. Notably, BT CEO Allison Kirkby has indicated that she favours a multi-brand approach in order to target customers with tailored service propositions. The FT report added that BT consumer chief Claire Gillies and others also believe BT must compete in all segments of the market to remain competitive. In May, Kirkby also confirmed that the BT brand “will be reinvigorated”. It’s understood that the older, more traditional brand will be increasingly used to drive consumer broadband sales among customers unimpressed by upstart brands such as EE.

Meanwhile, the UK market has certainly undergone significant structural change following the formation of VMO2 in 2021 and the recent merger of Three and Vodafone. A new report from network analytics company Opensignal has provided some analysis of VodafoneThree’s network integration efforts thus far, and has found that early network sharing is already bringing “tangible benefits for millions of users – from broader reach to faster, more reliable connectivity”. According to Opensignal’s data, once full integration is completed, Three users are expected to see around a 13% improvement in ‘coverage experience’, while Vodafone users will see a 7% increase. “For 5G coverage experience, the uplift is projected to be much greater – a 92% improvement for Vodafone users and 7% for Three users”, the company said. Opensignal attributes much of the improvements to the deployment of multi-operator core network (MOCN) technology, which it notes allows customers of both operators to connect automatically to whichever mast provides the stronger signal. “This means that in parts of the network where MOCN is enabled, users gain access to additional network resources, immediately improving coverage and reliability”, it explains.

Highlighting the growing importance of enterprise deals for vendors as well as telcos, Nokia has won what it describes as a “strategic contract” with European energy group E.ON. The five-year agreement starts in Germany and will see the Finland-based vendor modernise E.ON’s “mission-critical communications infrastructure”. The aim is to create an “optimised, highly automated telecommunications network for distribution system operators (DSO)” that is designed to reduce energy consumption by up to 50% compared to current network usage. Nokia notes that E.ON’s distribution grid in Germany connects 1.4 million renewable energy plants, “hence making the performance, flexibility and sustainability of its communications infrastructure critical. A key pillar, among others, is the IP, optical and fixed access part of its DSO telecommunications network”. Nokia will provide next-generation networking solutions to E.ON, including IP routing and switching, optical transport, fixed broadband access (XGS-PON) and network automation solutions. The plan is also to use the Germany model for other E.ON affiliates in Europe. Lars Ramelow, head of supply chain, grid communication infrastructure at E.ON Group, said modernising the network and “harmonising our technical infrastructure is a crucial move to ensure E.ON Group continues to deliver secure, reliable and energy-efficient services across Europe. We’re investing in a next-generation telecommunications network that is ready for future demands operationally, technologically and environmentally. Nokia is a trusted long-term supplier, and its ability to support our network makes it the right choice as we scale our digital transformation”.

Staying in Germany, it is being reported that Deutsche Telekom (DT) and AI technology giant Nvidia are preparing to announce previously touted plans for a €1.2bn datacentre in the country. According to Bloomberg (subscription required), the facility will be based in Munich and software giant SAP is being lined up as a first major customer. DT has already signalled its intention to play a major role in developing an AI Gigafactory in Germany to “support industrial AI workloads for European manufacturers”. Nvidia has become a key partner for DT in fields such as AI and the sovereign cloud, and has wider aims to become an indispensable vendor and partner to the telecom network operator community. At Gamescom 2025, DT announced plans to launch a new 5G+ gaming offering with Nvidia from autumn 2025.

Speaking of AI infrastructure, Qualcomm has announced a collaboration with Humain, the new Saudi AI infrastructure and services company launched in May this year. The aim of the agreement is to deploy “advanced AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia” in order to offer “global AI inferencing services and be the world’s first fully optimised edge-to-cloud hybrid AI”. The initiative is said to be a follow up of an announcement made by the two companies at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in May. Starting in 2026, Humain is targeting 200 megawatts of Qualcomm AI200 and AI250 rack solutions, “to deliver high-performance AI inference services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and globally”. Tareq Amin, the former CEO of Rakuten Mobile and its cloud platform and Open RAN-focused vendor offshoot Rakuten Symphony, was appointed CEO of Humain in December 2024 after a brief stint at Aramco Digital. He declared that combining Humain’s regional insight and full AI stack capabilities with Qualcomm’s semiconductors technology “will enable Saudi Arabia to lead the next wave of global AI and semiconductors innovation”. That’s quite some claim. Cristiano Amon, president and CEO at Qualcomm, added that the establishment of advanced AI datacentres will help Saudi Arabia to “create a technology ecosystem that will accelerate its AI ambitions of becoming a hub of intelligent computing”.

[TITLE]Commission courts top investors for up to €5B tech fund:
[TEXT]
It could range from €3 billion to €5 billion, depending on how much investors contribute.

The investors invited to meet with the Commission on Tuesday are Danish investment company Novo Holdings, the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark, Spanish CriteriaCaixa and Santander, Italian Intesa Sanpaolo, Dutch pension fund APG Asset Management, Swedish Wallenberg Investments, and Polish Development Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, according to the planning note.

The fund will focus on “strategic and enabling technologies,” the note read, including advanced materials, clean energy, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum technology, robotics, space and medical technologies.

The Commission is seeking to address the issue of companies struggling to scale in Europe. Many turn to investors from the U.S. or elsewhere for late-stage financing, after which they often relocate.

The goal of the fund is to make sure that startups that have completed their early funding rounds can “secure scaleup financing while maintaining their headquarters and core activities in Europe,” the note said.

The fund follows an earlier effort to take direct equity stakes in companies through the European Innovation Council Fund. Investments under the EIC Fund are capped at €30 million, while the new fund would invest €100 million or more.

The fund will launch in April. Other investors could still come in at a later date.

In November, the Commission plans to begin the search for an investment adviser — a process that should be wrapped up by January, according to the planning note.

Growth in AI traffic is exploding. For example, almost 50% of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly active users access the site via mobile devices, and its monthly mobile app downloads exceed 40 million.

With Nokia and NVIDIA-powered AI-RAN systems , mobile operators can improve performance and efficiency as well as enhance network experiences for future generative and agentic AI applications and experiences. They will be able to introduce new AI services for 6G with the same infrastructure, powering billions of new connections for drones, cars, robots and augmented- and virtual-reality glasses that demand connectivity, computing and sensing at the edge.

Seamless Transition to AI-Native Networks

NVIDIA is introducing Aerial RAN Computer Pro (ARC-Pro), a 6G-ready accelerated computing platform that combines connectivity, computing and sensing capabilities, enabling telcos to move from 5G-Advanced to 6G through software upgrades.

The NVIDIA ARC-Pro reference design is available for manufacturers and network equipment providers to build commercial-off-the-shelf-based or proprietary AI-RAN products, supporting both new buildouts and expansions to existing base stations.

Nokia will accelerate the availability of its 5G and 6G RAN software on the NVIDIA CUDA® platform and expand its RAN portfolio by embedding NVIDIA ARC-Pro at the heart of the new AI-RAN solution. This partnership will enable Nokia’s mobile network customers to transition seamlessly from today’s RAN networks to future AI-RAN networks.

Nokia’s unique anyRAN approach simplifies the introduction of the ARC-Pro platform by establishing software-defined RAN evolution for both Cloud RAN and purpose-built RAN. AirScale baseband is a modular architecture in which new cards can coexist with previously deployed cards. Nokia aims to expand and evolve its AirScale baseband into the 5G-Advanced and 6G era with new AI-RAN capabilities.

Dell Technologies is driving innovation in Nokia’s AI-RAN solution with its state-of-the-art Dell PowerEdge servers. Engineered for seamless scalability, these servers enable no-touch software upgrades and low-touch silicon upgrades, ensuring a smooth evolution from 5G to 5G-Advanced and 6G. With their robust, high-performance infrastructure, Dell PowerEdge servers are the ultimate compute platform for operators deploying AI-RAN solutions.

Future-Proofed for 6G

Nokia and NVIDIA’s AI-RAN platform unifies AI and radio access workloads on a software-defined, accelerated infrastructure, boosting performance, efficiency and monetization while enabling a smooth, cost-effective path to 6G.

New capabilities are added through software updates, future-proofing investments for 6G and beyond, while enabling rapid innovation cycles at the pace of AI. It serves growing generative AI and agentic AI traffic on the same sites as RAN functions, applying AI algorithms to improve spectral and energy efficiency, as well as overall network performance, and by tapping into underutilized RAN assets to host edge AI services and maximize return on investment.

“With America’s best network, T-Mobile remains committed to advancing next-generation technologies that redefine the customer experience,” said John Saw, president of technology and chief technology officer at T-Mobile. “Our collaboration with industry leaders Nokia and NVIDIA marks an important step toward shaping the future of connectivity as we develop the innovations that will power the 6G era. Building on the foundation established by the AI-RAN Innovation Center in 2024, this strategic initiative reinforces T-Mobile’s leadership in driving the U.S. wireless industry forward. Beginning in 2026, T-Mobile will conduct field evaluations and testing of advanced AI-RAN technologies to ensure they meet the evolving needs of our customers as we move toward 6G.”

“The telecommunications industry owns the most valuable real estate for AI — the edge, where data is created,” said Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive officer of Dell Technologies. “This AI-RAN collaboration with Nokia and NVIDIA makes that potential real. We’ve built some of the world’s largest AI clusters with 100,000+ GPUs. Now we’re applying that expertise to distribute intelligence across millions of edge nodes. The operators who modernize their infrastructure today won’t just carry AI traffic — they’ll be the distributed AI grid factories that process it at the source, where latency matters and data sovereignty is critical.”

Additional AI Networking Solutions Cooperation

Nokia and NVIDIA will also collaborate on AI networking solutions, including data center switching with Nokia’s SR Linux software for the NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ Ethernet networking platform and the application of Nokia’s telemetry and fabric management platform on NVIDIA AI infrastructure.

The companies will also explore the use of Nokia’s optical technologies and capabilities as part of future NVIDIA AI infrastructure architecture.

[TITLE]Major telcos urge EU's von der Leyen to ease merger rules to boost investments:
[TEXT]
BRUSSELS :Europe's biggest telecommunications companies urged the head of the European Commission on Tuesday to loosen EU merger rules, a move they said would boost much-needed investments in digital infrastructure and help them compete with U.S. and Asian peers.

The call by the chief executives of Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefonica, TIM, Vodafone, Nokia and Ericsson comes as the Commission is set to announce a legislative proposal to revamp the sector.

The Digital Networks Act, currently scheduled to be unveiled in November, aims to take a more comprehensive approach to help ramp up digital infrastructure across Europe.

It hit a stumbling block last week, however, when an internal Commission body issued a negative opinion on the legislation, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

"The Digital Networks Act is a crucial opportunity," the CEOs wrote in a joint letter to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

"Unless the Commission takes bold action with a clearly stated intent to address the need for scale, European industries will continue to lack the strength to invest at the same pace as their competitors in the United States, Asia and other markets," they wrote.

The telecoms industry has voiced concern the DNA will ignore their calls to ease the path for large mergers, particularly those which reduce the number of players in a market from four to three. Antitrust regulators have long viewed that level of consolidation as a precursor to price hikes considered harmful to consumers.

"The Commission must act boldly to recognise the link between scale and investment, and a much simplified regulatory framework that increases investment capacities," the executives said.

Other signatories to the letter included BT Group, CK Hutchison Group Telecom, KPN, Liberty Global, FiberCop, Swisscom and Telenor.

[TITLE]What’s up with… BT, VodafoneThree, Nokia:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: In a bid to challenge rising competition from MVNOs, BT is reportedly planning to launch a low-cost mobile brand; early network sharing between Vodafone and Three is already improving connectivity in the UK and is expected to boost coverage and 5G experience significantly for both user bases; Nokia secures a five-year deal to modernise E.ON’s German telecom network, improving automation, efficiency and sustainability, with plans to extend the model across Europe; and much more!

UK-based telco BT returned to the mobile services market back in 2016 when it completed the acquisition of EE in a £12.5bn deal. Since then, it has turned EE into its flagship consumer brand, while the BT brand does the heavy lifting in the business-to-business (B2B) segment and Openreach concentrates on building infrastructure. The group also operates a “value brand” in the form of Plusnet, although the latter now only provides no-frills broadband services after it axed its mobile offering. That leaves EE as the group’s only mobile brand, with a focus on the premium segment. According to a report in the Financial Times (subscription required), BT is now exploring the launch of a low-cost mobile brand in order to combat the growing number of new mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), including Revolut and Monzo. BT rivals Virgin Media O2 (VMO2) and VodafoneThree already offer low-cost mobile services via sub-brands, such as O2’s Giffgaff, Vodafone’s VOXI and Three’s Smarty. Citing sources close to the matter, the FT said BT is understood to be considering options including creating a new brand or buying an existing MVNO. Notably, BT CEO Allison Kirkby has indicated that she favours a multi-brand approach in order to target customers with tailored service propositions. The FT report added that BT consumer chief Claire Gillies and others also believe BT must compete in all segments of the market to remain competitive. In May, Kirkby also confirmed that the BT brand “will be reinvigorated”. It’s understood that the older, more traditional brand will be increasingly used to drive consumer broadband sales among customers unimpressed by upstart brands such as EE.

Meanwhile, the UK market has certainly undergone significant structural change following the formation of VMO2 in 2021 and the recent merger of Three and Vodafone. A new report from network analytics company Opensignal has provided some analysis of VodafoneThree’s network integration efforts thus far, and has found that early network sharing is already bringing “tangible benefits for millions of users – from broader reach to faster, more reliable connectivity”. According to Opensignal’s data, once full integration is completed, Three users are expected to see around a 13% improvement in ‘coverage experience’, while Vodafone users will see a 7% increase. “For 5G coverage experience, the uplift is projected to be much greater – a 92% improvement for Vodafone users and 7% for Three users”, the company said. Opensignal attributes much of the improvements to the deployment of multi-operator core network (MOCN) technology, which it notes allows customers of both operators to connect automatically to whichever mast provides the stronger signal. “This means that in parts of the network where MOCN is enabled, users gain access to additional network resources, immediately improving coverage and reliability”, it explains.

Highlighting the growing importance of enterprise deals for vendors as well as telcos, Nokia has won what it describes as a “strategic contract” with European energy group E.ON. The five-year agreement starts in Germany and will see the Finland-based vendor modernise E.ON’s “mission-critical communications infrastructure”. The aim is to create an “optimised, highly automated telecommunications network for distribution system operators (DSO)” that is designed to reduce energy consumption by up to 50% compared to current network usage. Nokia notes that E.ON’s distribution grid in Germany connects 1.4 million renewable energy plants, “hence making the performance, flexibility and sustainability of its communications infrastructure critical. A key pillar, among others, is the IP, optical and fixed access part of its DSO telecommunications network”. Nokia will provide next-generation networking solutions to E.ON, including IP routing and switching, optical transport, fixed broadband access (XGS-PON) and network automation solutions. The plan is also to use the Germany model for other E.ON affiliates in Europe. Lars Ramelow, head of supply chain, grid communication infrastructure at E.ON Group, said modernising the network and “harmonising our technical infrastructure is a crucial move to ensure E.ON Group continues to deliver secure, reliable and energy-efficient services across Europe. We’re investing in a next-generation telecommunications network that is ready for future demands operationally, technologically and environmentally. Nokia is a trusted long-term supplier, and its ability to support our network makes it the right choice as we scale our digital transformation”.

Staying in Germany, it is being reported that Deutsche Telekom (DT) and AI technology giant Nvidia are preparing to announce previously touted plans for a €1.2bn datacentre in the country. According to Bloomberg (subscription required), the facility will be based in Munich and software giant SAP is being lined up as a first major customer. DT has already signalled its intention to play a major role in developing an AI Gigafactory in Germany to “support industrial AI workloads for European manufacturers”. Nvidia has become a key partner for DT in fields such as AI and the sovereign cloud, and has wider aims to become an indispensable vendor and partner to the telecom network operator community. At Gamescom 2025, DT announced plans to launch a new 5G+ gaming offering with Nvidia from autumn 2025.

Speaking of AI infrastructure, Qualcomm has announced a collaboration with Humain, the new Saudi AI infrastructure and services company launched in May this year. The aim of the agreement is to deploy “advanced AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia” in order to offer “global AI inferencing services and be the world’s first fully optimised edge-to-cloud hybrid AI”. The initiative is said to be a follow up of an announcement made by the two companies at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in May. Starting in 2026, Humain is targeting 200 megawatts of Qualcomm AI200 and AI250 rack solutions, “to deliver high-performance AI inference services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and globally”. Tareq Amin, the former CEO of Rakuten Mobile and its cloud platform and Open RAN-focused vendor offshoot Rakuten Symphony, was appointed CEO of Humain in December 2024 after a brief stint at Aramco Digital. He declared that combining Humain’s regional insight and full AI stack capabilities with Qualcomm’s semiconductors technology “will enable Saudi Arabia to lead the next wave of global AI and semiconductors innovation”. That’s quite some claim. Cristiano Amon, president and CEO at Qualcomm, added that the establishment of advanced AI datacentres will help Saudi Arabia to “create a technology ecosystem that will accelerate its AI ambitions of becoming a hub of intelligent computing”.

[TITLE]OpenAI may move forward with new business structure, partnership with Microsoft, regulators say:
[TEXT]
By MATT O’BRIEN and THALIA BEATY

OpenAI said Tuesday it has reorganized its ownership structure and converted its business into a public benefit corporation after two crucial regulators, the Delaware and California attorneys general, said they would not oppose the plan.

The restructuring paves the way for the ChatGPT maker to more easily profit off its artificial intelligence technology even as it remains technically under the control of a nonprofit.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a call Tuesday that “the most likely path” for the newly formed business is that it becomes publicly traded on the stock market, “given the capital needs that we’ll have and sort of the size of the company,” though a Wall Street debut was not a part of the announcements detailed Tuesday.

Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings and California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in separate statements that they would not object to the restructuring, seemingly bringing to an end more than a year of negotiations and announcements
