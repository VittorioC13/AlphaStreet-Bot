[TITLE]EU moves to choke off Russia’s energy cash flow with sanctions on ‘shadow fleet’ and LNG sanctions:
[TEXT]
The European Union has agreed on a new raft of sanctions against Russia targeting its shadow fleet of oil tankers and banning its imports of liquefied natural gas, the Danish EU presidency announced Thursday.

“Today is a good day for Europe and Ukraine,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a statement, as EU leaders were gathering for a summit in Brussels.

He said that the new sanctions “will introduce new and comprehensive measures on oil and gas, the shadow fleet and Russia’s financial sector.” A new system for limiting the movement of Russian diplomats within the 27-nation EU will also be introduced.

The move comes a day after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration announced new sanctions against Russia’s oil industry that are aimed at moving Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and ending Moscow’s war on Ukraine.

Energy revenue is the linchpin of Russia’s economy, allowing Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.

The new EU measures took almost a month to decide. The 27-nation bloc has already slapped 18 packages of sanctions against Russia over the war, but getting final agreement on who and what to target can take weeks.

The sanctions agreement was sealed at a Thursday morning meeting of EU ambassadors, just a few hours before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joins his European counterparts for the one-day summit, as they press for a ceasefire to halt almost four years of fighting.

The summit comes after Trump said that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn’t want it to be a “waste of time.” It was yet another twist in Trump’s stop-and-go effort to end the war.

The leaders are also eager for any progress on Trump’s Gaza peace plan, and will debate ways to keep the 27-nation bloc involved in proceedings.

The EU is the world’s biggest provider of aid to Palestinians but has little leverage over Israel – in part because European nations are divided over how to handle the conflict – and it has struggled to play a role of consequence.

It’s role in the war in Ukraine is clearer, and the summit takes place as Russian armed forces strike at the conflict-torn country’s power grid just as the weather starts to turn colder.

Earlier this week, Ukraine’s strongest European backers who form part of the “coalition of the willing” said they opposed any push to make Ukraine surrender land captured by Russian forces in return for peace, as Trump most recently has suggested.

The U.K. will host a meeting of the members of that coalition of more than 30 countries on Friday.

On the EU side, leaders intend to push forward with plans to use billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine’s war efforts, despite some misgivings about the consequences of such a step.

The biggest tranche of frozen assets – some $225 billion worth – are held in Belgium, and the Belgian government has been reluctant to take any risks on using the money without firm guarantees from its European partners.

Ukraine’s budget and military needs for 2026 and 2027 are estimated to total around $153 billion.

The EU leaders are also likely to sign off on a new “road map” to prepare Europe to defend itself against a Russian attack by the end of the decade. Top officials believe that Russian could be ready to take aim at another European country within 3-5 years.

[TITLE]Shale Giants Slash Thousands of Jobs as Lower Prices Bite:

U.S. oil and gas producers seek efficiencies and cost reductions amid lower oil prices this year compared to 2024 levels.

Fresh off multi-billion-dollar mergers and acquisitions in the 2023-2024 period, many major producers in the U.S. shale patch are restructuring businesses and operations.

The result so far has been a series of announcements and reports of workforce reductions across geographies and basins.

The latest such report came this week, by Reuters, which reported a memo it had seen regarding layoffs at the Canadian business of U.S. oil and gas giant ConocoPhillips.

The U.S. firm, one of the world’s largest independent exploration and production companies based on production and proven reserves, has its Canadian headquarters in Calgary, Alberta.

ConocoPhillips Canada develops the Surmont oil sands project in the Athabasca region of northeastern Alberta and opportunities in the unconventional liquids-rich Montney play in northeastern British Columbia.

According to the memo on workforce reductions, ConocoPhillips’ employees in Calgary will be notified virtually on November 5, and those in Surmont and Montney will be told in person on the following day, sources told Reuters.

More than 300 companies, including heavyweights such as Swiggy ITC , and Larsen & Toubro, are set to release their financial results this week, offering investors and analysts a comprehensive snapshot of corporate performance for the July–September quarter of FY26.The flood of earnings announcements will give markets a clearer picture of how companies navigated a quarter marked by volatile commodity prices, uneven consumer demand, and shifting monetary conditions. With results spanning major sectors — from energy and manufacturing to banking and consumer goods — the disclosures are expected to help map the trajectory of both corporate profitability and broader economic trends.According to Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President of Research at Religare Broking, corporate earnings have played a key role in lifting market sentiment in recent weeks. “Better-than-expected Q2 earnings from major companies lifted overall sentiment, further supported by renewed optimism over potential India–U.S. trade collaborations and easing tariff tensions between the U.S. and China,” Mishra said.He added that sustained participation by foreign investors — who have announced more than Rs 50,000 crore in fresh investments in India’s financial and banking sectors — has also reinforced the positive tone in the markets.Adani Energy Solutions, Bata India, Canara HSBC Life Insurance Company, Chennai Petroleum Corporation, Indian Oil Corporation, Indus Towers, JK Tyre & Industries, Jubilant Ingrevia, KFin Technologies, Mahindra Logistics, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, PNB Housing Finance, Raymond, SRF, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, Supreme Industries, Tamilnad Mercantile Bank, Tata Investment CorporationAdani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas, Blue Dart Express, CarTrade Tech, Computer Age Management Services, CreditAccess Grameen, DCM Shriram, Happiest Minds Technologies, ICRA, Ideaforge Technology, Jindal Steel, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, Newgen Software Technologies, NIIT, Novartis India, Shree Cement, Star Health and Allied Insurance Company, Sundram Fasteners, Tata Capital, TVS Motor Company63 Moons Technologies, APL Apollo Tubes, Apar Industries, Bharat Heavy Electricals, Brigade Enterprises, CG Power and Industrial Solutions, Coal India, Fino Payments Bank, HeidelbergCement India, Larsen & Toubro, LIC Housing Finance, Mahanagar Gas, NLC India, PB Fintech, Quess Corp, RailTel Corporation of India, Radico Khaitan, United Breweries, Varun Beverages, V-Guard IndustriesAbhishek Finlease, Adani Power, Canara Bank, Cipla, Dabur India, DLF, Exide Industries, Gillette India, ITC, LT Foods, Manappuram Finance, Mphasis, Navin Fluorine International, Nippon Life India Asset Management, Pidilite Industries, Swiggy, Union Bank of India, United Spirits, Vedant Fashions, Adani PowerACC, Bank of Baroda, Bharat Electronics, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Equitas Small Finance Bank, Godrej Consumer Products, Maruti Suzuki India, Patanjali Foods, Schaeffler India, Shriram Finance, Zensar TechnologiesJK Cement, Orient Cement, SBFC Finance, Taj GVK Hotels & Resorts, Urban CompanyAlso read | Ola Electric vs Ather Energy shares: Which EV bet looks stronger for your portfolio right now?

[TITLE]Trump targets federal employees working on conservation and environmental protection:
[TEXT]
This story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The Trump administration moved last Monday to slash federal jobs across two key environmental and conservation agencies, targeting employees who work on scientific research and the enforcement of anti-pollution laws.

At the Environmental Protection Agency, staff received a new round of furlough notices as funding dwindles amid the government shutdown. The Department of the Interior disclosed plans to permanently cut more than 2,000 positions, according to a court filing by its chief personnel officer.

The Interior Department layoffs, also known as a “reduction in force,” are at the center of ongoing litigation over President Donald Trump and his administration’s efforts to further gut the federal workforce.

Monday’s filing came in response to a judge’s order requiring the Interior Department to disclose its layoff plans for unionized employees. The administration said it intends to eliminate 2,050 Interior Department positions, a decision made before the government shutdown began.

That timing contradicts Trump’s recent claim that government layoffs stemmed from the shutdown.

Most of the planned cuts would hit the U.S. Geological Survey, or USGS, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service’s regional offices, and Interior’s main headquarters, according to the filing.

The Interior Department manages national parks, wildlife refuges, and other public lands. It oversees environmental and wildlife conservation, fulfills trust obligations to Alaska Natives and Native American tribes, and conducts scientific research on endangered species, water resources, and natural hazards like flooding and wildfires so officials can better respond to them.

Those research positions would be especially hard hit by the planned layoffs, including projects focused on the Great Lakes ecosystems and the USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center in Missouri, where scientists study toxic contaminants such as PFAS, a class of chemicals Trump’s health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has pledged to address.

Asked for comment, the White House referred questions to the Interior Department, which did not respond.

Environmental groups described the move as part of a broader campaign by Trump and his administration to eliminate research and data collection on environmental contamination after carrying out what EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the largest rollback of environmental protections in U.S. history.

“This plan would eviscerate the core science that every American depends on,” said Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the conservation group the Center for Western Priorities, in a statement about the new Interior Department cuts revealed last week.

Rokala said the planned cuts “would devastate scientific research across the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, and Great Lakes,” while harming workers who “make our parks and public lands the envy of the world.”

Rokala also said that Monday’s filing revealed only the planned layoffs for unionized employees: “We don’t know how many non-union offices and positions are also on the chopping block.”

At the EPA, the new furlough notices arrived as the agency’s funding dries up. Earlier this month, Trump said the shutdown was an opportunity to dismantle “Democrat programs that we want to close up or we never wanted to happen.” He has repeatedly cast environmental protection, conservation, and related public health issues as “woke” and left-wing.

Some of the country’s key environmental protections, and in fact the EPA itself, date back to the Republican Nixon administration.

“Only Trump’s EPA would lay off the people who protect our kids from breathing polluted air and drinking contaminated water but keep the pesticide office open to greenlight more poisons,” said J.W. Glass, EPA policy specialist at the conservation organization Center for Biological Diversity.

Glass, in a written statement, accused the administration of using the shutdown to dismantle the EPA, leaving “our communities paying the price.”

EPA press secretary Carolyn Holran said in a written statement that the suggestion that the furloughs are part of a deliberate campaign to dismantle the EPA “is both inaccurate and unfair to the dedicated EPA employees who continue working to protect human health and the environment.”

Holran blamed Democrats for the government shutdown and said the EPA was taking a “calculated approach” to ensure “that we remain able to deliver on presidential priorities and avoid actions that directly impact or harm the American people.”

Asked for details about the number of furlough notices sent and which offices they impact, Holran called it “a ridiculous question to ask.”

In a written statement, Peter Murchie, senior director at the nonprofit Environmental Protection Network and a former EPA official, called on Congress to intervene and stop the “systematic dismantling.”

“The health harms facing American families — cancer, childhood asthma, infertility, organ failure — don’t pause for politics,” Murchie said. “When EPA’s expert staff are sent home, large parts of the agency’s work simply stop.”

[TITLE]Germany is doing to itself what even its defeat in WWII couldn’t:
[TEXT]
Once, the US wanted the country deindustrialized but ultimately decided against it – now, Berlin’s incompetent authorities are wrecking it themselves

By Tarik Cyril Amar , a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory

By Tarik Cyril Amar , a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory

Toward the end of World War II in Europe, the US government pondered a plan to not only demilitarize but also disintegrate and deindustrialize postwar Germany.

Named after its main proponent, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, the Morgenthau Plan proceeded from the insane assumption that “it is a fallacy that Europe needs a strong industrial Germany.” If it had been implemented, the remains of defeated Germany would have been deliberately turned into a post-industrial wasteland.

But then the Cold War happened, everyone, East and West, wanted their Germans making modern things in factories again, and so it was Marshall Plan in and Morgenthau Plan out. Lucky Germans.

Now the US-Soviet Cold War has been over for a third of a century already. You’d think that for the Germans – finally free of the odd obligation to kill each other on behalf of Washington and Moscow in case of World War Three and (sort of) happily re-united – Morgenthau’s dark fantasies would just be a tale of bad times long gone-by.

But there you would underestimate the often badly overlooked German gift for eccentricity. In reality, post-Cold War Germany’s governments have set out on a resolute course of self-Morgenthauing economic auto-asphyxiation, adapting and obstinately clinging to policies that look as if they had been deliberately devised to deindustrialize and wreck their own country.

How can this be? For starters consider the case of global chemistry giant BASF: “What’s happening to Germany you’ll see first at BASF,” some say. And they have a point. Until recently, the German-headquartered company was considered the “crown jewel” of the country’s industry. Now, Germany is “mired in its longest period of stagnation since the Second World War” – says not Moscow’s RT but London’s FT – and BASF exemplifies much of what went so very, very badly wrong.

Like much of German business in general, the country’s traditionally powerful and vital chemical industry “is stuck in the greatest crisis” since, at least, the early 1990s. Since 2019, German industry as a whole has shed a total of almost a quarter-million jobs.

Regarding BASF – originally founded in 1865 smack in the middle of modern Germany’s Time of Founders (“Gründerzeit”) as the “Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik” – it is true that it is still the largest chemical industry company in the world with subsidiaries in over 80 countries and 112,000 employees. But in Germany, at its original production site in the city of Ludwigshafen – for now still the largest such facility worldwide – it has been enduring billions in losses for years. As a whole, BASF’s business at home, in Germany, is contributing nothing to the company’s profits, at best.

If BASF is still doing alright, then not because but in spite of its historic German base. As its former CEO Martin Brudermuller (now with Mercedes Benz, in the other key German industry) put it in 2024, BASF was “making profits everywhere in the world, except Germany.” And that – together with China’s rise (now constituting half of the global chemical industry market) – is why BASF is reducing operations not only in Ludwigshafen but all of Germany, while building a giant new production site in Zhanjiang in China.

An up-to-date “mirror image” of the company’s trademark full-integration or composite production concept (“Verbund”) originally pioneered in Ludwigshafen, BASF Zhanjiang is the greatest single investment in the company’s history. In short, Germany’s chemical giant is cloning and optimizing its historic core – not elsewhere in Germany, not in Europe, and not in the US either, but in China. While Brudermüller, an outspoken man, has been warning of Germany’s comprehensive deindustrialization. And though no one will admit it, it is easy to guess what will happen to the dated, ever less competitive original in Ludwigshafen.

The open secret of success of BASF’s Ludwigshafen flagship was two-fold: German science and engineering, management, and work ethic played a key role, but so did inexpensive gas from Russia, used as energy source and raw material. Both the German and the Russian inputs were indispensable. Ludwigshafen’s success, as much of the German economy, was a direct result of successful German-Russian, mutually beneficial cooperation. No longer.

The EU and Berlin’s – both, ironically, run by Germans – self-destructive policy of re-defining mutual benefits as oh-so-horrible “dependence” to be replaced with some real dependence on the incredibly reliable US and cutting themselves off from Russian natural gas is the decisive factor in Ludwigshafen’s ongoing decline. There are other problems as well, but without this suicidal strategy, longstanding issues – such as, for instance bureaucracy, a mishandled “green transition,” and US tariff warfare – could be resolved or, at least, managed. Yet without inexpensive energy and raw materials, the decline is irreversible. Indeed, by now, BASF is warning of scenarios in which Ludwigshafen will soon stop its gradual descent, but not with recovery. Instead a total crash may loom. The cause? A massive potential gas shortage.

None of the above is exceptional in today’s Germany. Of course, economic sectors and individual companies have their specific features. But what matters is how much BASF’s fate represents that of Germany’s economy as a whole. Except the latter is usually worse, often much worse, as in lethal.

Consider a few data points: Germany is experiencing a twenty-year peak of insolvencies, as the co-leader of the AfD (Alternative for Germany) party has recently pointed out. And it’s not just Germany’s opposition (and single biggest party in the polls). Even the thoroughly government-aligned de facto state-TV channel ZDF has to admit that “Made in Germany is crumbling.” From 2024 to 2025 alone, 2.1% of Germany’s industrial jobs have gone missing.

If you are one of the many Germans busy developing and assembling cars, your chances of employment survival have been even worse: in that sector, a whopping 51,000 or 7% of jobs were axed in just one year – and there’s no end in sight. Profits have been cratering: by over 50% between January and June at Mercedes-Benz, by over a third in the second quarter of 2025 at VW.

And that was before some very stable geniuses in Washington made the Dutch government steal – that’s the correct term – Chinese-owned chip maker Nexperia. Inevitably, China is retaliating. Unlike Germany, it’s not run by strange people who take things such as, say, a terrorist attack by “allies” on vital infrastructure with an obsequious grin and a bow. Nexperia is duly out of action and German car companies are among the worst hit by the resulting supply shortages: Hildegard Müller, the head of their national association, has warned of “significant production restrictions, depending on circumstances even full interruptions.” Slow claps for you again, great master trade war strategists of the West.

If BASF’s Ludwigshafen is ground zero for the (still) relatively slow decline of the German chemical industry, Stuttgart is shaping up to be one of the cities most devastated by the more rapid fall of the car makers. With 17%, or a quarter of a million, of Stuttgart’s population earning their living from cars – whether at Mercedes-Benz or Porsche directly or one of the many local suppliers, such as much less well-known Mahle or Eberspächer – the city has reason to be afraid.

[TITLE]Virtual PPAs, the next big thing in RE:
[TEXT]
Renewable energy (RE) adoption in India is poised for a major boost.

The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has released draft guidelines on ‘virtual power purchase agreements’ (VPPAs) for public comments. As many as 61 responses were received — including from global corporations such as Google and Accenture, Indian renewable developers like ACME and ReNew Power, energy exchanges, think tanks such as CEEW and Prayas Energy, and the government’s auctioning agency SECI. A public hearing has also been held. In short, India will soon have a regulatory framework for VPPAs — guaranteeing RE developers a minimum price (see box). The new regime is expected to drive the creation of more renewable capacity.

Merchant RE projects

In India, merchant RE plants — projects not tied to long-term PPAs — have been slow to take off because banks hesitate to finance projects without an assured revenue. VPPAs resolve this issue by guaranteeing a minimum price.

Rohit Bajaj, Joint Managing Director, Indian Energy Exchange, believes VPPAs are “poised to enhance merchant power capacity in India”. These financial contracts, he told businessline, “serve a dual purpose — ensuring stable revenue for RE merchant generators while enabling corporates to procure green attributes cost-effectively, to offset their carbon emissions”.

While there is no authoritative data on India’s existing merchant power capacity, estimates put it at 25 GW; VPPAs are expected to increase this significantly.

REC carry-forward

CERC is now finalising the VPPA guidelines. In the meantime, it has introduced one key change — allowing the carry-forward of the renewable energy certificates (RECs) issued to a VPPA counterparty from one year to subsequent years. Beyond this, it is not clear what the final framework will look like, though the 61 comments received will undoubtedly shape the outcome.

Here’s a look at some of the key stakeholder suggestions.

Several, including ReNew, have urged the CERC to elevate the draft from guidelines to regulations, to give it a stronger legal standing.

The draft currently states: “A consumer or a designated consumer may enter into a long-term bilateral virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with a renewable energy (RE) generator at a mutually agreed price (VPPA price).”

ReNew and the National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) have questioned the restriction to long-term agreements, suggesting that short-term VPPAs should also be allowed. “Given the presence of merchant renewable projects, there is already a viable opportunity for short- to medium-term VPPAs, including durations as short as six to seven months,” ReNew has said.

Expanded scope

The most common demand from stakeholders is to expand the benefits of VPPAs beyond RECs. The draft guidelines currently restrict VPPA participation to companies seeking RECs.

The hows and whys of virtual power purchase agreements A VPPA is an agreement between a renewable energy company (such as ReNew) and a corporate consumer (like Google). Under this agreement, the developer does not supply energy directly to the consumer — hence the term virtual. The two parties agree on a ‘strike price’. The developer sells power to third parties — either through long- or short-term PPAs or on energy exchanges. If the sale fetches a price lower than the strike price, the VPPA counterparty (say, Google) pays the developer the difference. If the market price is higher, the developer pays the difference to the VPPA counterparty (in a typical contract). In return, the corporate counterparty receives the green attributes of the energy — in India’s case, these are renewable energy certificates (RECs), as specified in the draft guidelines. Purchasing these green attributes allows the company to meet its renewable purchase obligations or sustainability targets. VPPAs thus guarantee a minimum price to the RE developer, allowing them to sell electricity on the market — via energy exchanges — without locking into long-term PPAs.

Accenture notes, “The current draft restricts VPPA buyers to consumers or designated consumers, with a focus on REC acquisition only. Expanding this to allow foreign corporations — especially those seeking energy attribute certificates (EACs) for ESG reporting — can unlock significant foreign capital and increase RE capacity deployment.”

Google echoes this, saying, “Parties should be free to agree on the type of environmental attributes (EAs) transferred under the VPPA and not be restricted to only RECs.”

It has suggested including “any other globally recognised EA registry, such as International-RECs.

Similarly, the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum argues that “limiting the use of VPPAs to compliance entities to meet renewable consumption obligations would be detrimental to the Indian renewable energy sector by constraining the availability of offtake agreements, thereby limiting financing and project development”.

Under the current draft, RECs issued under a VPPA cannot be traded — they can only be used to meet compliance obligations.

NSEFI, however, wants trading freedom for VPPA counterparties.

SECI’s stand

The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), the government’s nodal agency for renewable auctions, has suggested discouraging plain solar projects in VPPAs.

SECI warns that too many solar-only projects could flood the grid during solar hours, pushing down exchange prices and creating a large gap between the VPPA strike price and the market price — ultimately imposing a financial burden on VPPA consumers.

To illustrate, the corporation noted that the average day-ahead market price between 9 am and 6 pm dropped from ₹3.22 per kWh in May 2024 to ₹1.97 per kWh in May 2025.

[TITLE]Carney’s Nuclear Detour: Darlington’s SMRs Will Raise Prices, Emissions, & Political Risks:
[TEXT]
In October 2025, the federal government officially designated the four-unit SMR build at Ontario Power Generation’s Darlington site as a “Major Project” and invested $2 billion through the Canada Growth Fund, alongside $1 billion from the provincial Building Ontario Fund, signalling that the federal government views the SMR programme both as a national-industrial priority and a pillar of Canada’s clean-power strategy. This upfront funding and symbolic anointment embed the SMR scheme at the core of Prime Minister Carney’s climate-industrial agenda—tying his legacy to its success and subjecting his broader ambitions to the reactor’s performance.

Ontario once led the world in nuclear engineering. The province built its grid around CANDU reactors designed, manufactured, and operated by Canadians. Those heavy-water machines provided decades of reliable electricity and created thousands of high-skill jobs. They also anchored a domestic supply chain that made Canada one of the few countries with full nuclear sovereignty. Now, as the world turns toward flexible, low-cost renewables, Ontario is making a different bet. With Mark Carney’s backing and the provincial government’s enthusiasm, it is building the first GE Hitachi small modular reactor at Darlington. It is a decision that will look visionary to some today, but in a decade it will look like a strategic error.

Carney’s ambition to build a clean, secure industrial future for Canada is genuine. His economic credibility and climate focus give him the moral authority to act. But in aligning himself with an American-owned, first-of-a-kind reactor technology, he has made a choice that will come back to haunt him. The project promises jobs, energy security, and innovation, but it delivers higher costs, greater complexity, and new dependencies. The evidence is already clear. Ontario Power Generation’s Darlington site is the province’s largest single employer, and the refurbishment program for the existing reactors is providing steady, high-paying work. The new SMRs are not needed to sustain that prosperity. What they will bring is financial exposure and an energy mix less aligned with what Ontario actually needs.

Darlington alone employs roughly 15,000 people directly and indirectly in a region with only 70,000 workers. Those jobs are secure for decades through ongoing refurbishment and operations, with the current CANDU reactors expected to be extended to 2065, an unprecedented 80+ years. Average wages are among the highest in the province. It is by far the largest and best paying employer around. Adding four small modular reactors does not create a new employment base. It diverts billions of dollars toward a first-of-a-kind nuclear experiment that will be built by foreign technology vendors and managed under unfamiliar regulatory frameworks. For the region, this is not an economic development project. It is an engineering gamble wrapped in the rhetoric of innovation.

The GE Hitachi BWRX-300 is a light-water boiling reactor that bears little resemblance to the CANDU systems Ontario’s nuclear workforce knows intimately. It requires enriched uranium, not natural fuel. It has a fixed refuelling cycle, not continuous on-power refuelling. It depends on U.S. supply chains for core components and fuel assemblies. Ontario’s nuclear professionals, from control-room operators to maintenance crews, have spent their careers mastering CANDU systems. They will have to relearn an entirely different technology under a regulatory regime still being defined. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has no operating precedent for this design, and its licensing process must be harmonized with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The result is a project that combines first-of-a-kind technical risk with first-of-its-kind regulatory uncertainty.

Bent Flyvbjerg’s megaproject database—now in the tens of thousands of cases across sectors—shows nuclear among the worst performers for cost and schedule reliability, with a dedicated nuclear new-build reference class of roughly 194 projects used in recent risk analyses. From that record, reference class forecasting (RCF) gives decision-grade uplifts: at P50, add

[TITLE]The Race to Recycle Renewable Energy:
[TEXT]
With the renewable energy sector growing rapidly on a global scale, as many governments pursue a green transition, the need to recycle more components has become evident. Finding innovative ways to recycle renewable energy equipment could help significantly cut costs and reduce waste, further supporting the sector’s green ambitions. There is great potential for a range of components to be reused and recycled, from solar panels to wind turbines and electric vehicle (EV) batteries. However, greater research and investment must be contributed to the sector to improve practices and make recycling options more accessible. As interest and investment in renewable energy increase, we are seeing more technological advancements across the sector. Wind turbines have become bigger and more powerful, while solar panels have been getting cheaper and more efficient. This means that old technologies are becoming outdated more quickly, leading to their replacement. Once a renewable energy component reaches the end of its lifecycle, it is normally removed and replaced by something bigger, stronger, and better. What is done with these old components varies massively from country to country.

Often, old turbine blades or photovoltaic (PV) panels are stockpiled for long periods of time as companies decide what to do with them. Waste from the renewable energy sector is significant, with Europe expected to dismantle around 14,000 wind turbines by the end of the decade. This would result in between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes of blade waste, according to WindEurope. Meanwhile, in the United States, wind turbine blade waste could reach anywhere between 200,000 to 370,000 tonnes a year by 2050.

Greater innovation in recycling could help reduce waste and cut costs by putting old components to good use. However, recycling old renewable energy parts is not always so simple. Steel and other materials that can be easily recycled account for around 85 to 90 percent of the makeup of a wind turbine, but the glass fibre or carbon fibre blades are much more complicated to recycle. The difficulties in recycling have not put operators off, with more innovative solutions being seen year on year. In a bid to become more sustainable, after years of discarding old blades and other components, several wind firms have pledged to invest in recycling operations to prevent old components from going to landfill.

In Scotland, old blades from the Hagshaw Hill windfarm are being recycled to provide a hybrid polymer to be used to produce precast concrete alternatives or replace virgin plastics. Meanwhile, Spanish energy firm Iberdrola aims to transform 10,000 tonnes of blade waste annually at its blade recycling facility on the Iberian Peninsula. It will use glass fibres and resins from the turbines to produce new blades to be used across a range of sectors, from aerospace to construction.

In the solar energy sector, various innovations are being seen. For example, in Brisbane, Australia, solar panels are being transformed into silver and copper. Operators are removing aluminium and wires from PVs that can no longer produce energy to grind them up into plastic, glass, silicon, silver, and copper. Pan Pacific Recycling is now processing around 30,000 panels a year and hopes to eventually increase its annual capacity to 240,000 panels.

Global solar panel waste is currently far higher than the recycling capacity for this waste, meaning that greater investment is needed in the sector to expand capacity and improve sustainability by preventing old solar panels from going to landfill. In addition, experts suggest that many of the solar panels being replaced with more efficient models are still capable of producing energy and could be reused in a different context rather than discarded. Several startups, such as Australian Second Life Solar, are working to encourage the reuse of old solar panels in alternative settings to provide clean energy and prevent unnecessary waste.

Some of the greatest advancements have been seen in EV battery recycling, as companies worldwide strive to improve their critical mineral supply chains. The lithium supply used for EV battery production is finite, meaning that once supplies are depleted, we will no longer be able to produce this type of battery. However, extracting the lithium from old EV batteries could allow EV makers to reuse the critical mineral, rather than relying wholly on mining projects for their lithium supply. Other minerals that can be extracted from these batteries include nickel, cobalt, and graphite.

Various companies from different regions of the world are now investing in expanding and improving recycling practices, although the industry’s recycling capacity still falls far behind the production of new wind turbine blades and solar panels, suggesting that greater funding is needed to accelerate the global component recycling capacity. In addition, governments could encourage companies to invest in recycling activities by introducing stricter rules and regulations on renewable energy waste, thereby helping the industry to become more sustainable.

[TITLE]UAE Pioneers Gigascale Renewable Energy Project:
[TEXT]
This project is projected to avoid 5.7 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually, create over 10,000 jobs, and serve as a global blueprint for nations seeking to meet clean energy objectives and power rapidly expanding technology sectors.

Developed by Masdar and EWEC, the facility is expected to be operational by 2027 and will utilize AI-enhanced forecasting to overcome the intermittency challenges of traditional renewable sources.

The UAE has commenced construction on a $6 billion project that combines a 5.2 GW solar plant with a 19 GWh battery storage system, aiming to provide one gigawatt of continuous renewable energy.

The United Arab Emirates has broken ground on a combined solar power and battery storage facility designed to deliver one gigawatt (GW) of continuous, round-the-clock baseload renewable energy. The project, described by developers as the largest and most technologically advanced of its kind, represents a capital investment exceeding $6 billion.

The facility is being developed by Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company PJSC – Masdar and Emirates Water and Electricity Company (EWEC). Once operational in 2027, the system aims to overcome the intermittency challenges traditionally associated with renewable energy sources like solar and wind, according to statements from the companies.

Project Scope and Technology

The new infrastructure will integrate a 5.2 GW solar photovoltaic (PV) plant with a 19 gigawatt-hours (GWh) battery energy storage system. Developers state the design incorporates advanced technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced forecasting and intelligent dispatch capabilities for predictive analytics and system optimization.

The groundbreaking ceremony was witnessed by Sheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Chairman of the Presidential Court for Development and Fallen Heroes' Affairs, underscoring the government's support for the initiative.

According to the developers, the facility is projected to avoid approximately 5.7 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually while providing power at a globally competitive tariff.

Industry Context and Strategic Implications

This development is being framed within the context of the growing global demand for secure, clean, and reliable power sources, particularly to meet the energy needs of rapidly expanding technology sectors.

Ahmed Ali Alshamsi, Chief Executive Officer at Emirates Water and Electricity Company, highlighted the role of the project in supporting the burgeoning digital economy. "Abu Dhabi and the UAE are a global hub for artificial intelligence research, innovation, and adoption, and this project will ensure that the energy needs of this key sector are met sustainably, powering the next generation of economic growth," Alshamsi said.

The integration of gigascale solar power generation with a large-capacity battery system is seen by Masdar as a potential "blueprint" for other nations seeking to meet clean energy objectives by ensuring consistent power supply from renewables. Masdar, which has existing battery storage investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, is targeting an overall project portfolio capacity across clean energy technologies of 100 GW by 2030.

Executive Commentary and Economic Impact

Executives emphasized the strategic importance of the project in advancing renewable energy integration.

Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Chairman of Masdar, called the project a step towards "redefining the role of renewable energy for the information age." He noted that the breakthrough is the culmination of Masdar's two decades of work in renewables.

Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Chief Executive Officer at Masdar, echoed this sentiment, stating that the project is "the largest and most ambitious in Masdar's history" and demonstrates that renewable energy can be dispatched continuously. "By overcoming the challenge of intermittency, we can provide sustainable power to meet fast-growing demand from advancements in artificial intelligence and other technologies," Al Ramahi added.

Beyond energy production, the project's development is expected to create more than 10,000 jobs and drive the establishment of new manufacturing and service facilities within the UAE. This aligns with the UAE's broader national strategy to position AI as a cornerstone of its economic diversification efforts.

The successful commission of the facility in 2027 would mark a significant step toward demonstrating the commercial viability of large-scale, continuous baseload power from combined solar and storage technologies, potentially shifting conventional reliance on fossil fuels for grid stability. The effort underscores the country's commitment to energy diversification and its role in the transition to non-intermittent renewable power.

[TITLE]Energy Secretary Chris Wright Proposes Changes to Power American Manufacturing, Lead AI Innovation:
[TEXT]
Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to initiate a rulemaking to accelerate American manufacturing and ensure that the United States continues to lead in artificial intelligence.

Wright wrote to commissioners of the FERC:

To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity. To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.

The Energy secretary wrote that, while FERC has historically not exerted jurisdiction over load interconnections to the interstate transmission system, he believes that interconnection of large loads falls “squarely within” FERC’s jurisdiction.

He explained why this move is so important for American manufacturing and AI development:

This Administration is committed to revitalizing domestic manufacturing and driving American AI innovation, both of which will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation’s interstate transmission system. We must do so efficiently, fairly, and expeditiously. Thus, pursuant to my authority under section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, I attach for the Commission’s consideration the enclosed advance notice of proposed rulemaking.

Yahoo News wrote:

This type of rule change has been eagerly anticipated by tech and power executives in the aftermath of the FERC’s rejection of a request by Talen Energy Corp. to directly supply an Amazon.com Inc. data center from a Pennsylvania nuclear plant. But it also risks pushback from states grappling with soaring power demand from data centers, new factories, and electric vehicles — and the resulting higher utility bills.

Wright’s proposed rule would give data centers an expedited review if they include additional power plants or agree to limit power usage if the regional grid system faces increased strain, such as during a heatwave.

Data center companies cheered the news.

“Then there’d be a lot more certainty when you start a project that you’d know when it would be energized,” Raul Martynek, CEO of DataBank, which operates about 75 data centers across the country, said.

He added, “On behalf of the American people, and given the urgency of this issue, I look forward to your consideration and final action (no later than April 30, 2026).”

[TITLE]FirstEnergy expects peak load to grow 45% by 2035 on data centers:
[TEXT]
Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

BY THE NUMBERS: FirstEnergy Q3 2025 3.8 GW and 11.7 GW contracted and potential data centers Up 30% and 92%, respectively, since February. 39.3 million MWh weather-adjusted sales Up 0.8% from the year-ago period, with a 1.4% jump in residential sales, a 0.7% increase in commercial sales and a 0.3% bump in industrial sales. $5.5 billion 2025 CapEx Up 10% from previous estimate. $441 million net income Up 5.3% from the year-ago period, partly driven by a $225 million rate hike in Pennsylvania.

Surging data center forecast

FirstEnergy expects its system peak load will jump 15 GW, or 45%, from 33.5 GW this year to 48.5 GW in 2035, driven by data center development, Brian Tierney, FirstEnergy chairman, president and CEO, said Thursday during an earnings conference call with analysts. FirstEnergy doesn’t plan to develop “large load” tariffs for data centers, according to Tierney.

“We think that we can enter into terms and conditions that make the data center developers responsible for the incremental investment that we're making and protect our existing customers,” he said.

Electric sales set to grow

In the first nine months this year, electric sales by FirstEnergy utilities grew 1% from the same period in 2024, but were essentially flat on a weather-adjusted basis, Jon Taylor, FirstEnergy chief financial officer, said. However, based on ramp-up schedules of some data centers, the company expects “more meaningful” increases in industrial load starting in the fourth quarter, he said.

“I'm talking like mid-single digits by the time we get to maybe Q2, to maybe even higher than that, significantly higher than that by the time we get to the fourth quarter of next year,” Taylor said.

Transmission drives capital spending

With the PJM Interconnection’s peak load expected to grow by close to 48 GW, or 30%, by 2035, FirstEnergy’s utilities — which sit in the middle of the grid operator’s footprint — are poised to support the growth by building transmission infrastructure, according to Tierney.
