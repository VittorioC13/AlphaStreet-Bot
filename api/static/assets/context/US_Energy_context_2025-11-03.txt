[TITLE]AI Energy Crunch: Hyperscalers Turn to Small Nuclear Reactors:
[TEXT]
Despite global momentum and policy support, the SMR revolution faces substantial execution risks, including cost control, supply chain maturity, regulatory bottlenecks, and the need for robust financing structures to ensure timely and on-budget delivery.

Key industry players such as NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy are moving SMRs from conceptual designs to billion-dollar commercial projects, with notable advancements in deployment programs, industrial heat applications, and corporate energy strategies.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are experiencing a significant comeback, driven by their scalability, siting flexibility, and ability to provide carbon-free baseload power, crucial for rising AI energy demands and industrial decarbonization.

After decades of stagnation, nuclear energy is staging a comeback — and it’s no longer the gigawatt-scale reactors of the past leading the charge. Small modular reactors, once dismissed as niche or speculative, have moved to the center of a global energy and geopolitical pivot. Their appeal lies in scalability, siting flexibility, and the promise of dedicated, carbon-free baseload power—a vital ingredient in an era defined by the AI energy demand surge and industrial decarbonization.

The shift from ambitious blueprints to billion-dollar commercial projects is officially underway, driven by key industry announcements throughout 2025. Some of the leading stakeholders include NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy.

NuScale Power: From De-Risking To Gigawatt-Scale Deployment

NuScale Power has cemented its role as the bellwether of the SMR movement, but its commercial success will depend on disciplined financing. In early September 2025, the company announced a landmark collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority and ENTRA1 Energy to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of its SMR technology within the TVA service region — the largest SMR commitment in U.S. history.

The structure of this deal is as important as its scale. Rather than placing the full “first-of-a-kind” financial and regulatory burden on TVA, ENTRA1 will reportedly finance, own, and operate the facilities, selling power back to TVA through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement. This off-balance-sheet approach could prove pivotal, unlocking institutional investment and moving SMRs from demonstration projects into a bankable, utility-scale asset class.

[TITLE]Oil Prices Unmoved by Trump-Xi Meeting:
[TEXT]
Significant developments in the energy sector include Gunvor acquiring Lukoil's international assets, Mozambique disputing the budget of a major LNG project, and new oil and gas exploration and production initiatives in Greenland and Colombia.

Geopolitical and economic factors are influencing regional oil markets, with Saudi Arabia expected to cut Asian prices, the US and China temporarily suspending port fees, and India continuing to import Russian crude.

The Trump-Xi meeting did not impact oil markets, with the upcoming OPEC+ meeting expected to be the next major market driver, likely resulting in a modest output increase.

This report provides an overview of global oil and natural gas market trends, including price changes, production data, and geopolitical developments impacting energy.

The Trump-Xi meeting in South Korea, frequently lauded as a potential icebreaker moment between the United States and China, failed to provide any momentum to oil markets as discussions centered more on fentanyl than crude oil or LNG. As such, this weekend’s OPEC+ meeting is the next trend-setting market for the market at large, even if this time around reports all seem to indicate the same outcome - a 137,000 b/d ‘modest’ increase. Thus, ICE Brent could linger around $65 per barrel for slightly longer.

Saudi Arabia Expected to Cut Prices. The combination of higher Middle Eastern exports and a flattening Dubai futures curve will prompt Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) to slash its Asian formula prices to multi-month lows, with analysts predicting a month-over-month cut of $1.00 to $1.50 per barrel.

US, China Temporarily Suspend Port Fees. China’s Commerce Ministry announced that Beijing and Washington have agreed to suspend reciprocal port fees that have buoyed shipping markets in recent months, however the Trump administration is still yet to confirm the one-year suspension.

India Never Stopped Buying Russian. India’s largest refiner Indian Oil bought five cargoes of Russian oil for December arrival from non-sanctioned entities this week, equivalent to a 120,000 b/d supply, saying that the company will continue importing Russian barrels if they are in compliance with sanctions.

Gunvor Mops Up Lukoil Assets. Russia’s second-largest oil producer Lukoil (MCX:LKOH) said it had accepted an offer from global trading house Gunvor to buy its international assets, including Iraq’s giant West Qurna 2 oil field (producing 480,000 b/d) and several refineries across Europe.

Mozambique to Dispute LNG Development. The Mozambique government said it would challenge the updated budget and schedule of TotalEnergies’ (NYSE:TTE) 13 mtpa Mozambique LNG project, following reports that costs had risen by 4.5 billion in the four years that it was stalled due to security concerns.

China’s Teapots Come Back to Life. Improved refinery margins and returning downstream capacity have lifted refinery runs in China’s Shandong region to 71% in October, the highest reading in 2025 so far, however many will be forced to curb throughput as Beijing’s crude import quotas are running out.

Nigeria to Tax Fuel Imports. The Nigerian government has approved a 15% import duty on gasoline and diesel, part of its long-standing plan to boost domestic refining as the shaky performance of the 650,000 b/d Dangote refinery didn’t lead to a full halt in imports, still importing 170,000 b/d of gasoline.

Greenland Oil Drilling, Here We Go. According to US oil services firm Sproule, the gross recoverable resources of Greenland are estimated to be around 13 billion barrels with most of those volumes located in the untapped Jameson Basin in the east of the island, spurring drilling interest for 2026-2027.

Brazil Expands into Colombia’s Gas. Colombia’s state-controlled oil firm Ecopetrol (NYSE:EC) has formed a joint venture with Brazil’s Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) to market natural gas from the offshore Sirius block, holding an estimated 6 Tcf of natural gas and believed to start producing by 2029-2030.

Henry Hub Balloons on Surging LNG Exports. As the Henry Hub gas futures started trading December-delivery contracts, the US gas benchmark surpassed the $4 per MMBtu mark and jumped almost 20% from where the November 2025 contract settled on Wednesday, buoyed by robust feedgas demand.

Qatar Locks In More Indian Demand. QatarEnergy signed a 17-year sales and purchase agreement with India’s Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation to deliver 1 mtpa of liquefied gas, with first deliveries starting in 2026 on a delivered ex-ship basis and pricing believed to be near mid-12% of the Brent slope.

Kuwait Floods Asia with More Crude. Kuwait has sold 3 million barrels of extra crude to Asia after an unplanned outage at its giant 615,000 b/d Al Zour refinery, coming after a fire on October 21, lowered the country’s own oil needs, adding to oversupply concerns in the Asian markets.

Doctor Copper Surges Again. Copper is set to log a third straight monthly gain after hitting an all-time nominal high of $11,200 per metric tonne this Wednesday, only to subside towards the end of the week on a stronger dollar, boosted by hedge funds increasing their long positions to a 8-month high.

Jakarta (ANTARA) - The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) announced that BP gas stations have purchased 100,000 barrels of base fuel from Pertamina Patra Niaga."That is correct (as a result of negotiations between BP and Pertamina). The volume is 100,000 barrels," the ministry's Director General of Oil and Gas, Laode Sulaeman, confirmed here on Friday.According to him, the sale and purchase agreement has enabled BP gas stations to resume sales of RON 92 or BP 92 fuel.Besides BP, Sulaeman stated that other private gas station operators have also agreed to negotiate with the state-owned oil company, Pertamina. However, he declined to provide further details until fuel stocks at each station have fully recovered.Regarding fuel purchases from Pertamina, PT Aneka Petroindo Raya (BP-AKR) emphasized that the base fuel supply had undergone quality testing under the supervision of a trusted independent surveyor to ensure compliance with Indonesian government specifications and BP International standards."Our priority is clear: BP 92 is back in stock with consistent product quality. This focus on quality reflects our long-term commitment to building trusted energy services in Indonesia," BP-AKR President Director Vanda Laura stated.Laura noted that importing base fuel through a government-established mechanism is a temporary solution to ensure business continuity, a step BP-AKR has taken carefully and responsibly to address fuel shortages.Fuel shortages have affected several private gas stations since mid-August 2025, with Vivo, Shell, and BP outlets experiencing limited supplies by mid-October.To address the issue, the government advised private operators to cooperate with Pertamina to maintain supply continuity.Since then, negotiations have been ongoing between private gas station management entities, the ESDM Ministry, and Pertamina.ESDM Minister Bahlil Lahadalia also instructed private gas station operators to use Pertamina's import quota to restore fuel stocks at their stations.After two months of negotiations, fuel supplies at BP gas stations are now beginning to recover.

[TITLE]Shell to Sign Exclusive Oil Exploration Deal with Angola:
[TEXT]
One of Africa’s biggest oil producers, Angola, will sign next week an exclusive agreement with Shell under which the supermajor will explore and potentially develop several offshore blocks, Angola’s oil and gas agency ANPG has said.

“This event marks a historic moment for the Angolan oil sector, consolidating Shell's presence in Angola, an ANPG statement said, as carried by Reuters.

Under the agreement Shell will explore Blocks 19, 34, and 35 and several ultra-deepwater blocks as Angola looks to revive its exploration and production sector following years of underinvestment and supply restrictions under the deals within OPEC, which the country quit effective January 2024.

Earlier this year, Angola’s crude output slipped below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time in two and a half years and for the first time since one of Africa’s biggest oil producers quit OPEC.

Angola’s motivation to exit the cartel after 16 years was a spat with the OPEC and OPEC+ members

[TITLE]Trump tariffs to raise costs, delay oil and gas projects in 2026, report says:
[TEXT]
US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are set to raise operating costs, disrupt supply chains and weaken investment momentum for the oil and gas industry in 2026, a report published by Deloitte showed on Wednesday.

Why it’s important

The energy industry relies heavily on global supply chains and internationally sourced materials such as drilling rigs, valves, compressors and specialised steel are central to their operations.

US tariffs on these components and other key input materials, including steel, aluminum and copper, could increase material and service costs across the value chain by 4 per cent to 40 per cent, potentially compressing industry margins, the report said.

Context

The US has imposed tariffs on a wide range of imports, including 10 per cent to 25 per cent on crude feedstocks not covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and 50 per cent on steel, aluminum and copper.

The tariffs could reshape the oil and gas industry’s cost structure and add uncertainty around feedstock sourcing, Deloitte said in its report.

Key points

Inflation and financial uncertainty sparked by the tariffs could push final investment decisions (FIDs) and offshore greenfield projects worth more than $50 billion to 2026 or later.

As a result, operators may struggle to recover higher costs, which could eventually dampen investment activity in the sector, the report said.

As input costs climb and cascade through the value chain in the form of pricing adjustments, Deloitte expects oil and gas companies will renegotiate contracts with escalation and force majeure clauses to share risks and limit exposure to volatility.

What’s next

The ongoing disruptions could drive companies to prioritise supply chain resilience over lowest-cost sourcing and shift to domestic or non-tariffed suppliers and use foreign trade zones or tariff reclassification to manage duties, Deloitte said.

“This shift is significant given the United States’ reliance on imports, with nearly 40 per cent of oil country tubular goods demand in 2024 met through foreign sources.”

[TITLE]Nepal Calls for Renewable Energy Investment - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
Nepal Invites International Investment in Renewable Energy

New Delhi – The Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation, Physical Infrastructure and Transport, and Urban Development, Kulman Ghising, has called upon the international community to invest in Nepal’s hydropower and solar power, as well as other renewable energy sources. Minister Ghising highlighted that Nepal’s journey towards clean energy is entering a crucial new era.

“With immense hydropower potential, growing solar energy capacity, and expanding cross-border transmission lines and energy connections, we have the potential to sustainably energize the region,” Ghising stated. “I invite our friendly nations and partners to invest in Nepal, invest in renewable energy, and become part of a brighter and greener future for all.”

Addressing a thematic session on “Envisioning Regional and Global Interconnections for Large-Scale Clean Energy Transition,” Ghising served as a key speaker on the sustainable development of vast energy potential and the roadmap for trilateral electricity trade (Nepal-India-Bangladesh). He emphasized that Nepal’s hydropower is a strategic enabler for clean energy transformation in South Asia.

He noted that Nepal’s hydropower is a crucial resource for a resilient and stable grid in the region. Ghising highlighted Nepal’s vision to become a major exporter of clean and green energy to South Asia, with hydropower production not only contributing to the country’s development but also supporting regional sustainability. He mentioned that Nepal and India are jointly identifying and constructing high-capacity transmission line infrastructure with the goal of exporting 15,000 MW of renewable energy by 2035.

Nepal is rich in energy resources, with approximately 83,000 MW of hydropower potential and around 42,000 MW of pumped storage hydropower potential. These resources are clean, renewable, and ideally complement the solar and wind energy of Nepal’s neighboring countries, he added.

He explained that as grids develop regionally and globally, interconnected transmission networks enable the flow of renewable energy between different regions, balancing electricity demand and supply, reducing costs, and expanding access.

“This vision aligns perfectly with the ‘One Sun, One World, One Grid’ concept, where clean energy flows seamlessly and sustainably across borders,” he said. “To turn this vision into reality, regional countries must move towards an integrated electricity market.”

“Ensuring a seamless, non-discriminatory, and unrestricted flow of green energy requires transparent regulations, standardization of norms, and open access to transmission infrastructure – key elements for attracting private investment and ensuring long-term sustainability.”

Ghising emphasized that cross-border energy cooperation is at the heart of Nepal’s clean energy vision. He stressed the need to strengthen transmission infrastructure between not only Nepal and India but also India and Bangladesh to establish a fully integrated grid among the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) countries, facilitating effective regional integration of electricity.

He called for further strengthening regional and international cooperation to address and mitigate the serious damage that climate change is inflicting on electricity systems and livelihoods.

Minister Ghising stated, “Another crucial aspect of sustainability is the resilience of our energy infrastructure to cope with the increasing impacts of climate change. Although Nepal’s contribution to carbon emissions is negligible, frequent floods and droughts are causing serious damage to our electricity systems and livelihoods, often requiring large-scale reconstruction. Therefore, strengthening climate-resilient infrastructure is our national priority, and we call for further strengthening regional and international cooperation to address and mitigate these climate-induced damages.” He reiterated the importance of investment in renewable energy for a sustainable future.

[TITLE]US electric utilities entering investment ‘super-cycle,’ says Morningstar DBRS:
[TEXT]
U.S. electric utilities are entering a five-year capital expenditure “super-cycle” as they build out transmission and generation networks to meet new demand from data centers, Morningstar DBRS said in a Monday research note.

“Investment in electricity infrastructure is projected to be $1.4 trillion from 2025 to 2030, double the amount invested in the prior 10 years,” the firm said. And based on data from the North American Electric Reliability Corp., Morningstar said many regions can expect load growth to increase from previously estimated 6.1% to around 11.6% over the next decade.

“The challenges posed by the rapid buildout of data centers are overlaid on existing concerns for most utilities, including decarbonization and guaranteeing the reliability of grid infrastructure while increasing the contribution of renewable power,” Morningstar said. “The projected surge in demand provides opportunities for utilities that must be counterbalanced with structural changes and regulatory support for utilities and rate payers.”

"We anticipate that regulated utilities with supportive regulatory commissions, solid credit ratings, and access to capital markets will deploy the needed capex to take advantage of the data center boom," Bukola Folashakin, Morningstar assistant vice president of corporate ratings, said in a statement. "We expect this capex investment in turn to make such utility locations attractive for more data center construction, potentially creating a cycle of increased revenue for as long as data centers remain economically viable."

Some states — Morningstar named California, Texas, and Louisiana — will see elevated risks of resource inadequacy next year that “in extreme conditions, could trigger electricity shortfalls,” according to the note.

Morningstar’s analysis mirror’s recent capital expenditure estimates from the Edison Electric Institute, which expects U.S electricity generation to grow “for the foreseeable future.” The group, which represents investor-owned utilities, said generation rose 3% in 2024 and generation investments as a share of the industry’s total capital expenditures have risen for four straight years.

The rapid rise in electricity demand, following decades of stagnation, will challenge utilities in a few ways, according to Morningstar.

Uncertainty around needed data center capacity “makes it challenging for utilities to accurately forecast future power demand and the required investment,” according to the report. And those data centers bring demand surges that are driving “higher tolls for other customer segments,” which “will be exacerbated as more data centers become operational.”

Meeting the demand requires massive utility investment but “traditional funding sources are inadequate to meet future investment needs,” Morningstar said. “Utilities are increasingly looking to private capital to fill funding gaps,” while increased ratepayer-funded investments lead to regulatory lag.
