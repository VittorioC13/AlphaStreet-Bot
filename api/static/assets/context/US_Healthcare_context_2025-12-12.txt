[TITLE]Telix and Varian Announce Strategic Theranostics-EBRT Clinical Collaboration:
[TEXT]
MELBOURNE, Australia and PALO ALTO, Calif., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, NASDAQ: TLX, “Telix”) today announces a strategic clinical collaboration with Varian, a Siemens Healthineers company and global leader in radiation oncology, to develop novel clinical applications that combine Telix’s theranostic products and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).

EBRT is a widely used and validated treatment suitable for most solid malignant tumors. This treatment is typically delivered by radiation oncologists who play a central role in managing cancer across multiple stages of the patient journey. The role of EBRT and radiation oncology in treating cancer could potentially be enhanced by integrating with therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals and precision diagnostics. Working with Varian, a key player in EBRT, Telix will explore how theranostics can be used more effectively by radiation oncologists to enhance patient selection and deliver targeted treatment.

The first area of investigational focus is PSMA-PET1 imaging for prostate cancer radiotherapy patients. Telix and Varian aim to identify opportunities to utilize Gozellix® (kit for the preparation of gallium-68 (68Ga) gozetotide injection) and Illuccix® (kit for the preparation of gallium-68 (68Ga) gozetotide injection)2 in selecting patients for EBRT, developing personalized treatment plans (particularly in the context of Varian’s Ethos adaptive radiotherapy), and monitoring responses to treatment. The agreement supports both company-sponsored and investigator-led clinical studies, enabling robust clinical exploration of novel approaches.

While the initial focus is on PSMA imaging, the collaboration has been implemented as a general framework for future co-development opportunities, with broad clinical applicability. This includes other PET imaging candidates in Telix’s pipeline, such as TLX250-CDx (Zircaix®3) and TLX101-CDx (Pixclara®3), as well as potential future therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. By combining radiopharmaceutical theranostics with Varian’s EBRT technology, the companies believe radiation oncologists are uniquely positioned to lead both definitive and palliative treatment strategies.

Dr. Arthur Kaindl, Head of Varian, said, "Collaborating with Telix opens a powerful pathway to embed precision imaging and theranostics into the radiation therapy workflow, advancing how we personalize and optimize treatment decisions. By combining Telix’s strength in molecular imaging and radiopharmaceuticals with Varian’s leadership in radiation therapy and treatment planning, we are shaping a future of more targeted, patient-focused cancer care."

Dr. Christian Behrenbruch, Group CEO and Managing Director, Telix, said, "This strategic partnership with Varian represents a transformative opportunity to bring precision imaging into the heart of radiation oncology. Integrating theranostics into EBRT has the potential to improve patient outcomes. And by combining Telix’s innovation in molecular imaging with Varian’s global leadership in cancer treatment technologies, we are building alliances to explore new frontiers in personalized cancer care."

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION (GOZELLIX)

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Risk for Misinterpretation

Image interpretation errors can occur with GOZELLIX PET. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer, and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Gallium Ga-68 gozetotide uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non-malignant processes such as Paget’s disease, fibrous dysplasia, and osteophytosis. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended.

Imaging Prior to Initial Definitive or Suspected Recurrence Therapy

The performance of GOZELLIX for imaging of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels and by site of disease. The performance of GOZELLIX for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by Gleason score.

Radiation Risks

Gallium Ga-68 gozetotide contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer. Ensure safe handling to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and healthcare providers. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration.

Hypersensitivity Reactions to Sulfites

Ascorbic Acid Stabilizer contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The safety of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide was evaluated in 960 patients in the PSMA-PreRP and PSMABCR studies, each receiving one dose of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide. The average injected activity was 188.7 ± 40.7 MBq (5.1 ± 1.1 mCi). The most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness, occurring at a rate of <1%.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

Androgen deprivation therapy and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway, such as androgen receptor antagonists, can result in changes in uptake of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide in prostate cancer. The effect of these therapies on performance of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide PET has not been established.

[TITLE]GENFIT: GNS561 Shows Promising Antitumor Activity in Combination Therapy:
[TEXT]
Highly encouraging early data from the ongoing Phase 1b study evaluating investigational drug GNS561 with a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) in KRAS mutated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), positioning this novel combination as a potential new therapeutic approach for difficult-to-treat cancers: No dose limiting toxicity reached to date, enabling recruitment of a third patient cohort GNS561 and MEKi combination demonstrated disease stabilization in all evaluable patients with evidence of tumor shrinkage in a subset of patients, warranting further investigation Recommended Phase 2 doses expected for 1H26

Lille (France), Cambridge (Massachusetts, United States), Zurich (Switzerland), December 10, 2025 - GENFIT (Euronext: GNFT), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases, today reports encouraging preliminary Phase 1b data from its CCA clinical trial evaluating GNS561 in combination.

Clinical trial context and objective

CCA is a rare and aggressive cancer of the bile ducts, often diagnosed at an advanced stage. The unmet medical need is characterized by strong limitations in current treatments and poor prognosis. GNS561 is an investigational small molecule that targets PPT1, leading to autophagy inhibition and lysosomal dysfunction, which disrupt cancer cell survival mechanisms. By blocking autophagy, GNS561 aims to promote cancer cell death and may enhance sensitivity to other treatments. Combining GNS561 with a MEKi aims to unlock synergistic potential by simultaneously targeting autophagy and MAPK signaling pathways. In the on-going Phase 1b study, patients with advanced KRAS mutated CCA who have previously failed one or two lines of prior standard of care therapies are enrolled to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GNS561 when given in combination with trametinib, a MEKi, and to identify the recommended doses of the combination to be administered in Phase 2.

Preliminary results

The analysis evaluated 9 patients with measurable disease at baseline, 4 of them reaching tumor assessment at week 6. At this point, the combination therapy demonstrated:

Disease stabilization observed in all 4 evaluated patients, who had all shown disease progression during previous treatment;

Tumor shrinkage in a subgroup of patients with the best response showing a 20% reduction approaching the partial response (PR) threshold.

Achieving disease control and tumor reduction in such heavily pretreated patient population with advanced CCA is a significant signal of antitumor activity.

Clinical Impact

The results to date show a potential to address a critical unmet medical need in oncology. Patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed on multiple prior therapies have limited treatment options and poor prognoses. The ability of the investigational drug GNS561 associated with a MEKi to achieve disease control in this challenging patient population would represent a significant advance. The consistent pattern of disease stabilization observed across all evaluated patients, combined with objective tumor shrinkage in a subgroup of heavily pretreated patients, suggests the combination has the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit. Optimization of dosing and patient selection could lead to further improvement in response rates.

Dr. Mark Yarchoan, Associate Professor of Oncology at John Hopkins Medicine (Baltimore, MD, USA), principal investigator of the program, commented: “Advanced KRAS-mutated cholangiocarcinoma remains a formidable clinical challenge, and the emerging activity seen in this initial study is encouraging. Because MEK inhibition alone has historically shown limited efficacy in this setting, the early signs of benefit with dual targeting of autophagy and MAPK signaling provide meaningful rationale for continued evaluation of this combination strategy.”

Pascal Prigent, Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT, added: “These early results suggest a potential breakthrough for patients with limited options, and we are committed to advancing this program rapidly to individuals impacted by cholangiocarcinoma. We will also explore GNS561 potential in combination with other agents and in other tumors where autophagy inhibition plays a central role.”

Next development steps

Phase 1b dose escalation will continue as planned to confirm the activity signal, with new data for the next patient cohorts expected in 1Q26. These results will be used to establish the recommended Phase 2 combination doses, with completion expected in 1H26. Phase 2 initiation is targeted for 2H26.

[TITLE]NovaBridge Presents Positive Ragistomig Phase 1 Dose Expansion Data at ESMO-IO:
[TEXT]
Ragistomig is a 4-1BB X PD-L1 bispecific antibody, designed to treat patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including those who have relapsed or are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors, a multi-billion dollar pillar of cancer care, hampered by widespread resistance

The study achieved its objective, as the new Q6W extended dosing interval produced encouraging anti-tumor efficacy and immunological data in prior immune-oncology refractory or relapsed patients including anti-PD- (L)1 checkpoint inhibitor, with improved safety, compared to the prior Q2W schedule

The poster includes positive immunological data on CD8+ cell proliferation and memory T-cell activation

ROCKVILLE, Md., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NovaBridge Biosciences (Nasdaq: NBP) (NovaBridge or the Company) a global biotechnology platform company committed to accelerating access to innovative medicines, today announced the presentation of new data from the expanded 3mg/kg every 6 week (Q6W) Phase 1 dosing study for ragistomig, a bispecific 4-1BB X PD-L1 antibody, in a poster at the European Society for Medical Oncology – Immuno-Oncology Congress 2025 (ESMO-IO 2025) by co-developer ABL Bio. The poster (Poster 257P), presented by Gerald Falchook, MD, Director of the Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) at HealthONE Denver, showed the new Q6W schedule demonstrated consistent monotherapy antitumor activity with improved immunological endpoints and tolerability.

“We are very pleased by the impressive ragistomig Phase 1 dose expansion data presented today at ESMO-IO, indicating that the prior Q2W schedule demonstrated meaningful clinical activity, and that the new Q6W dosing interval provides comparable efficacy with a more favorable safety profile. The study achieved its objective by extending the therapeutic window and supports the advancement of ragistomig into combination studies. We are particularly encouraged by the improved safety profile, with only 5% of patients experiencing ≥ Grade 3 liver function elevation, while maintaining comparable immune-mediated activity. These observations, combined with comparable confirmed responses and durable immune engagement, underpins our optimism that ragistomig has the potential to make an important contribution to more effective treatment outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumor cancers,” said Phillip Dennis, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer of NovaBridge.

“Ragistomig was designed to overcome resistance in patients who relapsed after treatment with checkpoint inhibitors, a multi-billion dollar pillar of cancer treatment. The ragistomig data presented at ESMO-IO build on the promising results presented at ASCO 2024. This program aligns well with our strategy to partner with innovators around the world to advance transformative and potentially breakthrough therapies. We are enthusiastic to collaborate with our partner, ABL Bio, to initiate combination studies,” said Sean Fu, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of NovaBridge.

Ragistomig Phase 1 Monotherapy Q6W Data (per October 22, 2025 data cut-off):

Ragistomig demonstrated comparable anti-tumor efficacy for the Q6W dose schedule compared to the Q2W regimen (58.8% disease control rate (DCR) at Q6W compared to 64.3% at Q2W)

Ragistomig exhibited a favorable and improved safety profile, with 1/20 Grade ≥3 liver function test elevations (LFT), no treatment discontinuations due to treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and no reported cytokine release syndrome (CRS)

Overall immune cell activity was consistent between the Q6W and Q2W dosing. Immune cell pharmacodynamics with the Q6W dosing demonstrated expansion of effector memory and CD8+ T cells, with attenuated Treg expansion, indicating durable immune engagement

The data suggest evaluation of the ongoing 5 mg/kg Q6W dosing cohort and evaluation of ragistomig in future combination studies

Patient Characteristics:

20 heavily pre-treated subjects received 3 mg/kg Q6W ragistomig. In this group, 100% were previously treated with immuno-oncology therapies and 70% had previously received ≥3 lines of systemic treatment and exhausted all available standard treatment options

Dosing is underway in 10 patients who are receiving 5 mg/kg Q6W ragistomig

Efficacy Results, based on 17 evaluable patients receiving 3 mg/kg Q6W v. 14 evaluable patients with 3 mg/kg Q2W

ABL503 monotherapy

efficacy profiile 3 mgkg Q6W

(N=17) 3 mg/kg Q2W

(N=14) Objective Response Rate, n (%) 2 (11.8%) 4 (28.6%) Disease Control Rate, n (%) 10 (58.8%) 9 (64.3%) Complete response 0 (0%) 1 (7.1%) Partial response 2 (11.8%) 3 (21.4%) Stable disease 8 (47.1%) 5 (35.7%) Progressive disease 7 (41.2%) 5 (35.7%)

Safety Data, based on 20 evaluable patients receiving 3 mg/kg Q6W v. 15 evaluable patients with 3 mg/kg Q2W

An improved safety profile was observed with the 3 mg/kg Q6W regimen

The 3 mg/kg Q6W regimen was identified as an optimal potential regimen for combination strategies

1/20 subjects (5%) experienced ≥Grade 3 LFT elevation at Q6W dosing v. 40% at Q2W dosing

TEAEs ≥Grade 3 were 50% at the Q6W (10/20) v. 66.7% (10/15) at 3 mg/kg Q2W. In the Q6W dose, these TEAEs, including LFT elevations, decreased platelet count, anemia and decreased neutrophil count, were recovered within 3-14 days (with or without treatment interventions), with no discontinuations

No cases of CRS were reported with either dosing schedule

Immunology Data:

Effector and memory CD8+ T cell subsets were increased, with comparable fold-changes between dosing groups, suggesting that immune mediated pharmacodynamic activity may contribute to efficacy

CTLA+ Treg frequencies remained near baseline in the Q6W group, suggesting a more favorable effector-to-regulatory balance

[TITLE]GRI Bio Announces Positive Topline Data from its Phase 2a Study in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (“IPF”):
[TEXT]
Study met its primary endpoint demonstrating that GRI-0621 was well tolerated over 12 weeks of treatment, with no drug-related severe or serious adverse events and no increase in GI issues when used with existing approved treatments

Study met its secondary endpoints and demonstrated improvement in biomarkers of collagen turnover, suggesting a resolution of fibrosis and repair of the alveolar basement membrane

GRI-0621 demonstrated increases in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 6 and 12 weeks of treatment

39% of GRI-0621 treated subjects experienced an increase in FVC at 12 weeks compared to 80% of subjects treated with placebo experiencing a decline in FVC at 12 weeks

LA JOLLA, CA, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GRI Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ: GRI) (“GRI Bio” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company advancing an innovative pipeline of immune cell modulators for the treatment of inflammatory, fibrotic and autoimmune diseases, today announced positive topline data from the Phase 2a GRI-0621-IPF-02 clinical trial evaluating GRI-0621 for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (“IPF”). The study met its primary endpoint and secondary endpoints demonstrating that GRI-0621 was well tolerated over a 12-week treatment period, consistent with earlier studies evaluating over 1,700 subjects treated for up to a year. Subjects treated with GRI-0621 also displayed improvements in serum biomarkers of collagen turnover suggesting fibrosis resolution and induction of an alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism.

“Treatment of patients with IPF in the GRI-0621 Phase 2a trial was observed to be safe and well tolerated through the completion of the 12-week study,” said Toby Maher, MD, PhD, Professor of Clinical Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, USC Los Angeles. “Secondary endpoints related to the effect of GRI-0621 on biomarkers associated with disease progression provided evidence that GRI-0621 maintains a net anti-fibrotic effect compared to standard of care. Lastly, FVC improved in patients treated with GRI-0621, with more patients experiencing an increase at 12 weeks than with standard of care. We look forward to watching the clinical advancement of GRI-0621 as a potential treatment for patients with IPF.”

Study Met Its Primary Endpoint, Demonstrating a Safety Profile Differentiated From Existing Treatment Options

No safety or tolerability concerns were observed in the subjects enrolled at 12 weeks of treatment, with dry skin, dry lips, muscle and joint pain as the most common adverse events reported. There were no increases in cough (0% in the GRI-0621-treated arm compared to 25% in the placebo arm) or gastrointestinal disorders reported in the GRI-0621 arm compared to the placebo arm (diarrhea reported in 13% versus 33%, respectively). 80% of the subjects enrolled were taking background pirfenidone or nintedanib.

Study Met Secondary Endpoints Suggestive of Disease-Modifying Activity, Reversing Fibrosis and Inducing a Lung Repair Mechanism

Subjects treated with GRI-0621 also displayed improvements in serum biomarkers of collagen turnover, suggesting fibrosis resolution and induction of an alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism. PRO-C6, a biomarker of type VI collagen synthesis, was observed to decrease from baseline (-3%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and increase (+12%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. C6M, a biomarker of type VI collagen degradation, was observed to increase from baseline (+6%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and decrease (-3%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. The type VI collagen remodeling rate shifted from fibrogenic (+10%; continued worsening of fibrosis) in placebo-treated subjects to fibrolytic (-7%; resolution of fibrosis), suggestive of GRI-0621 inducing resolution of fibrosis in treated subjects compared to continued worsening of fibrosis in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care.

Destruction of the alveolar basement membrane is a hallmark of IPF, and type IV collagen synthesis, and repair of the basement membrane, is a crucial step in lung tissue repair. PRO-C4, a biomarker of type IV collagen synthesis, was observed to increase from baseline (+9%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and decrease (-2%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. C4Ma3, a biomarker of type IV collagen degradation, was observed to decrease in GRI-0621 treated subjects compared to subjects treated with placebo and standard of care (10% vs 24%, respectively). The type IV collagen remodeling rate shifted from fibrolytic (-16%; continued destruction of the basement membrane) in placebo-treated subjects to neutral (0%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects, suggestive of GRI-0621 inducing a lung tissue repair mechanism and repair of the alveolar basement membrane compared to placebo-treated subjects.

Interestingly, the alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism is supported by differential gene expression data of AT1 cell re-epithelialization of the basement membrane. GRI-0621 was observed to significantly reduce DLK1 (-6.46 LogFC; FDR 0.0003), a gene involved in lung epithelial AT2 cell fate plasticity and regeneration of alveolar AT1 cells (Sawhney, et al. (2025) Nat Commun 16, 8924; Li, et al. (2025) Resp Res 26 188), another critical step in alveolar basement membrane repair, compared to subjects treated with placebo and standard.

Reductions in neutrophil and macrophage activity (immune cell biomarkers upregulated in IPF and associated with disease progression) and downregulation of genes associated with fibrosis, disease progression and mortality were also observed in patients treated with GRI-0621 compared to placebo-treated subjects.

“The positive Phase 2a results represent an important milestone for our IPF program and a compelling early signal of GRI-0621’s disease-modifying potential. IPF remains one of the most devastating respiratory diseases, with limited treatment options and a significant need for therapies that can do more than slow decline and address the underlying biology of the disease,” commented Marc Hertz, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of GRI Bio. “In addition to a favorable safety and tolerability profile, GRI-0621 demonstrated meaningful improvement in biomarkers suggesting fibrosis resolution and repair of the alveolar basement membrane. These results reinforce our belief in GRI-0621’s differentiated mechanism and support its potential to go beyond slowing disease progression by directly impacting core drivers of IPF. With this mechanistic proof-of-biology in hand, we are well-positioned to advance toward the next stage of development. We believe GRI-0621 could represent a truly meaningful advance in the IPF treatment landscape, with the potential to create significant value for patients and shareholders alike.”

Study Met Exploratory Endpoints Demonstrating Increased Forced Vital Capacity, With Twice as Many Subjects Observed to Have No Decline in FVC Compared to Standard of Care at 12 Weeks

Placebo-adjusted changes from baseline in FVC increased by 99 ml in the GRI-0621-treated arm and a 139 ml increase in the subset taking both GRI-0621 and standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care. Spirometry is subject to large visit-to-visit variability and is dependent on the individual’s effort, often resulting in data outliers. To minimize the impact of outliers in the dataset, a post hoc data analysis was performed excluding the datapoints with the largest gain or loss in FVC over 12 weeks from both arms. The results of this analysis demonstrated an increase in placebo-adjusted change from baseline in FVC of 54 ml in the GRI-0621-treated arm and an increase of 81 ml in the subset taking both GRI-0621 and standard of care. Overall, 39% of GRI-0621 treated subjects experienced an increase in FVC at 12 weeks compared to 80% of subjects who experienced a decline in FVC at 12 weeks in the placebo-treated arm.

The Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, multinational, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-design, 2-arm study enrolled 35 subjects with IPF who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio for GRI-0621 4.5mg or a placebo. GRI-0621 dose of 4.5mg was compared with a dose of placebo following once daily oral administration for 12 weeks. Concurrently, a sub-study examined the number and activity of immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (“BAL”) fluid in 8 subjects (across various centers). The primary endpoint for the Phase 2a study was safety and tolerability of oral GRI-0621 as assessed by clinical labs, vital signs and adverse events after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints were baseline changes in serum biomarkers collected at week 6 and week 12; an assessment of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GRI-0621 at the week 12 visit of treatment (steady state); and a determination of the pharmacodynamic activity of oral GRI-0621 as measured by inhibition of immune cell activation in blood after 6 weeks and 12 weeks, and from BAL fluid after 12 weeks of treatment in the sub-study. Additional exploratory endpoints for the study included assessment of the effect of GRI-0621 on pulmonary function at baseline and after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment and flow cytometry and differential gene expression at various time points. These results show that GRI-0621’s receptor selectivity is consistent with the toxicity profile observed in earlier studies evaluating oral tazarotene in over 1,700 patients treated for up to 52 weeks.

[TITLE]MediWound Reports New Clinical Data Demonstrating NexoBrid®’s Effectiveness in Preventing Traumatic Tattoos After Abrasion and Blast Injuries:
[TEXT]
MediWound Reports New Clinical Data Demonstrating NexoBrid®’s Effectiveness in Preventing Traumatic Tattoos After Abrasion and Blast Injuries

Prospective clinical data show NexoBrid® removes embedded particles in friction and blast wounds, reducing pigmented wound surface by >90%

Traumatic tattoos form when dirt, metal, or explosive residue becomes permanently embedded in the skin; findings support further evaluation in acute trauma settings

YAVNE, Israel, December 10, 2025 -- MediWound Ltd. (Nasdaq: MDWD), a global leader in next-generation enzymatic therapeutics for tissue repair, today announced the peer-reviewed publication of new prospective clinical data showing that NexoBrid® substantially reduces embedded particles associated with traumatic tattoos following abrasion and blast injuries.

Traumatic tattoos occur when high-velocity accidents or blasts drive materials such as asphalt, dirt, glass, or metallic particles (shrapnel) into the skin, often leaving not only permanent dark discoloration but also causing aesthetic deformities, functional impairment, and increased risk of inflammation or infection. Current standard of care relies on aggressive non-selective mechanical scrubbing, which may leave embedded particles behind and may risk damage to viable tissue.

The study is published in the Journal of Burn Care & Research, the official journal of the American Burn Association, under the title “Enzymatic Bromelain-based Debridement with NexoBrid®: A New Treatment to Effectively Prevent Traumatic Tattoos After Abrasive Incidents and Explosive Events.”

In this prospective independent study, conducted at Sheba Medical Center’s National Burn Center, 15 patients diagnosed with traumatic tattoos resulting from friction or blast injuries underwent standard mechanical scrubbing to remove loose debris. Residual pigment load was then documented, and patients were treated with NexoBrid within 24 hours of injury under procedural sedation. Pigmentation was reassessed immediately after enzymatic debridement, using computer-based image analysis.

The mean pigmented wound area decreased from 37.5% before NexoBrid application to 2.1% afterward, a 92.5% reduction in pigmented wound surface compared with the post-scrubbing baseline, with every patient showing substantial clearance of foreign particles. In abrasive injuries, an average of 96% of visible pigments were removed, while pigment load in explosive injuries was reduced by 84%. Treatment was well tolerated, performed at bedside, and no treatment-related adverse events were reported during the early post-procedure period.

“In blast injuries and friction burns, where wound depth is highly irregular, NexoBrid provides the precision these cases demand,” said Professor Josef Haik, MD, MPH, Director of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Burn Center at Sheba Medical Center. “We believe the effectiveness of NexoBrid is driven by its selective enzymatic action on damaged skin layers, which helps remove many of the particles embedded within them. In high-energy explosions, some debris may remain lodged in deeper tissues, yet NexoBrid consistently reveals a clean, well-defined wound bed, enabling clinicians to determine the most appropriate next steps.”

[TITLE]GENFIT: GNS561 Shows Promising Antitumor Activity in Combination Therapy:
[TEXT]
Highly encouraging early data from the ongoing Phase 1b study evaluating investigational drug GNS561 with a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) in KRAS mutated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), positioning this novel combination as a potential new therapeutic approach for difficult-to-treat cancers: No dose limiting toxicity reached to date, enabling recruitment of a third patient cohort GNS561 and MEKi combination demonstrated disease stabilization in all evaluable patients with evidence of tumor shrinkage in a subset of patients, warranting further investigation Recommended Phase 2 doses expected for 1H26

Lille (France), Cambridge (Massachusetts, United States), Zurich (Switzerland), December 10, 2025 - GENFIT (Euronext: GNFT), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases, today reports encouraging preliminary Phase 1b data from its CCA clinical trial evaluating GNS561 in combination.

Clinical trial context and objective

CCA is a rare and aggressive cancer of the bile ducts, often diagnosed at an advanced stage. The unmet medical need is characterized by strong limitations in current treatments and poor prognosis. GNS561 is an investigational small molecule that targets PPT1, leading to autophagy inhibition and lysosomal dysfunction, which disrupt cancer cell survival mechanisms. By blocking autophagy, GNS561 aims to promote cancer cell death and may enhance sensitivity to other treatments. Combining GNS561 with a MEKi aims to unlock synergistic potential by simultaneously targeting autophagy and MAPK signaling pathways. In the on-going Phase 1b study, patients with advanced KRAS mutated CCA who have previously failed one or two lines of prior standard of care therapies are enrolled to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GNS561 when given in combination with trametinib, a MEKi, and to identify the recommended doses of the combination to be administered in Phase 2.

Preliminary results

The analysis evaluated 9 patients with measurable disease at baseline, 4 of them reaching tumor assessment at week 6. At this point, the combination therapy demonstrated:

Disease stabilization observed in all 4 evaluated patients, who had all shown disease progression during previous treatment;

Tumor shrinkage in a subgroup of patients with the best response showing a 20% reduction approaching the partial response (PR) threshold.

Achieving disease control and tumor reduction in such heavily pretreated patient population with advanced CCA is a significant signal of antitumor activity.

Clinical Impact

The results to date show a potential to address a critical unmet medical need in oncology. Patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed on multiple prior therapies have limited treatment options and poor prognoses. The ability of the investigational drug GNS561 associated with a MEKi to achieve disease control in this challenging patient population would represent a significant advance. The consistent pattern of disease stabilization observed across all evaluated patients, combined with objective tumor shrinkage in a subgroup of heavily pretreated patients, suggests the combination has the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit. Optimization of dosing and patient selection could lead to further improvement in response rates.

Dr. Mark Yarchoan, Associate Professor of Oncology at John Hopkins Medicine (Baltimore, MD, USA), principal investigator of the program, commented: “Advanced KRAS-mutated cholangiocarcinoma remains a formidable clinical challenge, and the emerging activity seen in this initial study is encouraging. Because MEK inhibition alone has historically shown limited efficacy in this setting, the early signs of benefit with dual targeting of autophagy and MAPK signaling provide meaningful rationale for continued evaluation of this combination strategy.”

Pascal Prigent, Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT, added: “These early results suggest a potential breakthrough for patients with limited options, and we are committed to advancing this program rapidly to individuals impacted by cholangiocarcinoma. We will also explore GNS561 potential in combination with other agents and in other tumors where autophagy inhibition plays a central role.”

Next development steps

Phase 1b dose escalation will continue as planned to confirm the activity signal, with new data for the next patient cohorts expected in 1Q26. These results will be used to establish the recommended Phase 2 combination doses, with completion expected in 1H26. Phase 2 initiation is targeted for 2H26.

[TITLE]Telix and Varian Announce Strategic Theranostics-EBRT Clinical Collaboration:
[TEXT]
MELBOURNE, Australia and PALO ALTO, Calif., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, NASDAQ: TLX, “Telix”) today announces a strategic clinical collaboration with Varian, a Siemens Healthineers company and global leader in radiation oncology, to develop novel clinical applications that combine Telix’s theranostic products and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).

EBRT is a widely used and validated treatment suitable for most solid malignant tumors. This treatment is typically delivered by radiation oncologists who play a central role in managing cancer across multiple stages of the patient journey. The role of EBRT and radiation oncology in treating cancer could potentially be enhanced by integrating with therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals and precision diagnostics. Working with Varian, a key player in EBRT, Telix will explore how theranostics can be used more effectively by radiation oncologists to enhance patient selection and deliver targeted treatment.

The first area of investigational focus is PSMA-PET1 imaging for prostate cancer radiotherapy patients. Telix and Varian aim to identify opportunities to utilize Gozellix® (kit for the preparation of gallium-68 (68Ga) gozetotide injection) and Illuccix® (kit for the preparation of gallium-68 (68Ga) gozetotide injection)2 in selecting patients for EBRT, developing personalized treatment plans (particularly in the context of Varian’s Ethos adaptive radiotherapy), and monitoring responses to treatment. The agreement supports both company-sponsored and investigator-led clinical studies, enabling robust clinical exploration of novel approaches.

While the initial focus is on PSMA imaging, the collaboration has been implemented as a general framework for future co-development opportunities, with broad clinical applicability. This includes other PET imaging candidates in Telix’s pipeline, such as TLX250-CDx (Zircaix®3) and TLX101-CDx (Pixclara®3), as well as potential future therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. By combining radiopharmaceutical theranostics with Varian’s EBRT technology, the companies believe radiation oncologists are uniquely positioned to lead both definitive and palliative treatment strategies.

Dr. Arthur Kaindl, Head of Varian, said, "Collaborating with Telix opens a powerful pathway to embed precision imaging and theranostics into the radiation therapy workflow, advancing how we personalize and optimize treatment decisions. By combining Telix’s strength in molecular imaging and radiopharmaceuticals with Varian’s leadership in radiation therapy and treatment planning, we are shaping a future of more targeted, patient-focused cancer care."

Dr. Christian Behrenbruch, Group CEO and Managing Director, Telix, said, "This strategic partnership with Varian represents a transformative opportunity to bring precision imaging into the heart of radiation oncology. Integrating theranostics into EBRT has the potential to improve patient outcomes. And by combining Telix’s innovation in molecular imaging with Varian’s global leadership in cancer treatment technologies, we are building alliances to explore new frontiers in personalized cancer care."

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION (GOZELLIX)

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Risk for Misinterpretation

Image interpretation errors can occur with GOZELLIX PET. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer, and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Gallium Ga-68 gozetotide uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non-malignant processes such as Paget’s disease, fibrous dysplasia, and osteophytosis. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended.

Imaging Prior to Initial Definitive or Suspected Recurrence Therapy

The performance of GOZELLIX for imaging of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels and by site of disease. The performance of GOZELLIX for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by Gleason score.

Radiation Risks

Gallium Ga-68 gozetotide contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer. Ensure safe handling to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and healthcare providers. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration.

Hypersensitivity Reactions to Sulfites

Ascorbic Acid Stabilizer contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The safety of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide was evaluated in 960 patients in the PSMA-PreRP and PSMABCR studies, each receiving one dose of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide. The average injected activity was 188.7 ± 40.7 MBq (5.1 ± 1.1 mCi). The most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness, occurring at a rate of <1%.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

Androgen deprivation therapy and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway, such as androgen receptor antagonists, can result in changes in uptake of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide in prostate cancer. The effect of these therapies on performance of gallium Ga-68 gozetotide PET has not been established.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION (ILLUCCIX)

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Risk for Misinterpretation

Image interpretation errors can occur with Illuccix PET. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer, and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non-malignant processes such as Paget’s disease, fibrous dysplasia, and osteophytosis. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended.

Imaging Prior to Initial Definitive or Suspected Recurrence Therapy

The performance of Illuccix for imaging of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels and by site of disease. The performance of Illuccix for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by Gleason score.

Radiation Risks

Ensure safe handling to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and healthcare providers. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The safety of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide was evaluated in 960 patients in the PSMA-PreRP and PSMA-BCR studies, each receiving one dose of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide. The average injected activity was 188.7 ± 40.7 MBq (5.1 ± 1.1 mCi). The most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness, occurring at a rate of <1%.

In the VISION study, 1003 patients received one dose of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide intravenously with the amount of radioactivity 167.1 ± 23.1 MBq (4.52 ± 0.62 mCi). Adverse reactions occurring at ≥0.5% in patients with metastatic prostate cancer who received gallium Ga 68 gozetotide injection in the clinical study were fatigue (1.2%), nausea (0.8%), constipation (0.5%), and vomiting (0.5%). Adverse reactions occurring at a rate of < 0.5% in the VISION study were diarrhea, dry mouth, injection site reactions, including injection site hematoma and injection site warmth and chills.
