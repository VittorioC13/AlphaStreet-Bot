Atrial Fibrillation Overview

Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common form of heart rhythm disorder, in which the heartbeat becomes irregular and often rapid. It happens due to abnormal electrical activity in the atria, the upper chambers of the heart, causing them to beat ineffectively. This disrupts smooth blood flow and can cause blood clots, increasing the risk of stroke and other heart-related complications. AFib can appear occasionally, last longer than a week (persistent), or become a long-term condition. Symptoms vary widely in severity.

Typical signs include a racing or fluttering heart, tiredness, dizziness, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort. However, some individuals may not feel any symptoms, a condition known as silent AFib, which is still dangerous. Symptom intensity can vary based on heart rate, existing heart conditions, and overall health.

A variety of factors can lead to AFib. These include high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart failure, valve disorders, and congenital heart abnormalities. Other non-heart-related triggers include overactive thyroid, obesity, diabetes, sleep apnea, and excessive alcohol use. The risk also increases with age. Family history can also contribute, suggesting a genetic link.

In AFib, the heart’s normal electrical rhythm becomes disorganized, often due to abnormal electrical signals arising from areas like the pulmonary veins. These signals cause the atria to quiver instead of contracting properly, leading to an irregular heartbeat. Over time, structural and electrical changes in the atria may occur, making AFib more persistent and harder to treat. Diagnosis is usually made through an electrocardiogram (ECG), with further tests such as Holter monitoring, echocardiography, and blood work to evaluate heart function and identify causes.

Treatment aims to relieve symptoms, prevent complications like stroke, and correct underlying conditions. Common therapies include medications such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and anticoagulants, or electrical cardioversion to restore normal rhythm. In more complex cases, procedures like catheter ablation or surgery are used to eliminate the faulty electrical areas. Lifestyle changes, such as keeping a healthy weight, controlling blood pressure, and limiting alcohol, are also important parts of managing AFib.

[TITLE]NANOBIOTIX Provides Business Update and Reports Half Year 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
PARIS and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO - NASDAQ: NBTX - the “Company”), a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering nanotherapeutic approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases, provided an update on operational progress and announced its half year financial results for the six-month period ended June 30, 2025.

Operational Highlights of the 2025 Half Year Period and To Date

Expanding clinical development program evaluating the potential broad applicability of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) continues to build significant momentum:

First patient dosed in the CONVERGE study, a Johnson & Johnson (“J&J”)-sponsored randomized Phase 2 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) for patients with Stage 3 unresectable non-small cell lung cancer receiving standard of care chemoradiation followed by consolidation durvalumab

First data announced from the completed dose escalation part of a Phase 1 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) as a 2L+ therapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC, sponsored by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center

Announced full data from the completed MD Anderson Phase 1 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in pancreatic cancer along with the launch of a new cohort and expansion of the trial

Achieved regulatory harmonization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) after agreement with health authorities in major European countries to reclassify JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) from a medical device to a drug

Filed a new composition of matter patent for JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) that aims to reinforce the intellectual property foundation supporting the product candidate

First data announced from a Nanobiotix-sponsored Phase 1 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with primary cutaneous melanoma resistant to anti-PD-1

Updated data announced from a Nanobiotix-sponsored Phase 1 study continuing to support JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) plus anti-PD-1 as a potential new 1L or 2L+ option in anti-PD-1 naïve or resistant R/M-HNSCC

Further execution of disciplined financial plan to reinforce pathway to long-term, self-sustained growth:

Strengthened financial position through amendment of the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) global licensing agreement extending cash visibility to mid-2026

In active discussions regarding non-dilutive financing, intended to meaningfully extend its cash runway beyond mid-2026.

Half Year 2025 Financial Results

Revenue and Other Income: Revenue and other income have increased for the six months ended June 30, 2025, up to €26.6 million, compared to €9.3 million for the same period in 2024. Further to J&J amendment letter signed in March 2025 reducing the Company’s funding obligation on the future NANORAY-312 study costs, a positive non-cash revenue impact amounting to €21.2m was recorded in accordance with IFRS15 revenue recognition accounting principles application, offsetting the negative non-cash revenue impact recognized in 2024 results following the transfer of NANORAY-312 study sponsorship to J&J signed at the end of 2024. In addition, revenue towards J&J also included €3.4m of clinical product sales to J&J and R&D tax credit income of 1.7 million.

Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses: R&D expenses consist primarily of preclinical, clinical and manufacturing expenses including employee-related payroll expenses related to the development of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3). These expenses for the six months ending June 30 2025, were €14.5 million compared to €22.0 million for the same period in 2024. This favorable R&D cost decrease was primarily driven by lower clinical development activities in NANORAY-312 study further to the transfer of sponsorship to J&J which has assumed nearly all remaining study expanses, less a small portion of costs that remain covered by the Company.

Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses: SG&A expenses consist primarily of administrative employee-related payroll expenses, legal and other professional fees, patent filing and maintenance fees, and insurance. Total SG&A expenses for the six months ending June 30, 2025, were €11.3 million, which is quite stable compared to €10.8 million for the same period in 2024. This slight unfavorable variance is mainly due to a phasing issue of social contributions expenses.

Net loss: Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the six months ending June 30, 2025, was €5.4 million, or a €0.11 basic loss per share. This compares to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of €21.9 million, or €0.46 basic loss per share, for the same period in 2024.

Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025, were €28.8 million, compared to €49.7 million as of December 31, 2024.

Financial Guidance: Based on the current operating plan and financial projections, the Company anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents of €28.8 million as of June 30, 2025, will fund its operations into mid-2026, similar to its prior guidance.

Going Concern:

In March 2025, the Company and J&J executed an amendment to the License Agreement. The amendment provides that J&J will assume nearly all remaining costs for the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trial through completion, less a small portion of costs that will remain covered by the Company, allowing the Company to extend its cash runway and to reduce its operating cash outflows post this amendment, including the period beyond mid-2026.

With the available €28.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025 and based on its current operating plan, the Company anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be insufficient to fund its operations over the next twelve months following the issuance of interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

These events and conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, the Company may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.

However, as the Company is in active discussions regarding non-dilutive financing intended to meaningfully extend its cash runway beyond the 12 months, the executive board determined it is appropriate to prepare the interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2025, on a going concern basis, assuming the Company will continue to operate for the foreseeable future and to address its liquidity challenges by pursuing activities to generate additional cash inflows and by closely managing its operating expenditures, based on assumptions described in the half-year 2025 financial report.

Availability of the Half Year 2025 Financial Reports

The 2025 half-year financial report has been filed with the French financial market authority (Autorité des marchés financiers). It is available to the public on the Company’s website, www.nanobiotix.com.

Improvement in King’s Sarcoidosis Questionnaire-General Health score at week 48 observed in the 5.0 mg/kg efzofitimod treatment group vs placebo (p=0.0197).

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- aTyr Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATYR) (“aTyr” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and development of first-in-class medicines from its proprietary tRNA synthetase platform, today presented additional findings from the Phase 3 EFZO-FIT™ study of efzofitimod in 268 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, a major form of interstitial lung disease, in a late-breaking oral abstract presentation by Daniel Culver, D.O., Chair of the Department of Pulmonary Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and principal investigator of the study, at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Congress 2025 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

“Building on the positive data we presented in the topline results for the King’s Sarcoidosis Questionnaire (KSQ)-Lung score, the clinical improvements in the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) and KSQ-General Health scores presented at ERS are compelling because these directly address critical symptoms and quality of life measures that profoundly impact pulmonary sarcoidosis patients,” said Sanjay S. Shukla, M.D., M.S., President and Chief Executive Officer of aTyr Pharma. “Crucially, the improvements observed for the KSQ-Lung, FAS and KSQ-General Health scores were achieved rapidly and sustained robustly throughout the study. Despite missing the primary endpoint of the study, efzofitimod has clearly demonstrated the potential to durably improve multiple disease-related health outcomes, including cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and general health. These consistent clinical benefits reinforce our belief in efzofitimod’s potential to meaningfully improve quality of life and reduce reliance on chronic steroids for pulmonary sarcoidosis patients.”

The ERS presentation included analyses of additional pre-specified outcomes that demonstrated clinical improvements in mean change from baseline in the FAS Total Score (p=0.0226) and KSQ-General Health score (p=0.0197) in patients treated with 5.0 mg/kg efzofitimod vs placebo. Treatment with efzofitimod was also associated with a trend toward a greater proportion of patients achieving steroid-free status for at least six months.

As previously reported in the topline results, the study did not meet its primary endpoint of change from baseline in mean daily oral corticosteroid dose at week 48. However, clinical benefit for 5.0 mg/kg efzofitimod was observed across multiple study efficacy parameters at week 48 compared to placebo, including complete steroid withdrawal and KSQ-Lung score improvement (p=0.0196), improvement in KSQ-Lung score change from baseline (p=0.0479), preservation of forced vital capacity and a well-tolerated safety profile.

Note, the study’s statistical analysis plan was designed on a hierarchical assessment basis. Since the primary endpoint was not met, all subsequent statistical testing is reported as nominal findings.

Additionally, increased investment in research and development to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets is fuelling the market's growth, ensuring that more accessible and effective solutions are available for managing EGFR inhibitors induced skin disorders.

EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancers, and colorectal cancer. However, their use often leads to skin disorders, a common side effect that can significantly impact the quality of life for patients. EGFR inhibitors can cause a range of dermatologic issues, such as acneiform rash, xerosis, pruritus, and other inflammatory skin reactions. These skin conditions are primarily attributed to the inhibition of EGFR signalling, which plays a critical role in skin cell growth and maintenance. Symptoms of these skin disorders can include redness, pustules, dryness, and intense itching, which can affect a patient's self-esteem and treatment adherence. In severe cases, these skin issues may lead to treatment interruptions, requiring medical intervention to manage the symptoms and prevent further complications.

The prevalence of EGFR inhibitors induced skin disorders is relatively high among patients undergoing EGFR targeted therapy, especially in individuals with a genetic predisposition. Risk factors for these skin disorders include the type of EGFR inhibitor used, the dosage, and the patient's skin type.

Additionally, genetic factors related to skin sensitivity and immune response play a significant role in the development and severity of these conditions. The diagnosis of EGFR inhibitors induced skin disorders is primarily clinical, based on the presentation of skin lesions and symptoms. The use of skin biopsies or genetic testing may be employed in some cases to assess the underlying mechanisms and personalize treatment.

The market for managing EGFR inhibitors induced skin disorders is driven by the increasing use of targeted therapies in cancer treatment, along with the growing recognition of the dermatologic side effects associated with these treatments. As more patients undergo EGFR inhibitor therapy, there is an increasing need for effective management of the associated skin conditions. The rise in awareness of these side effects, coupled with advancements in dermatologic research, has led to the development of specialized treatments to manage and alleviate these skin disorders. Additionally, improvements in diagnostic techniques, including genetic and biomarker testing, have contributed to earlier detection and more targeted management strategies.

Recent advancements in the treatment of EGFR inhibitors induced skin disorders focus on both preventive and therapeutic approaches. Newer therapies targeting the molecular pathways involved in skin inflammation and immune response are showing promise in clinical trials. Research into personalized medicine, including the identification of genetic markers that predict susceptibility to skin disorders, holds the potential to revolutionize treatment approaches, enabling more tailored and effective interventions.

Despite these advancements, the EGFR inhibitors induced skin disorders market faces several challenges. The management of these side effects is still largely symptomatic, with limited curative options available. The high cost of specialized treatments, coupled with the relatively low incidence of severe skin disorders in the general population, makes it difficult for pharmaceutical companies to justify large-scale investment in drug development for these conditions. Furthermore, the complexity of managing skin disorders in cancer patients, who may be undergoing other treatments simultaneously, complicates the development of standardized treatment protocols.
