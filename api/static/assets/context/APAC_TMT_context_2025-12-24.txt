[TITLE]Asian Stocks Set To Climb On Year-End Rally Hopes: Markets Wrap:
[TEXT]
Focus in Asia will be on China’s one and five-year loan prime rates later today. Commercial banks are likely to keep lending rates unchanged for a seventh month as expectations grow that the People’s Bank of China may ease policy next year.

“A weaker economy heading into the fourth quarter has raised the urgency for more support to prevent a sharper slowdown, with year-end policy meetings hinting slightly more monetary easing in 2026,” said Eric Zhu from Bloomberg Economics. “We see the next rate cut early next year, guiding lending rates lower.”

Crude prices will also be watched, with the US still in pursuit of a third oil tanker near Venezuela as President Donald Trump intensifies an oil blockade on Nicolás Maduro’s government.

Elsewhere, UK and US growth readings are due this week, as well as minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s December policy meeting which may give clues to whether it could hike in February. In Japan, Tokyo inflation as well as national jobs data are due, helping traders assess the outlook for Bank of Japan policy after its cautious hike last week.

Treasury yields edged higher on Friday as New York Fed President John Williams signaled no urgency to cut interest rates again citing recent employment and inflation data. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack echoed that sentiment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, reinforcing expectations for a pause after a string of recent reductions.

While the slew of economic data last week did little to provide clarity on the outlook for US interest rates, traders continue to bet on two rate cuts in 2026.

“We think inflation worries voiced by some hawks on the board are overdone and overall risks in the labor market are clearly to the downside,” Citigroup Inc. strategists including Adam Pickett wrote in a note to clients. But with only one clean set of data to be published prior to next month’s meeting, “this makes current market pricing of a 30% probability of cut in January look fair,” they wrote.

Corporate News

A group of private equity firms led by Permira and Warburg Pincus has agreed to acquire Clearwater Analytics Holdings Inc. in a deal valuing the investment and accounting software maker at $8.4 billion including debt.

Chinese chipmakers are rushing to the IPO market, raising funds that are key to the nation’s goal of technological self-reliance and winning the global race on artificial intelligence.

Seven & i Holdings Co.’s chief executive is pressing its US convenience-stores business to deliver a faster turnaround as the retailer seeks a public listing of the unit to fund new investment and lift shareholder returns.

Some of the main moves in markets:

Stocks

S&P 500 futures rose 0.2% as of 8:31 a.m. Tokyo time

Hang Seng futures rose 0.5%

Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5%

[TITLE]CNBC's The China Connection newsletter: Why Sam’s Club is in a sweet spot as China faces consumption worries:
[TEXT]
This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Sam's Club, the membership-based warehouse retail arm of Walmart, opened its new store in Beijing last month, followed by another one in Shanghai on Tuesday. They drew large crowds, snarling traffic for hours and keeping consumers in long queues.

American membership warehouse clubs are telling something more nuanced: they are finding success in drawing consumers who are willing to pay a hefty membership fee in exchange for premium goods at reasonable prices. On top of that, those stores provide no-frill "treasure-hunt" shopping experiences to sweeten the deal.

Latest data from China showed a key gauge on consumption falling to its weakest level in nearly three years. But it does not capture the full story.

YANGZHOU, CHINA - NOVEMBER 12, 2025 - Citizens shop at the first Sam's Club in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China on November 12, 2025.

Such warehouse stores have long been known as places to buy large quantities of household staples at cheaper prices.

Even though it's less typical in China, where grocery habits have historically skewed toward high-frequency, smaller-basket shopping, this retail model is starting to find its customers.

"Here they do buy it because of the value and niche products," said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidal Wave Solutions. He said residents in his compound often ask in group chats whether others want to split oversized packs.

Sam's Club has leaned into that proposition: a shopping experience and product lineup distinct from conventional supermarkets and online retailers, paired with annual membership fees ranging from 260 yuan to 680 yuan ($37-$97). Shoppers get modest discounts — but the bigger draw is access to curated merchandise that they can't find elsewhere.

"It's a membership model that consumers pay the membership fee upfront, and as a result, they get a full set of services," said Weiwen Han, a Hong Kong-based partner at Bain & Company.

Walmart's success

Walmart entered China in 1996 with its first hypermarket and Sam's Club warehouse chain in Shenzhen.

But the hypermarket format — which combines a supermarket and department store — has lost momentum as digital retail took off. Sprawling online marketplaces, such as Alibaba and JD.com , with their aggressive discounts and convenience, have squeezed out traditional grocers and foreign players such as France-based Carrefour.

Walmart has closed almost 150 hypermarkets in China since 2020, with just 279 stores operational as of July, down from 412 in 2020.

But Sam's Club has proven an enduring strength for the company. The chain has turned warehouses into both shopping destinations and e-commerce delivery hubs, while filling shelves with products consumers can't easily comparison-shop elsewhere, including exclusive items under its house brand Member's Mark and Marketside.

Beyond online grocery ordering and delivery, the clubs offer an offline experience where shoppers can browse and "treasure hunt" — something local e-commerce players struggle to replicate, Han said.

The bet is paying off. Sam's Club has become one of the China's fastest-growing foreign retailers, with 56 outlets nationwide, compared to Costco's seven stores in the country. The market also helped fuel Walmart's strongest net sales growth globally. In the third quarter, Walmart's net sales in China surged 21.9% year on year to $6.1 billion, exceeding the broader Walmart International segment's average growth rate of 10.8%.

'Let's go to Disney'

That blend of curated products and digital convenience helps explain why the model has gained traction with affluent shoppers — and why one store visit can translate into multiple online orders.

Many shoppers won't return often in person. They'll make one trip to browse, then rely on the mobile app for five to 10 deliveries from the same store, said Curtis Alan Ferguson, former president of Coca-Cola Greater China and Korea and now managing partner at Ventech China, a venture capital firm focused on consumer startups.

For some, the appeal is the outing itself — a well-designed, predictable version of discovery shopping. "It's more of a … 'let's go to Disney' here," Ferguson said.

Aside from the physical shopping experience, Walmart says speed is part of the stickiness. "Our team in China delivers extremely fast, with nearly 80% of digital orders delivered within one hour," Doug McMillon, Walmart's CEO, said on the company's third-quarter earnings call.

Ferguson said suppliers also like working with Sam's Club because the volumes can justify unique packaging or sizes. "People bend over backwards to give [Sam's Club] the quality they desire," he said. "If you have … Sam's or Costco pulling your brand … that gives you some other cachet."

Hard to copy — even with local muscle

Few local rivals have managed to seriously challenge Sam's Club and Costco in membership retail — and not for lack of trying.

Alibaba's Freshippo, the Chinese tech giant's grocery business, shuttered its last members-only store in August.

However, regional chain Pangdonglai, which started in Xuchang, a city in the heartland of Henan, is widely viewed as a standout success.

Pangdonglai's appeal is that it operates on a "people-first philosophy" where emotional value and trust matter more than scale, said Olivia Plotnick, founder of Shanghai-based marketing agency Wai Social.

But the Henan store has struggled to scale beyond its home base. Its distinctive culture and high operational standards can be difficult to replicate — and to defend — in larger, more competitive cities, said Plotnick.

"Consumers with real demand for premium value are still willing to pay, but those seeking rational, low-price essentials are shifting toward discount formats," Plotnick said.

As China's consumer slump drags on, the warehouse clubs that offer quality goods at reasonable prices, and provide a store experience that online competitors can't easily rival, are emerging as rare bright spots in the sector.
