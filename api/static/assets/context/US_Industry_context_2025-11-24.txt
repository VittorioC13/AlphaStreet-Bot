[TITLE]Toyota CEO goes full MAGA at NASCAR event as carmaker unveils $912M investment in US manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Toyota on Tuesday unveiled a $912 million investment in US manufacturing, days after CEO Akio Toyoda hosted a red, white and blue NASCAR event in Japan while sporting a Trump-Vance shirt and red MAGA hat.

The Sunday spectacle at Toyota’s Fuji Speedway featured top drivers, a crowd waving American flags and an appearance from US Ambassador to Japan George Glass, according to Automotive News.

The top Toyota exec nodded to recent US-Japan trade tensions during his bold display of pro-Trump sentiment.

“I’m not here to argue whether tariffs are good or bad. Every national leader wants to protect their own industry,” Toyoda said ahead of the endurance race.

“We are exploring ways to make tariffs a winner for everyone. The people we want most to be winners are our customers.”

Japan is facing a roughly 15% baseline tariff on auto imports, slashed down from 27.5% as part of a trade agreement in September.

“Start your engines!” Glass’ account tweeted Sunday alongside pics of him and Toyoda, who’s the grandson of Toyota Motors founder Kiichiro Toyoda. “Looking forward to celebrating the culture of [US] motorsports again next year” as part of America’s 250th-anniversary festivities in Japan, he added.

Toyota, the second-largest seller of new vehicles in the US behind General Motors, on Tuesday announced its nearly $1 billion investment will ramp up hybrid vehicle production across the Southern US.

It’s part of a previously announced plan by the Japanese automaker to invest up to $10 billion in the US by 2030, which President Trump revealed last month. Most of the investments are expected to be completed by 2027.

Toyota already leads hybrid vehicle production with more than 51% market share through the third quarter of this year, according to Motor Intelligence data.

But the company is looking to further increase manufacturing of hybrid-compatible engines and vehicles at certain American facilities.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our US manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president of manufacturing operations, said in a statement.

“Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our US footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.”

Of the investments announced Tuesday, the largest is $453 million toward Toyota’s Buffalo, W. Va., plant to ramp up the assembly of four-cylinder, hybrid-compatible engines.

Another $204.4 million is going toward the automaker’s Georgetown, Ky., plant to increase production of the same engines.

Toyota says it is also sending $125 million to expand production of Corolla vehicles and add hybrid vehicle production at its Blue Springs, Miss., factory.

The automaker is also investing $71.4 million in its Jackson, Tenn., plant and $57.1 million in its Troy, Mo., facility.

The investments are expected to create 252 new jobs, according to Toyota.

[TITLE]Trump Touts Manufacturing Jobs Created by Saudi Investment:
[TEXT]
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced that his country will increase its U.S. investment from $600 billion to almost $1 trillion.

The White House highlighted at an event Tuesday an American factory leader who thanked President Donald Trump and the crown prince for an increase in thousands of manufacturing jobs as a result of the investment.

David Broomell of Marlton, New Jersey, is the factory leader at GE Vernova for three factories critical to producing the world’s most advanced and reliable gas turbines in America. Broomell oversees facilities in Parsippany, New Jersey, and Allentown, Pennsylvania.

“David shared a powerful story of how these historic foreign investments secured by President Trump are GOOD deals for the American people that are improving lives and fueling new opportunities,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told The Daily Signal. “President Trump is putting America First by creating good-paying jobs, improving our economy, and ensuring the world’s biggest companies invest directly in our communities.”

GE Vernova announced in May during Trump’s state visit to Saudi Arabia it would export gas turbines and energy solutions worth up to $14.2 billion to Saudi Arabia.

“If you look at the landscape for GE Vernova investment, over $750 million in the U.S. focused on true manufacturing jobs here stateside,” Broomell said at the White House event. “We’re looking at tripling the output of our Greenville, South Carolina, facility, where we make the gas turbines that are supporting U.S. needs as well as the Saudi Arabia needs.”

David Broomwell, Manufacturing Technology Manager at energy equipment manufacturer GE Vernova, discusses what the Saudi investment in the United States means for American jobs:

"We're looking at tripling the output of our Greenville, South Carolina facility where we make the gas… pic.twitter.com/2SRMYMnQXd — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) November 18, 2025

Broomell said $300 million in gas investment resulted in over 500 pieces of new equipment being installed in the Greenville facility. On May 14, GE Vernova announced initiatives worth up to $14.2 billion during the state visit to accelerate Saudi Arabia’s energy transition with U.S. technology and expertise.

“That translates into roughly 1,800 jobs across the board for GE Vernova, as we try to scale capacity to be able to meet this demand,” he said. “Along with that, we’re partnering with local communities to build the skill set that’s required to meet these capacity needs. So that talent pipeline is incredibly important. So it’s real jobs in the manufacturing space.”

Thanks to Broomell, GE Vernova is on track to triple the capacity of the turbines produced in America since the inauguration, a White House official said.

[TITLE]Government selects 17 projects worth ₹7,172 crore investment in electronics manufacturing:
[TEXT]
The Centre on Monday approved 17 projects entailing around ₹7,172 crore investment across six categories under the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS), underlining India’s resolve and its decisive push into producing high-value components.

These projects will lead to production of electronics worth ₹65,111 crore and 11,808 direct jobs cumulatively.

The ECMS would drive the next phase of value chain integration and steer India’s electronics manufacturing to $500 billion by 2030–31, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw said here.

The approved units are spread across nine states -- Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh, reinforcing the government’s commitment to balanced regional growth and creation of high-skill jobs beyond metropolitan clusters, he said.

The second tranche of the scheme includes a wide range of components and sub-assemblies, such as India’s first-ever Optical Transceiver (SFP) manufacturing facilities by Jabil Circuit India and Zetchem Supply Chain Services; Oscillators for precise timing applications in communication devices, computers, and industrial electronics by Rakon India Private Limited; high-end precision enclosures for laptops and smartwatches by Aequs Consumer Products; and camera modules by ASUX Safety Components, Uno Minda Limited, and Syrma Mobility.

Meanwhile, talking about electronics manufacturing in India, Vaishnaw said that developing design teams is crucial for long-term success and global competitiveness because the way geo-economics are emerging, the challenges will be bigger.

He also urged the industry to focus on getting six sigma quality in every product that they manufacture and support each other in the process.

“Make sure that you hold hands and get them up the value chain. That will define your success in the coming years because sooner or later when the world the way geopolitics, the way geo-economics are emerging, the challenges will be bigger and in those challenging periods your ability to have a good control of the supply chain behind you will define your resilience and will define your ability to compete during the difficult times,” Vaishnaw said.

He added that with schemes like ECMS, India could get some of the global large manufacturers of finished products into the country, and that has given the opportunity to create the market and demand for components.

On quality manufacturing, he said, already the manufacturing sector has created new standards, especially in the automobile sector, aerospace sector, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, where the quality is today compared with the global benchmarks.

The government also continues to focus on skilling of youth using these facilities and capabilities. “Hopefully very soon we’ll come out with a new skilling framework also for electronics manufacturing where we will be tying up with certain organisations who have done very good work in the social fields,” he added.

[TITLE]Activist Ananym Capital sees upside if Baker Hughes spins off its oilfield services business:
[TEXT]
Business: Baker Hughes is an energy technology company with a portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. The company operates in two segments: oilfield services and equipment and industrial and energy technology. The OFSE segment provides products and services for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the lifecycle of a well, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development, to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning. OFSE is organized into four product lines: well construction; completions, intervention and seasurements; production solutions and subsea and surface pressure systems. The IET segment provides technology solutions and services for mechanical-drive, compression and power-generation applications across the energy industry, including oil and gas, liquefied natural gas operations, downstream refining and petrochemical markets, as well as lower carbon solutions to broader energy and industrial sectors.

Activist: Ananym Capital Management

Ownership: n/a

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to resort to a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.

What's happening

On Oct. 21, Ananym Capital announced that they have taken a position in Baker Hughes and are calling on the company to spin out its oilfield services and equipment business, arguing such a step could help push up the stock price by at least 60%.

Behind the scenes

Baker Hughes is a leading provider of energy and industrial technology services. The company was formed through the 2017 merger of legacy Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas, combining best-in-class intellectual property shared by GE spinoff assets and the technical expertise from both organizations.

The company operates through two primary segments: industrial and energy technologies and oilfield services and Equipment. The IET unit (55% of projected 2025 revenue and 60% of projected 2025 EBITDA) is a long-cycle industrial and energy business focused on gas technology equipment, including turbines and compressors, and aftermarket services, including new energy applications. The OFSE unit (45%/40%) is a short-cycle oilfield equipment and production services business with an end-to-end portfolio of oilfield services and equipment for well construction and production.

Management has built up a strong track record of effective execution, and that success has been reflected in the share price, with the company delivering strong returns of 28.26%, 75.29% and 232.98% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively.

Within IET, the company has taken advantage of its leading position in LNG, in which Baker now has 95% global footprint for the turbomachinery required in plant construction, a market that is expected to grow at a 10% compound annual growth rate through 2030.

Additionally, the company has a strong position in power generation, as Baker is one of few original equipment manufacturers supplying smaller-scale turbines and complete behind-the-meter power solutions. These offerings have allowed the company to play a pivotal role in helping to address rapidly growing data center demand, as its data center orders have gone from $0 to $550 million in just two quarters. As such, management is heavily investing in this opportunity — developing larger-scale power systems to support mega-data center deployments.

Furthermore, Baker's pending acquisition of Chart Industries is expected to further strengthen IET's position in power, LNG, and industrials. As a result, IET is approaching a 20% EBITDA margin, with further margin expansion expected as the business mix continues to shift toward aftermarket services, which generate long-term recurring revenue streams supported by contracts exceeding 10 years and margins of 35% or more.

For OFSE, management has taken steps to meaningfully improve the segment's earnings mix and reduce its cyclical commodity exposure. This includes exiting or downsizing non-core ventures and low-margin product lines, such as its surface pressure control joint venture with Cactus; prioritizing the Middle East and international markets (now 75% of OFSE revenue), which are less correlated to commodity prices; and implementing strong pricing discipline and cost cutting measures by enforcing minimum margin thresholds on new contracts, consolidating product lines and simplifying reporting. However, despite these efforts, OFSE remains highly subject to commodity volatility, affecting both the segment's performance and the company's overall valuation.

Currently valued at about 9x EBITDA, Baker trades more closely with oilfield services peers (6–7x EBITDA), than its industrial and energy technology peers (16–18x), despite IET being the majority of the company's revenue and EBITDA. An implied sum-of-the-parts multiple for Baker would put the company at approximately 13x.

It is for this reason that Ananym has launched a campaign at Baker calling for the company to either continue growing IET relative to OFSE or to pursue a sale or spin of OFSE.

Ananym believes that a potential separation could result in an about 51% immediate upside through realizing Baker's sum of parts valuation, even when assuming $100 million dis-synergies from separation. Moreover, this upside does not reflect much of the potential long-term growth tailwinds and margin expansion expected from these ongoing operational initiatives — value drivers that shareholders should also be better positioned to realize through such a move.

Founded in September 2024, this is Ananym's third public activist campaign. Knowing Charlie Penner and Alex Silver as we do, we would expect them to strive to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders. As such, they have already expressed full confidence in management to choose the optimal path forward, and the company's strong operational track record fully supports that confidence.

Moreover, on Oct. 6, the company announced a review of its capital allocation, business, cost structure, and operations.

With all signs pointing towards alignment between the two parties, we do not expect that they will insist on, or even ask for, board representation or continue to engage in much more of a public campaign. Rather, we expect them to work amicably with Baker behind the scenes to unlock meaningful shareholder value. However, this cooperative approach should not be confused for weakness, as they are fiduciaries to their own investors and will do whatever is necessary to create value at their portfolio companies. Thus, should management fail to act decisively, Ananym could quickly shift to a more assertive stance.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

[TITLE]'Liquidity Crisis': $12B in DeFi Liquidity Sits Idle as 95% of Capital Goes Unused:
[TEXT]
A new report from decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch has shown a growing crisis in decentralized finance (DeFi): the vast majority of capital deployed in major DeFi liquidity pools is not being used effectively.

According to data presented at Devconnect Buenos Aires, between 83% and 95% of liquidity in top pools, including Uniswap v2, v3, and v4, as well as Curve, remains idle for most of the year. That means billions of dollars sit in smart contracts without earning fees or generating meaningful returns.

[TITLE]Office of Strategic Capital Agrees to Joint $700M Conditional Loan Commitment with Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies:
[TEXT]

Release

Office of Strategic Capital Agrees to Joint $700M Conditional Loan Commitment with Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies

The Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) announces a joint $700 million conditional loan commitment with Vulcan Elements ("Vulcan") and ReElement Technologies ("ReElement") to increase domestic Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) magnet production and significantly bolster U.S. critical minerals supply chains.

The OSC commitment includes two separate loans, one to Vulcan for $620 million and one to ReElement for $80 million. These loans will directly support the production of advanced rare earth element separation, metallization, and magnet manufacturing capabilities in the United States. With the increased manufacturing and processing capabilities enabled by OSC's loans, Vulcan and ReElement anticipate collectively producing up to 10,000 metric tons of NdFeB magnet material in the next several years, thereby significantly reducing the U.S. NdFeB magnet supply chain gap.

"These OSC conditional commitments build on the swift and decisive actions taken by the Trump Administration to secure a domestic supply chain for the magnets used in chip manufacturing, drones, electric vehicles, fighter jets, industrial motors, nuclear submarines, and satellites," said the Honorable Emil Michael, Under Secretary of War for Research and Engineering. "Following the Department of War's agreement earlier this year with MP Materials, these conditional loan commitments with Vulcan and ReElement present a forward-leaning approach to further strengthen America's magnet production."

The funding for OSC's conditional loans comes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in July 2025. The Act provides up to $100 billion in total OSC lending authority specifically for critical minerals production and related industries and projects. The Department of War will also receive warrants from Vulcan and ReElement as part of the joint commitment. Additionally, the Department of Commerce's Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Program Office signed a preliminary non-binding letter of intent to provide $50 million in proposed federal incentives under the CHIPS and Science Act for the purchase of equipment in parallel with OSC's financing. The CHIPS incentives will provide further investment stability to strengthen domestic critical minerals production. The Department of Commerce will also receive $50 million of equity in Vulcan Elements.

The conditional loan commitments between OSC and the respective companies specify additional steps both companies must take to proceed toward financial close on the loan, to include fulfilling financial, legal, technical, and other due diligence requirements. No OSC funds are disbursed until all parties have completed or met the conditions for disbursement as specified in the loan commitment. The time between conditional commitment and financial close varies by project to ensure full due diligence and ultimately protect the American taxpayer.

"These commitments demonstrate that OSC's federal financing tools can successfully scale private capital investment in sectors vital to our economic and national security," said Mr. Ryan Lindner, Chief Investment Officer, OSC. "I am immensely grateful to Under Secretary Michael, Deputy Secretary Feinberg, and Secretary Hegseth for their support in executing these commitments, which are part of the Trump Administration's whole-of-government effort to secure domestic critical minerals production, revitalize the U.S. industrial base, and ultimately achieve peace through strength."

[TITLE]The exit economy is here. Black Women are paying the highest price:
[TEXT]
Since February, according to my latest analysis, almost 600,000 Black women have been economically sidelined. The November 20, 2025, Jobs Report makes clear this isn’t a blip. It’s a structural crisis. The economy added only 119,000 payroll jobs in September. Revisions to August and July erased another 33,000 positions (the country actually lost 4,000 jobs in August), leaving just 187,000 jobs gained over three months—an average of 62,000 per month. That’s a 3% slowdown from the previous quarter’s already anemic growth.

Stagnation would be troubling enough. But because revisions are reported only in aggregate, we don’t know which groups bore the brunt of those cuts. Intersectional analysis fills that gap—and what it reveals

[TEXT]
Why your savings aren’t growing even when you try

Hidden expenses, inflation, high-interest debt and low-yield accounts can stall financial progress despite consistent effort

Many people ask themselves this frustrating question, especially when they feel like they’re doing everything right. You cut back on little luxuries, skip nights out and even transfer a set amount into your savings account every month. Still, the balance barely moves. When hard work meets slow progress, it can drain your motivation and make you wonder if financial security is slipping out of reach. But you’re not alone. Countless people face the same challenge, and the reasons behind it are more common than you think.

Below, we break down the most overlooked barriers, explain why they happen and offer clear guidance to help you finally move forward.

Hidden expenses sneaking in

One of the biggest reasons savings stall is the quiet creep of hidden expenses. They show up in small amounts: a subscription you forgot to cancel, delivery fees, convenience buys at the store or that automatic renewal for an app you no longer use. None of these feel major in the moment, but stacked together, they silently drain your progress.

These overlooked costs interrupt even the most disciplined financial plan. When money slips away without you noticing, it robs you of the momentum needed to see real growth. The emotional hit comes later, when you look at your balance and realize those small leaks were actually large potholes on your journey.

The good news is this area is one of the easiest to fix. Once you build awareness, you can take back control. Reviewing your monthly statements, canceling unused services and setting alerts for auto-renewals can help you reclaim money you didn’t realize you were losing.

Inflation working against you

Another major obstacle is inflation, and its impact is more powerful than most people realize. Even when you save consistently, rising costs can outpace your efforts. Groceries, transportation, utilities and even basic essentials increase slowly but steadily over time. If your income hasn’t grown at the same rate, your savings become less effective.

This economic pressure leaves many people feeling like they’re treading water. They’re not doing anything wrong. The financial landscape itself has shifted. Inflation quietly eats away at the value of your money, making it feel like your hard work isn’t enough. It creates a psychological punch, especially for anyone trying to build a safety net or plan for the future.

Addressing this isn’t

[TITLE]Xcel Energy seeks $355.5M revenue hike, increasing residential bills nearly 10% on average:
[TEXT]
Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has asked state regulators for an increase of $355.5 million to its rate base, which would boost the average residential electric bill by nearly 10% per month.

Xcel filed the proposal Friday with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which will take testimony from the company and various intervening parties and hold a public hearing. If approved, the increase would take effect in September 2026.

Xcel Energy-Colorado President Robert Kenney said the utility’s last increase to the rate base was in 2022. The average residential bill rose by 3.2%, according to an Xcel statement after an agreement was reached with all the parties

The rate base is a utility’s investments to provide services and on which it’s allowed to earn a regulated rate of return.

“This rate case is to recover costs associated with investments that we’ve made over the last three years,” Kenney said.

The Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, said the proposed increase is “too big of an increase.”

“It’s an especially large increase given the context of the economic times,” said Joseph Pereira, UCA deputy director.

The increase is largely related to Xcel’s expanded capital spending on distribution, transmission and generation, Pereira said.

“It’s unclear to parties in the UCA that the company is prioritizing investments that are the biggest bang for the buck, that increase reliability and that adopt an intelligent approach to how they’re using the grid,” Pereira said. “It still appears that the company is using a crude blanket approach to replacing and investing in new infrastructure.”

Kenney said Xcel has invested in safety, reliability, making the system more resilient, electrifying transportation and buildings, meeting increased demands from growth and taking steps to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

Xcel has said it has reduced carbon emissions by 57%. The state’s target is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2030.

Xcel is upgrading its electric grid with a $1.7 billion transmission project. The Colorado Power Pathway includes transmission lines, power substations and other equipment stretching over 12 counties, mostly in eastern Colorado.

“We’ve added a tremendous amount of renewable energy over the last several years,” Kenney said. “And we’ve done all of this while keeping bills as low as possible.”

Xcel has faced criticism from the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, and customers over the past few years for what the UCA has called “a pancaking of rate increases.”

The criticism of Xcel and other regulated utilities heated up in 2023 after a cold winter and high natural gas prices sent costs soaring statewide. A legislative committee held hearings and approved a bill intended to protect customers against future price shocks and level what some see as a playing field tilted in the utilities’ favor.

Kenney said Xcel Energy’s rates have been well below state and national averages for approximately the last 10 years. But, he added, the company recognizes that some customers face challenges to paying their bills. He said Xcel is expanding its programs to help people struggling to pay their bills and adding $10 million in assistance. People can also call 800-895-4999.

In the past, Xcel required people to show proof of income to apply for help, but now will accept their statements of need. And those receiving other aid, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will be automatically eligible.

Under Xcel’s proposed rate hike, the average monthly residential bill would rise 9.9%; small commercial bills would go up 9.3%-9.4% per month; and large commercial monthly bills would increase 7.3%-8.6%.

[TITLE]How Thanksgiving can quietly drain your wallet:

How Thanksgiving can quietly drain your wallet

Rising grocery costs, travel expenses and holiday shopping pressure combine to create unexpected financial strain

Thanksgiving arrives each year wrapped in warmth and gratitude, but for many families, the holiday comes with a financial sting that doesn’t reveal itself until the bills arrive. What begins as a celebration of togetherness can quietly chip away at your budget through rising grocery prices, travel commitments and last-minute purchases.

The season’s hidden expenses accumulate faster than most people realize. Understanding where these costs come from — and how to manage them — can help you protect your financial health without sacrificing the joy of the holiday.

The true cost of the feast

The Thanksgiving meal itself often becomes the biggest budget drain. Grocery prices have climbed steadily, and the traditional spread of turkey, butter, eggs, vegetables, desserts and beverages adds up quickly. Many shoppers underestimate their spending because they purchase items in small batches, picking up just one more thing until costs snowball.

Hosting a large dinner pushes families toward premium ingredients, larger quantities and extras like wine or seasonal desserts. The pressure to impress guests or maintain traditions often leads to spending that exceeds original plans. This emotional attachment to the meal drives many families to overspend without realizing it.

Even small upgrades seem harmless at first:

A nicer tablecloth or holiday runners

New cookware or bakeware for the occasion

Prettier serving trays and platters

Decorative napkins and place settings

When added together, these purchases transform an affordable meal into an expensive production.

Travel and gathering expenses

Transportation costs represent another major hidden expense. Whether flying across the country or driving to a nearby city, getting to loved ones drains wallets quickly.

Airfare during Thanksgiving week ranks among the year’s highest, and last-minute bookings can devastate a budget. Gas prices typically spike during holiday travel seasons, and long road trips include tolls, food stops and sometimes overnight lodging. Even local gatherings require spending on rideshares, parking fees or emergency runs for forgotten items.

For families who host annually, home preparation adds another cost layer. Extra cleaning supplies, decorations and higher electricity bills from constant heating, baking and appliance use accumulate quickly. These smaller expenses often go unnoticed but steadily chip away at financial stability.

Gatherings also carry emotional expectations. Many people feel obligated to bring gifts, wine or dessert for friends and relatives. While generosity feels good, unplanned spending increases financial strain.

Holiday pressure and impulse buying

The seasonal atmosphere makes overspending dangerously easy. Stores capitalize on the holiday’s emotional warmth by offering tempting discounts, themed decor and limited-time deals. Before the turkey reaches the table, many families have already purchased unplanned items.

The biggest financial trap arrives immediately after Thanksgiving. Black Friday and Cyber Monday pressure shoppers to start gift buying early. Even when deals appear incredible, they often trigger impulse purchases that bust spending limits.

Retailers design these events to push emotional decision-making. The fear of missing a must-grab deal, the thrill of discounts or the belief that generosity equals expensive gifts makes clear thinking about long-term financial goals nearly impossible.

Suddenly, these items seem necessary:

Subscription boxes and services

New holiday outfits for the family

Festive home decor upgrades

The latest electronics and gadgets

Every card swipe stretches budgets thinner, setting up post-holiday regret.

How to protect your budget

Thanksgiving doesn’t have to become a financial setback. Strategic choices allow families to enjoy the holiday’s warmth and connection while protecting their wallets.

Plan the meal intentionally. Create a detailed list of dishes, ingredients and serving needs before shopping. Stick to essentials and resist impulse buys. Shop early to avoid price spikes and choose store brands when possible.

Share hosting responsibilities. Carrying the entire cost alone isn’t necessary. Ask guests to bring a dish, dessert or beverage. This approach creates a more communal celebration while reducing financial pressure.

Travel strategically. Book flights well in advance or consider off-peak travel days when visiting family. For road trips, plan fuel budgets, pack snacks and map the most efficient routes.

Limit decor spending. Use items already owned, create simple centerpieces or repurpose decorations from previous years. Thanksgiving’s beauty comes from people, not price tags.

Control shopping temptation. Set spending limits before Black Friday arrives. Make a must-buy list and avoid purposeless browsing. Remember that deals creating financial stress aren’t actually good deals.

Taking control of holiday spending

Thanksgiving blends tradition, emotion and social expectations — all powerful triggers for overspending. But careful planning and awareness allow families to enjoy the celebration without sacrificing financial stability.

Gratitude shouldn’t come with guilt. The holiday’s warmth doesn’t require stretching wallets beyond their limits. With intention and mindfulness, families can create a Thanksgiving full of connection and meaning while keeping finances healthy long after the dishes are washed and put away.

[TITLE]United Construction Buys Queens Property From Madison Realty Capital for $64M – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
United Construction and Development Group, a prolific developer in Queens, has acquired an office and retail building in the borough’s Flushing neighborhood.

United Construction, run by Chris Jiashu Xu, purchased the three-story, 104,292-square-foot property at 41-60 Main Street from Madison Realty Capital for $64.25 million, according to the seller’s broker, JLL.

The building on the corner of Main Street and Sanford Avenue is fully occupied and hosts office tenants Capital One Bank, Preferred Bank and MassMutual Insurance. Retail tenants at the property include Chinese bakery Fay Da Bakery and JD Drug Store.

JLL’s Ethan Stanton, Michael Mazzara, Drew Isaacson and Brendan Maddigan brokered the deal for the seller, while no brokers represented the buyer.

Spokespeople for United Construction and Madison Realty Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Crain’s New York Business first reported the news.

News of the deal comes after Madison Realty Capital acquired the Flushing property in February 2024, as Commercial Observer previously reported.

Bankrupt developer Jeffrey Wu handed off the building to Madison Realty Capital — a creditor — for $80 million after filing a Chapter 11 petition in 2020 to initiate bankruptcy proceedings for his company, Flushing Landmark Realty. Madison Realty Capital had previously provided a $66 million bridge loan for Wu to refinance two Flushing properties in 2014.

It’s unclear what Xu intends to do with his new property, but the developer already has a lineup of projects planned for Queens.

Over the summer, Xu filed plans to build a 39-story, 387-unit residential tower at 23-07 43rd Avenue in Long Island City, as well as a two-tower, 630-unit residential property at 61-06 Junction Boulevard in Rego Park, Crain’s reported.

[TITLE]Cemtrex Enters into Agreement to Acquire Invocon, Adding Proven Aerospace & Defense Engineering Capabilities:
[TEXT]
Hauppauge, NY, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- - Cemtrex, Inc. (Nasdaq: CETX), a diversified industrial and technology company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Invocon, Inc., a Texas-based systems-engineering firm with a 40-year history designing, manufacturing, and supporting mission-critical instrumentation, wireless sensing systems, and flight hardware for aerospace, defense, and advanced government programs

Invocon’s technologies have been deployed across satellites, launch vehicles, target missiles, space shuttles, and the International Space Station, including 17 shuttle systems, 10 ISS systems, and numerous next-generation flight programs for major primes and government agencies.

Invocon also holds a deep intellectual property portfolio, including multiple U.S. patents related to hypervelocity impact detection, gridless lethality assessment, acoustic and RF sensing, and advanced flight-system telemetry. Invocon’s systems have been used in over 40 shuttle flights, over 30 target missile flights, and a range of high-reliability space and defense missions requiring precise sensing in extreme environments.

This acquisition represents a significant strategic expansion for Cemtrex, bringing in capabilities in high-reliability electronics, flight instrumentation, wireless data acquisition, lethality assessment systems, and complex system design, all supported by a long-standing and experienced engineering team.

Under the terms of the agreement, Cemtrex will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Invocon for $7.06 million, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close on or around January 1, 2026.

Cemtrex Chairman and CEO Saagar Govil commented, “Invocon brings nearly four decades of experience building flight-proven hardware and advanced sensing systems for some of the most demanding aerospace and defense applications. Their technologies have supported shuttle missions, ISS systems, target missiles, and major prime-led flight programs. This is a highly specialized engineering organization with capabilities that are extremely difficult to replicate, and it fits directly with our long-term strategy of expanding into high-reliability and mission-critical technologies.”

Govil continued, “This acquisition provides the foundation for Cemtrex’s new Aerospace & Defense segment and positions us to participate in a wider range of engineering programs that require precision, durability, and deep technical expertise. Invocon’s heritage in flight hardware, wireless telemetry, impact detection, and high-reliability electronics aligns with opportunities across traditional aerospace, defense modernization efforts, and emerging commercial-space markets over the long term.”

Following the closing, Cemtrex expects to establish a new reporting segment, Aerospace & Defense, with Invocon serving as the cornerstone for expanding into advanced engineering programs for government agencies, prime contractors, and next-generation commercial-space customers.
