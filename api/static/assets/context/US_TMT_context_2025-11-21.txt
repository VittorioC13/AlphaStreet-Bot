[TITLE]The software companies most likely to be acquired as AI eats the world:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The threat of AI has sent shockwaves through the software sector, hammering share prices and creating, in the words of analysts at RBC Capital Markets, a rare opportunity for "opportunistic" buyers.

Once-high-flying software companies are now trading at deep discounts as investors worry about how generative AI could upend SaaS business models. That same anxiety, the analysts argue, is laying the groundwork for a new wave of dealmaking.

According to RBC, software M&A activity has surged 78% this year, with private-equity deal volume more than doubling as sponsors hunt for bargains.

"We continue to see software underperform on concerns around AI and as this underperformance drags on in spite of better-than-expected results, we may see more buyers opportunistically step in and take advantage of dislocations, particularly in private equity," the analysts wrote in a recent note to investors.

A chart showing software M&A activity RBC Capital Markets

While noting they have no knowledge of any such deals, the analysts listed potential targets, all of which have solid customer bases and cash flow but limited AI narratives. Private-equity buyers, less constrained by quarterly earnings pressure, could move quickly to take these companies private, reset expectations, and rebuild them for an AI-first world.

While regulatory scrutiny remains a hurdle for mega-cap tech acquirers, financial sponsors are freer to strike. RBC expects deal momentum to accelerate as sentiment stabilizes and valuations remain depressed. For investors, the AI scare that crushed software stocks might soon become the catalyst for a new consolidation boom, one driven not by hype, but by hard-nosed value hunting.

Here's RBC's view on which software companies are potential mergers and acquisitions targets and why:

Asana (ASAN): Under pressure amid rising AI-native competition and ongoing industry consolidation, the workplace and project management company remains a potential takeover target despite its founder-controlled voting structure.

Box (BOX): With growth stagnating and shares undervalued, the cloud content management company could attract private equity buyers seeking to reset expectations or strategic acquirers interested in its horizontal content platform.

Confluent (CFLT): Positioned attractively in the data streaming layer, Confluent could appeal to a strategic buyer seeking deeper data infrastructure capabilities.

Coursera (COUR): Despite headwinds in EdTech, Coursera's large learner base and AI partnerships make it an appealing target for strategic buyers or as a cornerstone for a PE-led rollup.

Dropbox (DBX): Lacking the scale advantages of larger cloud storage rivals, Dropbox could become a target if new products underperform, with greater value realized as part of a bigger platform.

DocuSign (DOCU): If the e-signature company's identity access management pivot fails to gain traction, DocuSign could attract private equity interest, though its valuation may deter many bidders.

Elastic (ESTC): Elastic's GenAI momentum and leadership in search make it a logical target for strategic consolidation.

Five9 (FIVN): With strong contact-center-as-a-service (CCaaS) technology and margin improvement potential, Five9 could appeal to enterprise companies such as Salesforce or Cisco, or to private equity once leadership stabilizes.

Fastly (FSLY): Its solid edge-computing technology and reasonable valuation could make Fastly an attractive target to acquirers such as Google or Cisco.

Gen Digital (GEN): With stable margins, strong cash flow, and revenue synergies, the cybersecurity and fintech platform could be a compelling buyout candidate for private equity.

GitLab (GTLB): GitLab's growing presence in developer security operations and GenAI developer tools positions it as an appealing strategic acquisition.

ZoomInfo (GTM): This company's valuable customer relationship management data and integration potential make it a fit for large platforms such as Salesforce or a PE candidate for operational optimization.

N-Able (NABL): Its foothold in the fragmented managed service provider and small and medium-sized enterprise market makes N-Able an attractive consolidation play for private equity.

NICE (NICE): Misunderstood by markets and undervalued, NICE's CCaaS and compliance businesses could unlock value through a takeover or breakup.

Nutanix (NTNX): As hybrid-cloud adoption grows, Nutanix's scale and SaaS shift could make it a strategic target for major IT vendors.

PagerDuty (PD): PagerDuty fits as a logical acquisition to strengthen an integrated IT operations platform.

Qualys (QLYS): High margins and leadership in vulnerability management make Qualys an attractive consolidation target within the cloud security sector.

Rapid7 (RPD): Following restructuring and a pivot from cybersecurity toward DevSecOps, Rapid7's improved cash profile could appeal to private equity buyers.

Teradata (TDC): Its progress in cloud analytics positions Teradata as a potential acquisition target for large vendors or PE firms.

Varonis (VRNS): Focused on data security and governance, Varonis is well placed for a strategic GenAI-driven acquisition.

Zoom (ZM): While a sale is unlikely soon, Zoom's best-in-class video platform could entice acquirers seeking synergies in AI and collaboration.

[TITLE]Elon Musk, Nvidia unveil deal with Saudi state-backed firm to build massive AI data center:
[TEXT]
Elon Musk’s xAI and Jensen Huang-led Nvidia announced Wednesday they are partnering with Saudi Arabia’s state-backed artificial intelligence firm to build a massive AI data center in the Persian Gulf kingdom.

The center is expected to consume as much as 500 megawatts of electricity – making it xAI’s largest site outside the US, according to reports.

As part of the deal, Musk’s xAI chatbot, Grok, will be deployed throughout Saudi Arabia, according to an xAI

[TITLE]Saudi Arabia backs Elon Musk's xAI with data center deal:
[TEXT]
Elon Musk has been hunting for partners to grow his artificial intelligence startup xAI as it tries to keep pace with OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia has been trying to diversify his oil-rich country's economy by making it a global hub for tech and artificial intelligence.On Wednesday, their intersecting interests led to a deal.Musk's xAI, which makes the chatbot Grok, agreed to work with the state-backed Saudi company Humain to build a new data center in the Gulf country. The project is set to consume as much as 500 megawatts of electricity, which would make it xAI's biggest data center outside the United States. Humain and xAI did not disclose the value of the deal.The project was part of a package of military and tech deals announced Wednesday during Crown Prince Mohammed's visit to Washington. The United States and Saudi Arabia appear to have reached an agreement that clears the path for the kingdom to buy the US semiconductors needed to power artificial intelligence, as the United States has used AI chips as part of geopolitical diplomacy.Working with xAI is a victory for Humain, an AI company created by Crown Prince Mohammed in May with backing from the country's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund. Through Humain, Saudi Arabia is aiming to position itself as an AI exporter.The goal is to use the country's ample energy reserves, deep pockets, abundance of land and links to global fiber optic networks to provide cheap AI computing power, including to companies based elsewhere. Humain has set a target of powering 6% of the global AI workload in the coming years.The deal with xAI, which includes expanding the use of Grok's AI models in Saudi Arabia, deepens Musk's business ties to the country. The kingdom also backed his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in 2022, before he renamed it X. Musk has poured money into xAI since founding the company in March 2023, including building a data center called Colossus in the Memphis, Tennessee, area."The future of intelligence will be engineered through massive and efficient compute combined with the most-advanced AI models," Musk said in a statement. "Humain's capabilities enable us to build that future faster in Saudi Arabia."Tareq Amin, the CEO of Humain, said the deal was "creating scale that few others can match."The xAI deal has been in the works for months but was held up partly by uncertainty over Saudi Arabia's access to the key semiconductors.In May, President Donald Trump announced a deal to send thousands of AI chips made by Nvidia to the kingdom. But the chips had not been delivered over US concerns

[TITLE]Dutch government is relinquishing control of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia:
[TEXT]
The Dutch government said it's relinquishing control of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia , easing a standoff between China and the Netherlands that threatened supplies of semiconductors vital for global auto manufacturing.Economics Affairs Minister Vincent Karremans said Wednesday that he was suspending an earlier order to take control of Nexperia under a rarely invoked law.The Dutch government cited national security concerns and "serious governance shortcomings" when it took effective control of Nexperia, which is headquartered in the city of Nijmegen but owned by China's Wingtech Technology . Officials said they were trying to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe's economic security.Nexperia chips are widely used by carmakers in North America, Japan and South Korea. Automakers warned in recent weeks that they were running low on the chips, and Honda was forced to shut down a factory in Mexico producing its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets.Karremans said he was suspending his order issued in late September as a "show of goodwill" in a decision that came after "constructive meetings" with Chinese authorities over the past few days."In light of recent developments, The Netherlands has considered it the right moment to take a constructive step by suspending my order under the Goods Availability Act," he said in a statement."We are positive

[TEXT]
Synopsis

Nvidia's move to use smartphone-style memory chips in its artificial intelligence servers could cause server-memory prices to double by late 2026. Because each AI server needs more memory chips than a handset, the change is expected to create sudden demand that the industry is not equipped to handle, according to Counterpoint.

[TITLE]State rules delay broadband, 5G expansion plans: Industry:
[TEXT]
Mumbai: Inconsistent state-level policies, approvals and tariff classifications are causing delays and cost overruns disrupting fibre and small cell deployments, slowing India's broadband and 5G expansion goals, experts and telecom infrastructure companies said.

These issues are creating obstacles despite the central government's efforts to support the process, including notification of the Right of Way (RoW) Rules."Inconsistent state-level policies remain a significant barrier to India's digital infrastructure expansion. Divergent RoW norms, varying approval fees and complex multi-departmental clearances can extend fibre and tower rollout timelines by several weeks to a few months per project," said CS Krishnadas, chief executive of networking equipment company Umiya Buildcon This, he said, leads to cost overruns in the range of several lakhs to a few crores of rupees and potentially deferring sectoral investments worth thousands of crores annually.Electricity tariffs also have an effect on operational costs for these companies. "States apply widely varying tariffs, generally ranging from ₹3 to ₹18 per unit commercially, and ₹2 to ₹8 when classified as telecom infrastructure. This creates substantial cost differentials that impact daily running costs, payback periods and investment returns," Krishnadas added.Neutral digital infrastructure players also made similar views."The biggest hurdle is right-of-way, which varies by state and significantly impacts investment safety and timelines. Power sector regulations and labour laws also differ across states, complicating operations," said Ram Sellaratnam, CEO of IBus Networks , calling for regulations in power and digital infrastructure to catch up with technology.The Department of Telecommunications last year notified the new RoW rules and wrote to all state governments to follow them. But despite the nudging from the Centre, not all states have complied. The aim of the new rules was to create a streamlined, rules-based framework that cuts bureaucratic delays and enhances coordination across central and state governments.As per Teamlease Reg Tech, which helps companies manage compliance with laws and regulations, due to inconsistencies in the federal relationship between central and state governance, there are procedural bottlenecks leading to the delayed implementation of infrastructural initiatives like BharatNet and Digital India "Inconsistent RoW permissions, arbitrary changes and delays in approvals by local bodies continue to stall fiber and tower rollouts. There is a lack of an effective single-window clearance mechanism, which means that service providers must adhere to the requirements of multiple departments, resulting in redundant paperwork and extended project timelines," said TeamLease RegTech chief executive and cofounder Rishi Agrawal.The Indian government's draft National Telecom Policy 2025 has set targets primarily focused on 2030, including achieving 100% 4G and 90% 5G population coverage, enabling fixed-line broadband connectivity to 100 million households and completing fiberisation of all gram panchayats under the BharatNet project with over 98% uptime. The policy also aims to increase mobile tower fiberisation from to 80% by 2030 from about 46% now.

[TITLE]Nokia Divides AI and Telecom Business Into Two Units:

Nokia is dividing its artificial intelligence (AI) and telecom businesses into separate units.

The tech company announced Wednesday (Nov. 19) that its new network infrastructure division would house its AI and data center operations, while its telecoms network operations would become part of its mobile infrastructure unit.

“Nokia changed the world once by connecting people — and will again by connecting intelligence,” said Justin Hotard, Nokia’s president and chief executive, said in a news release.

“As the trusted western provider of secure and advanced connectivity, our technology is powering the AI supercycle.”

The Finland-based company is positioning its network infrastructure business as a “growth segment” designed to capitalize on rapid, global AI and data center build-out.

Projections earlier this year from Citigroup forecast that artificial intelligence spending will exceed $2.8 trillion by 2029. The banking giant has cited investments by hyperscalers and rising demand for enterprise AI use. Citi also forecasts that capital expenditures among hyperscalers — or data center operators — will come to $490 billion by the end of next year, surpassing its previous estimate of $420 billion.

Although the AI and telecoms divisions will be Nokia’s core units, the company also announced it was establishing a new defense division.

Nokia Defense is being launched as an incubation unit to serve as the central go-to-market and research and development hub for Nokia’s defense portfolio, the release added.

“Building on the strong foundation of Nokia Federal Solutions in the US, the company sees further opportunities in the US, Finland and other allied countries to deliver defense-grade solutions based on Nokia’s core technologies in network and mobile infrastructure.”

Nokia’s new artificial intelligence push comes just weeks after the company announced it was receiving a $1 billion investment from Nvidia.

That investment is part of a partnership that involves weaving Nvidia-powered, commercial grade artificial intelligence radio access network (AI-RAN) products into Nokia’s RAN portfolio.

This will let communication service providers launch AI-native 5G-Advanced and 6G networks on Nvidia platforms, Nvidia said in a news release, calling the collaboration “the beginning of the AI-native wireless era.”

The companies say their partnership also addresses the fast-growing AI-RAN market, with the larger RAN market expected to top $200 billion by 2030.

“Telecommunications is a critical national infrastructure — the digital nervous system of our economy and security,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia.
