[TEXT]
EDMONTON, Alberta, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Power (TSX: CPX) is pleased to announce the successful execution of a new long-term contract with improved economic terms for Midland Cogeneration Venture (“MCV”) with Consumers Energy, extending to 2040 and providing 10 years of incremental contracted revenue.

MCV1 is the largest natural gas-fired combined electric and steam generation facility in the United States, and a cornerstone of reliable power generation in Michigan. MCV will receive payments for 1,240 MW, approximately 75% of the facility’s capacity starting in June 2030 under the new PPA, creating long-term revenue stability throughout the contract term. The contract is expected to generate a gross increase in full year adjusted EBITDA2 for the facility of approximately US$100 million1 annually (representing an 85% increase over current contract pricing3).

“We are proud to continue our partnership with Consumers Energy, one of America’s most respected utilities,” said Avik Dey, President and CEO of Capital Power. “Michigan is an attractive and growing market for electricity. This contract is an important milestone for Capital Power as it reinforces the critical role efficient natural gas assets like MCV play in maintaining grid reliability as energy demand grows.”

“Investing in assets that seek stable cash flows with the ability to enhance that profile through long-term contract extensions with creditworthy counterparties is a key principle of our strategy,” said Recep Kendircioglu, Global Head of Infrastructure, Manulife Investment Management. “This Agreement underscores that MCV is vital to the MISO market, and we are pleased to own the facility alongside a terrific partner in Capital Power.”

“We’re pleased to continue our long-standing relationship with Capital Power through this new PPA,” said Sri Maddipati, President of Electric Supply, Consumers Energy. “The Midland Cogeneration Venture has been a reliable source of energy for our customers for decades, and this agreement ensures continued reliability and affordability as we transition to a sustainable energy future.”

The MCV facility is a key part of Michigan’s energy infrastructure, delivering an exceptional track record for reliability and operating performance. As North America's fifth-largest natural gas IPP, Capital Power is forging strategic partnerships to help shape the future of energy across the continent.

[TITLE]California oil merger set to benefit from permitting boom:

[TITLE]IEA Reverses Course on Oil and Gas Investment:
[TEXT]
The world needs to develop new oil and gas resources just to keep output flat amid faster declining rates at existing fields, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday in a major shift in its narrative from 2021 that ‘no new investment’ is needed in a net-zero by 2050 scenario.

The rates of decline at operating oil and gas fields have accelerated in recent years, largely due to higher reliance on shale and deep offshore resources, said the IEA.

The agency is under pressure from the Trump Administration to return to its core mission to help protect global security of supply, instead of pushing the net-zero agenda it has been doing so far this decade.

A new IEA report, The Implications of Oil and Gas Field Decline Rates, said on Tuesday that if the industry has to maintain current levels of production, more than 45 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil and around 2,000 bcm of natural gas would be needed in 2050 from new conventional fields.

Even with projects ramping up and others approved for development and not yet in production, a large gap still exists “that would need to be filled by new conventional oil and gas projects to maintain production at current levels, although the amounts needed could be reduced if oil and gas demand were to come down,” the IEA said.

“Only a small portion of upstream oil and gas investment is used to meet increases in demand while nearly 90% of upstream investment annually is dedicated to offsetting losses of supply at existing fields,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said.

“Decline rates are the elephant in the room for any discussion of investment needs in oil and gas, and our new analysis shows that they have accelerated in recent years,” Birol added, finally acknowledging what the industry has been saying for years—underinvestment threatens global energy supply.

“In the case of oil, an absence of upstream investment would remove the equivalent of Brazil and Norway’s combined production each year from the global market balance, Birol added. “The situation means that the industry has to run much faster just to stand still.”

New oil and gas projects may be necessary to maintain current production levels, the IEA said Tuesday, as it is in a public feud with the Trump administration over its forecasts for lower demand.

The International Energy Agency said in a report that its analysis of 15,000 oil and gas fields showed that output was declining more rapidly than in the past, which has “implications for markets and energy security”.
