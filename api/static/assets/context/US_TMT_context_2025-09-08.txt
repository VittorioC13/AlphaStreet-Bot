[TITLE]Figure Technology targets $526M in IPO amid crypto listing wave:
[TEXT]
Figure aims to raise $526M in IPO, valuing the blockchain lender at $4.3B.

IPO momentum grows as Gemini, Kraken, and Bullish drive the crypto listing wave.

Figure shifts from lending roots to blockchain finance, boosting investor interest.

Blockchain-focused lender Figure Technology Solutions is preparing to raise $526 million through its upcoming initial public offering (IPO), according to regulatory filings submitted Tuesday and reported by Bloomberg Law.

The company intends to sell 21.5 million shares priced between $18 and $20 each, with 4.9 million shares expected to come from existing holders.

At the high end of the price range, the IPO would assign the company a valuation of roughly $4.3 billion.

Figure first signaled its public market ambitions last month when it filed confidentially with regulators, followed by a formal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on August 18.

The latest filings suggest the company is targeting September 10 for its IPO pricing date.

The firm’s valuation has steadily increased since its 2021 Series D funding round, when it raised $200 million in a deal led by 10T Holdings that valued the company at $3.2 billion.

More recently, Figure reported financial momentum, with revenues reaching $191 million in the first half of 2025.

From consumer lending to blockchain infrastructure

While Figure is now recognized for its blockchain-driven financial products built on the Provenance Blockchain, the company originally focused on consumer lending.

Its first offering was a digitized home equity line of credit for US homeowners, before expanding into blockchain infrastructure designed to streamline lending, securitization, and related processes.

By leveraging blockchain technology, Figure has positioned itself at the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized systems, aiming to deliver faster, more transparent, and cost-effective financial solutions.

This pivot has helped the company differentiate itself from fintech rivals while attracting investor interest in its long-term growth prospects.

Crypto IPO momentum builds

Figure’s listing effort comes as more crypto and blockchain firms move toward the public markets during the ongoing bull market cycle.

On Tuesday, the crypto exchange Gemini also filed for an IPO, seeking to raise $317 million.

Rival exchange Kraken is rumored to be pursuing a $500 million raise at a valuation of around $15 billion, though reports suggest it may delay its public debut until 2026.

Meanwhile, several high-profile listings have already set a precedent this year.

In August, digital asset exchange operator Bullish launched its IPO with shares priced at $37, soaring as much as 218% on its first trading day.

Despite a pullback, Bullish still maintains a market capitalisation of roughly $9.6 billion, up from its IPO valuation of $4.8 billion.

Similarly, stablecoin issuer Circle completed an IPO that raised about $1.1 billion, with shares more than doubling on the first day of trading. The company now commands a market capitalization of approximately $30 billion.

Gemini, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’ crypto exchange also readying for its public debut, with the firm aiming to raise $317 million at a valuation of $2.2 billion.

Beyond traditional IPOs, the industry is exploring alternative routes.

A group of crypto executives recently launched Bitcoin Infrastructure Acquisition Corp, a Cayman Islands-based special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) targeting a $200 million raise through an IPO.

[TITLE]Intel gets a lifeline. Now comes the hard part.:
[TEXT]
Late last month, the US government acquired a 9.9% stake in chipmaker Intel Corp. for $8.9 billion by converting $5.7 billion in unpaid CHIPS Act grants and adding fresh funds. Coupled with a separate $2 billion investment from Japan’s SoftBank, the deal provides a critical lifeline to the company weighed down by mounting losses and slipping competitiveness.

Intel has reported six straight quarterly losses, including $2.9 billion in Q2 2025. For the full year 2024, it reported a loss of $18.8 billion, its first annual loss since 1986. Its free cash flow has been negative since 2022, burning through more than $15 billion in 2024 alone. This was due to a substantial increase in capital expenditure amid lower revenues. On Nasdaq, Intel's share prices have halved in the past five years, while its key rival AMD’s doubled.

The US government, under President Donald Trump, believes that the fund infusion will help. Soon after the investment deal, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted on X saying, “This historic agreement strengthens US leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America’s technological edge."

However, for that to happen, Intel will have to turn around, and that is a challenge. Intel is struggling to make inroads into the booming GPU (graphics processing unit) market. The competition in its core CPU (central processing unit) market is intensifying. Its manufacturing business is struggling. Most importantly, the government ownership itself might add to its problems.

Market shift

The AI chip market is dominated by GPUs, where Nvidia controls a 94% share, driven by its technology ecosystem and high-performance products like the H100, according to a recent Jon Peddie Research report. Intel’s Gaudi GPUs are marketed as cheaper alternatives, but they have failed to gain traction against Nvidia’s dominance and AMD’s rise.

Intel’s traditional strength lay in CPUs for PCs and servers. But as AI shifted demand to specialized processors optimized for complicated workloads, Intel remained focused on CPUs. Intel also rejected an opportunity to invest in OpenAI in 2018, reflecting its scepticism on GenAI. Its late pivot meant it missed the AI chip boom of 2023-24.

Intel's grip on the CPU market is weakening as AMD intensifies competition in desktops and servers. Once outselling AMD by the 9:1 ratio, Intel’s lead has shrunk to just 2:1 in desktops, with AMD grabbing record revenue share. In servers, Intel still leads shipments, but AMD dominates high-end growth.

Foundry gamble

Intel’s bid to rival Taiwan’s TSMC through a contract foundry business is straining its finances. The company spent $23.9 billion on capex in 2024, but Intel Foundry posted only $4.4 billion in Q2 2025 revenues, up 3% year-on-year and still unprofitable. High costs and weak yields on the 18A process node, Intel's chip-making technology, have limited its appeal for external customers, with CEO Lip-Bu Tan conceding it may mainly serve Intel’s own products.

The company has struggled to secure anchor customers, a critical plank of its strategy. The lack of demand for 18A and uncertainty over offering the 14A node, its next-generation technology, to outsiders underscores the weakness. In 2025, Intel cancelled projects in Germany and Poland, slowed Ohio factory construction, and consolidated Costa Rican operations into Vietnam and Malaysia to cut costs.

Its overall headcount, including subsidiaries, dropped by over 15,000 to 108,900 people in 2024. It’s expected to be down by another 25,000 people by the end of this year.

Deal strings

The government stake could add to Intel’s woes. It earns over 75% of its revenue overseas, with China alone contributing 29% in 2024. In an August 2025 filing, it warned that the US government’s $8.9 billion equity stake could trigger “adverse reactions" from international customers and partners. Chinese clients, wary of the US influence, may cut demand, threatening a key revenue stream.

The deal also came with a warrant allowing Washington to raise its holding by 5% if Intel’s ownership of its foundry business falls below 51%. This effectively limits Intel’s ability to spin off or restructure its loss-making foundry arm—an option analysts had seen as a path to recovery.

While the infusion shores up Intel’s balance sheet, it doesn’t resolve core problems: negative $15.7 billion free cash flow in 2024, low-yield 18A process struggles, and steep competition from AMD and Nvidia, which continue to chip away at Intel’s CPU and AI markets.

The U.S. government is taking a stake in Intel. It's rare — and it has some risks

toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images North America

In the capitalist American economy, markets pick winners, and the federal government typically stays out of the way of business. But during times of crisis or war, the government has occasionally felt the need to step in.

During World War I and II, it seized rail and telegraph networks, and nationalized industries, like coal mining, when strikes threatened the war effort.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, established in the wake of the Great Depression, has since taken over — and wound down — failing American banks with an eye towards protecting depositors and keeping the economy stable.

Sponsor Message

And when companies deemed "too big to fail," including insurer AIG and automakers Chrysler and General Motors, teetered on the brink of collapse during the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09, the government took ownership stakes in them to help prop them up.

In late August, the Trump administration took a page from this book — but with a twist.

The government took a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker Intel , becoming its biggest single shareholder. The company designs and produces microchips that go into everything from self-driving cars to laptops.

The U.S., however, is facing no acute economic crisis or war. Instead, the government's motivation is competition with China and the race for artificial intelligence, which have fueled a desire to boost American companies' ability to make cutting-edge microchips at home.

Last year, then-president Biden funneled billions of dollars in grants to Intel via the CHIPS and Science Act. Now, The Trump administration is converting those and other grants into equity.

Intel's long history

Michael Malone, author of The Intel Trinity: How Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, and Andy Grove Built the World's Most Important Company, says Intel invented the modern microchip. The company was founded in 1968 in Mountain View, California — along with the nascent computer-makers who relied on their chips, they helped build what is today known as Silicon Valley.

Sponsor Message

"Intel really ruled the chip world. Everybody else was, you know, planets next to the sun," he said.

But the company failed to get in early on the smartphone boom, and later effectively missed the boat on chips for AI data centers. Now, Malone said, Taiwan's TSMC leads the pack, followed by South Korea's Samsung.

"They're always just a little bit behind the other players," he said.

"Intel has been trying to keep up. But, you know, in this business, everything turns over every couple of three years," he continued. "So if you fall behind a generation, which is just a fraction of a decade, you can almost never catch up. And that's where Intel finds itself."

Despite that, analysts say Intel is still probably the best option the United States has for attempting to retake the lead in high-end chip manufacturing.

"Companies that can actually physically manufacture those advanced chips are very strategically important because there's just not many of them," said Jennifer Lind, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. "Intel is the only one in the U.S."

Most other major chip players, including Nvidia and AMD , which make the most popular chipsets for AI development, do not manufacture anything. They ship designs to Taiwan where TSMC handles fabrication.

A push to onshore chipmaking

Jacob Feldgoise, an analyst at the Georgetown University Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said the idea behind propping up Intel and reigniting leading-edge chip manufacturing in the United States is to reduce the risk of "foreign supply shocks," like the potential shutdown of overseas fabrication plants.

"That's a general way to say the government is worried

[TITLE]Trump warns that he will soon announce ‘fairly substantial’ chip tariffs — chip companies investing in the US will be spared the brunt of the tariffs:
[TEXT]
At the White House on September 4, President Trump said that his administration will “very shortly” impose a “fairly substantial” tariff on imported semiconductors from companies that are not making chips in the United States, adding that firms investing in domestic production would be spared from the levy.

“I’ve discussed it with the people here, chips and semiconductors, and we’ll be putting tariffs on companies that aren’t coming in,” Trump said.

“We’ll be putting a tariff very shortly. You probably are hearing we’ll be putting a fairly substantial tariff, or not that high, but a fairly substantial tariff.”

Export controls tighten

The remarks capped an evening of dealmaking theater involving major tech CEOs and large investment pledges from Silicon Valley. Apple has publicly raised its US commitment to $600 billion, a figure the company touted in August and appears to have placed the iPhone maker on the right side of the incoming policy, with Trump singling out Apple as being “in pretty good shape.” Precise rates and timings for the tariffs were not announced.

The fresh tariff threats land as Washington is already tightening export controls around China. On August 29, the Commerce Department revoked authorizations from 2022 that had allowed Samsung and SK hynix to obtain U.S. chipmaking equipment for their China fabs, replacing fast-track processes with a return to case-by-case licensing. The Commerce Department said that the US plans to grant license applications to allow the companies to maintain their existing facilities in China, but not to upgrade technology or expand capacity.

A few days later, TSMC said the US government had also decided to pull its ‘Validated End User’ (VEU) fast-track status for shipping American tools to its Nanjing site by the end of the year. After December 31, the world’s largest contract chipmaker will need licenses for those exports, a shift that will add paperwork and uncertainty to any upgrades at the Chinese plant.

More tariff limbo

Trump’s actions leave yet more unanswered questions for hardware fans. How broad will the tariff coverage be? Will there be a carve-out for firms with U.S. fabs preparing to ramp up? And what happens while domestic capacity remains a fraction of offshore output? Both AMD and Nvidia lean heavily on TSMC’s production today, and even as domestic capacity comes online, near-term supply is still tied to Asia .

Price pressure could arrive quickly if the White House moves to implement these tariffs. An April analysis prepared for the Consumer Technology Association, estimated that tariffs could lift retail prices by roughly a third for laptops and tablets, with monitors rising by a similar amount, and game consoles hit hardest. The study projects a $123 billion annual hit to consumer purchasing power if the costs flow through to retail.

For now, we’re waiting on an official announcement and the subsequent fine print.

[TITLE]President Trump to impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from firms not moving production to America:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump announced Thursday that his administration will impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that do not move production to the U.S., speaking before a dinner with top tech company CEOs.

“I have discussed it with the people here. Chips and semiconductors – we will be putting tariffs on companies that aren’t coming in. We will be putting a tariff very shortly,” the president said. “We will be putting a very substantial tariff, not that high, but fairly substantial tariff with the understanding that if they come into the country, if they are coming in, building, planning to come in, there will not be a tariff.”

Jeff Mason and Kanishka Singh for Reuters:

‎

Trump has made tariffs a pillar of U.S. foreign policy, using them to exert political pressure and renegotiate trade deals and extract concessions from countries and companies that export goods to the U.S. “If they are not coming in, there is a tariff,” Trump said in his comments on semiconductors. “Like, I would say (Apple CEO) Tim Cook would be in pretty good shape,” he added, as Cook sat across the table. iPhone maker Apple recently raised its total domestic investment commitment in the U.S. to $600 billion over the next four years as tech leaders have warmed up to Trump in his second term.

‎

MacDailyNews Note: Apple Silicon manufacturer TSMC in July announced that it would speed up construction of American chip plants by “several quarters.”

[TITLE]Anthropic raises $13 billion in Series F, valuing company at $183 billion:
[TEXT]
Anthropic has raised $13 billion in a Series F funding round, valuing the company at $183 billion post-money.

Why it matters: The successful fundraise demonstrates investors’ confidence in Anthropic’s financial performance and commitment to fueling its unprecedented growth in the AI industry.

The details:

The round was led by ICONIQ, with significant participation from Fidelity Management & Research Company, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and other notable investors.

Anthropic’s run-rate revenue exceeded $5 billion in August 2025, making it one of the fastest-growing technology companies in history.

The company’s growth is attributed to its leading technical talent, focus on safety, and pioneering research in alignment and interpretability.

Anthropic serves over 300,000 business customers, with a significant increase in large accounts, each representing over $100,000 in run-rate revenue.

Krishna Rao, Chief Financial Officer of Anthropic, stated, “From Fortune 500 companies to AI-native startups, our customers rely on Anthropic’s frontier models and platform products for their most important, mission-critical work. We are experiencing exponential growth in demand across our entire customer base. This financing demonstrates investors’ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and their commitment to fueling our unprecedented growth.”

What’s next: The funding will allow Anthropic to expand its capacity to meet growing enterprise demand, deepen its safety research, and support international expansion, as the company continues to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.

Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), plans to increase its investments in AI startups, following significant investments in Anthropic and XAI.

The details:

QIA was a “significant” investor in Anthropic’s $13 billion financing round, positioning Doha’s wealth fund among key stakeholders.

The decision to invest in AI startups marks a deeper dive into the technology sector for QIA, aligning it with other Gulf sovereign wealth funds in a competitive race to secure prime AI deals.

The move underscores a growing interest from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds in the AI sector, previously dominated by traditional venture capitalists.

Mohammed Al-Hardan, head of technology, media, and telecommunications at QIA, highlighted the importance of these investments as part of the fund’s broader strategy to support innovative technologies and diversify its portfolio.

[TITLE]Comcast Corporation (CMCSA): A Bull Case Theory:
[TEXT]
We came across a bullish thesis on Comcast Corporation on Lame’s Substack. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on CMCSA. Comcast Corporation's share was trading at $33.81 as of August 27th. CMCSA’s trailing and forward P/E were 5.61 and 7.97 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

tiziano-brignoli-aTXxr0gfQzg-unsplash

Comcast Corporation stands as a diversified media and telecommunications giant, touching nearly every facet of consumer life—from high-speed internet and mobile services to streaming content, films, and theme parks. Its largest revenue stream, broadband internet under the Xfinity brand, anchors the company with recurring, high-margin subscription revenue, even as traditional cable TV declines. Comcast has successfully leveraged this connectivity dominance to grow in wireless, reaching 7.5 million Xfinity Mobile lines by late 2024.

The content side, via NBCUniversal and Sky, contributes around one-third of revenue through media networks, film studios, and international platforms, while its streaming service Peacock has rapidly grown to over 36 million subscribers. Though still operating at a loss, Peacock is a strategic long-term bet, with its ad-supported model aligning with Comcast’s advertising strengths. Comcast’s Universal theme parks have emerged as a key growth driver, with nearly $9 billion in 2023 revenue and the major Epic Universe expansion planned for 2025.

Financially, Comcast is strong—generating $16.2 billion in 2024 net income, over $5 billion in quarterly free cash flow, and maintaining investment-grade credit despite a sizeable debt load. Strategic investments in broadband upgrades and content are fueling future growth, while divestments like the planned Hulu stake sale will add cash flexibility. The company also excels in capital returns, with $15 billion in buybacks authorized and a growing dividend yielding ~4%. With a current P/E under 8x and a conservative fair value estimate of $55–$60 per share, Comcast offers compelling upside, driven by stable cash flows, strategic execution, and shareholder-friendly policies.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Comcast Corporation by Boyar Research in February 2025, which highlighted undervaluation, strong free cash flow, and expanding wireless growth. The company’s stock has depreciated by 6.85% since then due to broadband subscriber losses. The thesis still stands as infrastructure investments support long-term upside. Lame shares a similar view but emphasizes Peacock and theme parks as key drivers.

[TITLE]Paramount’s Previous Merger Saga Revisited: John Malone Concedes “Smart Move” By Sumner Redstone But “Huge Disappointment” For Barry Diller:
[TEXT]
Media moguls and frequent business collaborators John Malone and Barry Diller spent part of Thursday’s panel session at the Paley Center for Media recalling the one that got away: Paramount Pictures.

During a luncheon session that also featured Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav and former Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries, Malone touched on a lot of the material in his new book. Born to Be Wired: Lessons from a Lifetime Transforming Television, Wiring America for the Internet, and Growing Formula One, Discovery, SiriusXM, and the Atlanta Braves was published this week by Simon & Schuster.

Three-plus decades before Skydance and other bidders pursued Paramount Global and then ran an obstacle course with regulators and the White House to get the deal through, the previous tussle over the Melrose lot resulted in a lot of spilled ink by the press. (And it was actual ink at the time.)

Watch on Deadline

Sumner Redstone, who ran Viacom at the time, was battling Malone and Diller for control of Paramount. Redstone hit on a legal gambit, to sue Malone personally for making the bid via QVC, the home-shopping channel he and Diller then controlled, a move Redstone claimed was a violation of SEC rules. After the $3 billion complaint was filed, Malone recalled, “I didn’t even get mad at Sumner. … I sat there and said, ‘That’s a smart move.’ It did blow us up. It blew us out of the deal.”

The maneuver undid momentum that had been building on the Malone front after he brought Diller in to oversee QVC.

“Barry’s doing great, the stock is flying, and Barry says, ‘You know, why don’t we use this equity to buy Paramount?'” Malone said. “So, he puts in a Herculean effort to assemble a buyer group, to buy Paramount. And then Sumner blows TCI out with this litigation, and Barry just didn’t want to go that extra mile and take in Bell South as a controlling partner.”

The Federal Trade Commission required TeleCommunications Inc., or TCI (Malone’s company), to withdraw $500 million it had pledged for the deal. That effectively handed the trophy to Redstone, who upped his bid to $10.7 billion.

“So, he stood down,” Malone said of Diller, adding that it was a “great disappointment” given Diller’s background of having run production at the studio. “Obviously, it would have been a huge, huge home run with his talent and Paramount, you know, and the industry behind it.”

Diller praised Malone’s “humanity” and was asked by panel moderator Mark Robichaux what his reaction was to receiving a note of apology from him after the Paramount deal went “sideways.” Had he ever received such a note? “Rarely,” he said. “Rare to never.”

As Malone recounts in the book, Diller showed that pithy side in reacting to the end of the line for his quest for Paramount. He issued a

[TITLE]I’m chief legal officer at a $1 billion IT unicorn and I’ve got Gen Z advice for leaders looking to reimagine entry-level work in the age of AI:
[TEXT]
LinkedIn’s chief economic opportunity officer recently warned that AI is “breaking” entry-level jobs that have historically served as stepping stones for young workers. As Aneesh Raman wrote in The New York Times, “Breaking first is the bottom rung of the career ladder.”

AI tools are performing simple coding and debugging tasks that junior software developers once did to gain experience, along with work that young employees in the legal and retail sectors traditionally handled. Wall Street firms are also reportedly considering steep cuts to entry-level hiring in light of this.

The implications go way beyond individual hardship — they threaten the foundation of how organizations build expertise, maintain security and sustain innovation. However, there are things all organizations can do now to help.

The risks of AI over-reliance in the workforce

Hasty AI adoption at the expense of hiring and developing human workers creates serious security vulnerabilities. AI is only as effective as its inputs, and the interpretation and action steps that follow are only as sound as the skills and contextual understanding of the people involved. In short: reducing human oversight creates breeding grounds for security gaps.

Indeed CEO Chris Hyams recently noted that while AI can’t completely replace a job, “for

[TITLE]Just How Bad Would an AI Bubble Be?:
[TEXT]
If there is any field in which the rise of AI is already said to be rendering humans obsolete—in which the dawn of superintelligence is already upon us—it is coding. This makes the results of a recent study genuinely astonishing.

In the study, published in July, the think tank Model Evaluation & Threat Research randomly assigned a group of experienced software developers to perform coding tasks with or without AI tools. It was the most rigorous test to date of how AI would perform in the real world. Because coding is one of the skills that existing models have largely mastered, just
