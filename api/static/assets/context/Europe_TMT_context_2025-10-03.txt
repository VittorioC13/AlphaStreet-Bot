[TITLE]What’s up with… Vodafone & Telenor, Zayo, NTN R&D:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Vodafone and Telenor are pooling their hefty procurement resources; Zayo believes it has developed a true network-as-a-service (NaaS) solution; non-terrestrial network development partners get UK Space Agency funding; and more!

The global procurement units of Vodafone Group and Telenor have teamed up to “leverage the scale and global capabilities of both groups across major areas of procurement,” a move that will have major network equipment vendors reeling at the prospect of deeper discount requests. The two purchasing units, which have a combined annual spend of €26bn, aim to “unlock savings through combined purchasing power and complementary geographies and expertise. In addition, the partnership will deepen supplier and partner engagement and strengthen supply chain resilience amid a rapidly changing geopolitical global landscape.” Ninian Wilson, Vodafone Group’s supply chain management director and CEO of Vodafone Procure & Connect, commented: “We are excited by the collaboration between our organisations. By combining our scale, complementary footprints and competencies, we will drive sustainable efficiencies and greater innovation for our customers.” And he even pitched an upside for the vendors. “At the same time, we will simplify engagement for our partners, reducing administrative burden and duplication in an increasingly complex environment, while opening new opportunities to our suppliers and partners.”

US long-distance network operator and enterprise service provider Zayo claims that, unlike many of its rivals, it can deliver a network-as-a-service (NaaS) solution that delivers on, and even surpasses, the promises of such a service. Zayo notes that NaaS, which is defined by Gartner as “a highly automated network configuration model with self-service interfaces and dynamic scaling”, has so far “been more promise than reality”, but claims its new DynamicLink service fits the bill. “DynamicLink delivers what others can’t: More reach, broader capabilities and industry-first AI-powered intelligence,” stated Zayo in this announcement, claiming that it is “the most complete NaaS solution on the market, giving organisations real-time control to turn up, scale and manage their networks.” Bill Long, chief product and strategy officer at Zayo, boasted: “We aren’t the first to market here but we are the first to get it right.” No doubt the team at Lumen Technologies, one of Zayo’s fiercest rivals and which announced in August that it has more than 1,000 NaaS customers, will have some thoughts about such claims.

Southampton, UK-based wireless network optimisation specialist AccelerComm, which is developing 5G tech for satellite-enabled communications, and one of its existing partners, telecom software stack developer Radisys (part of Jio Platforms), have received an unspecified sum of funding from the UK Space Agency’s International Bilateral Fund (IBF) to support the development of the next generation of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). “This project will tighten the integration of the two companies' technologies so that they can be offered as a complete package to satellite manufacturer and operator customers,” noted AccelerComm in this announcement. The joint project will see the integration of the latest versions of AccelerComm's Layer 1 (PHY) technology into Radisys's lab in India, “providing a valuable resource for joint research and demonstrations to customers and partners around the world. This builds on the long-term relationship between the two companies, which has positioned them several years ahead of emerging competitors,” stated AccelerComm. David Helfgott, CEO of AccelerComm, stated: “The next generation of NTNs is dependent on 5G base stations operating on board satellites. Making this happen in the extreme environment of earth’s orbit is only possible through close collaboration among companies from across the value chain. Today’s news builds on our long standing partnership with Radisys, further unlocking new business opportunities for Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) 5G communication. It also strengthens the UK's international partnerships in space technologies.”

German operator O2 Telefónica (aka Telefónica Deutschland) has struck a deal with OpenAI to offer ChatGPT Plus to its customers for three months without charge: The regular fee for the generative AI (GenAI) chatbot is €23 per month. “The collaboration with OpenAI enables our customers to use AI in everyday life – whether for learning, working or personal use,” stated Andreas Laukenmann, chief commercial officer at O2 Telefónica. “Together, we’re giving our customers access to ChatGPT Plus and showing that artificial intelligence is not a luxury for the few but a powerful tool for the many,” he added. Jeremy Fine, head of consumer partnerships at OpenAI, stated: “Germany has become our largest market in Europe, with our ChatGPT user base growing fivefold over the past year. Through our collaboration with O2 Telefónica, even more people will be able to access our most advanced AI in ChatGPT and unlock the benefits of this transformative technology.”

[TITLE]How much digital sovereignty does the UK have left?:
[TEXT]
After weeks of stormy headlines, the announcement of tens of billions of pounds of US investment into the UK’s tech sector must have seemed like manna from heaven for the British government. Announced in conjunction with President Donald Trump’s second state visit to these shores, the list of commitments from tech giants including Microsoft, Google and Nvidia would, according to the Business Secretary Peter Kyle, “create thousands of high-quality jobs across the UK — from clean energy to advanced manufacturing.” What’s more, “[w]orking closely with the US strengthens our global position and delivers real results for British businesses.”

The sheer size of the commitments – several of which came with the wonderful word ‘billion’ at the end – made this argument seem especially persuasive. Google would invest £5bn, to be spent on capital investment, R&D and engineering tasks, helping to support over 8,000 jobs a year. Palantir, meanwhile, would create hundreds of new jobs with its £1.5bn investment in the defence technology sector, while a collective £22bn from Microsoft, Coreweave and Salesforce would support the expansion of the UK’s nascent AI infrastructure – with GPU giant Nvidia pouring £500m into UK-based AI firm Nscale to help create a British version of the US ‘Stargate’ program.

As a result, predicted Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, “the UK is going to be an AI superpower,” with the latter deal finally combining much-needed GPU capacity with the country’s prodigious wellspring of AI talent.

Then came the caveats, first, ironically, from Huang himself, who pointed out that there probably wasn’t enough electricity on the grid yet to power all these new AI data centres. Others opined that Nscale, Nvidia’s ostensibly British partner in building out all this infrastructure, was not only functionally beholden to US investor interests over and above its potential UK customers, but ‘owned and operated by Australians,’ had only just opened a London office and operated only one data centre in Norway (in a statement to Tech Monitor, Nscale said that it is “UK-based”, “was officially incorporated in the UK in May 2024” and “has multiple data centres,” the number of which is not disclosed “due to security and client sensitivities.”)

Would, then, the UK’s future be shaped not by its own government and companies, but by US tech giants? For many critics, the answer was indisputably ‘yes,’ and at great cost to this country’s agency in controlling its tech stack, otherwise known as its ‘digital sovereignty.’ The deals announced in the wake of President Trump’s state visit, the Ada Lovelace Institute’s Gaia Marcus warned Politico, increased UK public and private sector reliance on US tech firms – already massive – to a sinister degree. “We mustn’t just focus on what the figures look like today, if the cost is technological lock-in tomorrow, limiting our ability to seek alternatives in the future,” said Marcus. Ex-Meta majordomo and former Lib-Dem deputy prime minister Nick Clegg went even further, arguing that British tech prowess was “defanged” by such arrangements, which were little more than Silicon Valley’s “sloppy seconds.”

The CIO’s view of digital sovereignty

Is that fair? From the UK government’s point of view, after all, these are probably minor niggles in what constitutes a near-unprecedented slew of investment deals for this country’s economy. Heaven knows we need it. The UK not only lacks for AI infrastructure, but also the means and impetus to invest in such infrastructure itself. It’s not going to come from the government – spending commitments to repair the damage caused by decades of underinvestment in comparatively more important areas like transport, health, social care and defence have put paid to that – and British businesses have historically proven reluctant to match the commitments of their French, German or US counterparts to invest in themselves, much less the wider tech sector.

If the money comes from foreign investment, then, what’s there to worry about? After all, it’s not going to make much functional difference for consumers used to using Google, ChatGPT or Microsoft Word. At the C-suite level, it gets a bit more complicated. Those companies for which data residency laws are actually something to worry
