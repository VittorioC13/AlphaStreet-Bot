[TITLE]The rise of corporate R&D rescue missions: more companies are spinning out multinational innovations:
[TEXT]
Photo courtesy of rawpixel.com on Freepik.

Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.

Let’s say you’re a researcher at a major multinational corporation, and you’ve developed a groundbreaking technology that will change the world. Then you get notice that your innovation has been shelved — because it’s not central to the company’s mission. This frustration is felt by many researchers at numerous multinational corporations around the world.

According to the EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard, multinationals and large corporations now invest over $1 trillion every year. Even more staggering, McKinsey reported that large enterprises invested $2.3 trillion in R&D in 2019. The firm also states that many enterprises lack an R&D strategy capable of realizing their aspirations.

As a result, a lot of these technologies are failing to reach end customers, being shelved due to issues like timing, internal misalignment or lack of commercialization expertise. But corporations without the R&D strategy needed to successfully commercialize their innovations have a new way to bring them to market: by spinning them out into new companies.

The trend: Spinning out dormant tech

Colin Scott, senior vice president of New Company Development at Innventure, is seeing a fundamental shift in how corporations view unrealized R&D. The firm has evaluated over 150 opportunities and found that multinationals are sitting on breakthrough solutions that solve real-market problems but fall outside core operations.

Corporations are increasingly partnering with outside firms, incubators, or venture studios to unlock value. This is part of a larger shift toward open innovation and reducing R&D waste. Some companies are creating internal venture studios; others are licensing or selling intellectual property to third parties.

How spin-offs draw value from technology

Specialized venture builders like Innventure and some major conglomerates are carving out a niche in the rescue model for shelved technologies. One of the most widely publicized spins among conglomerates is GE, which split into three separate companies so that it could spin out its health care, aviation, and energy technologies — boosting market value and increasing flexibility in the process.

While the majority of GE’s major technologies in those three segments weren’t exactly shelved, spinning them out separately enabled the three companies to focus more on their areas of expertise, potentially developing even more innovations that could’ve been shelved while they were part of the massive GE conglomerate. The giant has been known to let projects in development fall dormant in the past, like its plans for an Amazon-like cloud several years ago.

Additionally, Siemens spun off its health care business in 2018 to create Siemens Healthineers and its energy business in 2020 to establish independent players that are more focused on the internally developed technologies.

Similarly, Innventure partners with multi-national corporations to spin out their shelved innovations. Using its DownSelect framework, the company demonstrates how structured evaluation reduces risk. Innventure Chief Growth Officer Roland Austrup said when spinning out dormant technologies at multi-nationals, they look for several indicators.

First, does the technology solve a significant unmet market need? Second, is there an economic value proposition that’s immediate, compelling, and quantifiable? Third, can this technology reach billion-dollar value?

How spinning out technologies unlocks value

Spinning out shelved technologies signals a shift in how corporations think about their innovation portfolios. It opens opportunities for investors, startups, and entrepreneurs to access high-value IP, and it could accelerate commercialization of sustainability tech, health care advances, and AI tools that might otherwise never reach the market.

Multinationals that spin out their dormant technologies can tap into those innovations for their own uses — without having to be in a business they don’t want to be in. For example, a major corporation developed sustainable packaging it could use for its products, but it didn’t want to be in the packaging industry. Spinning out that innovation created the ability for it to use that technology for its own products while reaping the financial benefits of such a transaction.

According to Austrup, value creation happens through focus and specialization. Inside a multinational, breakthrough innovations compete with billion-dollar core businesses for resources. Outside, they get dedicated teams, capital, and strategic attention.

The value unlocks three ways: First, multinationals monetize R&D that would otherwise sit unrealized — they get equity stakes, royalties, and solutions to their strategic problems. Second, specialized operators create companies worth multiples of the initial investment through focused execution.

Third, markets get transformative solutions to urgent problems. Having a good idea doesn’t mean you can run a business. Building the right team is crucial for unlocking that value.

In some ways, this model takes the best of private equity and pairs it with the replacement of inexperienced founders with experienced owner-operators. PE firms come alongside startups and provide funding and sometimes guidance, but they also may take a more hands-off approach. In fact, one could even call this practice “PE in disguise.”

[TITLE]Stripe Atlas startups in 2025: Year in review:
[TEXT]
2025 was a breakout year for early-stage startups: founders launched more companies and generated revenue faster than ever.

Delaware C corporations grew an average of 41% year over year for the past 6 months, according to the Delaware Division of Corporations. US investors deployed more capital into larger seed rounds in 2025 compared to previous years, enabling founders to hire earlier, accelerate product development, and invest in customer acquisition from the outset. Case in point: among startups incorporated through Stripe Atlas, a platform that helps founders incorporate their company, 20% now land their first paying customer within 30 days of incorporation—more than double the rate in 2020.

Notably, this acceleration in early-stage revenue growth happened even as the share of funded Atlas startups declined in 2025, suggesting that speed-to-revenue isn’t just a function of outside funding.

Atlas now incorporates one in five Delaware C corps, giving us unique visibility into how quickly founders generate revenue, how they structure teams, and how many countries and customers they reach in their first months. Looking at our data from the 23,000 companies that incorporated in 2025 versus prior years, three shifts stand out: customer bases are more international than ever, time-to-revenue has compressed, and founders are turning their attention to AI agents over AI infrastructure or copilots.

Startups in 2025 are more global than ever

The number of countries represented by Atlas incorporations hit 169 in 2025—an all-time high—up from 158 in 2024. This year also marked Atlas’s first-ever founders from the Central African Republic, Comoros, San Marino, and Vanuatu.

While 56% of Atlas startups are based in the US, the founder base has become more global.

Europe saw the largest year-over-year increase in its share of Atlas incorporations in 2025, with European founder incorporations growing 48%. The strongest European incorporation growth was concentrated in the UK, France, and Germany.

Amid tighter capital constraints at home, European founders are increasingly incorporating in Delaware to access US capital markets. This trend reflects a persistent funding gap: startups in the US pulled in nearly half of $36 billion in global seed funding in 2025.

Founding teams span multiple countries

The rise of remote work has led to more distributed founding teams, with cofounders often living in different cities or countries. Among Atlas startups with more than 1 founder, 24% now span multiple countries—a 79% increase since 2017. The most common country pairings for multicountry Atlas founding teams are Canada and the US, the UK and the US, and India and the US.

To understand how these distributed teams form, we surveyed a subset of Atlas teams with cofounders based in different countries. We found two paths: roughly half the founding teams met in person first, then moved to different countries. The other half met entirely online, typically through professional projects. This represents a new model of company formation: founders prioritize the right partnership over physical proximity.

Cross-border startup activity reaches new highs

For years, selling internationally was something you tackled after nailing product-market fit at home. That mental model is becoming obsolete.

Between 2017 and 2024, the median Atlas startup sold to customers in one country during its first six months. In 2025, that doubled to 2 countries, and at the 90th percentile, startups reached 15 countries—up from 12 last year. The typical startup is now cross-border from the start.

These startups are reaching customers across an unprecedented number of countries. For example, Rork, a no-code website and app builder, reached 69 countries in its first month accepting payments on Stripe. The startup generated $100,000 in revenue in 5 days from a viral X post. Zeabur, from Taiwan, was used by software developers in 46 countries to deploy and operate services, including databases, open source projects, and custom applications.

There are several factors at play. Payments infrastructure and compliance tools have reduced technical barriers, while cloud infrastructure and translation APIs have reduced dependency on local servers and custom localization work. Distributed founding teams come with built-in international networks: when your cofounder lives in London and you’re in Bangalore, you’re not “expanding to Europe and India.” You’re just selling to your networks. For companies starting in 2025, going global has become a default posture at launch.

Speed to revenue is accelerating

Founders are generating revenue faster than ever. The share of Atlas startups charging their first customer within 30 days hit an all-time high of 20% in 2025, up from 8% in 2020.

Among startups that monetize quickly (i.e., those accepting payment within their first three months), the pace also accelerated. The median time to first payment fell nearly 11% year over year in 2025, from 38 to 34 days—the fastest since 2020.

Contributing to this speed: accepting payments no longer requires waiting for an EIN when you incorporate with Atlas. Beginning in January 2025, Atlas enabled founders to accept payments immediately after incorporation, saving founders outside the US from waiting up to five months for their EIN during tax season.

The infrastructure change explains part of the acceleration, but revenue growth points to a separate dynamic. The median first 6 months of revenue for the 2025 Atlas cohort jumped 39% year over year. Founders are shipping products and finding customers faster.

More companies are hitting $100K faster

In 2025, more Atlas startups hit $100,000 of revenue in their first 6 months—56% more than in 2024—and they got there nearly 11% faster (108 days versus 121).

Atlas startups are also landing more customers: an average of 242 in their first 6 months, up over 50% from the prior year.

The gap between breakout and average is widening

The median Atlas startup that incorporated in 2025 generated 39% more revenue in its first 6 months than its 2024 counterpart. But the gains weren’t evenly distributed. Startups at the 10th percentile generated 18% more than their 2024 counterparts. At the 90th percentile, the increase was 52%—widening the gap between top and bottom performers.

Outliers have always been the driving force in startups. But this year’s outliers are pulling even further ahead than prior cohorts. At the same time, the entire distribution is shifting up: at month 6, the median Atlas startup formed in 2025 is growing as fast as the 90th percentile startup from 2024.

Revenue is growing faster because it’s easier for new companies to start monetizing. Modern developer tools allow developers to ship faster. Global payments, compliance management, and financial infrastructure have improved. As a result, founders can move from incorporation to revenue in weeks instead of months.

AI is changing what founders are choosing to build

Startups reveal where founders and investors see opportunity. In January 2023, just 15% of Atlas founders told us they were building AI startups. By 2024, that rose to 33%. In 2025, it hit 42%.

AI is spreading beyond venture-backed startups, as well. This is particularly evident among LLCs: the structure often chosen by small teams and bootstrapped businesses for its flexibility. In January 2023, 5% of Atlas LLCs identified as AI companies; today, it’s 22%.

This rise in AI-focused formations might be associated with a decline in the share of funded Atlas startups. Total Delaware C corp formations are up 28% in 2025, according to the Delaware Division of Corporations, but Carta data shows pre-seed deal count in H1 2025 is largely unchanged from last year. Among Atlas startups at least 6 months old in 2025, only 2.2% have fundraised within 3 months of incorporating—down from 3.1% in 2024. With Crunchbase reporting a 40% year-over-year increase in AI startups’ share of global seed capital, founders might be gravitating toward AI to improve their odds.

One possible explanation for the funding rate decline is that founders can do more with less capital. Since 2019, the average time to first hire within 1 year has increased nearly 49%, according to Carta data. Startups are operating lean longer, enabled by AI coding assistants, no-code development platforms, and automated marketing tools that reduce the need for early headcount.

The focus is shifting to agents

Among Atlas startups that say they’re building AI infrastructure, copilots, or agents, nearly half are building agents in 2025—up from one in eight in 2024.

2023 AI startups focused on infrastructure and copilots—AI assistants embedded in existing workflows. Now the focus has shifted to AI agents: autonomous systems that can act on a person’s behalf, from qualifying sales leads and resolving support tickets to completing purchases and writing code. As the underlying models commoditize, founders are building executors, not assistants—systems that can browse, buy, research, and analyze without human input. Atlas formation data suggests that’s where founders are seeing the opportunity.

[TITLE]ChatGPT Thinks Palantir Stock Will Close At This Price In The Next 60 Days:
[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Shares of Palantir Technologies traded slightly higher over the past month, a solid continuation of its exceptional year as the market’s premier artificial intelligence pure-play. The stock is currently reflecting intense investor interest driven by its rapidly adopted Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).

Against that backdrop, we ran Palantir Technologies through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI’s GPT. The goal was not to chase a sensational long-term target, but to see how a data-driven model handicaps the next 60 days for a stock that has become shorthand for the entire AI trade.

What the AI model is actually predicting

The agent was asked to generate a 2-month outlook for Palantir Technologies, using recent price action and a focused set of technical indicators. At the time of the run, Palantir traded at $184. For the period from Dec. 16 through Feb. 10, the model’s base-case projection came out to:

Average predicted price: $187

Implied move: roughly higher over the next month

Signal snapshot: The technical indicators (MACD and RSI) both skewed positive

The model is saying that, given current momentum and volatility, the most likely path is a modest grind higher from current levels rather than a dramatic reset. Still, broader AI price prediction says that Palantir Technologies could hit $180-$250 by 2030, which illustrates the massive long-term upside baked into the current valuation.

The primary driver of Palantir's meteoric rise and a core factor in the AI model's bullish bias is the commercial success of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Designed to help enterprises quickly integrate generative AI models into their operations, AIP is seeing accelerating adoption. Recent reports show a significant surge in commercial customers and contract value, moving the company beyond its historically dominant, but sometimes volatile, government segment. This commercial expansion is crucial for transforming Palantir from a specialist vendor to a true enterprise software giant.

The model’s conservative short-term forecast, despite a positive technical signal, likely reflects the extreme valuation Palantir currently commands. Trading at high multiples of forward sales and earnings, the stock has already priced in several years of phenomenal growth. This high valuation acts as a form of resistance, making every percentage point increase harder to earn. The market is showing minimal tolerance for any misstep in earnings or customer growth, meaning even a small hiccup could trigger a sharp pullback.

[TITLE]Technology M&A: AI infrastructure and regulation redefine the deal cycle:

Deals are ramping up in the tech space, driven by trends like AI, cybersecurity and connectivity. Credit: Adobe/Creative-Touch.

A powerful rebound in tech dealmaking

Despite a forbidding backdrop of geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty, technology M&A has hit the accelerator. In the third quarter of 2025, transactions in the tech, media and telecom (TMT) sector reached $256 billion, a 51% jump on the previous quarter. The scale of the rebound is significant in a market that only recently seemed stuck in neutral.

The resurgence has been led by very large transactions. Deals worth $1 billion or more accounted for $220 billion of Q3 2025 value, spread across 37 mega-deals. The largest of these was the $55 billion takeover of Electronic Arts by a consortium including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, which alone absorbed more than a fifth of quarterly tech deal value. Buyers are once again prepared to commit serious capital. Yet, in an age of anxiety

Beijing has greenlit Biren Technology's initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong, as more Chinese artificial intelligence chip designers rush to go public amid heightened investor interest in these stocks.

Biren, which designs high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs), received regulatory approval to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange, according to a China Securities Regulatory Commission filing on Monday. This was expected to put the company on track to become the first GPU developer to go public in Hong Kong.

[TITLE]China AI chip firm Biren to launch Hong Kong IPO in coming weeks, sources say:
[TEXT]
BEIJING/HONG KONG, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Chinese AI chip startup Biren Technology aims to launch a Hong Kong initial public offering in the coming weeks, four sources with knowledge of ​the matter said.

The IPO could raise $300 million, local Chinese media reported. One of the sources ‌confirmed the number to Reuters.

The Shanghai-based company, along with other domestic rivals, is banking on rapid growth as China seeks to develop ‌domestic alternatives to U.S. semiconductors amid stringent export restrictions by Washington on advanced chips.

Biren could kick off the offering as early as this month and debut in January, said two of the sources.

According to a Monday notice from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), Biren plans to issue up to 372.5 million shares in Hong ⁠Kong and its shareholders will convert ‌873.3 million onshore shares into Hong Kong-listed stock.

The sources declined to be identified as the information was confidential. Biren did not respond to a Reuters query for ‍comment.

CHINA'S CHIP AMBITIONS

Beijing has prioritised building homegrown champions in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are critical for artificial intelligence development.

The planned IPO would follow successful offerings from industry peers Moore Threads and MetaX that were thousands of times oversubscribed.

Moore Threads' ​shares soared over 400% in its December 5 Shanghai debut.

Founded in 2019, Biren's co-founders include Zhang Wen, ‌formerly a president at leading AI face-recognition company SenseTime, and Jiao Guofang, who previously worked at Qualcomm and Huawei.

The company initially drew attention in 2022 when it unveiled a first batch of products, including its BR100 chip, which it claimed could match the performance of Nvidia's advanced H100 AI processor.

However, the company was added to the U.S. 'Entity List' in 2023, preventing it from using leading global foundry TSMC to ⁠manufacture its chips.

Biren was valued at approximately 14 billion yuan ($2 ​billion) prior to a funding round in the first half ​of 2025, when it raised

[TITLE]Tech war 2.0: The dangers of Trump's 'G2' bargaining with an emboldened China:
[TEXT]
When Beijing sharply reduced exports of rare earths, germanium and other critical materials throughout 2025, the tech war entered a more dangerous phase. During part one, the first Trump administration and subsequently the Biden administration had insisted that ever more stringent high-tech controls on the transfer of American, European, and other partners’ technologies to China were non-negotiable, invoking national security. The US objective was to maintain – and later maximise – its (military-)technological edge over China.

Then China changed the game. What began as a struggle over leading and trailing-edge American and partner high-tech evolved into a contest over access to crucial, but barely lucrative or even unprofitable inputs for all industries. Beijing used the export controls it had gradually introduced between August 2023 and April 2025 to not just squeeze critical mineral supply to the US, but also to most other countries. The stakes are enormous: these materials are the skeleton of our healthcare, energy and weapon systems and of the global economy more broadly. Soon after Beijing cut mineral supplies, President Trump lowered tariffs, again allowed exports of Nvidia’s H20 (and later H200) chips, and rolled back some other tech restrictions.

This Brief tracks the transformation of the US-China tech war to identify the most serious risks for Europe and the options to mitigate them. Europe faces a dual threat. The first stems from a United States that strikes ‘G2’ bargains with Beijing that benefit US tech exports, while retaining the legal tools to block European high-tech exports. More dangerously, Europe confronts an emboldened China that drip-feeds critical minerals to foreign industries.

Throughout 2025, Beijing’s strategy has caused production disruptions around the world, while demonstrating its ability to tighten the thumbscrews with devastating effect – including if Europe protests

[TITLE]General Assembly Speakers Push to Close Digital Divides, Transform Promise of World Summit on Information Society into Real-World Gains for All:
[TEXT]
Ministers from around the world today underscored the role of the UN in creating a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented digital future as the General Assembly took stock of the implementation of commitments made at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).

The Summit is an evolving multi-stakeholder platform that addresses issues raised by information and communications technologies. It was first held in two phases, in Geneva in 2003 and in Tunis in 2005. The WSIS Forum is an annual multi-stakeholder event, and in 2025, it took the shape of the WSIS+20 High-Level Event, held in July in Geneva, Switzerland.

Solly Malatsi, Minister for Communications and Digital Technologies of South Africa, who chaired that event, said there was widespread support for the continuation of the WSIS architecture, “provided that the process and the way we work evolves with changing times”. “We must close the remaining digital divides”, address affordability, and equip people — especially women, youth, persons with disabilities and communities in the Global South — to participate meaningfully in the information society. WSIS has been a compass for his country’s digital journey. In 2005, fewer than 1 in 10 South Africans were online. Today, almost 8 in 10 are connected, 4G coverage is at 99 per cent “and more than a million kilometres of fibre knit our country together”. But 13 million South Africans are still offline.

Digital Divides as Development Divides

Many speakers from the Global South highlighted this disconnect — despite concerted efforts to adopt technology, it is challenging to keep pace. The representative of Lesotho highlighted the WSIS+20 outcome document’s focus on closing persistent digital divides, which is crucial for remote communities in landlocked least developed countries such as hers. Lesotho has achieved over 95 per cent mobile coverage across mountainous terrain; integrated non-geostationary orbit satellite services to extend high-speed broadband and is leveraging “its unique high-altitude location, natural quietness and cold climate to attract investments in energy and data centers”, she said. However, she expressed concern

[TITLE]Verizon partners with Array Digital Infrastructure for tower usage:
[TEXT]
Verizon Communications Inc. and Array Digital Infrastructure, Inc. have entered into a new strategic partnership through which the carrier will use Array’s national portfolio of 4,400 towers to enhance its 5G network.

The multi-year deal permits Verizon to co-locate on several new Array Digital Infrastructure sites over the next several years for an established — though undisclosed — price.

“This strategic partnership with Array is a key part of our network tower management strategy,” Phillip French, Verizon vice president of engineering, said in a prepared statement.

“It provides us with the nimbleness and flexibility to manage our network portfolio efficiently. The streamlined agreement allows for greater cost efficiency and, most importantly, accelerates our ability to deploy advanced wireless technologies to Verizon customers across the nation.”

“Our partnership with Verizon, particularly with this new agreement, creates great opportunities for both organizations,” said Array Digital Infrstructure President and CEO Anthony Carlson. “We’re pleased to continue growing Array and strengthening our position as one of the leading tower companies in the United States.”

Array Digital Infrastructure, formerly known as UScellular, was in the news recently after the purchase of some of its spectrum by AT&T was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

The $101.8 billion deal, first announced in early November 2024, was part of Array Digital Infrastructure’s effort to divest itself of licenses that were not included in the company’s acquisition by T-Mobile.

The FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau portrayed the deal as posing little risk and agreed that a significant upside potential exists. But the Rural Wireless Association (RWA) released a statement criticizing the FCC decision and a decision related to a different Verizon/Array Digital Infrastructure deal than the one announced today.

“These two staff level decisions, along with an expected decision allowing Verizon to acquire UScellular spectrum collectively, amount to the death of mobile wireless competition,” RWA outside counsel Carri Bennet said in the statement.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 228 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 1.8%.Slightly more stocks rose within the S&P 500 than fell, but they got drowned out by the drops for companies in the artificial-intelligence industry.Questions continue to dog the former superstars

[TITLE]Instacart shares drop on report that FTC is probing company over AI pricing tool:
[TEXT]
Shares of grocery delivery service Instacart dropped about 7% in extended trading on Wednesday, following a report that said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has begun an investigation into the company's pricing practices.

The FTC sent a civil investigative demand to Instacart, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people.

"The Federal Trade Commission has a longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations," the FTC told CNBC in a statement. "But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practice."

A study released last week showed that prices for the same products in the same supermarkets that work with Instacart can vary by around 7%, which can result in over $1,000 in extra annual costs for customers. Instacart responded by saying that retailers determine prices listed in the app.

In 2022, Instacart spent $59 million to acquire Eversight, a company specializing in artificial intelligence-driven pricing and promotions for retailers and consumer packaged goods. Instacart sought to "create compelling savings opportunities for customers in real-time" with Eversight, according to a regulatory filing.

Instacart declined to comment on the investigation but said reporting has mischaracterized its pricing system.

"Much of what's been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart," a company spokesperson said in an email. "First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing – prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices.

"These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores."

Earlier on Wednesday, Robert Garcia, a U.S. House Democrat from California, sent a letter to Instacart CEO Chris Rogers asking for a report on how the company sets prices.

"It is unconscionable that corporations are adding to Americans' financial strain with algorithmic — and potentially surveillance — pricing," wrote Garcia, who is ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

[TITLE]Technology M&A: AI infrastructure and regulation redefine the deal cycle:

A powerful rebound in tech dealmaking

Despite a forbidding backdrop of geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty, technology M&A has hit the accelerator. In the third quarter of 2025, transactions in the tech, media and telecom (TMT) sector reached $256 billion, a 51% jump on the previous quarter. The scale of the rebound is significant in a market that only recently seemed stuck in neutral.

The resurgence has been led by very large transactions. Deals worth $1 billion or more accounted for $220 billion of Q3 2025 value, spread across 37 mega-deals. The largest of these was the $55 billion takeover of Electronic Arts by a consortium including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, which alone absorbed more than a fifth of quarterly tech deal value. Buyers are once again prepared to commit serious capital. Yet, in an age of anxiety
