[TITLE]The Ticker: A crisis at chipmaker Nexperia sent automakers scrambling:
[TEXT]
A power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, is impacting global auto production. The Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, citing national security concerns. This move highlights vulnerabilities in the technology supply chain, affecting automakers like Honda, which halted production at a Mexican factory. The dispute is part of a broader U.S.-China tech rivalry, with Europe caught in the middle. Recent talks between the Dutch and Chinese governments show signs of resolving the crisis.

Modern automobiles rely on so-called discrete chips made by companies like Nexperia, which, unlike more advanced microprocessors, perform a single function. Leaders at big carmakers spelled out their worries in the latest round of earnings calls, saying that finding a replacement for Nexperia at scale in the short term will be difficult.

Pfizer clinches deal for obesity drug developer Metsea after a bidding war with Novo Nordisk

Pfizer has signed a deal to purchase Metsera Inc., an obesity drugmaker in the development stage, after winning a bidding war against Novo Nordisk. Metsera, based in New York, is developing oral and injectable treatments for obesity and diabetes. On Friday, Metsera announced that Pfizer will acquire the company for up to $86.25 per share, including cash and contingent value rights. Metsera’s board said it believes this deal offers the best value and certainty for shareholders. Novo Nordisk, which had increased its offer to $10 billion, announced on Saturday that it would not continue pursuing the acquisition.

A quiet security check in Norway has suddenly sparked concern across Europe. Dozens of Chinese-made electric buses were meant to push cities toward cleaner transport, until a troubling tech discovery changed everything.Now Denmark is rushing to act, worried it may be facing the same hidden threat.Norway’s capital, Oslo, had rolled out hundreds of Chinese Yutong electric buses as part of its clean-energy transition. But routine security testing uncovered something no one expected: the buses could reportedly be accessed remotely from China, raising fears that the manufacturer could disable them in seconds, as per a report by Supercar Blondie.The finding forced Norway’s public transport authority, Ruter, to make a drastic move. Officials removed the SIM cards from the buses, a fix that blocks any potential interference but also prevents software updates that keep the vehicles running smoothly. The sudden discovery left authorities stunned, and other nations quickly took notice, as per a report by Supercar Blondie.The issue surfaced after authorities realized the same technology used for over-the-air updates could allow remote shutdowns. That meant the manufacturer had theoretical access to the entire fleet. In a worst-case scenario, the buses could be switched off instantly.With Norway acting fast, Denmark has now been pushed into a similar scramble. Movia, Denmark’s biggest public transport provider, has 262 Yutong electric buses on its roads. Officials are now trying to determine whether those vehicles pose the same threat, as per a report by Supercar Blondie.Movia Chief Operating Officer Jeppe Gaard stressed that the issue is not exclusive to one country’s vehicles. “This is not a Chinese bus problem. It is a problem for all types of vehicles and devices with Chinese electronics built in,” he told The Guardian.Yutong defended its practices, saying it “strictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards,” adding that data is encrypted and “used solely for vehicle-related maintenance, optimisation, and improvement to meet customers’ after-sales service needs. No one is allowed to access or view this data without customer authorization.”Danish civil protection agency Samsik echoed that there have been no known cases of remote access, but admitted that sensors, cameras, and microphones in such vehicles create potential risks. “The authorities have previously advised the transport sector in relation to the purchase of Chinese electric buses and are ready to advise and guide companies and authorities on the prevention and handling of threats,” a spokesperson said.While Chinese electric brands like BYD and XPeng continue expanding across Europe, with BYD recently becoming the continent’s top-selling brand, the situation has shaken confidence. Norway remains a world leader in EV adoption, with over 97 percent of cars sold in 2025 being electric. But the discovery shows that even in the most advanced markets, cybersecurity concerns are becoming impossible to overlook, as per a report by Supercar Blondie.As Europe accelerates toward electrified transport, this incident serves as a reminder: clean energy may be the future, but cybersecurity is becoming just as crucial as battery power.Security testing in Norway showed Yutong buses could be remotely accessed, prompting Denmark to check its own fleet.Authorities removed SIM cards from the buses to stop remote access, though it prevents updates.

[TITLE]Amazon workers with disabilities file suit against tech giant, alleging systematic discrimination:
[TEXT]
A group of Amazon (AMZN) employees has filed a lawsuit against the tech giant, claiming the company systematically discriminated against disabled workers in part due to its alleged use of artificial intelligence.

Nine Amazon employees across multiple divisions and states filed a complaint proposing a class action in a federal district court in Seattle on Oct. 20. Their suit claims Amazon unlawfully denies nearly all medical requests to work remotely as the tech giant pursues its controversial return to office policy — and allegedly uses AI to handle accommodations requests. The suit said the company terminates employees or forces them to take unpaid leave rather than granting their requests for medical accommodations.

A judge must certify the lawsuit as a class action for it to move forward.

The company filed a response opposing the complaint this past Tuesday, arguing the employees’ case is "fundamentally flawed."

Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser told Yahoo Finance in an email: "Most of the allegations in this case are simply untrue and intentionally misleading, and we plan to demonstrate that through the legal process."

The plaintiffs are represented by New York-based law firm Harman Green PC, which represents about two dozen disabled Amazon employees overall.

“We feel very confident about our claims,” said attorney Walker Harman Jr.

The legal action is one of the latest in a series of employee discrimination lawsuits against Amazon. In late October, New Jersey’s attorney general filed a complaint accusing the company of discriminating against disabled and pregnant warehouse workers. In 2022, the New York State Division of Human Rights filed a similar lawsuit, alleging that Amazon’s policies force disabled and pregnant warehouse workers to take unpaid leave rather than accommodate them.

Many other cases have been filed by workers against the tech giant in the last decade, alleging disability, race, and gender discrimination. Such cases have yielded mixed outcomes — some resulting in wins by workers and settlements, others in victories for Amazon.

Amazon is one of the largest US employers, with more than 1.5 million employees. Last week it announced thousands of layoffs as it aggressively invests in AI.

The employees participating in the latest suit — which would be ruled on as a class action by Judge John Chun in the Western District of Washington, should it go forward — range from warehouse workers to software engineers.

Nearly all of the workers allege Amazon failed to grant medical accommodations necessary to their health and safety. The complaint said that Amazon’s requirement that employees use its “A to Z” app when requesting accommodations created technical issues and resulted in significant delays.

Lots of leftists are crowing about those 2 Georgia rats winning “Utilities Commissioner” jobs over sitting Republicans, but the problem here is obvious: The current system of utilities essentially being regulated by the state is NOT working. I am NOT any kind of broad electrical engineer who understands how power generation, grids/transport of energy, etc works - I’m just saying. My gut says GOVERNMENT OUT! and let the market decide. Maybe there is a role for oversight and regulation; I’m not a crank. But look around folks - blue states, red states, purple states. The current regulatory schema in play seems to be nothing more than a political griftback schema that it is damn near as non-partisan as it gets in this country anymore. How about we fix that?

[TITLE]AWS DevOps Professional Practice Tests on Exam Topics:
[TEXT]
The AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional exam validates your ability to provision, operate, and manage distributed systems on AWS with strong focus on automation, observability, reliability, and security.

It targets practitioners with two or more years of hands-on experience with AWS, CI or CD, infrastructure as code, and operational excellence practices.

If you are mapping a broader certification plan, see the full AWS certification catalog and compare adjacent tracks such as Solutions Architect, Security, Developer, Data Engineer, and ML Specialty.

For cross-cloud perspective you can also review the GCP pathways including DevOps Engineer and Solutions Architect Professional.

DevOps exam content domains and weights The blueprint is organized into six domains that reflect how DevOps engineers deliver value on AWS. Each domain contributes a percentage to your total score so you should allocate study time accordingly. If your background is primarily development, supplement with Scrum Master and Product Owner resources to sharpen delivery flow and release planning. Builders coming from ML should also glance at AWS ML topics and even AI Practitioner for responsible AI context that increasingly intersects with DevOps. Domain 1 SDLC automation – 22 percent

Domain 2 configuration management and infrastructure as code – 17 percent

Domain 3 resilient cloud solutions – 15 percent

Domain 4 monitoring and logging – 15 percent

Domain 5 incident and event response – 14 percent

Domain 6 security and compliance – 17 percent

Domain 1 SDLC automation This domain focuses on building robust delivery pipelines and choosing safe deployment strategies. If you like structured drills, timed sets on platforms such as Udemy practice exams help you internalize AWS exam phrasing even when the course title targets another cert. Implement CI and CD pipelines You configure version control integration, build stages, artifact management, and automated deployments that span single and multi account environments. The mindset transfers from associate tracks like Developer Associate and Solutions Architect Associate. Connect repositories and trigger builds and tests on pull requests and merges

Generate and promote artifacts through environments

Choose deployment patterns that reduce risk and enable rollback Integrate automated testing You position unit, integration, acceptance, security, and performance tests at the right stages in the pipeline. Teams that embrace Scrum practices often find test placement and definition of done easier to standardize. Gate promotions on test outcomes and health signals

Exercise applications at scale and interpret exit codes and metrics Build and manage artifacts You create secure artifact repositories and control lifecycles and provenance. These patterns complement data movement concerns that appear on Data Engineer and GCP Data Engineer Professional. Produce container images, function bundles, and AMIs through repeatable builds

Sign, scan, and promote artifacts across accounts Deploy to instances, containers, and serverless You select deployment approaches that fit each runtime and business need. The blue green and canary release patterns will also appear in GCP DevOps Engineer prep, which makes them worth mastering. Use blue green or canary for safe releases

Automate agent configuration and troubleshoot rollout failures

Domain 2 configuration management and infrastructure as code This domain covers how you define, standardize, and govern cloud infrastructure at scale. If your long term goal includes architecture leadership, align these skills with the guidance in Solutions Architect Professional. Define cloud infrastructure with reusable components You compose templates and modules that encode security controls, guardrails, and best practices. Model networks, compute, storage, and policies as code

Deploy stacks consistently across accounts and Regions Automate account provisioning and governance You standardize account creation and baseline configuration for multi account setups. The same governance ideas show up on GCP Workspace Administrator and GCP Security Engineer. Apply organization structures and service control policies

Enable configuration recording, drift detection, and change approval flows Automate operations at scale You build runbooks and workflows that keep fleets configured, patched, and compliant. For end to end delivery literacy consider complementing with GCP Developer Professional or GCP Data Practitioner resources. Automate inventory, patching, and state management

Orchestrate complex tasks with event driven functions and workflows

Domain 3 resilient cloud solutions This domain validates your ability to keep systems highly available, scalable, and recoverable. Many resilience patterns overlap with architect content, so browsing Solutions Architect Associate summaries can help. Design for high availability and fault tolerance You translate business objectives into technical resilience and remove single points of failure. Use multi Availability Zone and multi Region patterns where needed

Implement health checks, graceful degradation, and failover routing Scale elastically You select the right auto scaling, load balancing, and caching strategies for each layer. Scale instances, containers, serverless functions, and data services with appropriate metrics

Design loosely coupled and distributed architectures for growth Automate recovery and disaster readiness You meet recovery time and recovery point targets with tested procedures. If you also study analytics stacks, compare backup choices with those seen in GCP Database Engineer Pro. Choose backup and recovery patterns such as pilot light and warm standby

Practice failovers and document restoration workflows

Domain 4 monitoring and logging This domain ensures you can observe complex systems and turn signals into action. The mental models carry nicely to GCP Network Engineer troubleshooting and GCP Associate Engineer operations. Collect, aggregate, and store telemetry You capture logs and metrics securely with the right retention and encryption. Create custom metrics and metric filters from logs

Stream telemetry to analytics and long term storage Audit and analyze signals You build dashboards, anomaly alarms, and queries that reveal health and trends. Correlate traces, metrics, and logs to pinpoint issues

Use managed analytics to search and visualize events Automate monitoring and event management You connect events to notifications and remediation without manual effort. Trigger alerts, functions, and self healing actions on thresholds and patterns

Install and manage agents safely across fleets

Domain 5 incident and event response This domain focuses on how you detect, triage, and resolve operational issues. Many event driven patterns echo what you will use in ML pipelines or AI agents so a scan of AI Practitioner and GCP Generative AI Leader can broaden your perspective. Process events and notify the right channels You integrate native event sources and build fan out pipelines for processing. Capture platform health, audit trails, and service events

Drive queues, streams, and workflows to coordinate actions Apply configuration changes safely You modify infrastructure and application settings in response to events without creating new risk. Roll back misconfigurations quickly

Automate fleet wide updates through managed services Troubleshoot and perform root cause analysis You analyze failed deployments, scaling behaviors, and timeouts with structured methods. For deeper architecture tradeoffs, the pro level architect guide at Solutions Architect Professional is a helpful companion. Use traces, metrics, logs, and health data to isolate faults

Document findings and preventive actions for future resilience

Domain 6 security and compliance This domain confirms that you can secure identities, data, and networks at scale and prove it with evidence. Security topics frequently overlap with GCP Security Engineer and AI governance elements from AI Practitioner. Manage identity and access at scale You design least privilege access for humans and machines across many accounts. Apply roles, boundaries, and federation patterns

Rotate credentials and enforce strong authentication practices Automate security controls and data protection You implement layered defenses and privacy controls through automation. If your org builds ML services, align controls with practices referenced in the AWS ML Specialty and GCP ML Engineer Pro tracks. Combine network controls, certificates, and encryption for defense in depth

Discover sensitive data and protect it at rest and in transit Monitor and audit security continuously You collect evidence, detect threats, and alert on anomalous behavior. These habits also strengthen success in AWS Security exams. Enable audit trails and configuration recording

Analyze findings and integrate remediation into workflows

[TITLE]Tata Sons' electronics bet crosses $1.3 billion:
[TEXT]
Tata Sons Ltd has ploughed over a billion dollars into its iPhone assembly business since inception, helping it cross watch-and-jewellery brand Titan Ltd in revenue in just four years.

The Tata Group holding company last month invested ₹1,499 crore in Tata Electronics Ltd, its phone assembly and semiconductor venture, bringing its total investment in the business to $1.3 billion. This also makes Tata Electronics the third Tata Sons subsidiary—the others are Air India Ltd and Tata Digital—to receive over $1 billion from its parent in the last four years. Tata Sons' investments in the three businesses now total $11.1 billion, a Mint review of the filings of the three subsidiaries showed.

Tata Sons’ latest annual report said it has invested ₹45,347 crore ($5.1 billion) in Air India, since acquiring the state-owned airline in January 2022. Tata Digital, its e-commerce business comprising BigBasket, Tata 1mg, Croma and Cliq, received nearly $4.7 billion ( ₹42,121 crore) since its inception in March 2019.

New investments in emerging businesses are a key focus for the Tata Group, which channels its investments through the group's holding company.

Tata Sons wants to pursue "manufacturing excellence at scale", chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran wrote to shareholders in the Tata Sons FY25 annual report. Major Tata Sons shareholders include Tata Trusts, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, and various Tata Group companies.

"At Tata Electronics, we are building a vertically integrated ecosystem for technology hardware and semiconductor manufacturing. It is hard, but that is why it matters so deeply to us," Chandrasekaran wrote. “In the capital-intensive world of technology hardware, I am told this is a good start."

Queries emailed to Tata Sons and Tata Electronics went unanswered.

Since beginning in September 2020, Tata Electronics has invested ₹6,961 crore in its iPhone assembly operations. It also spent ₹1,363.52 crore to acquire Wistron Corp’s plant in March last year, and ₹1,650 crore to buy a 60% stake in Pegatron’s India facility. Additionally, ₹50 crore was invested in the semiconductor subsidiary. These amounts total approximately $1.3 billion in investments by Tata Sons in Tata Electronics. The company is India’s single-largest assembler of Apple’s iPhones.

Tata Electronics last year entered chip manufacturing, announcing it will invest over ₹1,18,000 crore ($13 billion) to set up two semiconductor fabrication plants in Gujarat and Assam. The Gujarat plant, at an investment of $11 billion, is in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.

Tata Electronics reported revenue of ₹66,601 crore in FY25, behind Air India, which ended with ₹78,636 crore, and more than twice Tata Digital's ₹32,188 crore, according to Tata Sons’ latest annual report. The electronics business ended with a ₹70 crore loss, much less than the ₹10,859 crore loss from aviation and the ₹4,610 crore loss from e-commerce.

This is no small feat, as Tata Electronics’ ₹66,601 crore revenue surpassed Titan’s ₹60,942 crore, and close to Tata Power Ltd’s ₹66,992 crore. To be sure, Tata Electronics remains a loss-making business, unlike the profitable businesses of Titan and Tata Power. Despite Tata Electronics cutting losses by 92% to ₹69.7 crore ($7.8 million), down from ₹825 crore ($93 million) a year ago, the iPhone assembly margins remain wafer-thin for vendors like Foxconn.

To be sure, production-linked incentives (PLIs) for smartphone assembly expire in March next, and Tata Electronics is yet to spell out its plan to attain profitability. Tata Sons chairman Chandrasekaran also serves on the board of Tata Electronics.

Industry stakeholders, however, are not concerned.

"The smartphone PLI has seen Dixon become a large company in India, while Kaynes and Syrma are now on the path of growth," said Ashok Chandak, president, India Electronics and Semiconductor Association, an industry body. “These success stories have prompted Indian conglomerates to join the field too. Tata has been an early mover, while Larsen & Toubro has set up a dedicated subsidiary for fabless semiconductor engineering. The Murugappa group, too, has ventured into semiconductor testing and assembly—showing the importance of electronics in India's growth over the next decade."

“The primary purpose of the smartphone PLI was to cover for the cost disadvantage that early companies would have had when starting out in India, given that the PLI came when the industry was in its nascent stages. India now has a well-established last-stage assembly ecosystem, and both India and the likes of Apple have gained significantly from it. Now, with component incentives, we're seeing the next tier of value creation that will start to happen, and this will further strengthen the electronics ecosystem," added Ankush Wadhera, managing director and partner, and India leader - semiconductors at Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Tata Electronics employed 65,647 people. This exceeds the 31,749 in aviation and the 39,088 in Tata Digital.

India produced ₹11.3 trillion ($127 billion) worth of electronics goods in FY25, a 19% rise from ₹9.5 trillion ($107 billion) produced in FY24, making the electronics industry one of the fastest-growing sectors, finance ministry data shiwed. Mobile phone exports accounted for

[TITLE]Can California’s capital city become a world-class semiconductor hub?:
[TEXT]

There are around 9,000 political lobbyists in Sacramento, the capital of the fourth-largest economy in the world – but look beyond the backroom deal-making of California’s Capitol building and you’ll find a city in pursuit of reinvention.

Sacramento is ready to shed its reputation as a “government town,” as Barry Broome, CEO of the Greater Sacramento Economic Council (GSEC), refers to it, and become a central part of the US’ semiconductor industry.

Ten years ago, when Broome moved to Sacramento, it was a very different place. The city was recovering from the Great Recession. It had a population of less than half a million people, and had been experiencing a high rate of disconnected youth. Ten years later, the population has grown by over 10%, partly fuelled by priced-out San Francisco tech workers looking for a more family friendly environment. Downtown Sacramento is only a 90-minute drive from the Bay Area.

Now, GSEC says the greater Sacramento region is the fastest-growing semiconductor market in the state. According to Newmark and Brookings, Sacramento has 26-times more concentrated semiconductor growth capital than the US average. There are both domestic and international players such as Solidigm, Intel, Samsung, Kioxia and others to thank for this, as well as efforts from local leaders to foster a business environment with clear goals. The council highlights that nine of the world’s largest semiconductor firms have a presence in the region.

The biggest foreign investment in Greater Sacramento is Bosch’s. In 2023, the German multinational purchased a $1.5bn (€1.3bn) fabrication facility, or ‘fab’, in Roseville from TSI Semiconductors, representing the biggest semiconductor investment in California in three decades. The investment was supported by $575m in CHIPS Act funding (a mix between direct funding and loans), which officials assured has not been affected by uncertainty surrounding the policy. Once the plant is up and running, it is set to permanently employ 700 workers and is projected to make up 40% of domestic silicon carbon chip production capacity.

Intel as a tech industry anchor

In the late 1990s, Broome says the city began to decline following the Base Realignment and Closure process, a government effort to close military installations following the end of the Cold War. In Sacramento, the closure of two major Air Force bases, McClellan and Mather, led to major job losses. The McClellan facility, for one, employed 13,500 people at one point.

[TITLE]Underwater cables are a vital piece of the AI buildout and internet — investment is booming:
[TEXT]
Over 95% of international data and voice call traffic travels through nearly a million miles of underwater communication cables. These cables carry government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming around the world. The first commercial telecommunication subsea cable was used for telegraphs and was laid across the English Channel between Dover, England and Calais, France in 1850. The technology then evolved to coaxial cables that carried telephone conversations, and most recently, fiber optics that ferry data and the internet as we know it. "

[TITLE]EchoStar crafting a game plan for the billions it has generated in spectrum sales:
[TEXT]
EchoStar Corp. announced Thursday that it has created a new division called EchoStar Capital to invest the $45 billion the company has generated from the sale of its wireless spectrum.

EchoStar founder and chairman Charlie Ergen will take over as president and CEO of EchoStar Corp., putting him in charge of the operations of the pay television and wireless business units. Former EchoStar CEO Hamid Akhavan will head up the new investment arm.

“This is an opportune moment in time for our business to go on the offense as we build upon our 45-year institutional heritage and forge a new path forward for creating and developing opportunities in our strategic expertise domains that will provide attractive value creation for EchoStar and its shareholders,” Akhavan said in a news release.

The third quarter was a huge one in terms of redefining the company and its future. AT&T agreed to pay $22.65 billion in cash and SpaceX agreed to pay $19 billion for wireless spectrum that the Douglas County company had acquired over the years.

EchoStar had intended to deploy the spectrum to build out its Boost Mobile wireless network and private 5G networks for commercial customers. But the company wasn’t moving fast enough for the Federal Communications Commission, which had put pressure on it to use its spectrum or sell it. EchoStar agreed to sell the bulk of its spectrum and to rely on AT&T’s network to carry most of its wireless traffic going forward.

Although the choicest slices of spectrum have been claimed, the company announced on Thursday that it had reached an agreement to sell additional AWS-3 wireless spectrum to SpaceX for $2.6 billion worth of its shares.

A portion of the spectrum sale proceeds will go to pay down debt, but increasingly it is looking like the company will invest most of it to create future earnings for shareholders, who have seen a more than doubling in the company’s share price this year. EchoStar is one of the top-performing stocks this year, not including AI-related companies.

EchoStar reported $38.2 billion in liabilities at the end of the third quarter, down from $40.7 billion at the end of last year. Analysts said the company is now in a “net cash” position, meaning it has more cash and other liquid assets than it has debt.

That said, the company continues to struggle with declining subscriptions in DISH TV, its core satellite television business, which has lost 12.2% of its customer base over the past year. Sling TV, the over-the-internet alternative, fared better, gaining 159,900 subscribers, bringing the total number of pay television subscribers to 7.17 million.

The wireless side, consisting mostly of Boost Mobile, continued to grow, adding 223,000 new customers in the third quarter and generating $939 million in revenues. Boost Mobile is now larger than the pay-TV side with 7.52 million subscribers, although the monthly bill each subscriber is paying is smaller.

EchoStar took a $16.5 billion one-time charge to account for the impaired value on the portions of its 5G network that it won’t be using as a result of the agreement reached with AT&T. That noncash write-off contributed to a $12.8 billion loss in the third quarter, which compares to a $141.8 million loss in the third quarter of 2024.

[TITLE]What’s up with… SpaceX, BT, Canada:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: SpaceX has splashed $2.6bn on yet more spectrum from Echostar; BT’s sales are slipping slightly and its earnings flatlining as it faces ongoing fierce competition; the Canadian government is planning a telco sector shakeup that could lead to lower prices and greater competition; and much more!

EchoStar has entered into an amended definitive agreement with SpaceX, the parent of low-earth orbit satellite operator Starlink, to sell the company’s unpaired AWS-3 licences for approximately $2.6bn in SpaceX stock, adding to the previous $17bn agreement to sell 50 MHz of S-band spectrum in the US as well as global mobile satellite service (MSS) spectrum licences to SpaceX. EchoStar says the unpaired AWS-3 licences are nationwide and are part of 3GPP Band 70n (1695-1710 MHz uplink). “This transaction with SpaceX, in addition to our previously announced spectrum transactions and commercial agreements, will strengthen EchoStar’s ability to develop new business opportunities and growth in value for our shareholders,” stated EchoStar Capital CEO Hamid Akhavan. “The combination of AWS-3 uplink, AWS-4 and H-block spectrum from EchoStar with the rocket launch and satellite manufacturing capabilities from SpaceX accelerates the realisation of powerful and economical direct-to-cell service offerings for consumers and enterprises worldwide, including our Boost Mobile customers,” he added.

BT Group has reported a year-on-year decline in revenues and flat earnings for its fiscal second quarter that ended on 30 September. Total revenues shrank by 3% to £4.93bn, while UK service revenues dipped by 1% to £3.86bn. BT is reporting UK service revenues to show the performance of the domestic operation, on which it is focused and plans to further develop: The UK telco is, in one way or another, offloading its international operations, which continues to be the worst performing part of its overall business (with sales down 6% year on year to £568m). Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was flat at £2.07bn. BT ended September with a fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) network that reached 20.3 million premises (including 5.5 million in rural areas, which is where the operator ultimately plans to expand its reach through the newly announced partnership with satellite broadband specialist Starlink). BT ended September with 3.7 million consumer and 300,000 enterprise fibre broadband customers, while its 5G mobile customer base grew by 11% to 13.9 million. CEO Allison Kirkby noted: “BT is delivering on its strategy in competitive markets. We’re building the UK’s digital backbone, connecting the country like no one else and accelerating our transformation. Openreach full fibre broadband now reaches more than 20 million homes and businesses and our award-winning EE network is live with 5G+ coverage for 66% of the population. Since the start of the year, we’ve driven customer growth across Consumer broadband, mobile and TV and we’re stabilising our UK-focused Business division. Outside the UK, we’ve completed strategic exits and we’re reshaping our International unit. BT’s transformation is delivering ahead of plan, as our UK focus and radical simplification and modernisation are helping to offset declines from our International and legacy businesses and higher labour-related costs since the start of this tax year. We remain on track to deliver our financial outlook for this year, our cash flow inflection to circa £2bn in FY27 and circa £3bn by the end of the decade, and we’re announcing an increased interim dividend to 2.45 pence per share.”

Still with BT… Clive Selley, CEO at the UK telco’s quasi-autonomous wholesale fixed access division Openreach, is pre-empting some argy-bargy with UK regulator Ofcom. The Financial Times reports that Selley is suggesting he might abandon the extant plan to get approval for the last phase of Openreach’s fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) rollout unless the current regulatory environment is relaxed under the terms of Ofcom’s next Telecoms Access Review (TAR), due next year. That final phase would be to expand the FTTP coverage from 25 million premises at the end of 2026 to 30 million premises by 2030. Selley has given notice to both Ofcom and the UK government that he will postpone the plan unless, and until, the powers that be cut some slack for Openreach where taxation is concerned.

[TITLE]Amazon workers with disabilities file suit against tech giant, alleging systematic discrimination:
[TEXT]
A group of Amazon (AMZN) employees has filed a lawsuit against the tech giant, claiming the company systematically discriminated against disabled workers in part due to its alleged use of artificial intelligence.

Nine Amazon employees across multiple divisions and states filed a complaint proposing a class action in a federal district court in Seattle on Oct. 20. Their suit claims Amazon unlawfully denies nearly all medical requests to work remotely as the tech giant pursues its controversial return to office policy — and allegedly uses AI to handle accommodations requests. The suit said the company terminates employees or forces them to take unpaid leave rather than granting their requests for medical accommodations.

A judge must certify the lawsuit as a class action for it to move forward.

The company filed a response opposing the complaint this past Tuesday, arguing the employees’ case is "fundamentally flawed."

Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser told Yahoo Finance in an email: "Most of the allegations in this case are simply untrue and intentionally misleading, and we plan to demonstrate that through the legal process."

The plaintiffs are represented by New York-based law firm Harman Green PC, which represents about two dozen disabled Amazon employees overall.

“We feel very confident about our claims,” said attorney Walker Harman Jr.

The legal action is one of the latest in a series of employee discrimination lawsuits against Amazon. In late October, New Jersey’s attorney general filed a complaint accusing the company of discriminating against disabled and pregnant warehouse workers. In 2022, the New York State Division of Human Rights filed a similar lawsuit, alleging that Amazon’s policies force disabled and pregnant warehouse workers to take unpaid leave rather than accommodate them.

Many other cases have been filed by workers against the tech giant in the last decade, alleging disability, race, and gender discrimination. Such cases have yielded mixed outcomes — some resulting in wins by workers and settlements, others in victories for Amazon.

Amazon is one of the largest US employers, with more than 1.5 million employees. Last week it announced thousands of layoffs as it aggressively invests in AI.

The employees participating in the latest suit — which would be ruled on as a class action by Judge John Chun in the Western District of Washington, should it go forward — range from warehouse workers to software engineers.

Nearly all of the workers allege Amazon failed to grant medical accommodations necessary to their health and safety. The complaint said that Amazon’s requirement that employees use its “A to Z” app when requesting accommodations created technical issues and resulted in significant delays.

[TITLE]Study identifies weaknesses in how AI systems are evaluated:
[TEXT]
A new study led by the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) at the University of Oxford and involving a team of 42 researchers from leading global institutions including EPFL, Stanford University, the Technical University of Munich, UC Berkeley, the UK AI Security Institute, the Weizenbaum Institute, and Yale University, has found that many of the tests used to measure the capabilities and safety of large language models (LLMs) lack scientific rigour.

In Measuring What Matters: Construct Validity in Large Language Model Benchmarks, accepted for publication in the upcoming NeurIPS conference proceedings, researchers review 445 AI benchmarks – the standardised evaluations used to compare and rank AI systems.

The researchers found that many of these benchmarks are built on unclear definitions or weak analytical methods, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions

Combined with its secure architecture and high-speed execution, this integration of AI algorithms, automation, and real-time analytics positions the platform as a cutting-edge solution for modern trading environments.

How Balvionex Uses Algorithmic Intelligence to Execute Profitable Trades

At the core of the Balvionex is its algorithmic intelligence engine, which merges multiple AI methodologies to analyze and respond to market conditions in real time. Unlike conventional systems that follow pre-programmed strategies, Balvionex utilizes dynamic algorithms capable of learning from historical trends, live market data, and stochastic variables to identify profitable trading opportunities.

The AI engine operates by continuously scanning multiple markets, tracking indicators such as price volatility, liquidity changes, market depth, and trading volume. By cross-referencing these inputs against predictive models, the system generates trade recommendations or automated executions that align with both short-term and long-term strategies. The algorithms employ a multi-layered approach: initial pattern recognition, risk assessment, and predictive forecasting converge to optimize trade timing and allocation.

Additionally, the platform’s autonomous decision-making allows it to adjust strategies on the fly. For example, if market conditions shift rapidly, the AI recalibrates stop-loss thresholds, position sizes, and asset allocations to mitigate risk while capitalizing on emerging opportunities. The system also factors in cross-asset correlations, ensuring that exposure is optimized across diverse instruments to maintain balanced risk-reward profiles.

Transparency is integrated into this process. Every algorithmic decision is logged and traceable, providing a clear audit trail for compliance purposes. Users can review AI-driven trade rationales, including the signals and data points that informed each execution.

[TITLE]Underwater cables are a vital piece of the AI buildout and internet — investment is booming:
[TEXT]
Over 95% of international data and voice call traffic travels through nearly a million miles of underwater communication cables. These cables carry government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming around the world. The first commercial telecommunication subsea cable was used for telegraphs and was laid across the English Channel between Dover, England and Calais, France in 1850. The technology then evolved to coaxial cables that carried telephone conversations, and most recently, fiber optics that ferry data and the internet as we know it. "
