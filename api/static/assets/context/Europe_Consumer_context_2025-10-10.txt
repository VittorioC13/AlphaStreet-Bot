[TITLE]Tsiodras: Discussion on consumer protection from unfair practices:
[TEXT]
Newsroom October 7 01:59

A debate on the ways to protect Greek and European consumers from unfair commercial practices on the shelf and on the internet will be organised on Friday (10/10), at 10 am, at the Plaza Hotel in Syntagma Square, by the New Democracy MEP, Dimitris Tsiodras, member of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee of the European Parliament.

In today’s fast-changing market, consumers are looking for affordable prices, quality products, and safe transactions. Yet every day, they face inflated prices, unclear product labels, and unfair commercial practices.

Both Greece and the European Union are trying to meet these new challenges by introducing tougher safety standards, imposing penalties on violators, and creating easier ways for citizens to file complaints or resolve disputes out of court.

Still, key questions remain: Are these measures actually being enforced? Do citizens know their rights? Are the protection mechanisms truly effective? Because the market can only serve the public interest when the rules are not just written—but applied.

These issues will be at the center of discussion during the upcoming Round Table, which will feature:

Minister of Development Takis Theodorikakos, Secretary General of Commerce Sotiris Anagnostopoulos, Secretary General of Industry Eleftherios Kritikos, Director of DIMEA Spyridon Peristeri, Consumer Advocate Anna Stratinaki, EETT President Konstantinos Masselos, NCRTV legal expert Persa Lampropoulou, Vice President of the Competition Commission Hara Nikolopoulou, President of the National Accreditation System Tasos Thomaidis, Athens Trade Association President Thanos Tsangaris, Greek representative and board member of Ecommerce Europe Makis Savvidis, President of the Hellenic E-Commerce Association Katerina Fraidaki, EKPIZO President Panagiota Kalapotharakou, Hellenic Retail Association President Konstantinos Gerardos, and the Director General of the Institute of Consumer Goods Retail Research (IELKA).

[TITLE]Finnish Customs wants to turn back the tide on Temu:
[TEXT]
This year, more than 50 million parcels are expected to arrive in Finland from outside the EU.

Finnish Customs is struggling to deal with the flood of low-value products arriving via the Chinese shopping app Temu.

Some 28.2 million parcels arrived in Finland from outside the EU in 2024. Just a couple of years earlier, in 2022, the figure was 850,000. This year, more than 50 million parcels are expected to arrive in Finland, a staggering sixtyfold increase from earlier this decade, according to Finnish Customs.

The situation is even more dramatic on a European scale. Last year, 4.6 billion parcels entered the bloc, with 1.1 billion of those destined for the Netherlands alone. The flow shows no signs of slowing down.

For Customs officials, the workload is enormous, as every single e-commerce parcel must be processed individually.

Sami Rakshit, who heads Finnish Customs, told Yle he wants to see the system take a few steps back toward more traditional import practices, as officials are not able to monitor all incoming shipments.

In some cases, the EU is being shortchanged, as a number of Chinese e-commerce platforms are failing to properly remit value-added tax to the EU. While consumers are charged the full tax at purchase, customs inspections have found that the collected VAT is not always passed on to European authorities. Currently, tax compliance largely relies on the goodwill or law-abidingness of the retailer.

"We've noticed that it may not be the case across all platforms. Consumers are charged the full VAT, but it isn't always fully passed on to the EU,” Rakshit explained.

To rein in the online shopping 'tsunami', as Rakshit called it, he would like to see an end to individual packages getting shipped around the world like this.

According to him, only large shipments imported directly into Customs warehouses can be properly processed for safety and taxes.

"We should try to avoid sending individual parcels directly to consumers around the world, because controlling them is practically impossible,” he explained.

'Anti-junk' initiative heads to Parliament

Reacting to Rakshit's comments on Monday, Green MP Tiina Elo told Finnish news agency STT that the current volumes of products shipped by Temu are unsustainable. While restricting this may seem radical, Elo argued that it's the only way forward.

"Chinese shopping platforms fuel a culture of disposable consumption and pose a serious threat to the future of responsibly operating businesses," Elo said in a statement. "It's completely unsustainable — not only for the environment and the climate, but also for workers' rights and consumer safety."

This week will see the legislature receive a citizens’ initiative on cracking down on the throwaway economy, after being backed by more than 50,000 Finns who signed the proposal.

The initiative calls for a ban on the marketing and advertising of ultra-fast fashion and low-quality goods, as well as measures, including tax policy, to curb the growth of the trade.

[TITLE]What’s Propelling and Stalling the Industry’s Traceability Preparedness:
[TEXT]
When it comes to traceability, there is a gap between the industry’s intentions and their actions.

According to a survey conducted by Sourcing Journal in partnership with Oritain, 63 percent of industry executives indicate traceability is a strategic advantage, yet just 44 percent are actively tracing goods. The remaining 56 percent either have a plan in place but are not actively tracing goods yet or they have no plan in place. During a panel at Sourcing Journal’s Fall Summit, moderated by SJ and Fairchild Studio director Lauren Parker, speakers dove into the motivations behind traceability investments and what is still holding companies’ efforts back.

Looking at the key drivers shaping traceability, protecting brand reputation came out on top with 40 percent of respondents. This was followed by consumer demand for transparency and expected regulatory pressures, reflecting the growing need for compliance preparedness.

“The cost of trading non-compliant or unethical goods significantly outweighs the cost of investing in a pretty robust due diligence program,” said Ben Tomkins, regional vice president, Americas at Oritain, which uses forensic science to verify raw material origins. “The longer the businesses take to implement a degree of traceability, the more acute their risk becomes as well.”

One piece of legislation spurring the industry to action on traceability is the United States’ Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which bars imports tied to China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Between 2023 and 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s shipment detentions rose 25 percent, and the detention increase was sharper in apparel, footwear and textiles, rising 33.4 percent the same year. “UFLPA was a huge catalyst for sort of moving the need of traceability from a nice to have to sort of a business necessity,” said Tomkins.

This crackdown on slavery and forced labor extends beyond the U.S. with the United Kingdom’s Transparency in Supply Chain Act and the European Union’s Forced Labour Regulation. Companies are also facing escalating due diligence requirements from regulations like the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

Further, EU legislation will soon mandate digital product passports. To create DPPs, companies must have knowledge

[TITLE]One Month After Its $2.4B Acquisition of Foot Locker, Here Are 3 Burning Questions Dick’s Should Answer:
[TEXT]
Questions still remain one month after Dick’s Sporting Goods completed its $2.4 billion acquisition of .

And market watchers will have to wait a little bit longer to get some answers.

As Dick’s executive chairman Ed Stack said during the company’s second quarter earnings call in August, a full picture of its plans for will not be disclosed until its third quarter earnings call next month. Stack added at a recent conference that Wall Street should expect details on the expectations for Foot Locker on the company’s fourth quarter earnings call in March 2026.

As for what we do know, the company said in September that it will now operate more than 3,200 stores plus e-commerce and digital businesses across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, plus a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

Dick’s also noted that it will continue to operate Foot Locker’s portfolio of brands, including Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS, and Atmos, under a new leadership team.

Stack will lead the global Foot Locker businesses, in partnership with two new presidents, one for North America and one for international. For North America, Dick’s has named the controversial former Nike executive Ann Freeman as president of the North America. As for its international business, Dick’s said it has yet to officially name a president for the division.

By banner, Tony Aversa will serve as senior vice president and general manager of Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker North America, while Denise Karkos will serve as senior vice president and general manager of Champs Sports. No leadership changes were noted at WSS and Atmos at the time.

These executive changes also meant that Mary Dillon, chief executive officer of Foot Locker, and Franklin Bracken, who was just promoted to president of Foot Locker in March, have exited the company.

Looking ahead to November’s Q3 earnings report, here are the top three remaining questions Dick’s should address on the future of Foot Locker and the integration of the two massive sports retailers.

Will Foot Locker still move its headquarters to Florida?

In August 2024, Foot Locker announced its intention to make the move its global headquarters to St. Petersburg, Fla. in 2025 while maintaining a smaller presence in its current New York City office. At the time, Foot Locker said the move would help to cut costs and drive collaboration among teams in a location where many employees are already based. (Champs is already headquartered in St. Pete.)

In March, it looked like the move was one step closer to happening when national real estate investment firm The Feil Organization disclosed that the sneaker retailer had signed a long-term office lease for a 110,998-square-foot space in St. Pete.

But since Dick’s Sporting Goods is based in Pittsburgh, some think the move to Florida does not seem likely. According to Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser, his checks indicate that Foot Locker’s merchant team will remain in NYC and not move to St. Petersburg. “Dick’s has not confirmed our check,” Poser wrote in a note last month. “Keeping the Foot Locker team in NYC is best, in our view, for talent acquisition, and having close contact with core streetwear and fashion sneaker consumers.”

Will Dick’s continue to operate Foot Locker’s full portfolio of store banners?

While Dick’s confirmed that it will operate Foot Locker’s portfolio of store brands, some analysts are skeptical that it will remain that way for long. In an Aug. 27 note, Poser wrote that Williams Trading “would not be surprised” if Dick’s chooses to sell WSS, and shutdown Champs.

In a later note last month, the analyst noted that Champs “may not be long as a going concern under Dick’s ownership. Poser cited the appointment of Karkos as SVP and GM of Champs Sports as to why Champs may not be a focus for the company. “Karkos’ lack of footwear, apparel, and store experience lead us to believe that she is leading Champs, which has been a distraction to Foot Locker (in our view), until it is no longer a distraction,” Poser wrote.

With the integration of the businesses, when will layoffs be revealed?

During the acquisition process, Dick’s touted that the combined companies would generate approximately $100 million to $125 million of cost synergies once the deal is closed, which will be realized in the medium term. Some of the savings are bound to come from duplicate costs like technology and human resources, distribution center efficiencies and better terms from vendors. This leads to the question, “Will there be layoffs?”

TD Cowen’s John Kernan placed a “Hold” on shares of Dick’s last month, citing uncertainty on Foot Locker’s turnaround. With cost and procurement synergies in the works, he expects that headcount reductions and store rationalization are a possibility.

But while layoffs remain to be seen, there will inevitably be a “simplification” of staffing and organizational structure, similar to the recent moves done by Adidas, Nike and Puma this year.

[TITLE]Authentic Brands, Real Growth: Proof That Localization Pays Off Graphic Design Junction:
[TEXT]
Written by Muhammad Faisal• 4:28 pm• Articles

Pin Share 0 Shares

Numbers don’t lie, and the statistics on localization services and business growth speak for themselves. The multilingual economy is more connected than ever, and speaking your customer’s language is no longer a matter of politeness but one of profitability. The proof is in the pudding, and the data confirms that localization services generate quantifiable returns far beyond basic translation.

Studies reveal a compelling narrative. Brands that embrace localization are 1.5 times more likely to grow their revenues than those that don’t. This is not a marginal gain; rather, it is a result of significant business transformation enabled by cultural adaptation.

Consumer behavior illustrates the point. A whopping 76% of global online shoppers prefer to purchase products with information in their native language. Even more revealing, 40% of online buyers will not buy in another language, even if they are proficient, and instead head to competitors who have invested time and resources in localization.

The results are evident across the board. Businesses that leverage localization services experience:

5x to 2x higher conversion rates in localized campaigns.

30%+ improvement in customer engagement on multilingual websites.

Up to 400% higher ROI on localized marketing campaigns compared to non-localized ones.

The evidence piles up. The most extensive longitudinal study to date showed that 87% of global business leaders agree that investments in translation and localization have played a direct role in successful business expansion. In addition, 84% of brands reported increased revenues after localization of their content.

Successful localization services enable market breakthroughs that were previously limiting business potential. Companies pave the way to purchase by localizing their products, marketing collateral, and user experiences to meet cultural expectations and language nuances.

The data shows up in top-line performance indicators as well. Mobile apps localized to specific markets increase downloads by 128% and in-app purchases revenue by 26%. E-commerce sites that invest in localization see a 70% average increase in both traffic and conversion rates.

Customer loyalty and relationships add further weight to the business case. Localization reduces churn rates and forges deeper customer relationships through relevant and familiar experiences. The trust created over time is the bedrock for long-term growth.

Product managers seeking differentiators should view professional localization services as more than an operational decision, but rather as a strategic investment that will yield dividends in each new market. The numbers are indisputable: localization works.

Case Studies That Show the ROI of Speaking Customers’ Language

Localization ROI: Real case studies from the market illustrate that there are significant benefits. Here are some examples that show how well this investment pays off in practice. Companies of all sizes are proving the business value of speaking the language of their customers:

Airbnb is a great case study in the power of localization. After the platform applied end-to-end localization in 62 languages in “cold” markets, it reported a 2.4x increase in bookings. Airbnb’s cost per acquisition was reduced by 0.25x while its customer lifetime value increased 1.62x.

Retail giant ASOS recently reported that it increased its conversion rate by 13% and grew sales in the Russian market by 70% in six months. The business adjusted the e-commerce user experience for Russia by localizing payment methods, size charts, and marketing materials to make them more culturally relevant and appealing to Russian users.

Slack, a SaaS provider for business teams, reported similar results to ASOS after expanding into Japan with the help of professional localization services. The company experienced a 249% growth in Japanese users over a 12-month period and a 63% increase in paid product conversions after localizing its software, marketing content, and support documentation.

Netflix reported 13.6 million new subscribers in its international markets in one quarter after investing in localization. By subtitling and dubbing the content catalog in regional languages and tailoring marketing to resonate culturally, they reported year-over-year international revenue growth of 85%, outperforming domestic markets.

In B2B and smaller businesses, localization investments also yield positive results. One mid-market SaaS company offering project management software partnered with a localization company and achieved a 37% increase in trial signups and a 29% increase in free-to-paid conversions in five European languages and markets.

Across different industries and business sizes, success with localization has one common denominator: investing in quality localization services produces measurable return on investment. In fact, one survey of 275 medium-sized enterprises found that 94% achieved a positive ROI from localization within a year.

These are just some examples of the real business value that localization services offer to product managers who invest in them. The data shows that when you speak to your customers in their language and in a culturally resonant way, your bottom line will thank you.

From Awareness to Advocacy: How Localized Marketing Converts

Localized marketing delivers superior outcomes compared to generic approaches at every stage in the path to purchase. The conversion rates across all the touchpoints demonstrate how prospects move from the first point of contact to advocates for the brand.

Professional localization shifts the traditional marketing funnel into a high-converting sales machine. Studies have shown that localized landing pages result in a 2.5x improvement in conversion rate and a 43.2% reduction in cost-per-lead. The significant impact is because people relate more to information that’s directed to them.

Audiences who speak a language other than English become much more reachable at the awareness stage when brands use localized information. It’s important to note that a mere 25.9% of all online interactions take place in the English language. This clearly shows that localization services enable brands to expand their reach to the remaining 74.1% of the target audience who prefer languages other than English.

The level of trust naturally starts increasing in the minds of prospects when they come across messages at the consideration phase that are in their local language. Amazingly, 72.4% of buyers have expressed a preference for purchasing products in their native language. Localized marketing emails also perform 9.4% better in terms of open rate and 10% better in terms of click-through rate. The above metrics clearly indicate that prospects remain highly engaged at all touchpoints throughout the decision-making process.

Prospects no longer find language barriers at the conversion stage, as they are now made easier to purchase. According to research, 60% of online shoppers rarely or never buy from websites that offer only English. This makes localization a requirement for conversion.

The value of localized engagement remains much higher than the initial sale. Brands are able to create a far stronger emotional connection that turns their customers into brand evangelists when they serve customers at every touchpoint in the native language. The results achieved by IMVU clearly illustrate this point. In just two months, their commitment to deep-level localization resulted in a 43% and 45% increase in registration on Android and iOS platforms, respectively.

The above linear path from awareness all the way to advocacy is the key steps:

Awareness: Localization helps in expanding the brand reach to non-English speaking audiences. Interest: Content in the native language results in high engagement metrics. Consideration: Messaging that is culturally adapted helps in building trust. Conversion: Localized checkout process enables reducing the friction. Loyalty: Serving localized information at all touchpoints helps in creating advocates.

Product managers focused on growing their customer base should consider reaching out to professional localization service providers. The results are clearly seen in the form of measurable improvements at every step in the customer buying cycle. Brands that focus on building this strong, localized connection don’t just acquire new customers. Still, they are able to create a loyal following that becomes their brand advocates, promoting the products and services to friends and family members worldwide.

Global Brands Winning Big with a Local-First Mindset

“Whether through language, SEO, or social engagement, businesses that localize effectively build stronger connections.” – The Zoe Team (editorial statement), Marketing strategy consultancy

The localization process has evolved significantly from the straightforward translation practices of the past. For truly global brands, a local-first mindset changes the way they do business entirely. This means deep dives into foreign cultures, but as these examples show, it’s worth it.

Starbucks learned how to walk the walk (and read the tea leaves) in Japan. The coffee giant hired local designers who incorporated Japanese architectural elements, such as Shinto-style low-slung roofs, water features, and stone sculptures. Starbucks’ growth in the global market is a direct result of this localization success. The company now has more stores outside the US than in its home market.

McDonald’s regional menus provide another example of taking a “local-first” strategy to heart. Their McAloo Tikki burgers in India utilize spiced potato patties to accommodate religious dietary concerns. Japanese consumers can choose Teriyaki and Shrimp Filet-O burgers as cultural centerpieces. IKEA’s localization process offers an even more comprehensive approach. The company installed separate shopping aisles for men and women in Saudi Arabia to accommodate local cultural preferences.

Netflix’s internationalization strategy is more than just subtitling, dubbing, and translation. The streaming service’s regional recommendations, and even page elements like thumbnails and menu design, are all carefully localized. Their investments in dubbing and subtitling, now available in 33 and 36 languages respectively, have been well worth it. International titles now account for nearly half of the Netflix library.

Product managers hoping to localize their global brand can take note of these top examples. Some key learnings and localization tips include:

Set global standards but also allow for local team autonomy.

Use cultural insiders with an understanding of nuance, not just translators.

Test campaigns in small local markets before full rollouts.

Localize visuals, design, and functionality, not just the text.

Translation is no longer enough to localize a product. IKEA’s entrance into the Indian market is a prime example of this localization evolution. The furniture giant localized their entire marketing approach and product offering to match Indian multigenerational family living situations.

Spotify also recognized that localization needs to account for visual and cultural nuances, too. Their localized playlists now feature localized thumbnails with local landmarks and models. These visual elements help to represent the culture and create meaningful connections in the process. Statistics, such as 76% of online shoppers preferring to buy products marketed in their own language, make this type of localization an easy sell.

Conclusion: The Evidence Is Clear, Localization Isn’t Optional, It’s Essential

Numbers speak for themselves – companies with localization services have higher performance across all KPIs. Analytics data proves that companies using localization outperform competitors that don’t localize to address local markets. Intelligent product managers understand that this is not just an operational decision but a strategic advantage with tangible financial returns.

Localization is more than just translation, as it impacts every stage of the customer journey. Collaborating with professional localization services empowers companies to unlock higher conversion rates. They experience deeper customer engagement and significant revenue growth across global markets. This success is no surprise, given that people prefer to be communicated with in their native language and cultural context.

Case studies of “Airbnb”, “Netflix”, and “Slack” undoubtedly illustrate the significant ROI delivered by localization. Product managers with a local-first mindset are the ones who drive their organizations towards sustainable international growth, not restricted to English-speaking countries only.

Professional localization services are an excellent investment that reaps extraordinary ROIs. Market data validates what visionary product leaders already know: Communicating with customers in their language and cultural context leads to improved market performance and robust financial outcomes. Product managers who aspire to build businesses with a global reach consider localization as a table stake, no longer an afterthought.

[TITLE]Top Luxury Beauty Deals to Shop on Amazon After Prime Day:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

Word to the wise? Now is the best chance to stock your makeup bag with the beauty goodies you’ve used to the last drop and can’t function without — as well as hot-right-now sunscreens, serums, hair care, face oils, and styling tools that have long resided in your bookmarks tab, waiting for a good enough deal to hit so as to finally make them investment-worthy. Amazon’s fall Prime Day came and went, but many of the best beauty discounts are somehow still live on the mega retailer’s site (and because we don’t gatekeep around here, we wanted you to hear this from us first).

Need to level up your hair game for the fall season with a styling system that curls, smooths, dries, and volumizes? Look no further than the Shark FlexStyle, which our editors said was “in a league of its own” — selling for 30 percent off its original price. If it’s celebrity-backed makeup wipes you’re after, seriously consider grabbing the Neutrogena Night Calming Makeup Remover Face Wipes that Kim Kardashian once raved about. Replacing your dried-out tube of drugstore mascara? Treat yourself to something fancier (yet still under $15), courtesy of the Lancôme Lash Idôle Lash-Lifting & Volumizing Mascara.

Since these deals aren’t part of Amazon’s official Prime Big Deal Days happening anymore, you don’t have to be a Prime member to take advantage of them. That being said, there are lots of benefits to scoring a 30-day Amazon Prime free trial (not least of which is fast and free delivery, for unboxing and enjoying your purchases faster).

We know you’re patiently waiting to get to the good stuff after reading all this, so here are the best post-Prime Day beauty deals our editors have cleared space for on our bathroom counters. Drop everything and shop now, before the dreamy discounts are sunsetted until 2026.
