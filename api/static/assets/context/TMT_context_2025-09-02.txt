The gaps in India’s developing semiconductor ecosystem are drawing the attention of global players from allied sectors, who see it as a strategic opportunity to contribute to the country’s ambition of becoming a preferred hub for chip manufacturing.Many companies are increasing their operations in India and focusing on localising equipment manufacturing, bridging gaps through R&D, skilled workforce training, and infrastructure development -- as semiconductor firms increasingly seek partners with deep expertise and a strong local footprint in the Indian ecosystem, reporting ANI quoting industry executives.India’s flagship semiconductor showcase, Semicon India 2025 , is set to highlight the country’s growing role in the global chip ecosystem. Scheduled for September 2-4 in New Delhi, the event will see participation from over 30 countries this year.The summit aims to foster global collaboration, boost domestic innovation, and position India as a reliable, scalable, and competitive hub for electronics manufacturing.Global majors such as Applied Materials, IBM, Infineon, LAM Research, Merck, Siemens , TSMC, and Tata Electronics, along with several others, will take part in the upcoming edition.Speaking to ANI, Anil Chaudhry- Head, Robotics & Solutions at Indian arm of Taiwan-based Delta Electronics (India) said that the Delta sees India as a promising market, not only because of the increasing investments and government initiatives like the announcement of 10 semiconductor fabs but also due to the current technological gap that exists in high-speed precision machinery, which remains largely dependent on imports."So, the technological gap in terms of high-speed precision we can place. It is 100 per cent dependent on the machine, which is made outside India. And then what is basically we have taken the initial steps to start doing a level of localisation and then we see in the future we will be more focusing on the make in India equipment which fits not only to the semiconductor market, but also to the electronics market," Chaudhry said.He said, leveraging Delta's strong foundation in Taiwan, the company is working toward localising equipment manufacturing and bridging that gap through R&D, skilled workforce training, and infrastructure development.The company has invested $500 million in its operations, with a significant portion allocated to infrastructure, including land, test equipment, and factory expansion.Taiwan's Delta Technologies specialises in offering end-to-end solutions in both the semiconductor fabrication (fab) and assembly-testing (T-set) segments.

[TITLE]Tech gaps in Indias semiconductor sector draw global players eyeing big opportunity:
[TEXT]
New Delhi [India], August 31 (ANI): The technological gaps in India's emerging semiconductor ecosystem are capturing the interest of global players from allied sectors, who view this as a strategic opportunity to support the country's goal of becoming a preferred destination for chip manufacturing.

Many companies are ramping up their operations in India and focusing on localising equipment manufacturing, bridging gaps through R&D, skilled workforce training, and infrastructure development -- as semiconductor firms increasingly seek partners with deep expertise and a strong local footprint in the Indian ecosystem, according to industry executives.

The participation of firms in India's flagship semiconductor-focused event, Semicon India 2025, supports the trend.

Scheduled from September 2-4 in the national capital, the event will attract more than 30 countries as participants in this year's edition.

SEMICON India 2025 aims to catalyse global collaboration, support domestic innovation, and strengthen India's role as a trusted, scalable, and competitive electronics manufacturing hub.

International companies, including Applied Materials, IBM, Infineon, LAM Research, Merck, Siemens, TSMC, and Tata Electronics, among others, will participate.

Speaking to ANI, Anil Chaudhry- Head, Robotics & Solutions at Indian arm of Taiwan-based Delta Electronics (India) said that the Delta sees India as a promising market, not only because of the increasing investments and government initiatives like the announcement of 10 semiconductor fabs but also due to the current technological gap that exists in high-speed precision machinery, which remains largely dependent on imports.

"So, the technological gap in terms of high-speed precision we can place. It is 100 per cent dependent on the machine, which is made outside India. And then what is basically we have taken the initial steps to start doing a level of localisation and then we see in the future we will be more focusing on the make in India equipment which fits not only to the semiconductor market, but also to the electronics market," Chaudhry said.

He said, leveraging Delta's strong foundation in Taiwan, the company is working toward localising equipment manufacturing and bridging that gap through R&D, skilled workforce training, and infrastructure development.

The company has invested USD 500 million in its operations, with a significant portion allocated to infrastructure, including land, test equipment, and factory expansion.

Taiwan's Delta Technologies specialises in offering end-to-end solutions in both the semiconductor fabrication (fab) and assembly-testing (T-set) segments. This includes digital twin technologies, factory-level software integration, machine simulation, and facility management systems that enable seamless tool-to-utility connectivity within cleanroom environments.

Chaudhry said that semiconductor companies are looking for companies that have expertise in the allied activities of the core semiconductor manufacturing, which is propelling the players to localise their operations in Indian soil.

Supporting the trend, he noted that Delta is not alone in the Indian market but is facing competition from Japanese, Korean, and Singaporean players.

"They (Semiconductor Cos) are looking for people who are already in India...and they would like to work along with us as much as possible... So we are leveraging that advantage. We have a unique proposition in the Indian market," Chaudhry noted.

"We are creating the right infrastructure in delta India with the experience we have from the international market, like Taiwan and Japan. And in terms of infrastructure, we are creating high-standard labs where we train our foremen and our operators to do the very specific actions required in the semiconductor," he further added, indicating how global companies are strengthening their Indian units to capture the semiconductor opportunity.

"We are adding the R&D people in the organisation who can understand how to generate the semiconductor drawing in terms of piping, in terms of the movement of the tool. We are creating the software team," Chaudhry stated.

Talking about the intent to participate in the Semicon India 2025, Sanjeev Srivastava - Head, Industrial Automation, said, "We have a lot of products and technology that would go along with the semiconductor industry. So that is one of the intents of participating in this event, and also, India is going to be a big hub for semiconductors, and our initial engagement in this industry will be beneficial for both the industry as well as for us."

Discussing the company's localisation efforts, he noted that with fourteen regional offices, four manufacturing facilities (Rudrapur, Gurgaon, and Krishnagiri), and two R&D centres (Gurgaon and Bengaluru), Delta has a strong presence across India, supported by more than 200 channel partners.

As of date, the government has approved 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects with a cumulative investment of more than ₹1.60 lakh crore in 6 states - Gujarat, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh.

[TITLE]Another artificial intelligence deal collapses — as Colorado lawmakers’ budget fixes near finish line:
[TEXT]
Colorado’s first-in-the-nation regulations on artificial intelligence may have to wait longer if the legislature approves a proposal advanced by the state Senate on Monday.

In a dramatic shift from Sunday night, when a deal on revamped regulations appeared within reach, Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez gutted the bill. The measure, proposed during a mostly budget-focused special session, had been aimed at regulating AI and increasing transparency around its use to make decisions affecting Coloradans.

Instead, the bill as amended would simply delay, by several months, the implementation of a law passed 2024 that is supposed to go into effect next February.

Under Rodriguez’s proposal, which still needs to pass the state House, those regulations would take effect at the end of June — giving the tech industry, lawmakers, and public-interest and consumer-protection groups another chance during the next regular session to nail down how to regulate the growing, affluent industry. The regular session convenes in mid-January.

“Overnight, the tech industry decided that they were so unhappy with the compromise that had been achieved by consumer-protection organizations, educators, labor and business that they would rather return to the (existing rules),” said Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat and driving figure on AI regulations in the state.

The legislature met for its latest special session chiefly to address a $783 million budget deficit brought on by tax cuts and spending changes made by the federal government in July. But the AI regulations, which drew the ire of an industry that argues they are unworkable, was also specifically designated for new consideration in Gov. Jared Polis’ recall of the legislature this month.

Most budget-related bills finished

By the end of the fifth day of the session on Monday, the Democratic majority had sent to Polis the bulk of the bills they hoped would bite into the deficit. The single biggest revenue-raising measure, however, still needed at least two more votes.

The bills that have passed the legislature are:

House Bill 1001, which makes permanent a limit on certain business income deductions for people making more than $500,000 per year.

House Bill 1002, which cracks down on the use of foreign tax havens and adds several countries to that label.

House Bill 1003, which ends a tax incentive for insurance companies that keep offices in the state.

House Bill 1005, which ends a state subsidy to businesses for collecting sales taxes.

In total, those measures are expected to raise about $150 million. The fifth measure, House Bill 1004, would allow certain entities to sell tax credits that can be reclaimed at a discount in future tax years. Lawmakers expect that to bring in another $100 million, for a total of just over $250 million.

"Right now, we need to ensure that the families and the small businesses that truly need our help are getting it," said Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Jefferson County Democrat.

The revenue-raisers amount to nearly a third of the total $783 million budget gap. Polis' staff is preparing to address as much as a third of the gap through spending cuts. His office is expected to reveal its planned reductions later this week, after the revenue part has been adopted.

The rest of the hole will be filled from the legislature's piggy bank. That'll happen last: Whatever's not raised or cut will be pulled from the state's reserves. The governor's office has suggested roughly $320 million, which would reduce the current reserve level -- about 15% of the general fund budget -- by 2 percentage points.

That would mean his office was planning to propose about $200 million in spending reductions.

Liability at issue on AI

On the AI front, Rodriguez’s bill was sent Monday over to the House, where members have already debated a competing AI measure -- one that had also been watered down to simply delaying the 2024 regulations, in that case until October 2026. The House planned to take up Rodriguez's bill in committee and potentially for an initial floor vote Monday night, which would make a final vote possible Tuesday.

How to assign liability for bias apparent in the use of AI to make decisions -- between entities that use AI for things like screening job and rental applications and the entities that developed the AI tools -- was a key part of Rodriguez's measure before its gutting.

But that has been a key sticking point between the dueling bills.

“A delay is the prudent thing to do,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat and sponsor of the House bill, said. “We need to figure out a way where school districts, hospitals and other deployers aren’t left holding the bag for these regulations. We need to ensure that all stakeholders involved in this legislation are held equally accountable when bad things happen.”
