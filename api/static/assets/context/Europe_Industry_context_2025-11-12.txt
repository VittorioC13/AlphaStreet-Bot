In late September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era emergency law to take control of a Chinese-owned chip company that has operations in the country. The extraordinary move set off a chain of events that sent shock waves through the global motor industry – already battered by US tariffs and China's curbs on rare earth exports. In a statement to the Netherlands parliament, the minister of economic affairs cited "serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia" that "posed a threat". "This measure is highly exceptional and intended solely to ensure that the continuity of supply and safeguarding of critical technologies for the Dutch and European economy are not put at risk," the statement said. Beijing reacted furiously, accusing the Netherlands of political interference. It imposed export controls and halted deliveries of Nexperia chips from its Chinese facilities to Europe, while shipments of key supplies needed to make chips in China were frozen. The disruption caused to the motor industry highlighted a major weakness in the global supply chain of chips vital to car production and opened yet another front in the rivalry between the US and China. The Chinese government has now granted exemptions to export controls on the chips for civilian applications but has not clarified what it considers those to be. But Chinese authorities still want the Dutch to revoke the takeover of Nexperia. "China welcomes the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible," the commerce ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Nexperia's parent company Wingtech Technology did not respond to a BBC request for comment.

Weaponising supply chains

At the centre of the dispute is a critical part of the world's chip ecosystem. Nexperia makes so called "legacy" or "building block" semiconductors that are vital for everything from power-steering and airbags to central locking systems. These are not cutting-edge chips, but they are still indispensable. Some vehicles contain hundreds of them, and Nexperia supplies chips to major carmakers around the world. Around 70%-80% of its output is sent to China for processing, testing and packaging – a dependence that has left car makers exposed to Beijing's control over supply chains. "Car markers blindsided by the Nexperia mess should be hiring new supply chain management executives, as they clearly learned nothing from Covid... and excessive reliance on [Chinese] supply chains," China watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter. It underscores China's ability to choke off global supply chains - just as it did with rare earth exports. Similar to critical minerals, China can hold the West hostage with control of a company as inconspicuously important as Nexperia, according to Bill Echikson, Senior Fellow for the Tech Policy Program at Center for European Policy Analysis.

[TITLE]GenesisX Robotic Magnetic Navigation System Receives U.S. FDA Clearance:
[TEXT]
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stereotaxis (NYSE: STXS), a pioneer and global leader in surgical robotics for minimally invasive endovascular intervention, today announced that it received U.S. Food and Drug Administration 510(k) clearance for its latest generation robotic system, GenesisX™.

GenesisX is the latest advance in endovascular surgical robotics, building upon the established benefits of Robotic Magnetic Navigation while significantly enhancing the accessibility of the technology for healthcare providers. The system features a compact and efficient design, incorporating magnetic shielding into its structure in place of the shielding otherwise installed in the walls of the operating room. It operates on standard 120/230V power, requires no structural anchoring, and features an 80% smaller system cabinet. These allow for GenesisX to be installed in existing non-modified cath labs without complex architectural planning or construction. The system’s smaller and lighter design enhances workflow efficiency while maintaining the highest standards in speed and responsiveness.

“This is a landmark approval as we transform the accessibility and scalability of Robotic Magnetic Navigation, pioneering broad robotic adoption across endovascular surgery,” said David Fischel, Chairman and CEO of Stereotaxis. “We thank and congratulate all those who helped us reach this milestone. Successful development, approval, and deployment of complex surgical robots that operate reliably in daily clinical use is a unique expertise. This is our second robotic system launched within five years, reflecting our commitment and capacity to drive significant innovation in electrophysiology and endovascular medicine.”

“For years, challenging infrastructure demands limited the adoption of robotic technology amongst the community of physicians interested in its clinical benefits,” said Dr. Francis Marchlinski, Professor of Medicine and Director of Electrophysiology at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. “The GenesisX design changes that by dramatically simplifying installation. This helps to more readily bring the precision of robotic navigation and its ease of use for the operator to a broader patient population.”

Stereotaxis has initiated a limited launch of GenesisX in the United States and Europe while simultaneously expanding its portfolio of compatible catheters, enhancing compatibility with various x-rays, demonstrating commercial use, and enhancing supply chain, manufacturing, installation and commercial processes for a full launch. GenesisX’s flexibility as a capital system provides opportunities for alternative financing models including sales, leases and pay-per-use.

[TITLE]Global Precious Metals to Add Over $95 Billion in Market Value by 2030:
[TEXT]
The Asia-Pacific region currently leads the global market due to strong demand for jewelry and expanding industrial applications, while North America and Europe remain key players through advanced trading and ethical sourcing practices.

The primary drivers of this growth are sustained investor demand for safe-haven assets amid global uncertainty and increasing industrial consumption from the electrification trend, particularly in the automotive and electronics sectors.

The global precious metals market is forecast to grow by over $95 billion to reach $386.16 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 5.87%.

The global precious metals market is projected to grow by over USD 95 billion in the next five years, driven primarily by sustained investor demand for safe-haven assets and increasing industrial use in rapidly expanding technologies, according to a new report from Mordor Intelligence.

The market size, which was valued at $290.34 billion in 2025, is forecast to reach $386.16 billion by 2030. This expansion reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.87%, the research firm stated. Growth is being supported by a combination of investors seeking financial security during uncertain geopolitical and economic times, alongside rising demand for metals like silver and platinum in the electronics and renewable energy sectors.

Key Market Drivers

The research highlights two key dynamics propelling the market: the electrification trend boosting industrial metal consumption and the continued strengthening of safe-haven demand linked to global uncertainty.

The shift toward electric mobility is fundamentally reshaping industrial consumption patterns. This transition is lifting demand for silver, platinum, and palladium used in automotive electronics. Car manufacturers are reportedly diversifying their supply contracts and experimenting with substitute materials to manage rising costs associated with these in-demand metals. This trend benefits refiners and miners focused on the expanding electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem, particularly in regions that are scaling up vehicle production, according to the report.

Meanwhile, growing political tensions and trade disruptions globally are directing investors toward precious metals as a reliable store of value. Gold remains the primary refuge asset, with central banks continuing their accumulation efforts, underscoring the metal’s importance in diversified investment strategies. Furthermore, the report notes that silver and platinum are increasingly being utilized by investors to diversify their holdings. Institutional investors and central banks view bullion as a stabilizing asset amid volatile currency movements and geopolitical uncertainty, which is helping to keep long-term demand elevated.

Asia-Pacific Leads Regional Growth

Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region remains the largest area in the global precious metals trade. This dominance is attributed to strong regional jewelry demand and the expanding industrial application of precious metals. The report points to India's role in gold jewelry production and China's focus on bullion investment as key drivers. Japan and South Korea contribute to regional momentum through the extensive use of gold and silver in their electronics and semiconductor industries, keeping the Asia-Pacific ahead in both luxury and industrial segments.

North America maintains its market influence largely through advanced trading systems and exchange-traded fund (ETF)-based investments, which enhance bullion liquidity. The United States leads in financial innovation within the sector, while Canada and Mexico reinforce the supply chain through mining and refining operations. Europe, meanwhile, is noted for its emphasis on ethical sourcing and sustainable production practices, with Germany, France, and the United Kingdom playing important roles in global manufacturing, craftsmanship, and the bullion trade.

Sector Implications and Outlook

The expanding applications span several key sectors. Investment (including bars, coins, and ETFs) remains a core segment, alongside jewelry manufacturing. However, industrial applications are becoming more prominent, specifically in electronics, automotive catalysts, chemical catalysts, and photovoltaic systems. End-user industries contributing to the demand include banking and financial services, the automotive industry, and the electronics and electrical sector.

The precious metals market continues to demonstrate resilience, supported by sustained investment interest, expanding industrial utility, and a growing sector-wide emphasis on ethical sourcing, the report concluded.

[TITLE]Japanese investors turn to Europe as deep tech boom lures capital abroad:
[TEXT]
Huge swathes of cash are flowing from Japan to European tech startups as risk-averse investors favor a more mature entrepreneurial ecosystem, helping to scale the continent's booming deep tech cluster. While the European startup and venture capital ecosystem has long operated in the shadow of Silicon Valley, it has become fertile ground for Japanese corporates, whose domestic market is younger. Japanese investors or venture capital funds who themselves have Japanese investors, known as limited partners, participated in European financing rounds worth more than 33 billion euros ($38 billion) since 2019 when a trade deal between the European Union and Japan came into force, according to research from venture capital fund NordicNinja and data platform Dealroom. For the five years leading up to the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, investment totaled 5.3 billion euros. In Europe at that time, "there was no Japanese capital other than Softbank," Tomosaku Sohara, co-founder and managing partner of Japan-Europe VC NordicNinja, told CNBC. NordicNinja, which has 250 million euros of assets under management, is a collaboration between the firm's managing partners and Japan's JBIC IG Partners.

"Softbank was pretty active already at that moment, because they had acquired Finnish gaming company Supercell," Sohara said, noting that the acquisition injected life into Finland's startup ecosystem. Now, Mitsubishi , Sanden , Yamato Holdings , and Marunouchi Innovation Partners are among those directly backing European tech, per the report, while Japan-linked venture capital firms such as NordicNinja, Byfounders, and Toyota 's Woven Capital cut checks to startups on the continent. There are over two times more VC-backed startups in Europe than in Japan, per capita, and 4.3 times more unicorns, per the report.

The shadow of Silicon Valley

Japan's appetite for investing was always there, Sohara said. Its multinationals — like many — headed stateside to set up corporate venture capital arms in early 2000, in search of a slice of the action at the time when some of today's largest companies were just being thought up in dorm rooms. "Nobody wanted to look at Europe at that moment, but I think that after a couple of years they realized, 'Hey, maybe the U.S. culture is totally different from the Japanese culture,' and they began thinking, 'Hey, maybe we need to look at another region like Europe,'" Sohara said, adding that the profile of entrepreneurs in Europe, many of whom came from large corporates at the time, was more aligned with Japan. That's in contrast to the young founders coming from Stanford or university research and development departments, he said.

watch now

"They have experience at the corporates and also they have a mindset of entrepreneurship. Japan, unfortunately, is lacking the entrepreneurship mindset," Sohara added, referring to Europe's founders, many of whom came from Nokia and Skype.

The pull for founders

Japanese-linked investors have a penchant for one sector in particular: deep tech, which refers to companies building on top of scientific or engineering innovation. Deep tech and artificial intelligence accounted for 70% of deals made by such investors in Europe in 2024, echoing trends in the broader startup ecosystem as the AI, energy, and defense industries boom. The top-funded companies with Japanese participation include the U.K.'s autonomous vehicle startup Wayve, which raised $1.05 billion in an investment round in May 2024, British quantum computing firm Quantinuum, which secured 273 million euros in January 2024, and Spanish quantum firm Multiverse Computing, which saw investors cut it a check of 189 million euros in June 2025. The rounds were backed by Softbank, Mitsui and Toshiba, respectively. Such companies, however, typically need a lot of growth capital and industrial experience to scale successfully — two elements that Europe famously lacks.

"Investment appetite is way stronger than [in] any strategics I've seen here in Germany or in Europe," Sarah Fleischer co-founder and CEO, Tozero

"Japanese firms — and they're old, most of them that we're talking about, right — they're just sitting on a pile of money. They've been saving money throughout the last century, and now they're starting to spend it, to try to grow as a large corporate and increase their footprint outside of Japan," said Sarah Fleischer, co-founder and CEO of Germany-based battery materials recycling startup Tozero. "You see that investment appetite is way stronger than [in] any strategics I've seen here in Germany or in Europe," she added. Tozero has raised 14.5 million euros to date and counts NordicNinja, Honda and JGC among its investors. It's not just about the check. Japanese corporates and industrials have robust manufacturing and automotive know-how, Fleischer and Sohara noted respectively, meaning they are well positioned to plug Europe's knowledge gaps when it comes to scaling large manufacturing projects. Fleischer added that Japanese firms have long shored up their critical minerals supply chain and long-established trading firms, meaning they know how to secure essential components needed for the energy transition. For Tozero, this is an added plus, Fleischer said, given it's in the business of recovering such materials from spent batteries. In the age of political uncertainty amid choppy U.S.-China relations, Japan also acts as a good bridge to the Asian markets, Fleischer said.

A slower pace and lower risk appetite

Back in Japan, the number of entrepreneurs is "still very limited," Sohara said, as the older generation and "great talents" wanted to work for "a Toyota and Honda or Sony," he added, but the younger generation's mindset is beginning to change. Europe has also become the home to ambitious would-be founders searching for a tech ecosystem to build their companies in, Sohara said. However, as collaboration between Europe and Japan scales, language remains a barrier as fluency in English is not widespread in Japan, he added. For Fleischer, this also poses challenges. "There's so much miscommunication and local translation that could ruin a partnership instantly. And there's also some sort of cultural aspect as well, one needs to probably be aware of," she said, adding that she recently spent weeks in Japan getting to know her investors face-to-face, "because that's still the sentiment" there. Decision-making can therefore be slower, the founder said, due to thorough research and preparation. "They just do their homework," Fleischer said, noting that Japanese partners were hands-on in helping the company understand "how to build our next future commercial plant, potentially starting from Japan and then going worldwide."

Indeed, "without the support from NN [NordicNinja] it would have been much more difficult to build the right relationships," said Aaike van Vugt, co-founder and CEO of Dutch nanotechnology engineering firm VSParticle. That's in contrast to perhaps the most well-known Japanese player: Softbank. Softbank is "totally different" from traditional Japanese investor cultures, given it is driven by founder Masayoshi Son's decisions rather than operating on a consensus basis, like most Japanese business, Sohara added. The venture firm, known for its lofty bets on WeWork and, more recently, chip company Arm, poured huge sums of cash into tech startups amid the 2021 venture capital tech boom, which saw at least one Japanese-linked investor involved in deals worth 11.2 billion euros, per the report. Softbank stood out during this period; it was involved in 22% of deals with Japanese-linked participation in 2021.

[TITLE]Payments firm Worldline plans 500-million-euro capital injection:
[TEXT]
By Gianluca Lo Nostro

(Reuters) -Worldline on Thursday unveiled plans to raise 500 million euros ($583 million) by tapping some of France's biggest banks to fund a strategy aimed at turning ​around the payments firm following years of setbacks.

The two-stage capital increase will begin with a 110-million-euro ‌reserved share sale to Bpifrance, Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas, followed by a 390-million-euro rights issue open to all shareholders.

The three lenders ‌have committed to subscribe around 135 million euros to the rights issue.

Upon completion of the capital raise, expected in the first quarter of 2026, Bpifrance will hold a 9.6% stake in Worldline, Credit Agricole will own 9.5%, with BNP Paribas at 7.9%.

Swiss stock exchange operator SIX Group, Worldline's biggest investor, said it has accepted dilution as ⁠it will not participate in the capital increase.‌ SIX expects a 550-million-Swiss-franc ($693.48 million) impairment on its Worldline stake and said it will manage it as a financial investment in the future.

NEW PLAN FAILS TO ‍WIN BACK INVESTORS

The move failed to calm investors as shares in Worldline fell over 6%, hitting a new all-time low on Thursday.

Chief executive Pierre-Antoine Vacheron dismissed concerns that the company, valued 581 million euros as of Wednesday, could become a takeover target despite ​the new funding.

"We have very strong support from anchor shareholders, which are very large financial institutions in Europe,‌" Vacheron said in a call with reporters. "When you look at the competition, they are not really in good shape."

J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note the new plan gives the firm credibility but that investors will want to see proof of stabilisation.

[TITLE]Genco Shipping & Trading Limited Adopts Amendment to Limited Duration Shareholder Rights Plan to Protect the Best Interests of Shareholders:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE:GNK) (“Genco” or the “Company”), the largest U.S. headquartered drybulk shipowner focused on the global transportation of commodities, today announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) has adopted an amendment (the “Amendment”) to its one-year limited duration shareholder rights plan adopted on October 1, 2025 (the “Rights Plan”) that expires on September 30, 2026. The Amendment is effective immediately.

The Amendment amends and restates the definition of “Acquiring Person” to change the beneficial ownership threshold to become an Acquiring Person, thereby triggering the Rights Plan, to 10% (or 15% in the case of any 13G Investor). The definition also excludes the Grandfathered Shareholder, a shareholder that currently has beneficial ownership of nearly 15% of our Common Stock, subject to certain limitations described in a Form 8-K to be filed by the Company today.

The Board deemed the Amendment to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and appropriate and proportionate based on its ongoing assessment of the facts and circumstances following the Company’s entry into the Rights Agreement. These include the rapid accumulation of the Company’s Common Stock by a competitor and the possibility that the competitor could seek to transfer its position in whole or in part.

The Rights Agreement remains similar to plans adopted by other public companies and is intended to enable all Company shareholders to realize the long-term value of their investment. It is designed to reduce the likelihood that any entity, person, or group would gain control of or significant influence over the Company through open-market accumulation or other tactics potentially disadvantaging the interests of all shareholders, without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium. The Rights Agreement as amended by the Amendment will continue to provide the Board sufficient time to fulfill its fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders, and it does not prevent the Board from considering any proposal. The Rights Agreement as amended is not intended to deter offers that are fair and otherwise in the best interest of the Company’s shareholders.

[TITLE]Westport Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
~Company strengthens financial position with improved margins, enhanced liquidity, and continued progress on transformation initiatives~

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Westport Fuel Systems Inc. (“Westport") (TSX:WPRT / Nasdaq:WPRT), a supplier of alternative fuel systems and components for the global transportation industry, reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025, and provided an update on operations. All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.

“Our third quarter 2025 results reflect the continued execution of the transformation we began earlier this year, anchored by our commitment to sharpen Westport’s focus, strengthen our financial foundation, and position the Company for growth. The successful completion of the Light-Duty segment divestiture marked an important milestone in simplifying our business and concentrating on our core heavy-duty and alternative fuel systems. The proceeds of the Light-Duty segment divestiture enhanced our liquidity and provides the flexibility to invest in innovation and targeted opportunities aligned with our core strategy.

Operationally, our third quarter performance highlights the early benefits of our disciplined approach. While revenue declined as an expected outcome from the Light-Duty segment divestiture, we achieved a stronger gross margin of 31% in Q3 2025 compared to 14% in Q3 2024, driven by higher margin engineering services revenue, and we demonstrated tighter cost management year-to-date versus the prior year. Reflecting on the third quarter, Adjusted EBITDA results were impacted by the Light-Duty segment divestiture including, foreign exchange, relocation costs, and targeted changes to our staffing cost structure to ensure our underlying business is becoming more efficient and focused.

We also remain disciplined in strengthening our balance sheet, ending the quarter with $33.1 million in cash and less than $4 million in debt, while keeping cost efficiency and operational agility at the forefront. This solid financial position enables us to execute our strategic priorities and engage more proactively with OEM and fleet partners who are increasingly seeking affordable, lower-carbon solutions.

The Cespira joint venture continues to play a central role in our growth strategy. During the quarter, deliveries increased year-over-year, supported by aftermarket sales growth as supply chain constraints continued to ease. This progress reinforces our belief that Cespira provides a scalable, high-impact platform to accelerate the adoption of the HPDI systems in key markets worldwide.

As we move into the final quarter of 2025, our confidence in Westport’s direction has never been stronger. We are building a leaner, more resilient organization—one that is well positioned to deliver lasting value for our customers, employees, partners, and shareholders.”

Dan Sceli, Chief Executive Officer

Q3 2025 Highlights

Revenues of $1.6 million compared to $4.9 million in the same quarter last year. As planned and previously disclosed, our Heavy-Duty OEM segment ended its transitional service agreement with Cespira at the end of Q2 2025. Revenue this quarter was representative of our continuing High Pressure Controls & Systems segment, which produced $1.8 million in the same quarter last year.

Net loss from continuing operations of $10.4 million for the quarter compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $6.0 million for the same quarter last year. This was primarily the result of an increase in operating expenditures in research & development and selling, general and administrative expenses, a decrease in gross profit of $0.2 million compared to the prior year, and a negative impact from changes in foreign exchange gains and losses by $3.0 million.

Adjusted EBITDA 1 of negative $5.9 million compared to negative $0.8 million for the same period in 2024. The change was primarily driven by lower gross profit related to the divestiture of the Light-Duty business, partially offset by lower operating expenditures.

of negative $5.9 million compared to negative $0.8 million for the same period in 2024. The change was primarily driven by lower gross profit related to the divestiture of the Light-Duty business, partially offset by lower operating expenditures. Cash and cash equivalents were $33.1 million at the end of the third quarter 2025, compared with $14.8 million as at December, 31, 2024. Cash used in operating activities was $4.5 million, primarily driven by operating losses in the quarter partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $0.9 million. Investing activities were primarily cash capital contributions into Cespira of $11.0 million and cash received from the sale of the Light-Duty segment to (the "Purchaser") for $26.0 million. Cash used in financing activities was $1.0 million, primarily net debt repayments in the period.

Segment Information

High-Pressure Controls & Systems Segment

Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $1.6 million and $6.4 million, respectively, compared with $1.8 million and $7.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year quarter was primarily driven by lower sales during the plant relocation from Italy to Canada and China.

Gross profit increased by $0.1 million to $0.5 million, or 31% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $0.4 million or 22% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by engineering service revenue in the quarter that had higher margins.

Gross margin decreased by $0.9 million to $1.1 million, or 17% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $2.0 million, or 26% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in gross margin was primarily related to lower revenue and an increase in material costs.

Heavy-Duty OEM Segment

The segment's transitional service agreement with Cespira ended in Q2 2025 and, as a result, the segment did not have any sales activity in the quarter.

Light-Duty Segment (Discontinued Operations)

(1) Gross profit and gross margin are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to GAAP and NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES for the reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures and limitations on the use of such measures.

(2)Income (loss) before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 includes a loss on disposal of operations of $5.1 million and $35.3 million for the disposal of the Light-Duty business (refer to Note 5 in our interim financial statements for details).

On July 29, 2025, we closed the sale of our Light-Duty segment. As a result, quarter-to-date and year-to-date financial results only included one month and seven months of discontinued operations activity, respectively.

As part of the discontinued operations in the quarter, we recorded an additional $5.1 million loss on disposal of the Light-Duty segment. This was primarily driven by increases in the net assets of the disposal group for activity in the quarter and changes in foreign exchange rates between Euro and US Dollar impacting translation of foreign currency balances on the closing date compared to June 30, 2025 when the disposal group was previously classified as held-for-sale. We continue to account for any changes in purchase price adjustments through the loss on disposal in discontinued operations as we finalize post-closing items with the Purchaser in accordance with the Sale and Purchase Agreement.

Selected Cespira Statements of Operations Data

We account for Cespira using the equity method of accounting. However, due to its significance to our long-term strategy and operating results, we disclose selected Cespira financial information in our interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.

The following table sets forth a summary of the financial results of Cespira for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. In the 2024 comparatives, Cespira had four months of operations after its formation on June 3, 2024:

Three months ended September 30, Change Nine months ended September 30, Change (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2025 2024 $ % 2025 2024 $ % Total revenue $ 19.3 $ 16.2 $ 3.1 19 % $ 48.1 $ 20.3 $ 27.8 137 % Gross profit1 $ (1.1 ) $ (0.2 ) $ (0.9 ) 450 % $ (2.5 ) $ — $ (2.5 ) — % Gross margin % (6 )% (1 )% (5 )% — % Loss before income taxes $ (6.0 ) $ (5.3 ) $ (0.7 ) 13 % $ (19.8 ) $ (7.5 ) $ (12.3 ) 164 % Net loss attributable to the Company $ (3.2 ) $ (3.0 ) $ (0.2 ) 7 % $ (10.8 ) $ (4.1 ) $ (6.7 ) 163 %

(1)Gross profit and gross margin are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to GAAP and NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES for the reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures and limitations on the use of such measures.

Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $19.3 million and $48.1 million, respectively, compared to revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 which was $16.2 million and $20.3 million, respectively. The increase in revenue in the current quarter was primarily driven by higher volumes of systems sold compared to the prior year quarter.

Gross profit was negative $1.1 million and negative $2.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. Gross profit was negative $0.2 million and nil for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

Cespira incurred losses of $6.0 million and $19.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. Cespira continues to incur losses as it scales its operations and expands into other markets.

GAAP and NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). These U.S. GAAP financial statements include non-cash charges and other charges and benefits that may be unusual or infrequent in nature or that we believe may make comparisons to our prior or future performance difficult. In addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Westport and certain investors use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as an indicator of our ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, service debt obligations and fund capital expenditures. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures in its review and evaluation of the financial performance of Westport. EBITDA is also frequently used by investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA is multiplied by a factor or "EBITDA multiple" that is based on an observed or inferred relationship between EBITDA and market values to determine the approximate total enterprise value of a company. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional insight to investors and securities analysts as supplemental information to our U.S. GAAP results and as a basis to compare our financial performance period-over-period and to compare our financial performance with that of other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons of our core operating results from period to period and to other companies by, in the case of EBITDA, removing the effects of our capital structure (net interest income on cash deposits, interest expense on outstanding debt and debt facilities), asset base (depreciation and amortization) and tax consequences. Adjusted EBITDA provides this same indicator of Westport's EBITDA from continuing operations and removing such effects of our capital structure, asset base and tax consequences, but additionally excludes any unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses, stock-based compensation charges and other one-time impairments and costs which are not expected to be repeated in order to provide greater insight into the cash flow being produced from our operating business, without the influence of extraneous events.

At the Black Pine project (“Black Pine”),

On August 19, 2025 6 , we reported Phase 5A Column Leach Metallurgical results. Key results include: Consistent Gold Extractions and Leach Performance: Weighted average column leach gold extraction of 80.6%, with individual composites reaching up to 90.8%, demonstrating metallurgical continuity across multiple mineralized zones; all of the Phase 5A composites tested exhibit the typical Black Pine leach result of greater than 80% of the eventual gold extraction achieved in under 10 days. Corroborated Bottle Roll Data: Gold and silver extractions from coarse crush bottle roll tests strongly correlate with column leach results, 78.9% vs 80.6%, respectively, in line with previous metallurgical results. De-risking Project Development: Phase 5A column tests reinforce the suitability of ROM heap leach processing and provide key inputs into the ongoing feasibility study metallurgical model. Expanded Metallurgical Coverage: Phase 5A testing included composites from Back Range and J Zone, areas not previously tested and variability composites infilling previous sampling in the M Zone, Tallman and F zones.

, we reported Phase 5A Column Leach Metallurgical results. Key results include: On August 27, 2025 7 , we announced that sonic drill hole assays confirm the presence of residual, cyanide-soluble gold in the 30 million tonne legacy heap on site at Black Pine. Assay data further indicates residual gold grades supportive of potential economic reprocessing, with individual samples ranging from 0.06 to 1.18 grams per tonne (“ g/t ”) gold (“ Au ”), with the highest gold grades occurring near the surface of the heap. Recognizing the potential to remove the legacy heap and process that material economically on the new heap opens significant exploration potential for resource and reserve expansion in the Rangefront Zone, located directly adjacent to the legacy heap.

, we announced that sonic drill hole assays confirm the presence of residual, cyanide-soluble gold in the 30 million tonne legacy heap on site at Black Pine. On September 4, 2025 8 , we reported report initial reverse circulation assay results from the Rangefront Zone. Key results include: Multiple stacked zones of higher-grade oxide gold mineralization have been confirmed beyond the current Rangefront Resource Pit. Grades and widths are consistent with previous drilling. The near surface high grade zone in the western Rangefront area remains open for expansion, with strong continuity to the northwest toward the heap leach pad and to the east. This is an area previously categorized as waste. New drill results bolstered confidence in converting over 250,000 ounces of gold in mineral resources to mineral reserves currently locked by proximity to the legacy heap leach pad, building on previously released sonic drilling that indicated reprocessing legacy heap material could unlock Reserve Pit design potential. Legacy heap leach pad reprocessing could unlock ~1 square kilometer of new exploration potential and connect Rangefront mineralization to the main Discovery Area. Rangefront remains open in multiple directions and is emerging as a strategic starter pit for future mining operations.

, we reported report initial reverse circulation assay results from the Rangefront Zone. Key results include: On September 24, 2025, 9 we reported Phase 5B metallurgical program results. Key results include: Consistent Gold Extractions and Leach Performance: Weighted average column leach gold extraction of 81.9% at an average head grade of 0.65 parts per million gold, with individual composites ranging from 52% to 94.5%. Phase 5B composites exhibit the typical Black Pine leach result of greater than 80% of the eventual gold extraction achieved in under 10 days. Corroborated Bottle Roll Data: Gold extractions from direct leach coarse crush bottle rolls (P80 of 1.68 millimeters) are aligned with column leach results (P80 of 16.9 millimeters) at 78.4% vs 81.9%, respectively. Confirmed gold recoveries in Primary Mining Phases: Phase 5B testing focused on infill sampling within the primary mining phases of Rangefront and Discovery Zones.

we reported Phase 5B metallurgical program results. Key results include: On October 15, 2025 10 we announced the latest drilling results confirming that the Rangefront Zone at Black Pine continues to expand, with near-surface oxide gold mineralization now exceeding 150 meters wide (north-south) and 200 meters wide (east-west), introducing significant potential changes to mining economics and sequencing strategy. Highlights include: Near-surface, higher-grade mineralization in western Rangefront continues to grow in size to the south, east and northwest, extending toward the historic heap leach pad area. 0.41 grams g/t Au over 41.1 meters in LBP1145 at 45 m below surface Infill and conversion drilling continues to expand mineralization at Rangefront, with strong oxide gold grades and widths consistent with and extending the prior results. East Rangefront: 0.28 g/t Au over 125 meters in hole LBP1136 West Rangefront: 0.20 g/t Au over 53.3 meters and 0.92 g/t Au over 35.1 meters in hole LBP1141 North Rangefront: 0.37 g/t Au over 71.6 meters in hole LBP1144

we announced the latest drilling results confirming that the Rangefront Zone at Black Pine continues to expand, with near-surface oxide gold mineralization now exceeding 150 meters wide (north-south) and 200 meters wide (east-west), introducing significant potential changes to mining economics and sequencing strategy. Highlights include: On October 29, 2025 11 we announced new high-grade oxide gold drill intercepts at the Discovery Zone. This series of holes in Discovery were planned to increase confidence in the mineralization and metallurgical models in an area previously defined largely by historic drilling. The upper portion of this intercept has confirmed the extension of a previously mined high-grade shoot in the historic B Pit area. Notable intercepts include: 1.53 g/t Au over 85.3 meters, including 5.19 g/t Au over 9.1 meters in LBP1171 1.17 g/t Au over 59.4 meters, including 3.44 g/t Au over 15.2 meters in LBP1155

Manufacturing revenue increased by 7% to $4.7 million.

Net income from continuing operations attributable to company stockholders totaled $5.6 million or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $5.0 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024.

Including discontinued operations, net income attributable to company stockholders totaled $5.5 million or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $4.5 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024.

Cash and cash equivalents increased to $123.6 million and working capital increased to $141.7 million as of September 30, 2025.

Third Quarter Operational Highlights

Retail water sold by the company’s Grand Cayman water utility increased 6% due to significantly less rainfall on Grand Cayman during this past quarter compared to the third quarter of 2024 and an increase in total number of customer service connections.

The company was awarded two water treatment plant construction projects, including a drinking water plant expansion in Colorado and a wastewater recycling plant in California. The revenue attributable to these projects are expected to be realized primarily in 2026, and the combined value of these projects totals approximately $15.6 million.

Design of the company’s $204 million project to design, construct, operate and maintain a 1.7 million gallon per day seawater desalination plant in Kalaeloa, Hawaii is now 100% complete, which helps pave the way to begin construction once all permits have been obtained.

Management Commentary

“In Q3, our diversified water business model, which includes regulated utility operations, design and construction services, O&M services and manufacturing, continued to perform well,” commented Consolidated Water CEO, Rick McTaggart. “As a result, our consolidated revenue increased by 5% and our fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 10% compared to the same year-ago period.

[TITLE]Op-Ed: Japan's Offshore Wind Dream Hits a Wall:
[TEXT]
When Mitsubishi Corporation walked away from three massive offshore wind projects in August, paying ¥20 billion in penalties rather than proceeding, it sent shockwaves through Japan’s renewable energy sector. For a trading giant to abandon 1.7 gigawatts of capacity — enough to power 1.3 million homes — it signaled something more than a corporate retreat. It exposed a fundamental crisis in how Japan approaches its offshore wind future.

This story developed post Japan Mobility Show, when the discussion swerved to how 360° energy utilization will happen in Japan when the country’s energy mix is primarily based on fossil fuels (61%) like coal (28%), oil (2%), and natural gas (31%), whereas its low-carbon sources like hydropower (8%) and biomass (5%), particularly solar (11%) and nuclear power (10%), make up the remaining 39%.

Now, as the country lags dramatically behind its Asian neighbors in renewable deployment and major developers abandon projects and auctions falter, a new industry blueprint warns Japan risks missing its clean energy moment. This white paper from the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) is sounding the alarm: without immediate and comprehensive reform, Japan’s offshore wind ambitions may be dead in the water.

The Promise That Faded

The numbers tell a sobering story. Japan aims to reach 10 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 45 gigawatts by 2040. Current installed capacity? Just 0.3 gigawatts. While China added 8 gigawatts of offshore wind in 2024 alone, and Taiwan, South Korea, and Vietnam are racing ahead with ambitious buildouts, Japan’s three auction rounds have produced more cautionary tales than turbines.

Round 1’s sole winner withdrew. Round 2 and Round 3 winners are struggling with severe financial challenges. The government even postponed its fourth auction indefinitely in October to reassess the entire framework. Even before the delays, developers warned they were “at the brink of whether this business can continue.”

This isn’t just an industry problem — it’s an economic and strategic one for a nation that imports most of its energy and has pledged carbon neutrality by 2050. Japan’s electricity costs remain among Asia’s highest, its fossil fuel dependence near 70%, and its renewable energy share trails embarrassingly behind global peers. While wind provided just 1% of Japan’s electricity in 2024, it averaged 11% across other G7 nations.

“Japan holds vast offshore wind potential and cannot afford to miss its chance to become an offshore wind leader, especially within the Asia-Pacific region,” says Takeshi Matsuki, GWEC’s Japan Country Manager. The urgency in his assessment is palpable — and justified.

The GWEC white paper, Unlocking Japan’s Offshore Wind Potential, produced in partnership with renewable energy consultancy OWC, dissects what went wrong and maps a path forward through three critical reform areas.

Auction Framework

Japan’s current auction design creates a perfect storm of uncertainty. Price-focused evaluation criteria drove developers to submit unrealistically low bids — some at near-zero premiums — just to win projects. But winning means little when project economics don’t work.

The centralized survey model, while intended to reduce developer risk, hasn’t provided the certainty needed. Meanwhile, complex evaluation processes and academic-heavy review committees lack input from developers with “hands-on experience from the front lines,” according to the report.

The solution? Establish a dedicated public-private forum that supplements existing government working groups. Optimize evaluation criteria to better balance price and non-price factors. In the longer term, introduce two-stage auction structures that give developers clearer pathways from selection to financial close.

The Revenue Certainty Crisis

Here’s where the system truly breaks down. Japan uses a Feed-in Premium (FIP) scheme tied to volatile market prices on the Japan Electric Power Exchange, where spot prices averaged ¥9-16 per kilowatt-hour in 2025 — well below the ¥12-15/kWh needed for early offshore wind projects to pencil out.

Even when Mitsubishi secured FIP rates ranging from ¥11.99 to ¥16.49/kWh across its three projects, those levels proved insufficient as construction costs ballooned by more than 20% and turbine prices doubled. Material costs, labor shortages, and currency fluctuations combined to make even supposedly “winning” bids economically untenable.

The white paper strongly advocates transitioning to either a two-sided Contract for Difference (CfD) or Feed-in Tariff (FIT) — mechanisms that provide stable, predictable revenue streams and lower the weighted average cost of capital. The UK, facing similar auction failures, raised its CfD ceiling price 66% in 2024 and extended contract terms from 15 to 20 years. Denmark followed suit after receiving zero bids.

Japan also needs to review and raise price caps to align with current market realities while introducing lower limits closer to break-even points to prevent destructive underbidding. Greater access to Corporate Power Purchase Agreements, potentially backed by credit guarantees, could unlock additional financing.

Death By A Thousand Cuts

Beyond auctions and revenue structures, developers face a gauntlet of obstacles that make projects unbankable. Certification requirements lack transparency. The permitting process is byzantine. Grid curtailment — particularly in high-potential regions like Hokkaido, Tohoku, and Kyushu — threatens project returns without compensation mechanisms.

Perhaps most critically, Japan sets pipeline development targets rather than Commercial Operation Date (COD) targets. This creates phantom progress: projects awarded but never completed. COD-based targets would force accountability and enable the supply chain visibility that manufacturers and investors need to commit capital.

A Region Leaving Japan Behind

The contrast with neighboring markets is stark. In 2024, global offshore wind auctions awarded 56.3 gigawatts of capacity. China awarded 17.4 gigawatts. Europe awarded 23.2 gigawatts. South Korea awarded 3.3 gigawatts, Taiwan 2.7 gigawatts. Japan? Just 1.4 gigawatts.

The Asia-Pacific region expects to account for 61% of new wind capacity built worldwide between 2024 and 2030, with total onshore and offshore wind capacity potentially reaching 1,206 gigawatts by decade’s end. Japan has the offshore potential to be a major player in this transformation — its exclusive economic zone alone offers massive developable areas — yet it’s squandering that opportunity.

The economic costs of this failure extend beyond missed megawatts. Japan spent ¥3.7 trillion subsidizing electricity and gas bills between January 2023 and May 2024 due to fossil fuel price volatility. Every delayed offshore wind project is another year of import dependence, price exposure, and foregone job creation in manufacturing, installation, and operations.

The Window Is Closing

GWEC and OWC presented their findings to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), and Ministry of Environment (MOE) in late October. The government agencies expressed strong interest.

Interest, however, isn’t implementation. As the white paper notes, meaningful reform requires both short-term fixes — adjustments to Round 1 re-tendering and the upcoming auction that can be made without legislative changes — and long-term structural reforms envisioned for Round 5 and beyond.

“Japan stands at a pivotal moment in its clean energy transition, and offshore wind has emerged as a central pillar of its strategy,” says Masataka Nakagawa, OWC’s Japan Country Manager. “To enable stable and scalable deployment, Japan needs to address three critical areas: auction framework, offtake mechanisms, and other market bottlenecks.”

The question is whether Japan will act decisively enough, quickly enough. Other markets have shown that offshore wind can recover from setbacks with the right policy responses. But timing matters. Developers are increasingly mobile, directing capital to markets with clear, stable frameworks. Supply chain partners need demand visibility to justify investments in local manufacturing.

As GWEC prepares a detailed plan for the proposed public-private bridging forum, the message is clear: reform isn’t optional. It’s existential. Without it, Japan risks watching its offshore wind potential remain just that — potential — while the rest of Asia builds the clean energy infrastructure of the 21st century.

For a nation that pioneered hybrid cars and led in solar deployment before feed-in tariffs lapsed, that would be more than an industrial missed opportunity. It would be a strategic failure at precisely the moment when energy security, economic competitiveness, and climate leadership demand bold action.

The turbines are waiting. The question is whether Japan’s policymakers will build the framework to support them.

Advanced fleet management systems equipped with IoT sensors allow providers to monitor vehicle performance, fuel usage, and cargo conditions, thereby improving reliability and maintenance planning.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are being used to forecast delivery volumes, optimize warehouse operations, and automate dispatching based on traffic, weather, and customer demand patterns. Blockchain is emerging as a tool for enhancing data integrity and visibility across complex supply chains, particularly for high-value or regulated shipments where tracking provenance is critical. Cloud-based platforms are facilitating seamless integration between shippers, recipients, and carriers, allowing for real-time communication, automated invoicing, and instant issue resolution.

Digital dashboards and analytics tools enable businesses to analyze delivery performance, identify bottlenecks, and refine their logistics strategies. Mobile apps and web portals are empowering customers with self-service capabilities, such as booking pickups, changing delivery instructions, or accessing shipment history. Moreover, robotic process automation is reducing the administrative burden of tasks like order entry, customs documentation, and compliance checks. These technological advancements are not only increasing operational efficiency but also reshaping customer expectations, setting a new benchmark for what constitutes high-performance B2B delivery in the digital age.
