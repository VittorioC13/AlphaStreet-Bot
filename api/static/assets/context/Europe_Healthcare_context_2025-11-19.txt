(*) See "Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures" and "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures" sections herein for an explanation and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used throughout this release.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures

We collect and analyse operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to Revenue, Income (Loss) from Operations and Net Income (Loss) under GAAP, we use: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and Board of Directors. Therefore, these non-GAAP financial measures are presented here. Our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA

We define Adjusted EBITDA as Income (Loss) before Income Taxes, excluding (i) depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) interest income (expense), (iii) non-cash interest expense, (iv) stock-based compensation expense, (v) non-recurring and extraordinary items (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) gain (loss) on equity investments, net, (viii) gain on extinguishment of debt, (ix) change in fair value of derivative liability (x) foreign currency transaction, net, and (xi) prior years bad debt allowances.

We have included Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and Board of Directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and non-recurring and extraordinary items.

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted Net Income (Loss)

We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as Adjusted EBITDA (see above) adding provision for income taxes and deducting interest expense.

Adjusted Net Income has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

[TITLE]Captain T Cell Closes Financing Round to Advance its Proprietary, Next-Generation TCR-T Pipeline Into the Clinic:
[TEXT]
Available funding totaling EUR 20 million dedicated to developing novel solid tumor treatments addressing a high unmet medical need

Springboard Health Angels, Pluton Asset Holding AG, Sintra Limited , and Technologiegründerfonds Sachsen joined as new investors

Existing investors i&i Biotech Fund I SCSp, HIL-INVENT and Brandenburg Kapital also participated in the round

Schoenefeld/Berlin, Germany, November 17, 2025 --- Captain T Cell, a biotechnology company developing next-generation TCR-T cell therapies for solid tumors, today announced the successful closing of an equity financing round with both new and existing investors. The latest equity funding, along with already secured grants, provides Captain T Cell with a total budget of EUR 20 million to advance its best-in-class autologous program CTC127 to clinical Phase I read-outs and its first-in-class allogeneic program for off-the-shelf solid tumor treatments towards clinical trial readiness.

The round was led by Springboard Health Angels and Pluton Asset Holding AG, joined by Sintra Limited and Technologiegründerfonds Sachsen, as well as existing investors i&i Biotech Fund, HIL-INVENT and Brandenburg Kapital.

The funds will enable the Company´s lead program CTC127 to progress into a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial (TOMATA - “Toolbox-modified MAGE-A4-TCR-T cell therapy for HLA-A1”). The trial will be led by principal investigator Prof. Antonia Busse, Charité – Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, with participation from eight other leading cancer centers across Germany. The study will enroll patients with multiple advanced MAGE-A4-positive solid tumor indications, including lung, bladder, gastroesophageal, ovarian, and head and neck cancers. CTC127 is based on the Company’s proprietary and versatile engineering toolbox, which enables functional “armoring” of T cells to enhance their anti-tumor activity, persistence, and resilience within the solid tumor microenvironment.

In parallel, the Company has already demonstrated complete solid tumor responses in vivo with a program leveraging its first-in-class allogeneic TCR-T cell platform and will advance it toward clinical trial readiness. Furthermore, the Company plans to extend its proprietary best-in-class toolbox towards in vivo T cell therapy applications.

“Despite a challenging fundraising environment, we have gained broad investor support, which underscores the strong competitive profile of Captain T Cell’s best- and first-in-class next-generation T cell therapy platform and enables us to advance these therapies for the benefit of cancer patients,” said Dr. Felix Lorenz, CEO of Captain T Cell. “Our best-in-class autologous program CTC127 will enter the fully funded TOMATA clinical trial and our first-in-class allogeneic TCR-T platform is progressing toward clinical readiness. We are optimistic that our best-in-class toolbox technologies will be clinically validated in the upcoming trial and subsequently expanded into off-the-shelf approaches.”

“We are excited to co-lead this recent financing round of Captain T Cell,” said Dr. Andreas Schmidt of Springboard Health Angels. “The Company´s lead program CTC127 holds the potential to become a highly effective and safe therapy for solid tumor patients who urgently need novel treatment options. With funding secured through the upcoming Phase I readout, Captain T Cell is well positioned for a major value inflection.”

Dr. Theis Terwey, representing lead investor Pluton Asset Holding AG, commented: “MAGE-A4 is a de-risked and commercially validated target. The available preclinical data convincingly demonstrate that Captain T Cell’s toolbox-enhanced approach is conceptually superior to on-market cell therapies against solid tumors, providing strong evidence that the Company can deliver competitive efficacy in large solid tumor indications.”

Dr. Barbora Šumová, Investment Director at i&i Biotech Fund, added: “Since our initial investment, the Captain T Cell team has consistently executed with exceptional speed and quality, achieving every milestone set at the seed round funding stage. We are proud to continue supporting the Company as it advances towards becoming a clinical-stage company.”

Prof. Antonia Busse, Principal Investigator at Charité – Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, noted: “There remains a profound unmet need for effective therapies for patients with advanced solid tumors. We look forward to initiating the clinical safety and efficacy evaluation of CTC127 together with eight other leading cancer centers in Germany.”

[TITLE]Johnson & Johnson set to revolutionize the treatment of cancer with the acquisition of Halda Therapeutics:
[TEXT]
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ (November 17, 2025) – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Halda Therapeutics OpCo, Inc. (Halda), a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a proprietary Regulated Induced Proximity TArgeting Chimera (RIPTACTM) platform to develop oral, targeted therapies for multiple types of solid tumors, including prostate cancer, for $3.05 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close within the next few months, subject to antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions.

The lead candidate, HLD-0915, is a clinical-stage therapy for prostate cancer, of which new diagnoses are projected to reach 1.7 million globally by 20301. Given the existing unmet need, this once-daily therapy has the potential to transform patient outcomes with its novel precision cancer cell-killing approach that can overcome mechanisms of resistance to treatment. The acquisition also includes several earlier candidates for breast, lung and multiple other tumor types. Halda’s pipeline and platform may also enable the creation of novel targeted therapies beyond oncology.

“This acquisition further strengthens our deep oncology pipeline with an exciting lead asset in prostate cancer and a platform capable of treating multiple cancers and diseases beyond oncology, providing a potential mid- and long-term catalyst for growth,” said Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson. “We look forward to combining Halda’s pipeline, platform and people with our world class R&D, commercial and manufacturing capabilities and advancing our goal of bringing these therapies to patients around the world.”

“Many therapies lose effectiveness over time due to resistance. Halda’s innovative technology is designed to work even when cancers no longer respond to standard treatments using a novel mechanism that enables the selective killing of cancer cells,” said John C. Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine, R&D, Johnson & Johnson. “Results seen with HLD-0915 demonstrate impressive preliminary efficacy and a strong early safety profile in prostate cancer. We are eager to accelerate the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HLD-0915 and progress a pipeline of novel product candidates based on RIPTAC™ technology.”

The planned acquisition underscores Johnson & Johnson’s longstanding commitment to prostate cancer and industry-leading oncology portfolio, adding new therapies with novel and complementary mechanisms of action. Halda’s pipeline of differentiated assets, if successful, will provide critical new options for patients.

[TITLE]Biogen and Stoke Therapeutics Announce Publication of Two-Year Natural History Data Demonstrating the Severity of Dravet Syndrome, Including Frequent Seizures and Significant Cognitive and Behavioral :
[TEXT]
– Despite treatment with standard-of-care anti-seizure medicines, children with Dravet syndrome experienced high seizure burden and plateaued in neurodevelopment, resulting in a widening gap relative to children with typical development –

– Findings underscore the urgent need for new medicines that target the underlying genetic cause of Dravet syndrome to improve long-term outcomes –

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and BEDFORD, Mass., Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Stoke Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: STOK), a biotechnology company dedicated to restoring protein expression by harnessing the body’s potential with RNA medicine, today announced the publication of final data from the BUTTERFLY study, a prospective, two-year natural history study in people with Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) characterized by recurrent seizures and significant cognitive and behavioral impairments. There are currently no approved disease-modifying medicines to treat Dravet syndrome.

The BUTTERFLY study evaluated the impact of Dravet syndrome on adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment over two years in children and adolescents ages 2 to 18 years old. Major motor seizure frequency was evaluated as a secondary outcome measure. In the study, patients were treated with standard-of-care, including anti-seizure medicines (ASMs). Highlights from the research, published November 14, 2025, in Neurology®, 1 the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, include:

Regardless of the age at which patients with Dravet syndrome entered the study, neurodevelopment plateaued at the developmental age of approximately two years old. This created a gap that widened over time versus what would be expected for children with typical development.

Results showed that over the course of the two-year study, patients experienced minimal changes in cognition and behavior, including communication, motor skills and personal skills, compared to typical neurodevelopment expected for children of the same age. Assessments of cognition and behavior used in BUTTERFLY were pre-determined endpoints that were incorporated into this natural history study to support use in future clinical studies of Dravet syndrome. They included the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Third Edition (Vineland-3); Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID-III); and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV). These assessments, as well as other outcome measures used in BUTTERFLY, are consistent with the primary and secondary endpoints of the pivotal, global Phase 3 EMPEROR study evaluating zorevunersen as a potential disease-modifying medicine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome.

Major motor seizure frequency increased by 10.6 percent over two years (average of 14.3 seizures/28 days at baseline; p=0.63; n=23).

“These natural history data confirm that the life-altering effects of Dravet syndrome extend well beyond seizures, resulting in significant deficits in patients’ functioning and development despite treatment with the best available medicines,” said Joseph Sullivan, M.D., FAES, lead author of the Neurology publication and Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics at the University of California San Francisco. “The findings make clear that as children with Dravet syndrome grow up, they experience a widening gap in their cognitive and behavioral development compared to a neurotypical child of the same age. By giving us a baseline characterization of what current treatments can do for patients, these data become increasingly important in helping us understand how potential disease-modifying medicines might change the trajectory of Dravet syndrome. I’d like to extend my deep appreciation to the families who participated in BUTTERFLY and made significant sacrifices to help us more fully comprehend the debilitating effects of this disease.”
