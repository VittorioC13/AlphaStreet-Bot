What is Hidradenitis Suppurativa?

Hidradenitis suppurativa, also known as acne inversus, is a long-lasting inflammatory skin disorder characterized by deep nodules, abscesses, draining tunnels, and fibrotic scars. These lesions typically develop in intertriginous regions and areas with a high concentration of apocrine glands, with the axillae, groin, perianal, perineal, and inframammary areas being most commonly affected. This activity explores the causes, clinical features, and complications of HS, emphasizing the importance of an interprofessional approach to management. The disease process starts when a defective hair follicle becomes blocked and ruptures, releasing keratin, bacteria, and other contents into the surrounding dermis. This triggers a chemotactic inflammatory response from neutrophils and lymphocytes, which can lead to abscess formation and damage to the pilosebaceous unit and surrounding tissues. The prognosis varies among patients, and no definitive cure has been found. Outcomes are poorer when diagnosis and treatment are delayed, particularly in the early stages, and when comorbidities such as smoking and obesity are not addressed.

[TITLE]ALX Oncology Announces Preclinical Data and Phase 1 Trial-in-Progress Presentations of ALX2004, a Novel EGFR-Targeted ADC, at 2025 AACR-NCI-EORTC Conference:
[TEXT]
-Two poster presentations showcase best- and first-in-class potential of ALX2004, a novel, antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of EGFR-expressing solid tumors

-Robust body of preclinical data supports ALX2004 differentiation in EGFR-ADC class and continued evaluation in first-in-human trial

-Initial safety data from ongoing ALX2004 Phase 1 trial anticipated in the first half of 2026

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ALX Oncology Holdings Inc., ("ALX Oncology" or the “Company") (Nasdaq: ALXO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing a pipeline of novel therapies designed to treat cancer and extend patients’ lives, today presented preclinical data and the trial design for the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for its ADC candidate, ALX2004, in two poster presentations at the 2025 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, taking place October 22 – 26, 2025 in Boston, Massachusetts. ALX2004-01 is a first-in-human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of ALX2004 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are known to express EGFR.

“Our preclinical findings have shown potent anti-tumor activity and a favorable toxicity profile supporting our advancement of ALX2004 into the clinic," said Jason Lettmann, Chief Executive Officer at ALX Oncology. “Given that toxicity challenges of earlier generation ADCs have limited the therapeutic window in the treatment of EGFR-expressing solid tumors; we are encouraged by our preclinical data that this unique molecule, ALX2004 could potentially overcome these limitations. Enrollment in this trial began in August and continues to be on track to allow us to deliver initial safety data in the first half of next year. We are pleased to present extensive preclinical data supporting ALX2004’s potential to break new ground in ADC innovation in the EGFR-targeting class at the AACR-NCI-EORTC Conference.”

The Company’s first ADC, ALX2004, is the result of a rigorous internal drug design process. Developed in house by ALX Oncology’s protein engineers utilizing the Company’s proprietary topoisomerase I inhibitor (Top1i) payload and linker payload platform, ALX2004 is designed to optimize all mechanisms of ADC cancer killing while maximizing the therapeutic window. ALX2004 uses a matuzumab-derived EGFR antibody selected to minimize off tumor skin toxicity and maximize therapeutic window, with a binding epitope distinct from U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved EGFR antibodies. Additionally, ALX2004 has a proprietary linker-payload and Top1i payload engineered to offer improved linker stability for on-target delivery of payload and enhanced bystander effect.

ALX2004 is currently being evaluated in a first-in-human, open-label multicenter study in participants with advanced or metastatic select EGFR-expressing solid tumors. The design of this Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT07085091) will also be presented at the meeting.

German pharmaceutical giant Bayer plans to adopt a strong tiered pricing approach worldwide to make its drugs and therapies affordable. However, Stefan Oelrich , head of Bayer's pharmaceuticals division, in an interview with Vikas Dandekar and Teena Thacker underlined the need for returns on its investments for the risks it takes for research . Edited excerpts:I am in favour of rule-based trade around the world. Free trade has been the basis for an incredible creation of wealth for the entire world, independent of regions. On pharmaceuticals, an (US) investigation is ongoing when it comes to trade, and we'll have to see what the outcome is. There have been some trade deals between the EU and the US, given that we have a lot of reciprocal trade. That at least gives us some planning certainty, but the rest must be seen. It's a little bit in flux.Traditionally, we have been strong in cardiovascular and metabolic areas, so all of these are connected. We don't have a specific obesity pipeline project today, but that doesn't mean we're not interested in the overall connection of what's happening in terms of your immune system. In fact, obesity is ultimately an inflammatory process. We target other inflammatory processes, for example protecting the kidney, the heart, and all of this come together. So, reducing weight is one important factor, but not the only one. We are happy where we are. And in R&D, it's like a good sports game: you don't want all the kids on one ball; but you want them distributed along the field to score the most goals.Take our presence in India: more than 120 years, making us probably one of the oldest brands in the country. This holds true in many regions of the world. Investment into innovation goes where there's a good reception for it, and also some level of acceptance of returns on those innovations. Europe was traditionally the "pharmacy of the world." Then it shifted more to the US. Today we have more balance across regions, which now includes China.I would like to characterise it with three As: We need to accelerate, attract, and access. These words essentially sum up my agenda in this presidency. Europe needs to be attractive for investment, both in capital and in terms of people. Europe needs to be faster in approvals, faster in reducing bureaucracy and faster in creating better regulation. We need to accelerate and ultimately, it must ensure strong access to all citizens. One of the most important tasks that we have as innovators is that innovation translates into demand. These three together should make Europe competitive with any region in the world.I think time has never been better for breakthroughs than today in our industry. The increase in knowledge around biology, combined with digital advancements and chemistry, has never been better. Knowledge growth in our sector is almost second to none. In IT, we always talk

These lesions typically develop in intertriginous regions and areas with a high concentration of apocrine glands, with the axillae, groin, perianal, perineal, and inframammary areas being most commonly affected. This activity explores the causes, clinical features, and complications of HS, emphasizing the importance of an interprofessional approach to management. The disease process starts when a defective hair follicle becomes blocked and ruptures, releasing keratin, bacteria, and other contents into the surrounding dermis. This triggers a chemotactic inflammatory response from neutrophils and lymphocytes, which can lead to abscess formation and damage to the pilosebaceous unit and surrounding tissues. The prognosis varies among patients, and no definitive cure has been found. Outcomes are poorer when diagnosis and treatment are delayed, particularly in the early stages, and when comorbidities such as smoking and obesity are not addressed.

[TEXT]
-Two poster presentations showcase best- and first-in-class potential of ALX2004, a novel, antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of EGFR-expressing solid tumors

-Robust body of preclinical data supports ALX2004 differentiation in EGFR-ADC class and continued evaluation in first-in-human trial

-Initial safety data from ongoing ALX2004 Phase 1 trial anticipated in the first half of 2026

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ALX Oncology Holdings Inc., ("ALX Oncology" or the “Company") (Nasdaq: ALXO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing a pipeline of novel therapies designed to treat cancer and extend patients’ lives, today presented preclinical data and the trial design for the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for its ADC candidate, ALX2004, in two poster presentations at the 2025 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, taking place October 22 – 26, 2025 in Boston, Massachusetts. ALX2004-01 is a first-in-human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of ALX2004 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are known to express EGFR.

“Our preclinical findings have shown potent anti-tumor activity and a favorable toxicity profile supporting our advancement of ALX2004 into the clinic," said Jason Lettmann, Chief Executive Officer at ALX Oncology. “Given that toxicity challenges of earlier generation ADCs have limited the therapeutic window in the treatment of EGFR-expressing solid tumors; we are encouraged by our preclinical data that this unique molecule, ALX2004 could potentially overcome these limitations. Enrollment in this trial began in August and continues to be on track to allow us to deliver initial safety data in the first half of next year. We are pleased to present extensive preclinical data supporting ALX2004’s potential to break new ground in ADC innovation in the EGFR-targeting class at the AACR-NCI-EORTC Conference.”

The Company’s first ADC, ALX2004, is the result of a rigorous internal drug design process. Developed in house by ALX Oncology’s protein engineers utilizing the Company’s proprietary topoisomerase I inhibitor (Top1i) payload and linker payload platform, ALX2004 is designed to optimize all mechanisms of ADC cancer killing while maximizing the therapeutic window. ALX2004 uses a matuzumab-derived EGFR antibody selected to minimize off tumor skin toxicity and maximize therapeutic window, with a binding epitope distinct from U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved EGFR antibodies. Additionally, ALX2004 has a proprietary linker-payload and Top1i payload engineered to offer improved linker stability for on-target delivery of payload and enhanced bystander effect.

ALX2004 is currently being evaluated in a first-in-human, open-label multicenter study in participants with advanced or metastatic select EGFR-expressing solid tumors. The design of this Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT07085091) will also be presented at the meeting.

[TEXT]
Telangana has set an ambitious target of attracting ₹1 lakh crore in new investments in the Life Sciences sector by 2030, aiming to generate employment for five lakh people, according to Minister for IT and Industries Duddilla Sridhar Babu.

Delivering the keynote address at the AusBiotech International Conference 2025 in Melbourne organised jointly by AusBiotech and the Government of Victoria on Thursday, the Minister said the State government has drawn up a comprehensive Roadmap 2030 to position Telangana as a Global Life Sciences Hub.

“Telangana is preparing a Comprehensive Life Sciences Policy to accelerate innovation, infrastructure, and global partnerships,” Sridhar Babu said, outlining the State’s strategy for the next phase of bio-digital growth.

Stating that Telangana was outperforming the national average in economic growth, the Minister said: ``Though the State ranks 11th in geographical area and 12th in population, it contributes over 5 percent to India’s GDP. Telangana’s GSDP growth rate in 2024–25 stood at 8.2 percent compared with the national average of 7.6 percent,’’ he said.

Over the past 20 months, the State has attracted ₹3.2 lakh crore in new investments, with ₹63,000 crore coming from the Life Sciences sector alone. Exports from the sector crossed ₹26,000 crore between April and December 2024. The State aims to increase the value of the Life Sciences economy from USD 80 billion to USD 250 billion by 2030, the Minister said.

Sridhar Babu said Telangana was investing heavily in building a “ready-to-deploy bio-digital workforce” to meet the needs of emerging technologies in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and healthcare, according to a release.
