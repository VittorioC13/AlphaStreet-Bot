Haircare company Ionic Professional has raised Rs 6.5 crore in pre-seed funding led by early-stage venture capital firm All In Capital, with participation from MG Investments and several angel investors. The funding will be utilised to expand the company’s team and portfolio, which competes with L’Oréal and Hindustan Unilever Founded in 2025 by engineers-turned-entrepreneurs Saumya Yadav (IIT Delhi, Stanford GSB, ex-Udayy) and Atit Jain (BITS Pilani, ex-Elevation Capital, ex-co-founder of Pluss and Bulbul), the company that owns &Done is building a professional haircare brand designed specifically for Indian hair types and weather conditions.Since its launch, the company has partnered with 1,500 stylists across more than 300 premium salons in Tier-1 cities, combining a salon-led distribution model with a direct-to-consumer line of shampoos and conditioners for at-home use.“Haircare remains one of the toughest categories to crack in the beauty space as products are often rejected after a single use, unlike skincare where consumers show patience.However, &Done has understood this challenge deeply and built a brand around genuinely solving hair issues with highly effective formulations. As Indian consumers become increasingly aspirational and willing to pay a premium for products that work, we believe &Done is positioned to become a category-defining brand,” said Aditya Singh, co-founder of All In Capital.India’s haircare market was estimated at $3.8 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $6 billion by 2030, driven by premiumisation and rising consumer aspirations. The professional salon segment is valued between Rs 2,500 crore and Rs 3,500 crore, while the beauty services market exceeds $10 billion.“We are on a mission to bring science-backed, professional haircare solutions specifically made for Indian hair. Salons in India still rely on imported professional brands, but Indian hair types and weather are different, and consumers expect results, not just promises. Hence, we believe it’s time for Indian hair to have its own high-performance, professional haircare brand,” said Saumya Yadav, co-founder of &Done.With frequent salon visits in metros and high-value services, &Done said it sees significant growth potential in the professional segment while also expanding its direct-to-consumer presence. The company plans to launch new solutions for diverse hair types and expand both in India and overseas over the next three years.

Information technology outfit Megaport Ltd (ASX: MP1) has announced a $200 million capital raise and a major acquisition, which will open up a new business front for the company.

The company said on Tuesday that it would buy Latitude.sh, "a global, automated infrastructure platform delivering compute-as-a-service" for US$150 million up front and up to a further US$150 million contingent on revenue and integration targets.

Megaport also stated that it would invest approximately $43 million in expanding its operations in India, with the funds allocated to acquiring a leading network operator with a local team and approximately 400 active customers.

New capital to fund deals

The deals would be funded by a fully-underwritten $200 million placement to institutional shareholders at a price of $14.30 per share.

Up to another $20 million will be raised via a non-underwritten share purchase plan open to Megaport's retail shareholders, who will be able to subscribe for up to $30,000 worth of new shares at the placement price or a lower price if the shares trade below that.

Megaport also said that it had delivered "strong financial performance" through the first four months of the year, with annual recurring revenue running at $260.1 million for October this year, up 22% compared with the same month last year and first quarter revenue of $62.9 million, up 21% compared to the same period last year.

The company said in its statement to the ASX on Tuesday that the Latitude.sh acquisition was "highly strategic and financially compelling''.

The company added:

Latitude.sh is a globally scalable, high performance software platform that automates infrastructure. It is similar to Megaport and offers customers compute-as-a-service which can be provisioned on demand.

Megaport said it would set up a new "compute as a service" division based around Latititude.sh, giving it exposure to a US$13 billion compute market, which it said was expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 20%.

As the company said:

The market is being supported by customers increasingly seeking to run critical workloads globally, with low latency. Latitude.sh's CPU / GPU capabilities support deployed inference and training workloads closest to users, partners and data centres.

Megaport said Latitude.sh was profitable, with EBITDA margins of about 50%, and was growing its annual recurring revenue at more than 50%.

The acquisition will be funded with US$70 million in cash and about 7.8 million Megaport shares to make up the remaining US$80 million.

The extra US$150 million in contingent payments will be paid in three US$50 million tranches over three years, should the relevant milestones be met.

Megaport will hold its annual general meeting on 25 November. The company's shares remain suspended from trade and last changed hands for $15.30.

[TITLE]Autonomous EV trucking company Einride going public in SPAC deal valuing it at $1.8 billion:
[TEXT]
The Einride EV freight truck charging station in Lynwood, California, built by Voltera and located close to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

Autonomous EV freight trucking company Einride is planning to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a SPAC deal with Legato Merger Corp. III , a blank check company, valuing it at $1.8 billion.

The deal is expected to raise $219 million in gross proceeds, with up to an additional $100 million in PIPE capital from institutional investors, with Einride to begin trading during the first half of 2026.

In announcing its plans, the Stockholm, Sweden-based company reported a contracted annual recurring revenue base of $65 million and over $800 million in potential long-term ARR.

Founded in 2016, Einride has over 25 customers across seven countries, and regulatory permits in the United States and Europe. Its current fleet of approximately 200 electric vehicles is used by customers including GE Appliances and Swedish online pharmacy company Apotea.

"Today marks a defining moment for Einride and for the future of freight technology," said

Roozbeh Charli, CEO of Einride, in a release. "We've proven the technology, built trust with global customers, and shown that autonomous and electric operations are not just possible, but better. This transaction positions us to accelerate our global expansion and continue to deliver with speed and precision for our customers," said Charli, who took over the CEO post from co-founder and previous CEO Robert Falck last May.

Einride has made the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for three consecutive years, ranking No. 24 in 2025.

Freight trucking in the U.S. and elsewhere, estimated by Einride at a $4.6 trillion market, is both carbon-intensive and inefficient. Einride's technology is designed to reduce emissions at scale and prove electric freight is viable both technologically and economically.

PepsiCo is among the companies that has piloted use of Einride freight solutions, in markets including Germany, and in the U.S., Memphis, Tennessee. Heineken added EV freight routes between the Netherlands and Germany in 2024, and to Austria. Einride also has plans to deploy 300 electric trucks across Europe by 2030 with Mars.

[TITLE]NYC restaurateur cancels expansion plans following Zohran Mamdani victory: ‘I’m not signing’:
[TEXT]
New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s radical policy proposals have prompted high-profile restaurateur Stratis Morfogen to cancel plans to open new businesses.

He told Side Dish he’s pulling the plug on three new establishments, including one in Midtown West.

“I waited for the election before signing and now I’m not signing,” he said.

Just last week, Morfogen opened his first restaurant in Miami. He is also planning to open Diner24 in Miami in 2026.

5 Stratis Morfogen told Side Dish he’s pulling the plug on three new establishments, including one in Midtown West. Matthew McDermott

“I’m not signing any more leases in New York,” Morfogen vowed. “I’ll keep what I have. We’re not expanding in New York but we are pursuing further opportunities in Miami and other cities.

“We just don’t feel that this mayor is suitable to supporting small businesses.”

Veteran restaurateur and nightlife guru Richie Romero had the same response to Mamdani’s stunning defeat of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa earlier this month.

Romero has put a halt on new openings except for a new East Village outpost of Sushi By Bou, for which construction began months before the election.

“The hatred of Jews, socialism, the economics – it’s too much,” he said of Mamdani. “I had to be vocal. I get attacked, but it is what it is.”

5 “We want to wait and see what [Mamdani] does. His radical changes scare the s–t out of small business owners,” Morfogen said. Getty Images

Romero, who hosted fundraising events for Cuomo, said he is launching a coalition “to fight socialism” that is still in the works.

Instead of betting on New York, the lifelong New Yorker is opening 12 to 15 concepts outside the city in secondary markets — from Atlanta and Dallas to West Palm, Fla.

Morfogen said he opted not to sign a lease for an all-but-completed deal for a new restaurant at West 32nd Street and 10th Avenue. He also put the brakes on signing leases for new diners on the Upper East Side, at East 62nd Street and First Avenue, and on the edge of the Upper West Side.

“I am not signing any leases now,” Morfogen declared. “We want to wait and see what [Mamdani] does. His radical changes scare the s–t out of small business owners.”

The mayor-elect’s proposal to raise the city’s minimum wage to $30 by 2030 will “put fast-casual out of business,” Morfogen predicted.

“There won’t be any more diners for $25 a person if a $12 burger goes up to $22,” he said. “We will still have to pay our rent and our profit margin — at 10% — is too thin to survive.”

He is also worried

The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

Halifax residents brought traffic and environmental concerns to an open house on major development planned for the Sandy Lake area in Bedford, and questioned why no provincial decision-makers were there to hear feedback.

The public spoke with Halifax municipal planners and representatives for developers in the Sandy Lake special planning area at the open house at a Bedford church Wednesday.

Sandy Lake is one of 16 spots around the city where the province has taken over development approval from Halifax council in a bid to fast-track housing construction.

“The province just came in and said, ‘no, we're doing it.’ And they're not even here for us to talk to,” said resident Heather Crosby.

DALLAS, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Digital (the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APLD) a designer, builder, and operator of high-performance, sustainably engineered data centers and colocation services for artificial intelligence, cloud, networking and blockchain workloads announced today it expects to receive additional funding as part of its previously disclosed perpetual preferred equity financing facility of up to $5.0 billion with Macquarie Asset Management.

The anticipated additional draws of an aggregate amount equal to $787.5 million are expected to be completed by the end of the month and will support the continued build-out of Applied Digital’s Polaris Forge 1 and Polaris Forge 2 AI Factory campuses in North Dakota.

Of the anticipated funding, $450 million will be allocated toward completing the build-out of Polaris Forge 2, Applied Digital’s AI Factory campus in Harwood, North Dakota. The Polaris Forge 2 campus has leased 200 MW of critical IT capacity, currently under construction, to a U.S.-Based Investment Grade Hyperscaler, which also holds the first right of refusal for an additional 800 MW of critical IT load at that campus – representing the full 1-gigawatt expansion potential of the site.

Macquarie Asset Management will fund the remaining $337.5 million into Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, North Dakota, subject to the closing of the Company’s previously announced $2.35 billion senior secured notes offering and other customary conditions. The investment will provide additional non-dilutive capital for the 400-MW campus, support platform-level general and administrative expenses, and cover transaction costs.

“This funding underscores the continued execution of our AI infrastructure strategy and the confidence in Applied Digital’s ability to deliver at scale,” said Wes Cummins, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Applied Digital. “With Macquarie Asset Management’s ongoing support and the anticipated completion of our senior secured notes offering, we believe we’re positioned to strengthen our balance sheet, accelerate development, and expand our AI Factory platform. We recently achieved our first Ready-for-Service milestone for our first data hall at Polaris Forge 1, and both Polaris Forge 1 and 2 remain on schedule, reflecting our disciplined execution and commitment to on-time delivery.”

“Applied Digital continues to distinguish itself as a trusted partner to hyperscale customers, with a differentiated portfolio of near-term power availability built by a pioneering leadership team,” said Anton Moldan, Senior Managing Director of Macquarie Asset Management. “We are pleased to deepen our partnership with Applied Digital as it scales its high-performance compute data center platform. Our global experience as an owner and manager of some of the largest private data center portfolios positions us to help Applied Digital become an industry-leading data center platform.”

“With Macquarie Asset Management’s continued support, we believe we are well-positioned to drive meaningful progress across our platform of large-scale AI Factories,” said Saidal Mohmand, Chief Financial Officer of Applied Digital. “These additional investments provide the capital needed to deliver on Polaris Forge 1 and continue advancing Polaris Forge 2, reinforcing the strength of our financing model and execution strategy.”

Up to one-half of the $337.5 million Macquarie Asset Management funding that is allocated to Polaris Forge 1 may be, but need not be, used for the second building on our Polaris Forge 1 campus. Any portion of the Macquarie Asset Management funding not used for that building is expected to be used for our other data center projects and general corporate purposes, and will not be credit support for the proposed senior secured notes. These Macquarie Asset Management fundings are subject to customary conditions, including in the case of the Polaris Forge 1 funding, the closing of the senior secured notes offering on terms reasonably acceptable to Macquarie Asset Management, all of which we expect to be satisfied reasonably promptly.

In addition, on November 10, 2025, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with First National Bank of Omaha, pursuant to which the lender agreed to make one or more revolving loans, and issue letters of credit, from time to time to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $65 million. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance at a rate of SOFR plus 2.75% per annum. The loan is secured by all of the Company’s (but none of its subsidiaries’) assets.

[TITLE]Anthropic to spend $50 billion on US data center buildout:
[TEXT]
Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) on Wednesday announced it will spend $50 billion to build out AI data centers in Texas and New York. The company says the data centers will be constructed with the help of Fluidstack, which helps build out massive GPU clusters.

According to Anthropic, the investment will create up to 2,400 construction jobs and 800 permanent positions when the data centers come online in 2026.

"We’re getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren’t possible before," Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement.

"Realizing that potential requires infrastructure that can support continued development at the frontier. These sites will help us build more capable AI systems that can drive those breakthroughs, while creating American jobs," he added.

Anthropic said that the data centers are necessary to meet demand from "hundreds of thousands of businesses" using its Claude platform while allowing it to continue to perform research on frontier models.

The company said it will continue to prioritize "cost-effective, capital-efficient approaches" to achieving the scale necessary to meet its needs.

Anthropic said it currently serves more than 300,000 business customers. Its number of large accounts with revenue run rates of more than $100,000 has also grown by nearly sevenfold over the past year.

Wall Street analysts and investors have begun to raise questions about how AI companies like Anthropic can pay for the billions of dollars in data centers they're constructing around the globe.

Those concerns were on display during AMD's (AMD) Financial Analyst Day on Tuesday when analysts repeatedly asked CEO Lisa Su how customers like OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), which has plans to spend more than $1 trillion on data centers, will pay for its buildout.

Su, however, pushed back, saying that if there's enough demand for artificial intelligence, there will likely be plenty of cash to pay for it.

"This is a very unique moment in AI, and we shouldn't be shortsighted in thinking about, 'Hey, are you going to see returns in a couple of quarters, or are people going to be interested in financing it?' If the AI usage grows as much as we expect, I think there's going to be plenty of financing," Su added.

In addition to its plan to spend $50 billion on its own data centers, Anthropic recently inked deals to use up to 1 million of Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) custom AI chips and an additional 1 million of Amazon's (AMZN) custom chips.

[TITLE]Autonomous EV trucking company Einride going public in SPAC deal valuing it at $1.8 billion:
[TEXT]
The Einride EV freight truck charging station in Lynwood, California, built by Voltera and located close to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

Autonomous EV freight trucking company Einride is planning to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a SPAC deal with Legato Merger Corp. III , a blank check company, valuing it at $1.8 billion.

The deal is expected to raise $219 million in gross proceeds, with up to an additional $100 million in PIPE capital from institutional investors, with Einride to begin trading during the first half of 2026.

In announcing its plans, the Stockholm, Sweden-based company reported a contracted annual recurring revenue base of $65 million and over $800 million in potential long-term ARR.

Founded in 2016, Einride has over 25 customers across seven countries, and regulatory permits in the United States and Europe. Its current fleet of approximately 200 electric vehicles is used by customers including GE Appliances and Swedish online pharmacy company Apotea.

"Today marks a defining moment for Einride and for the future of freight technology," said

Roozbeh Charli, CEO of Einride, in a release. "We've proven the technology, built trust with global customers, and shown that autonomous and electric operations are not just possible, but better. This transaction positions us to accelerate our global expansion and continue to deliver with speed and precision for our customers," said Charli, who took over the CEO post from co-founder and previous CEO Robert Falck last May.

Einride has made the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for three consecutive years, ranking No. 24 in 2025.

Freight trucking in the U.S. and elsewhere, estimated by Einride at a $4.6 trillion market, is both carbon-intensive and inefficient. Einride's technology is designed to reduce emissions at scale and prove electric freight is viable both technologically and economically.

PepsiCo is among the companies that has piloted use of Einride freight solutions, in markets including Germany, and in the U.S., Memphis, Tennessee. Heineken added EV freight routes between the Netherlands and Germany in 2024, and to Austria. Einride also has plans to deploy 300 electric trucks across Europe by 2030 with Mars.
