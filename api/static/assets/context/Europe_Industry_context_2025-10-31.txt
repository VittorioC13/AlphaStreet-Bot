[TITLE]GlobalFoundries Plans Billion-Euro Investment to Expand Chip Manufacturing in Germany:
[TEXT]
GlobalFoundries (GF) today announced plans to invest €1.1 billion to expand its manufacturing capabilities at its Dresden, Germany site. The investment will enable a production capacity increase to more than one million wafers per year by the end of 2028, making it the largest site of its kind in Europe.The expansion, known as project SPRINT, is expected to be supported by the German federal government and the State of Saxony under the framework of the European Chips Act, with EU approval for the full program expected later this year. This investment underscores Saxony's role as a critical hub for semiconductor manufacturing and innovation and reinforces Europe's strategic goal of supply chain resilience.As a part of the project, the facility will be upgraded to offer end-to-end European processes and data flows for critical semiconductor security requirements.Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as part of his visit to GF Dresden on 28 October, welcomed the planned investments in Germany: "The SPRINT project is a commitment to Germany as an industrial and innovation location - and above all to the sovereignty of our country and Europe. The investment in chip manufacturing in Dresden sends a signal that Germany wants to play an active role in shaping the development of the global semiconductor market. Germany already plays a leading role in microelectronics in Europe. With its national microelectronics strategy, the federal government is setting the course for further expanding this strength."Saxony's Minister President Michael Kretschmer adds: "The further expansion of semiconductor manufacturing here at GlobalFoundries is a clear commitment to a unique location. The billion-euro investment is more good news for Silicon Saxony, Europe's most important microelectronics location, and demonstrates the attractiveness and dynamism of the cluster that has grown here. This will not only strengthen the Saxon economy—Germany and Europe will also benefit. After all, more chips manufactured here also means more German and European sovereignty and technological independence in this key industry. Germany's economic vulnerability due to excessive dependencies is currently being demonstrated by the example of chip manufacturer Nexperia."The new manufacturing capacity will focus on GF's highly differentiated technologies - with critical performance features including low power, embedded secure memory, and wireless connectivity - all essential for meeting Europe's chip demand for automotive, internet of things (IoT), defense and critical infrastructure applications. These sectors are being rapidly transformed by the rise of physical AI technologies for which GF's semiconductors are essential. The investment will also support continued innovation in next-generation compute architectures and quantum technologies as they scale into the next decade."Recent disruptions in the automotive sector underscore just how vulnerable global chip supply chains truly are. Our planned expansion in Dresden is yet another step in GF's strategy to address these challenges head-on and deliver on our commitment to support Europe's need for secure supply chains and differentiated technologies," said Tim Breen, CEO of GlobalFoundries. "By scaling our manufacturing footprint in Europe, in the U.S. and around the world, GF is reinforcing its role as a resilient and trusted partner to customers in critical industries and building a foundation for the next wave of innovation as physical AI becomes reality."Dr. Manfred Horstmann, senior vice president and general manager European fabs at GlobalFoundries, adds: "With this planned investment, we are deepening our commitment to Germany and Europe. Expanding cleanroom capacity is not just

[TITLE]Renta 4 Banco (BME:R4) Margins Improve to 15.3%, Reinforcing Bullish Profitability Narratives:
[TEXT]
Renta 4 Banco (BME:R4) delivered a net profit margin of 15.3%, up from 13.9% last year, highlighting expanding profitability. EPS growth was impressive, with earnings up 31.6% year-over-year and an average annual increase of 12% over the past five years. With shares currently trading at €19.8 versus an estimated fair value of €6.17, investors are weighing a track record of high-quality, consistent earnings growth against a premium valuation and a minor risk regarding dividend sustainability.

See our full analysis for Renta 4 Banco.

Next, we'll see how these headline figures hold up compared to the main narratives that drive sentiment for Renta 4 Banco. Some assumptions might get reinforced while others could be challenged.

BME:R4 Earnings & Revenue History as at Oct 2025

Net Margins Stay Above Peers

Renta 4 Banco's net profit margin reached 15.3%, which is well above both its own previous year’s figure of 13.9% and the average for many capital markets peers.

Consistent profitability heavily supports the market’s optimism. Investors note that expanding margins signal efficient management and stable cost discipline. Margins remain robust despite industry pressures. This fuels sentiment that the bank may sustain above-average performance. It is notable that this margin expansion comes alongside steady long-term earnings growth, adding weight to bullish narratives.

Trading at a Premium to DCF Fair Value

The current share price stands at €19.8, which significantly overshoots the DCF fair value of €6.17. The stock is priced at a P/E ratio of 20.3x, above the European Capital Markets average of 16.6x and its peer group’s 16x.

Market enthusiasm for recent profit growth appears to carry the share price to premium levels. This creates tension with more conservative intrinsic value models. Bulls may emphasize the 12% annualized earnings growth, but skeptics highlight that paying over 3 times DCF fair value could challenge future upside. Investors are left to weigh whether quality justifies the high multiple or if caution is warranted as relative valuations stretch.

[TITLE]SEACOR Marine Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
HOUSTON, Oct. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SEACOR Marine Holdings Inc. (NYSE: SMHI) (the “Company” or “SEACOR Marine”), a leading provider of marine and support transportation services to offshore energy facilities worldwide, today announced results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

SEACOR Marine’s consolidated operating revenues for the third quarter of 2025 were $59.2 million, operating income was $18.1 million, and direct vessel profit (“DVP”)(1) was $11.5 million. This compares to consolidated operating revenues of $68.9 million, operating loss of $6.5 million, and DVP of $16.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, and consolidated operating revenues of $60.8 million, operating income of $6.1 million, and DVP of $11.3 million in the second quarter of 2025.

Notable third quarter items include:

14.1% decrease in revenues from the third quarter of 2024 and a 2.7% decrease from the second quarter of 2025.

Average day rates of $19,490, a 3.2% increase from the third quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% decrease from the second quarter of 2025.

66% utilization, a decrease from 67% in the third quarter of 2024 and a decrease from 68% in the second quarter of 2025.

DVP margin of 19.4%, a decrease from 23.2% in the third quarter of 2024 and an increase from 18.6% in the second quarter of 2025, due in part to $9.9 million of drydocking and major repairs during the third quarter of 2025 compared to $8.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $9.2 million in the second quarter of 2025, all of which are expensed as incurred.

During the third quarter of 2025, the Company completed the sale of two 335’ class liftboats for total proceeds of $76.0 million and a gain of $30.5 million.

For the third quarter of 2025, net income was $9.0 million ($0.35 earnings per basic and diluted share). This compares to a net loss for the third quarter of 2024 of $16.3 million ($0.59 loss per basic and diluted share). Sequentially, the third quarter 2025 results compare to a net loss of $6.7 million ($0.26 loss per basic and diluted share) in the second quarter of 2025.

Chief Executive Officer John Gellert commented:

“The third quarter results reflect lower revenues driven by lower utilization in our premium liftboat fleet and soft market conditions in the North Sea.

As previously announced, we completed the sale of our two 335’ class liftboats to a foreign buyer at the end of the third quarter. In connection with this sale we incurred some market downtime during the quarter as the two liftboats were taken off the market in order to ensure a timely delivery. Additionally, one of our premium liftboats in the Middle East remained off hire undergoing repairs during the entire quarter. This vessel has now completed its repairs and is mobilizing towards a contract.

Average rates held steady during the quarter, despite poor utilization and pricing in the North Sea, and each of our reporting segments reported positive DVP for the quarter, except the Middle East due to the ongoing repairs of the premium liftboat, which are now completed.

Our fast supply vessel (“FSV”) fleet saw improved utilization and dayrate performance. We reactivated two of the three FSVs previously cold-stacked in the U.S., with one FSV redeployed to a contract internationally during the quarter and another one being prepared for service in international markets.

The platform supply vessel (“PSV”) fleet generated a 24.8% DVP margin despite being negatively affected by continued soft conditions in the North Sea. During the quarter, we were awarded multi-year contracts in Brazil for two of our large hybrid-powered PSVs with contract commencement in Q1 2026. These contracts will reduce our presence in the North Sea to two PSVs.

The successful execution of the liftboat sale during the third quarter demonstrates the deep value of our fleet and allows us to continue our strategic shift away from high volatility markets. We are streamlining our cost structure to reflect the recent asset sales and will utilize our improved liquidity profile to fund our newbuild PSV program and position ourselves for developments in offshore markets in the near term. With a better positioned fleet, an improved cost structure and a strengthened balance sheet, we will continue to explore opportunities to redeploy capital into more attractive assets or consolidation.”

_______________ (1 ) Direct vessel profit (defined as operating revenues less operating costs and expenses, “DVP”) is the Company’s measure of segment profitability. DVP is a critical financial measure used by the Company to analyze and compare the operating performance of its regions, without regard to financing decisions (depreciation and interest expense for owned vessels vs. lease expense for lease vessels). DVP is also useful when comparing the Company’s global fleet performance against those of our competitors who may have differing fleet financing structures. DVP has material limitations as an analytical tool in that it does not reflect all of the costs associated with the ownership and operation of our fleet, and it should not be considered in isolation or used as a substitute for our results as reported under GAAP. See page 4 for reconciliation of DVP to GAAP Operating Income (Loss), its most comparable GAAP measure.

SEACOR Marine provides global marine and support transportation services to offshore energy facilities worldwide. SEACOR Marine operates and manages a diverse fleet of offshore support vessels that deliver cargo and personnel to offshore installations, including offshore wind farms; assist offshore operations for production and storage facilities; provide construction, well work-over, offshore wind farm installation and decommissioning support; and carry and launch equipment used underwater in drilling and well installation, maintenance, inspection and repair. Additionally, SEACOR Marine’s vessels provide emergency response services and accommodations for technicians and specialists.

[TITLE]Bel Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
Sales and Gross Margin Percentage Above Mid-Point of Expected Ranges

Provides Q4-25 Sales and Gross Margin Guidance

WEST ORANGE, N.J., Oct. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bel Fuse Inc. (Nasdaq: BELFA and BELFB) today announced preliminary financial results for the third quarter of 2025.

Third Quarter 2025 Highlights

Net sales of $179.0 million compared to $123.6 million in Q3-24. Up 44.8% from Q3-24

Gross profit margin of 39.7%, up from 36.1% in Q3-24

GAAP net earnings attributable to Bel shareholders of $22.3 million versus GAAP net earnings attributable to Bel shareholders of $8.1 million in Q3-24

Adjusted EBITDA of $39.2 million (21.9% of sales) as compared to $21.5 million (17.4% of sales) in Q3-24

Gain of $1.6 million on Sale of Zhongshan, PRC building

"Bel delivered a strong third quarter, with sales and gross margin percentage at the high end of our guidance," said Farouq Tuweiq, President and CEO. "This performance was driven by robust demand in commercial aerospace, defense, and a continued rebound among networking and distribution customers. Our gross margin expansion reflects the leverage gained from higher sales volumes.

"Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, which generally reflects seasonality due to the holidays, based on information available today we estimate net sales of $165 to $180 million and expect gross margin to remain healthy in the 37 to 39 percent range. Across Bel, there is strong internal collaboration as we focus on growth and new opportunities for the next chapter of our journey,” concluded Mr. Tuweiq.

Non-GAAP financial measures, such as Non-GAAP net earnings attributable to Bel shareholders, Non-GAAP EPS, Non-GAAP Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA, adjust corresponding GAAP measures for provision for income taxes, other income/expense, net, interest income/expense, and depreciation and amortization, and also exclude, where applicable for the covered period presented in the financial statements, certain unusual or special items identified by management such as restructuring charges, gains/losses on sales of businesses and properties, acquisition related costs, earnout adjustments, impairment charges, noncontrolling interest ("NCI") adjustments from fair value to redemption value, and certain litigation costs. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we modified our presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures, including revising our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS, to additionally exclude from these Non-GAAP measures (i) stock-based compensation, (ii) amortization of intangibles (which primarily relates to the amortization of finite-lived customer relationships and technology associated with the Company's historical acquisitions, including those associated with the acquisition of Enercon), and (iii) unrealized foreign currency exchange (gains) losses. We believe this change enhances investor insight into our operational performance. We have applied this modified definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS to all periods presented.

[TITLE]US Army Corps of Engineers approves Enbridge plan to encase aging Great Lakes oil pipeline:
[TEXT]
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has approved energy company Enbridge's plan to encase a segment of an aging oil pipeline beneath a Great Lakes channel

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday approved energy company Enbridge’s plans to encase a segment of an aging oil pipeline that runs beneath a Great Lakes channel, pushing past its own findings that construction could ruin the environmentally sensitive area.

The corps initially planned to issue a permitting decision early next year. The agency fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

“The approval of the Enbridge Line 5 reroute application is a great success and will advance the President’s energy dominance agenda for America," Adam Telle, assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, said in a statement.

The corps released an environmental analysis in May that concluded tunnel construction would protect the pipeline but the work could destroy wetlands and archeological sites, harm bat habitats, disturb aquatic life, mar lake vistas and potentially trigger an underwater explosion.

The corps still issued Enbridge a permit, saying Wednesday that the application complied with all applicable federal laws and regulations.

Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Enbridge now needs only a permit from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to begin the $500 million-plus project. Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the application.

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, a channel linking Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.

[TITLE]Cabinet signs off on multi-billion euro plan to upgrade public transport across Cork city:
[TEXT]
THE GOVERNMENT HAS officially approved BusConnects Cork, a multibillion-euro overhaul of the city’s bus and cycling network that promises faster, greener and more reliable public transport for residents.

The move clears the way for the National Transport Authority (NTA) to submit planning applications to An Coimisiún Pleanála next year for the construction of new bus corridors and active travel routes.

It’s anticipated that delivery of the programme will range from between €2.3 billion and €3.5 billion.

The programme, developed following extensive public consultation, will deliver 11 ‘Sustainable Transport Corridors’, spanning 90km of new bus lanes and 95km of segregated cycle tracks, along with new bus shelters and a zero-emission fleet.

The plans also include a cashless ticketing system for buses.

Transport Minister Darragh O’Brien said the project would be “transformative” for Cork, enabling an additional 13,000 people to reach the city centre by public transport within 30 minutes of leaving home.

“BusConnects Cork will make it faster and easier to get to school, work, or visit family and friends. And by reducing congestion, it will make our streets safer for all,” he said.

Minister of State and Cork native Jerry Buttimer described the scheme as “a game-changer” for how people move around the city.

“There will of course be challenges, as with any ambitious project, but the benefits for Cork and its residents will be considerable,” Buttimer said.

According to the NTA, the redesigned network will provide over 50% more bus services across the city, including two new 24-hour routes running east-west and north-south.

The project is part of the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (CMATS) 2040, which aims to create an integrated, sustainable transport network to support Cork’s projected population growth.

Hugh Creegan, interim CEO of the NTA, described the project as “a significant step forward” for sustainable transport in Cork.

“The BusConnects programme will deliver a cleaner, faster and more efficient system, improving journey times, reducing congestion, and supporting the city’s growth,” Creegan added.

The NTA expects to submit the full planning documentation in 2026, with delivery of the programme to follow once procurement is complete.

Even at its upper cost estimate, the project’s benefit-to-cost ratio stands at 1.5 — meaning for every €1 spent, it is expected to return €1.50 in social and economic benefits.

Labour councillor Peter Horgan, chair of Cork City Council’s transport committee, welcomed the announcement but called for the immediate publication of the final plans.

“The people of Cork deserve to see the full details now that Cabinet has signed off,” he said.

Once complete, BusConnects Cork will represent the largest investment in public transport in the city’s history.

[TITLE]Saab considers Canada as site for Gripen jet assembly to meet demand from Ukraine:
[TEXT]
OTTAWA — The Swedish defence firm Saab is considering Canada as a place to assemble Gripen fighter jets as it moves to quickly ramp up production to meet demand from Ukraine.

Saab’s CEO Micael Johansson said in recent interviews with financial news publications that Kyiv’s interest in purchasing more than 100 Gripen fighter jets would double the defence company’s production requirements.

The Financial Times and the Reuters news agency reported Johansson said the company is searching for ways to expand production capacity, possibly in Canada or elsewhere in Europe.

On the sidelines of the Canadian Aerospace Summit in Ottawa, Industry Minister Mélanie Joly told The Canadian Press Wednesday this is “good news” and that she spoke with Johansson earlier in the day.

“I’ve been actively working with Saab to see what can be done to do more partnerships with Canada, and it starts with the Global Eye (surveillance plane), but also we’re willing to see what we can do to help support Ukraine,” she said.

The Global Eye, a long-range early warning surveillance aircraft, is jointly manufactured by Saab and Bombardier.

“We’re always willing to be able to have more foreign direct investments in Canada,” Joly said. “We see eye to eye when it comes to our position on Europe’s security and Ukraine, and we see eye to eye on the importance of our aerospace sector, and so I think there’s a great partnership between Canada and Sweden that we can further.”

Simon Carroll, president of Saab Canada, said in a media statement to The Canadian Press on Wednesday the firm “views Canada and its formidable aerospace industry as an important market to support a significant increase in global demand.”

“We’re continuing to grow and develop our relationships with Canadian companies to support our programs and products for Canada and for the export market,” he said.

The company would not say who it is speaking with

[TITLE]Boeing pushes 777X jet deliveries to 2027 amid certification delays:

Boeing on Wednesday reported mixed third-quarter results, with higher aircraft deliveries and a growing order backlog offset by certification delays for its 777X jet

Boeing reported mixed third-quarter results on Wednesday, as higher aircraft deliveries and a growing backlog of orders were offset by continued certification delays for its 777X jets.

CEO Kelly Ortberg said the first delivery of its next generation of long-haul, wide-body jets is now expected in 2027 instead of 2026, resulting in a $4.9 billion charge in the quarter through September. But Ortberg emphasized in a call with analysts that the delays stemmed from the certification process, and not from any newly discovered technical issues.

“While we are disappointed in the 777 delays, it shouldn't overshadow the progress we're making," he said.

Ortberg said Boeing was making progress on stabilizing its production. The aerospace giant delivered 160 planes in the third quarter, the most quarterly deliveries since 2018. The same time last year, Boeing said it delivered 116 planes.

Boeing also reported that its backlog of orders, including 5,900 commercial planes, had grown to $636 billion in the third quarter.

“There’s strong demand in our products,” Ortberg said in an interview Wednesday morning with CNBC.

In September, the Federal Aviation Administration restored Boeing's ability to perform final safety checks and certify 737 Max jets for flight more than six years after two crashes of the then-new aircraft killed 346 people.

That decision was followed by the FAA's move this month to raise Boeing's 737 Max production limit that it had set in January 2024, after a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines jet. Boeing is now allowed to build 42 Max jets per month, up from 38, and Ortberg said Wednesday that the company expects to raise that cap further once it demonstrates to the FAA that it can do so safely.

If the FAA approves future production boosts, Ortberg said, they'd come in increments of five jets and wouldn't happen more than once every six months.

“We won’t move to higher rates until we reach stability and readiness,” he said.

Boeing also reported $238 million in free cash flow, marking its first cash flow-positive quarter since 2023. But that figure was partly boosted by a delay in a potential $700 million payment to the Justice Department, part of a still-pending deal under consideration by a federal judge that could spare Boeing from criminal prosecution in the two deadly 737 Max crashes.

The crashes off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia happened less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 and were later blamed on a new software system that Boeing developed for the aircraft.

Meanwhile, a strike was ongoing at three Midwest plants in the St. Louis area.

[TITLE]Bridger Aerospace Secures $331 Million in New Financing Commitments to Fuel Growth and Fleet Expansion:
[TEXT]
BELGRADE, Mont., Oct. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings, Inc. (“Bridger”, “the Company” or “Bridger Aerospace”), (NASDAQ: BAER, BAERW), one of the nation’s largest aerial firefighting companies, today announced a significant financial milestone with a new senior secured facility of up to $331.5 million led by Bain Capital’s Private Credit Group (“Bain Capital”). In addition, in a separate announcement filed yesterday, the Company said it finalized its previously announced sale-leaseback of its Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport campus facilities.

Together, these transactions refinance Bridger’s $160 million municipal bond with Gallatin County, consolidate the Company’s existing debt, and provide significant capacity and financial flexibility through a delayed draw facility designed to fund future fleet expansion.

“This financing marks a turning point for Bridger,” Sam Davis, Bridger’s CEO shared. “Our strong quarterly results and our expectations for a second record year have made it possible for us to refinance our existing debt and enter into a new expanded debt facility with increased capacity. We believe this new facility significantly enhances our ability to grow organically. It provides financial flexibility for new aircraft purchases to support contract expansion that will drive EBITDA growth and long-term shareholder value. Bridger’s federal, state, and defense contracts have established our revenue model on a year-round basis. As a result, this financing and the simultaneous sale-leaseback of our campus demonstrates Bridger’s focus on financial resilience to address the evolution of our business.”

The $331.5M Senior Secured Credit Facility consists of a $21.5M Revolving Credit Facility, $210M Senior Secured Term Loan, and a $100M Fleet Expansion Facility.

Davis added. “As we expand our contracts and optimize our fleet, we are grateful for our strategic partners Bain Capital, Crestline, Power Sustainable, and Foundation Credit who are helping us take decisive steps towards making our vision for Bridger Aerospace a reality. Bridger continues to build on its long-term vision, and we believe this financing strengthens our ability to innovate and deploy the most advanced technology in our industry; yet, most importantly, this transaction equips us to continue delivering on our mission to protect lives, property, critical infrastructure, and the environment.”

“We are proud to support Bridger’s next phase of growth as they continue to lead the way in innovative wildfire solutions,” said David Healey, a Managing Director at Bain Capital. “Our investment reflects our confidence in the Company’s long-term vision, leadership, and ability to deliver value-added and mission-critical services to federal, state, and local governments while helping to revolutionize how our country fights wildfire.”

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated served as Sole Debt Placement Agent and Financial Advisor on the transaction, and Crestline Direct Finance, L.P. (“Crestline”) served as Joint Lead Arranger on the transaction.
