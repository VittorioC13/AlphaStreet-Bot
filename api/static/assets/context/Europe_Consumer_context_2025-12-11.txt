With interest rates edging lower and cash returns softening, investors are once again turning to the share market for dependable income.

The good news is that there are many high-quality ASX dividend shares that are trading at attractive levels right now.

Here are five ASX dividend shares worth a closer look this month.

BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP)

BHP remains one of Australia's most reliable dividend payers thanks to its world-class operations in iron ore, copper, and metallurgical coal. While commodity prices move in cycles, BHP's low-cost mines and strong balance sheet allow it to generate significant free cash flow even during softer periods.

With demand for copper and steel expected to rise over the coming decade, driven by electrification, renewables, and infrastructure investment, BHP looks well placed to continue rewarding shareholders with healthy distributions.

The market is expecting a 3.4% dividend yield from BHP's shares in FY 2026.

Sonic Healthcare Ltd (ASX: SHL)

Another ASX dividend share that could be a buy is Sonic Healthcare. It is a global leader in pathology and diagnostic imaging, operating across Australia, Europe, and the United States.

After a tough period, the market is expecting dividends to grow steadily over the next few years as operating conditions stabilise and acquisitions contribute more meaningfully to earnings.

The consensus estimate is for a dividend yield of 4.6% in FY 2026.

Super Retail Group Ltd (ASX: SUL)

Super Retail is the owner of Supercheap Auto, Rebel, BCF, and Macpac brands. The company's strong balance sheet, loyal customer base, and ability to manage inventory have supported healthy dividend payouts for many years.

The good news is that despite cost-of-living pressures impacting the retail sector, this trend is expected to continue in the near term. The market is expecting a dividend yield of 4.5% from Super Retail's shares in FY 2026.

Transurban Group (ASX: TCL)

Transurban is one of the ASX's top income stocks. Its toll roads span Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and North America, providing inflation-linked revenue streams and extremely high barriers to entry.

As traffic volumes increase and new projects come online, its cash flow is expected to rise and support increasing dividends. This is expected to underpin a 4.6% dividend yield in FY 2026.

Woolworths Group Ltd (ASX: WOW)

Woolworths isn't the highest-yielding stock on the market, but its dividends are among the most dependable. Supermarket spending remains resilient through all stages of the economic cycle, giving Woolworths a stable earnings base.

For investors prioritising reliability over high volatility, it is hard to overlook this stock. Woolworths shares are expected to provide investors with a 3.2% dividend yield in FY 2026.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced a $12 billion farm aid package Monday — a boost to farmers who have struggled to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs after the president raised tariffs on China as part of a broader trade war.

He unveiled the plan Monday afternoon at a White House roundtable with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, lawmakers from farm states, and farmers who thanked him for the help.

“With this bridge payment, we’ll be able to farm another year,” Iowa farmer Cordt Holub told Trump during the event.

Rollins put the immediate value of the program at $11 billion — money that the White House said will offer one-time payments to row-crop farmers. Another $1 billion will be put aside for specialty crops as the administration works to better understand the circumstances for those farmers, Rollins said. The aid will move by the end of February, she said.

“We looked at how they were hurt, to what extent they were hurt,” Trump said, explaining how the administration came up with the size of the package. Trump said the money for the program will come from tariff revenue.

Later this month, the USDA will use a formula that estimates production costs to come up with a per-acre payment for each type of crop. Payments will be capped at $155,000 per farm or person, and only entities that make less than $900,000 a year will be eligible for aid. That will limit payments to large farms, which was a criticism of farm aid Trump delivered in his first term.

Farmers have backed Trump politically, but his aggressive trade policies and frequently changing tariff rates have come under increasing scrutiny because of the impact on the agricultural sector and because of broader consumer worries.

The aid is the administration’s latest effort to defend Trump’s economic stewardship and answer voter angst

[TITLE]Johnvents, Ondo reaffirm investment in agribusiness, manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Johnvents Group has reaffirmed its commitment to deepening partnerships, investing in capacity, and building industries that will accelerate Nigeria’s economic transformation and boost Africa’s global competitiveness.

The resolve came as the Ondo State Government restated its ambition to position the state as a competitive hub for agribusiness, manufacturing, technology, and energy.

According to a statement, the Johnvents Group’s leadership gave the assurance during the company’s 2025 End-of-Year Celebration held at The Dome, Akure, where industry leaders, international partners, traditional rulers, including the Deji of Akure, and senior government officials gathered to review what the firm described as “a transformative year.”

Delivering the welcome address, Group Executive Director of Johnvents, Tarun Chawla, stated that the organisation had strengthened its operations and expanded its global presence. He noted that the company’s growth was made possible by a supportive business environment provided by the Ondo State Government.

He said, “This year reshaped us as a business. We strengthened our operations, expanded our relevance, and demonstrated what a committed team can achieve when purpose and discipline align. The stability and clarity your administration provides form the foundation on which organisations like ours continue to grow and innovate.”

Chawla appreciated the confidence of partners such as British International Investment, the International Finance Corporation, AFRIEXIM Bank, and other financial institutions in the Group’s long-term vision. He said Johnvents had now become “a global value-chain participant with investments and collaborations spanning Africa, the UAE, Asia, and Europe.”

In his keynote address, the Executive Governor of Ondo State, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, described Johnvents Group as a model of how homegrown enterprises can become global powerhouses without losing touch with their host communities.

Aiyedatiwa noted: “Johnvents stands today as a monument to what focused investment and structured institutional support can achieve. With over ten factories, more than 1,500 direct employees, thousands of benefiting households and an ecosystem of over 5,000 farmers, Johnvents is living proof that prosperity becomes inevitable when ingenuity meets institutional support.”

He listed reforms in ease of doing business, digitisation of government processes, security enhancement, infrastructure expansion, and the work of the Ondo State Development and Investment Promotion Agency as critical pillars of the state’s strategy to strengthen private-sector competitiveness.

The governor noted that the success of companies like Johnvents aligns with the administration’s vision of an inclusive, opportunity-driven economy. “The Johnvents story assures every investor here and across the world that Ondo State is ready for investment, ready for expansion and ready for global competitiveness,” he emphasised.

The event also celebrated the resilience of Johnvents’ workforce and the company’s widening contributions to community development, including education, youth empowerment and agribusiness initiatives.

Johnvents added that it is committed to partnering with local and global institutions, scaling capacity, and building industries that deliver value across Nigeria’s agricultural and manufacturing value chains.

The Group operates seven businesses, including Johnvents Cocoa Factory, Johnvents Trading, Johnvents Foods, Johnvents Industries DMCC, Johnvents Farms, Premium Cocoa Product (Ile-Oluji), and Haven Hauling, spanning production, processing, manufacturing, and trade of commodities and food products in Nigeria and other regions.

[TITLE]Sensex | Nifty | Stock Market highlights 10th Dec 2025: Sensex, Nifty extend losses for 3rd day as fag-end selloff erases gains:
[TEXT]
Stock Market today | Share Market highlights - Find here all the highlights related to Sensex, Nifty, BSE, NSE, share prices and Indian stock markets for 10th Dec 2025

Benchmark stock indices Sensex and Nifty declined for the third straight day on Wednesday to close at a nearly month’s low, dragged by a last-hour selloff in consumer durables, private banks and IT shares.

The 50-share NSE Nifty fell by 81.65 points, or 0.32 per cent, to close at a month’s low of 25,758. In the intraday session, it hit a high of 25,947.65 and a low of 25,734.55.

Among the Sensex constituents, Eternal, Trent, Bharti Airtel, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, UltraTech Cement, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharat Electronics Ltd, Larsen & Toubro and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles were the laggards.

However, Tata Steel, Sun Pharmaceuticals, ITC, NTPC, Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, PowerGrid, and Asian Paints were among the gainers.

“Indian markets mirrored global caution, weighed down by persistent FII outflows, INR weakness, and uncertainty surrounding US-India trade negotiations despite ongoing discussions. In the near term, market direction will be influenced by central bank cues and clarity on trade developments,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Ltd, said.

[TITLE]G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Results and Updates Fiscal 2026 Outlook; Initiates First Ever Quarterly Dividend Program:
[TEXT]
Net Income Per Diluted Share of $1.84 and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Diluted Share of $1.90 for the Third Quarter, Both Exceeding Guidance

Net Sales of $988.6 Million for the Third Quarter

Raises GAAP and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Diluted Share Guidance

Maintains Strong Cash and Availability Position

Introduces First Ever Quarterly Dividend of $0.10 Per Share

NEW YORK, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (NasdaqGS: GIII) (“G-III” or the “Company”) today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, ended October 31, 2025 and announces approval of a quarterly dividend.

Morris Goldfarb, G-III’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We delivered a strong third quarter with gross margins and earnings far exceeding our expectations. This was driven by the strength of our go-forward portfolio, particularly our owned brands, as well as a healthy mix of full-price sales and our mitigation efforts against tariffs. I am pleased with how our brands are resonating with consumers and encouraged by the solid demand we have seen throughout the holiday season to date.”

Mr. Goldfarb concluded, “Looking ahead, we are raising our fiscal 2026 earnings guidance to reflect our third quarter outperformance tempered by the uncertainties around the consumer environment and tariff-related margin pressures. I am extremely proud of our teams for executing on our strategic priorities and delivering strong profitability. With our powerful brand portfolio and best-in-class operating model, we are well-positioned to achieve our fiscal 2026 outlook. Our strong financial profile gives us the ability to return capital directly to stockholders including through our newly initiated dividend program, while also continuing to pursue strategic opportunities to drive profitable growth.”

Results of Operations

Third Quarter Fiscal 2026

Net sales for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025 decreased 9% to $988.6 million compared to $1.09 billion in the prior year’s third quarter.

Net income for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025 was $80.6 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared to $114.8 million, or $2.55 per diluted share, in the prior year’s third quarter.

Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.90 for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025 compared to $2.59 in the same period last year. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share excludes (i) in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, $2.4 million of professional fees related to a potential strategic opportunity that did not come to fruition, (ii) in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, asset impairments of $1.6 million, (iii) in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, $0.5 million in one-time severance expenses related to a closed warehouse and (iv) in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, a $1.6 million write-off of deferred financing costs related to the redemption of our senior secured notes (the “Notes”). The aggregate effect of these exclusions was equal to $0.06 per diluted share in the third quarter of this year and $0.04 per diluted share in last year’s third quarter.

Balance Sheet as of Third Quarter Fiscal 2026

Inventories increased 3% to $547.1 million this year compared to $532.5 million last year.

Total debt decreased 95% to $10.6 million this year compared to $224.2 million last year with the Company ending the quarter in a net cash position of $173.5 million compared to a net debt position of $119.5 million in the same period last year.

Capital Allocation

Share repurchases of 209,851 for $5.4 million were made in the third quarter and 2,158,276 for $49.8 million in the year-to-date period.

G-III announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a new quarterly dividend program to evolve its strategic use of capital. The Board of Directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 29, 2025, to all stockholders of record as of December 15, 2025. The Company intends to pay dividends quarterly in the future, subject to market conditions and approval by the Board of Directors.

Outlook

The Company has updated guidance for fiscal 2026, which reflects the strength of our third-quarter earnings outperformance, along with a disciplined view of the current consumer landscape and the expected effects of tariffs on our top and bottom lines. Based on current tariff rates, the Company anticipates the gross impact of tariffs will now be approximately $135 million. This has been partially offset through vendor participation, strategic sourcing shifts, and targeted price increases. The remaining unmitigated impact, reflected in fiscal 2026 guidance, is now estimated at $65 million.

Fiscal 2026

Net sales are expected to be approximately $2.98 billion (previous guidance $3.02 billion). This compares to net sales of $3.18 billion for fiscal 2025.

Net income is expected to be between $121.0 million and $126.0 million (previous guidance $112.0 million and $122.0 million), or diluted earnings per share between $2.72 and $2.82 (previous guidance $2.53 and $2.73). This compares to net income of $193.6 million, or $4.20 per diluted share for fiscal 2025.

Non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2026 is expected to be between $125.0 million and $130.0 million (previous guidance $113.0 million and $123.0 million), or diluted earnings per share between $2.80 and $2.90 (previous guidance $2.55 and $2.75). This compares to non-GAAP net income of $203.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $4.42 for fiscal 2025.

Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2026 is expected to be between $208.0 million and $213.0 million (previous guidance $198.0 million and $208.0 million) compared to adjusted EBITDA of $325.9 million in fiscal 2025.

Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $1.5 million.

Tax rate for fiscal 2026 is estimated to be 29.5%.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Reconciliations of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income, GAAP net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income per diluted share and GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA are presented in tables accompanying the financial statements included in this release and provide useful information to evaluate the Company’s operational performance. A description of the amounts excluded on a non-GAAP basis are provided in conjunction with these tables. Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

[TITLE]Skims ventures into live entertainment with shoppable TikTok livestream:
[TEXT]

Dive Brief:

Skims, the apparel brand co-founded by Kim Kardashian, made its first venture into live entertainment with “Kimsmas Live!,” a 45-minute holiday livestream event that was broadcast exclusively on TikTok, according to details shared with Marketing Dive.

The live event, held Dec. 3, was hosted by Kardashian and sought to draw inspiration from classic holiday variety shows and was fully shoppable in real time. The livestream featured Skims collections and exclusive holiday deals.

The event was teased ahead of time by Kardashian across social media, including with an animated spot featuring the celebrity and Kris Jenner set to an original jingle. The effort was produced in partnership with OBB Media and marks Skims’ latest effort to tap into pop culture.

Dive Insight:

As Gen Z continues to exert its influence on the holiday shopping season, brands are adopting marketing tactics that meet the cohort where they are spending their time, and that’s on social media. Nine in ten TikTok users are expected to use the app for holiday inspiration and advice, and one quarter of users have purchased or expect to purchase a gift that they saw on the platform, according to TikTok. Further, U.S. social commerce sales are expected to top $100 billion in 2026 and grow to more than $137 billion by 2028, per eMarketer.

“Kimsmas Live!,” which represents the biggest real-time event hosted by Kardashian on her TikTok channel, highlighted the star’s favorite holiday tips and Skims products, including special bundles, and included surprise celebrity guests. The special was executive produced by Michael Ratner, Scott Ratner, Simone Spira and Lana Womack for OBB Media alongside members of the Skims team, and was directed by Emmy Award-winning director Sam Wrench.

“Kimsmas Live! is an opportunity for us to deepen the way we engage our customers,” said Jens Grede, co-founder and CEO, Skims, in release details. “Livestreaming allows us to meet our community where they already are — in real time — and partnering with OBB Media and TikTok lets us build an experience that’s both entertaining and highly shoppable for the holiday season.”

Skims’ holiday livestream continues the brand’s efforts to tap into pop culture. In 2023, Skims entered into a multiyear partnership to become the official underwear of the NBA, WNBA and USA Basketball. Company and league executives characterized that deal as a union of pop culture, entertainment, fashion and sports. More recently, the brand partnered with Nike to create a new brand, NikeSkims, that will include apparel, footwear and accessories.

Other brands have also been making use of TikTok Shop this holiday season, and the platform has been offering a host of incentives, including covering delivery costs and cash rewards, to get retailers and marketers to set up shop on the platform. Those efforts have led several blue-chip companies, including Samsung U.S., Ralph Lauren and the Disney Store, to sign on in advance of the holiday season.

Building on the third quarter’s outperformance as well as the solid start to our fourth quarter, we are raising our full year outlook and are well positioned for a successful holiday season and finish to our fiscal 2025.”

Ms. Super concluded, “With two iconic brands, Victoria’s Secret and PINK, a curated product assortment, high-emotion marketing and a relentless customer focus, we are reinforcing our leadership in global intimates and beauty. As we continue to advance our Path to Potential strategy, we are accelerating global growth, elevating brand distinctiveness, and unlocking greater value across our ecosystem to drive long-term profitable growth.”

Scott Sekella, VS&Co Chief Financial and Operating Officer, said, “Building on strong first-half results, our third quarter exceeded expectations. We delivered robust adjusted gross margin expansion of 170 basis points, driven by a reduced promotional approach and higher regular-priced selling, while leveraging the strength of our business model. We remain focused on managing costs while prioritizing investments in product innovation, brand strength, and customer experience. These efforts, along with the solid operational foundation we have built enables us to scale effectively and support the Company’s growth, giving us confidence in delivering a strong finish to the year and positioning VS&Co for long-term success.”

[TITLE]Suzy Amis Cameron’s Inside Out Grows With Research-led Design and Strategic Acquisitions:
[TEXT]
PARIS — If you’ve followed Suzy Amis Cameron’s work as an early pioneer in sustainable fashion, you know her journey began with Red Carpet Green Dress, the campaign that put eco-conscious design on the map, proving that elegance and ethics could coexist.

But RCGD had limits — it gained attention, but it couldn’t scale the systemic change Amis Cameron wanted.

“Certainly, Red Carpet Green Dress started a big conversation, but it wasn’t making huge impact. I was at this place in my life where I was like, something has to be done, and if there’s a way for me to do that, I will,” she told WWD.

That’s why she closed that chapter in March 2024 and founded the international holding company Inside Out.

“The idea was to build a holding company that reimagines how business interacts with both people and the planet,” Amis Cameron said of the privately backed venture. Inside Out approaches fashion from a biological and psychological perspective, to create what she calls “healthy clothes.”

“Not only are we solution-oriented, we actually have solutions,” she said. “And they are lucrative.”
