[TITLE]Fanatics lands retail and merchandising deal for 2026 FIFA World Cup:
[TEXT]

Fanatics has struck a deal to run retail and merchandising for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the company announced Thursday.

The global competition will see 104 matches played in 16 stadiums across the U.S., Canada and Mexico this coming summer.

"There is no larger sporting event in the entire world than the World Cup … we've been doing a lot of events; this is the biggest one we'll have done yet," said Andrew Low Ah Kee, CEO of Fanatics Commerce, the company's manufacturing and retail arm.

Over the last several years, Fanatics has overseen retail operations at international sporting events like MLB's Tokyo Series, the NFL's slate of international games, the NHL's Four Nations tournament and UEFA's Euro 2024 in Germany. Fanatics was also the retail partner of FIFA's Club World Cup tournament across the U.S. last summer.

As part of its deal with FIFA for the 2026 tournament, Fanatics will oversee the in-venue retail operations across all 16 locations, which are mostly NFL stadiums with seating capacity of more than 60,000 fans.

It will also have retail operations in the parking lot at each stadium, as well as a retail presence at each of FIFA's fan festival locations spread across the host cities. In total, Fanatics is forecasting it will have more than 2,000 point-of-sale locations during the tournament.

"In terms of the logistical complexity of it, it's very real, but I'm confident in our readiness," said Low Ah Kee, adding that Fanatics has already operated in all the venues where the tournament will be held.

While the length of the tournament – 39 days, to accommodate a larger field of 48 nations – could present another layer of complexity compared to one-off events or shorter tournaments, Low Ah Kee said the company is aiming to lean into the momentum that is built during a World Cup, capitalizing on matchups and moments that arise to create quick-strike products and other limited merchandise.

Fanatics has expanded its soccer-focused retail operations in recent years, and is a partner of MLS, a quarter of the Premier League clubs, and several of the biggest club teams across the world like PSG, Inter Milan and Juventus. It's also a partner to several national teams who will be competing, such as Argentina, England, France, Belgium and Germany.

Low Ah Kee said that Fanatics' existing relationships have helped the company better understand soccer fans. That means more fashion-forward products and, specifically, more scarves, Low Ah Kee said.

Fanatics is already in discussion with partners, manufacturers, brands and vendors to make sure that the product stays well stocked for what it expects to be an unprecedented sports retail moment.

"We think this could be a multiple of the biggest events that we've run historically," Low Ah Kee said, declining to share specific figures.

Fanatics' execution of the 2026 World Cup will also set the stage for another massive undertaking: The company will oversee retail operations for the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics.

Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics. NBC Olympics is the U.S. broadcast rights holder to all Summer and Winter Games through 2036. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

[TITLE]Brixton Capital Sells San Diego Grocery-Anchored Plaza, Extending the Run on Retail:

Retail assets are all the rage in Southern California, and an investment firm based in Anaheim is getting its piece of the grocery-anchored pie.

[TITLE]JP Morgan Chase Buys Miami Beach Retail Branch:
[TEXT]
J.P. Morgan Chase bought back its retail banking branch in Miami Beach, paying a threefold premium since its sale 11 years ago.

The finance giant paid $23.5 million for the 25,030-square-foot building at 1801 Alton Road in the Sunset Harbour neighborhood, property records show. The two-story property sits on a 1-acre site, facing Dade Boulevard.

J.P. Morgan Chase purchased the property for $4 million in 2010. Four years later, the current sellers, a Coral Gables-based entity managed by Dominic Cavagnuolo, acquired the building for $8 million.

A representative for the sellers could not be reached, while a spokesperson for J.P. Morgan Chase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, J.P. Morgan Chase’s competitor, Wells Fargo, sold its 6,654-square-foot retail branch next door at 1901 Alton Road for $15 million to the family office of developer Russell Galbut. The developer obtained a $54 million construction loan for a Whole Foods-anchored development, where Wells Fargo will operate a 4,000-square-foot retail location.

J.P. Morgan Chase’s acquisition is also another example of retailers buying the properties they lease. Last year, nearby on Lincoln Road, Alo Yoga paid $17 million for a retail condo, where it plans to open a store and private gym. The activewear brand also bought its boutique in the Miami Design District for $22 million the year prior.

Since 2024, grocer Publix has spent about $345 million buying seven retail centers it anchors in South Florida.

New Delhi: Fitch Ratings Thursday raised India's FY26 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast to 7.4% from 6.9%, citing higher consumer spending driven by strong real income, increased consumer sentiment and the impact of recently implemented goods and services tax reforms.Fitch expects GDP growth to slow to 6.4% in FY27. India's GDP growth surged to a six-quarter high of 8.2% in Q2FY26.The ratings agency sees limited downside for the Indian rupee and expects it to strengthen to 87 per dollar by end-2026 from 88.5 projected for end-2025. The outlook comes a day after the currency hit a record low of 90.29 per dollar before closing at 90.19.It noted that the falling inflation gives the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) room for one more policy rate cut in December to 5.25%, following 100 basis points cut in 2025 so far. Retail inflation fell to a record low of 0.25% in October.RBI's Monetary Policy Committee is slated to announce its policy review on Friday.The agency said it expects the RBI to have reached the end of its easing cycle, and that rates will remain at 5.25% over the next two years with core inflation recovering and activity projected to remain strong.It also highlighted that India faces one of the highest effective tariff rates on its exports to the US (around 35%), and said that a trade deal between the two countries would reduce the tariff rate and "boost external demand".The ratings agency mentioned that private consumer spending is the main driver of growth this year, supported by strong real income dynamics, increased consumer sentiment and the impact of recently implemented GST reforms. Effective September 22, India unveiled sweeping reforms of the GST framework shifting to a two-rate structure of 5% and 18%. The revamp led to a decrease in tax rate of

[TITLE]Irish economy contracts slightly, consumer spending flat but exports continue to grow:
[TEXT]
The Irish economy slipped into contraction in the third quarter of the year, which ended on September 30, according to the latest official data.

The Central Statistics Office says gross domestic product (GDP) fell slightly, by 0.3pc, in Quarter 3. It followed very modest growth in the previous three months, of 0.3pc.

In contrast, the first three months of the year had seen a spike in growth, with GDP up 7.4pc.

Even after that slowdown, and amid the impact of US tariffs, the latest data shows total exports increased by 2.1pc (or €4.4bn) in Q3.

Exports throughout the earlier part of the year had been lifted in particular by the contribution of drug giant Eli Lilly, which manufactures ingredients for its weight loss drug Mounjaro and its diabetes drug Zepbound in Kinsale, Co Cork. The latest data may be a sign dramatic growth in the value of products shipped by Eli Lilly, including to the US, has started to moderate at elevated levels, although it is early to draw firm conclusions.

The latest numbers show imports rose much faster than exports in Q3, they are up €14.7bn versus the previous three months.

Measuring Ireland’s economy in any meaningful way is fraught. GDP is the standard measure used to compare economies but in the case of Ireland is volatile because of the outsized impact of multinationals.

The latest CSO data shows modified domestic demand (MMD), which is a broad measure of underlying domestic activity covering personal, government, and investment spending, grew by 2.3pc.

The latest data shows personal spending on goods and services, a good guide to how well off people feel and how they are behaving, grew by 0.1pc in the three months to the end of September – that’s effectively flat even at a time when the costs of goods and services themselves was higher – CSO data for the same period showed annualised inflation running at around 2.7pc.

Looked at compared to a year earlier the picture is more positive – modified final domestic demand grew by 5.1pc.

One factor potentially weighing on spending was a drop in the overall level of pay in the economy. Compensation of Employees (CoE), which includes wages as well such as bonuses and allowances, decreased in real terms by 0.1pc in Q3 2025 compared with Q2 2025.

The loss of spending power happened even though unemployment remains very low by historic standards, did tick up modestly in the summer.

[TITLE]Fitch ups India's FY'26 GDP growth forecast to 7.4% on better consumer spending, GST reforms:
[TEXT]
Fitch Ratings on Thursday raised India's GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7.4 per cent, from 6.9 per cent, on increased consumer spending and improved sentiment boosted by GST reforms.

It said falling inflation gives the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) room for one more policy rate cut in December to 5.25 per cent, following 100 bp of cuts in 2025 so far.

Fitch said GDP growth accelerated further in the July-September quarter to 8.2 per cent, from 7.8 per cent in the April-June quarter.

"Growth will ease over the remainder of the financial year 2025-26 (to end-March), but we have raised our full-year growth forecast to 7.4 per cent, from 6.9 per cent in September," Fitch said in its Global Economic Outlook report for December.

Private consumer spending is the main driver of growth this year, supported by strong real income dynamics, increased consumer sentiment, and the impact of recently implemented goods and services tax (GST) reforms.

Effective September 22, GST on about 375 items has been slashed, making over 99 per cent of consumption items cheaper.

Fitch expects GDP growth to slow to 6.4 per cent in FY'27.

It projected private investment to pick up in the second half of the next fiscal (2026-27) as financial conditions loosen.

Consumer price inflation fell to an all-time low of 0.3 per cent in October, driven by lower food and drink prices.

"We expect falling inflation should give the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) room for one more policy rate cut in December to 5.25 per cent, following 100bp of cuts in 2025 so far, and a series of reductions in the cash reserve ratio (from 4 per cent to 3 per cent)," Fitch said.

RBI's monetary policy committee is slated to announce its policy review on Friday.

With core inflation recovering and activity projected to remain strong, Fitch said that it expects the RBI to have reached the end of its easing cycle, and that rates will remain at 5.25 per cent over the next two years.

[TITLE]How surface texture affects consumers’ willingness to pay: Evidence from smartphone covers:
[TEXT]
Abstract This study investigates the impact of tactile impressions on consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for smartphone covers with varying surface textures. While prior research has examined visual and auditory cues in consumer behavior, the commercial relevance of surface texture remains underexplored. Therefore, we analyze how WTP varies across texture types and reference price conditions and examine the demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors influencing valuation. Data were collected from 387 respondents at a major shopping mall, where participants evaluated four surface textures (A–D) under two reference prices (100 yen and 1,000 yen). Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was used to assess associations between consumer characteristics and WTP. The results show that WTP increases with higher reference prices, indicating a price anchoring effect. Men, unmarried individuals, and those exhibiting hyperbolic discounting demonstrated higher WTP for certain textures. However, risk preference, smartphone usage, and impatience were not significant predictors. These findings suggest that firms can position textured products at premium price points and employ sensory

Food Processing Secretary A P Das Joshi on Thursday asked corporates to invest more in the sector to enhance the processing level from the current low of 12 per cent and also boost exports of processed food items.Addressing a CII event here, the secretary emphasised the need to dispel the myth that processed food is inherently bad.He also highlighted that the labour codes would benefit the sector.Joshi said that the issues related to the HFSS (High fat, sugar, salt) and FOPNL (Front-of-pack nutrition labelling) are under "very, very active consideration of the government" and there could be some decision in the near future.He was addressing a session on 'Scaling Food Processing for Rural Prosperity and Jobs' organised as part of the CII IndiaEdge 2025."We have 24 lakh units across the country, and only 2 per cent are organised. I look forward to a higher level of investment from the captains of the industry," Joshi said, adding that there is a huge scope for FDI and private domestic investment.He also emphasised the need for formalisation of the informal."Whatever you process ultimately comes from lakhs of farmers. So whenever we are doing the value addition, a part of it goes to the farmers. So rural prosperity, it is necessary that we increase the processing level. We process hardly 12 per cent of our food.

[TITLE]‘When I’m young and going out a lot, I don’t want to worry about putting on weight’:
[TEXT]
Everyone knows that alcohol can cause weight gain, particularly beer, sugary cocktails and creamy liqueurs. But while the most likely action for anyone trying to lose a few pounds would be to cut down on the amount of alcoholic drinks they consume, some people are doing the opposite and are cutting down their food intake in order to increase their “alcohol allowance”. This practice appears to be particularly prevalent among students and young adults.

Two students, Sarah and Aisling, are no strangers to food restricted alcohol consumption (FRAC), and say most of their friends do it as a means of staying slim and “not having to worry

[TITLE]Caitlin Clark Rakes In $16 Million Due To Sponsorships, 10x More Than $114,000 WNBA Salary:
[TEXT]
How should I say this? … *clears throat* … CHA-CHING!

Indiana Fever superstar Caitlin Clark is absolutely cashing in on sponsorships.

The most notable has to be her 8-year, $28 million deal with Nike in 2024 that includes her own signature shoe line.

Nike’s not the only one throwing money at her, however. (RELATED: Lane Kiffin Is Big Fat Liar, Police Say)

According to Sportico, Clark’s endorsement money has blown past $16 million — more than 10× her WNBA paycheck.

“$16 million from sponsors and $114,000 from her W playing salary and bonuses. In percentage terms, it’s 99.3% from endorsements and 0.7% from the WNBA,” reported Sportico.

Clark‘s current sponsors include State Farm, Gatorade, Xfinity, Lilly, Gainbridge, Panini America, Hy-Vee and Wilson. Nike named her its newest signature athlete in August, unveiling a personal logo, an upcoming apparel and sportswear collection, and a signature shoe slated for release in 2026.

Caitlin Clark may have struggled on-court this season but off-court she crushed it 💰 Clark has more than 10 sponsors that made up 99% of her total 2025 earnings of $16.1 million. Her WNBA salary and bonuses totaled $114,000. Full story: https://t.co/hlDMdB3tSh pic.twitter.com/b2ddEXNRdP — Sportico (@Sportico) December 4, 2025

I don’t know why, but I was under the impression that Caitlin Clark was making more money than this. Though don’t get me wrong, I’m not sneezing at $16 million, it’s a lot more than I ever anticipate making in my life. But I could’ve sworn she was pulling in more than this.

Crazy how far she’s come though.

I personally got tired of Caitlin Clark and the WNBA, I don’t have enough fan-width for it anyways, but good for the girl … get that money!

[TITLE]PVH Stock Drops 11.8% as Wall Street Waits for Fundamentals to Improve:
[TEXT]
Updated 4:13 p.m. ET Dec. 4

Wall Street is still waiting for PVH Corp. to take off.

Shares of the company fell 11.8 percent to $77.21 on Thursday, after the company beat its third-quarter earnings estimates, but didn’t raise its outlook for the year, signaling that business will be spread out between the two quarters.

“PVH shares look cheap, but they sure aren’t making it easy for value investors to step in,” said Tom Nikic, an analyst at Needham. “Trends continue to be very volatile.”

The Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent company saw third-quarter revenues increase 2 percent to $2.3 billion, making for a drop of less than 1 percent in constant currencies. PVH expects revenues to be flat to slightly positive for the year, in constant currencies.

Nikic zeroed in on the company’s “negative inflection” in the Europe, Middle East and Africa division, which trended down 2 percent in constant currencies.

“This was expected to be one of the growth drivers of the business following last year’s reset of the market — a gross margin miss didn’t help either,” the analyst said. “We continue to believe that shares are too cheap, particularly since they can probably buy back a high-single-digit percent of the float annually at these levels, if not more.

“Third-quarter gross margin was down 200 basis points, missing guidance by 25 basis points, driven by tariffs (110 basis point negative impact), the impact of bringing licenses in-house (50 basis points) and higher promotional mix, partially due to the … Calvin Klein product shipment delays,” he said.

PVH has been busy taking back licenses for its North American wholesale business from G-III Apparel Group, absorbing some of the businesses and finding other licensees for some categories, including dresses.

In conjunction with that take-back, the company set up a “global product kitchen” for Calvin Klein in New York, a complicated switch that had an uneven start.

Stefan Larsson, chief executive officer, told analysts on a conference call Thursday that the “delays from the transitory Calvin global product challenges put extra strain on our European distribution center, impacting shipments for both Calvin and Tommy, which made us lose a few critical weeks of full-price selling.”

But Larsson, who’s been busy remaking the company since stepping into the corner office in 2021, suggested it was growing pains the company was feeling.

“We are on track both from on-time delivery coming into spring ’26 and the margin recapture that we set out to take back. On both fronts, we are on track, which is really good,” he said. “It’s painful now, but we had to do it because in order to build premium products, differentiated product franchises with innovation, we need the global capability to do that. And now we have it for both Calvin and Tommy. And so do all of our best competitors in the premium space also have it. But we had to build that. And now you start to see it.”

But Wall Street is still waiting.

Matthew Boss, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said: “While we see multiyear brand ‘unlock’ underway with the new leadership team focused on driving increased desirability of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands through improved product design and marketing, we see an elongated path to reaching management’s mid-teens operating margin target given a slower top-line recovery with continued macroeconomic challenges globally, in addition to a competitive external promotional backdrop, and foreign exchange pressures.”

This year, PVH expects its adjusted operating margin to come in at about 8.5 percent.

[TITLE]Béis and Chipotle Collaborate on 11-piece ‘To Go’ Collection of Travel Essentials:
[TEXT]
Béis and Chipotle Mexican Grill have come together just in time for the holiday season. The travel brand and restaurant company have partnered on an 11-piece capsule collection of travel essentials, available beginning at 6 a.m. PT on the Béis app and at 9 a.m. PT on Béis official website on Monday.

“We’re longtime Chipotle fans here at Béis and were excited to approach clever design in a new, fresh way through this collaboration,” Adeela Hussain Johnson, Béis chief executive officer, said in a statement.

“Our goal was simple: create elevated silhouettes inspired by real Chipotle takeout habits that become an authentic part of superfans’ rotation. We’ve taken the function and the art of carrying your essentials to the next level. After all, during the busy holiday season and beyond, having your Chipotle burritos and bowls with you hands-free is a must.”

Ranging in price from $18 to $378, the Béis x Chipotle collaboration features a range of travel products from The Pepper Key Charm to The Chipotle Rollers, available in carry-on and large sizes. Luggage covers, a tote bag and a Chipotle-inspired Burrito Holder Sling feature in the collection, too.

Béis and Chipotle make this new collection even tastier with an exclusive deal — the first 5,000 orders placed in the U.S. and Canada will include a free entrée code from Chipotle to enjoy while on-the-go during the busy holiday season. Orders placed by Dec. 16 will be delivered by the Christmas holiday.

“Chipotle is the last stop on the way to the airport and the first stop after touchdown for many of our fans,” Chris Brandt, president and chief brand officer of Chipotle, said in a statement. “Chipotle To-Go reflects a relatable fan truth: comfort travels with you,” Brandt said.

Béis x Chipotle Courtesy of Béis

“Whether it’s ordering the same Chipotle bowl you’ve had since high school or tucking a sentimental memento into your carry-on, this collection turns familiar rituals into stylist function.”

The “To Go” collection marks the first partnership of its kind between Béis and Chipotle, but both brands have maintained a steady roster of collaborators over the last year. In the lead-up to the 2025 back-to-school season, Chipotle partnered with Urban Outfitters on a limited-edition apparel collection and Wonderskin on the “Lipotle” lip stain kit.

Béis, meanwhile, has partnered with the likes of Rare Beauty, Gap and Lonely Ghost over the last year for unique innovations on and collections of travel essentials.

[TITLE]Nike reshapes C-suite to speed digital shift:
[TEXT]
Nike Inc. is restructuring its senior leadership team as the company works to simplify decision-making, strengthen digital capabilities and regain momentum in key markets.

In a note to employees, CEO Elliott Hill said the company designed the changes to “remove layers” and improve execution under Nike’s “Win Now” strategy.

At the center of the overhaul is an executive vice president and chief operating officer (COO) role that Nike has newly created. Venkatesh “Venky” Alagirisamy, currently chief supply chain officer, will step into the position Dec. 8. He will oversee technology along with supply chain, planning, operations, manufacturing and sustainability — consolidating end-to-end operations under one leader.

Nike is No. 13 in the Top 2000. The database is Digital Commerce 360’s ranking of the largest North American online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales. In the database, Nike is the highest-ranking Apparel & Accessories retailer.

Nike’s new chief operating officer role changes C-suite, leadership team structure

Hill said Nike intends for the move to better integrate digital tools across how the retailer designs, makes, distributes and sells products.

The reshuffling eliminates two positions from the Nike senior leadership team. Muge Dogan, chief technology officer, will leave the company as it removes the chief technology officer (CTO) role. Craig Williams, executive vice president and chief commercial officer, is also departing as Nike dissolves the chief commercial officer (CCO) title.

To sharpen regional responsiveness, Nike is elevating its geography leaders to report directly to Hill.

Those reporting to him are:

Angela Dong (Greater China)

Carl Grebert (EMEA)

Tom Peddie (North America)

Cathy Sparks (Asia Pacific/Latin America)

The reorganization also shifts global sales and Nike Direct — spanning digital commerce and retail stores — under EVP and chief financial officer (CFO) Matt Friend. Hill said aligning commercial operations with strategy and capital allocation ensures consumer insights more directly guide investment decisions.

“This move is about growth and offense — giving Sales and Nike Direct an even stronger voice in how we set strategy and invest,” Hill wrote.

The changes extend Nike’s broader cost-reduction and operational streamlining efforts following uneven performance and intensifying competition across both sport and lifestyle categories. Hill emphasized urgency as the company seeks to restore momentum.

“We need everyone pushing forward with focus, speed, collaboration and urgency,” he said.

[TITLE]India’s e-commerce growth continues to outpace global market: Elara Capital:
[TEXT]
India’s e-commerce continued to outperform global markets in the September quarter, according to analysis by Elara Capital. It noted that while US online sales grew by about 5-6 per cent year-on-year while Indian online sales continued to grow double-digit.

Karan Taurani, Executive Vice-President, Elara Capital noted in a sector update report, “India’s digital commerce flywheel continues to outperform global markets, with e-commerce and quick commerce growing faster than in the US. While US online sales rose ~5-6 per cent YoY, India continues in double digits with robust trajectory fuelled by quick commerce channel driving user expansion and regional penetration.

He added that advertising is also shifting in India to digital mediums as brands chase high-ROI performance channels, directly benefiting ad-tech players such as Affle, with direct customer relations.

“Despite solid momentum, India’s category penetration is far below US levels, offering one of the largest multi-year growth runways globally across apparel, electronics, GM and beauty,” he added.

Taurani added that India’s e-commerce maturity curve trails the US and China by 10–12 years. “ This offers a compelling long-term growth as these mature markets growth plateaus. In the near term, India’s e-commerce expansion will be driven by the rise of quick commerce and mass-commerce,” he added.

Global e-commerce was steady in the third quarter of CY25, with US online sales being 5 per cent year-on-year with penetration at about 16-17 per cent, the report noted.
