[TEXT]
Mars Inc. announced Tuesday that its ten Mars Snacking factories across Europe are now operating entirely on renewable energy sources. The move is a significant step in the company's broader sustainability and decarbonization efforts, which aim for net-zero emissions by 2050.

The shift to renewable power follows a decade of investments in the company's European manufacturing facilities. According to the company, these investments include over $1.6 billion (€1.5 billion) spent over the past five years. The company's strategy involved both direct investments in energy reduction and conversion, as well as the purchase of Guarantees of Origin (GO) certificates to cover remaining electricity and natural gas consumption.

The ten factories are located in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom. These facilities collectively produce approximately 900,000 metric tons of popular confectionery brands annually, including SNICKERS, TWIX, and M&M'S. Around 85% of this production is distributed for consumption within the European region.

This transition comes amid a wider push across the food and beverage industry to reduce its carbon footprint and address consumer demand for more sustainable practices. Many companies are facing pressure from investors and regulators to align their operations with global climate goals. The sourcing of renewable energy, either through direct investment in projects like wind farms or through the purchase of energy certificates, has become a common strategy for corporations to lower their operational emissions.

"At Mars, we believe that the world we want tomorrow starts with how we do business today," said Marc Carena, Regional President for Mars Wrigley. "Therefore, we measure our success not only by financial results, but also by the positive impact we have on people, the planet, and society. Sustainability makes good business sense and is at the heart of our strategy."

The company stated that this development is a key part of its global strategy to achieve its net-zero target by 2050. Mars plans to invest an additional $1.1 billion (€1 billion) in its European manufacturing operations by the end of 2026. This investment is aimed at supporting innovation, economic growth, and the development of modern, energy-efficient infrastructure.

[TITLE]Indonesia: Palm oil sellers fear new barriers after EU deal – DW – 09:
[TEXT]
After nearly a decade of negotiations between Jakarta and Brussels, a new free trade pact will let Indonesia sell its palm oil in the EU with zero tariffs. But other obstacles are looming.

The European Union and Indonesia opened "an exciting new chapter" in trade this week, with the Indonesia-EU Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IEU-CEPA) being signed in Bali following years of diplomatic wrangling.

Palm oil exports have proven to be the most contentious issue during the talks. EU officials point out that producing palm oil is a major driver of deforestation and pollution. The trade dispute spilled into the arena of diplomacy and chilled ties between Jakarta and Brussels.

Recent global trade uncertainty, combined with US tariffs on countries in Europe and Asia, seem to have finally pushed the talks across the finish line. Brussels and Jakarta now hope to see the accord go into effect by 2027, allowing around 80% of Indonesia's exports to enter the EU tariff-free.

Although the new IEU-CEPA framework allows the European Union to buy Indonesia's palm oil at zero tariffs, this deal alone is not enough to guarantee smooth exports to Europe.

What's next after Indonesia's zero-tariffs deal with EU?

Starting in December, the European Union will demand palm oil imports to comply with the bloc's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), a new legal framework aimed at fighting deforestation worldwide.

Exporters, including those in Indonesia, will be required to carry out due diligence and provide documentation proving that their palm oil did not come from recently deforested areas.

Though major companies may be able to deliver the necessary export certificates, smallholders — who control over 42% of Indonesia's palm oil plantations — are likely to struggle, risking exclusion from supply chains. Without proper support, this imbalance could leave independent farmers marginalized and likely weakened in any land conflicts with big corporations.

Small palm farmers likely to bear the brunt

Eddy Martono, chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI), praised the IEU-CEPA deal as a vital gateway to global markets, but told DW that there would be further obstacles related to the EUDR.

"For large companies, especially GAPKI members, EUDR is not a major problem. The real challenge lies with smallholders, as the government has yet to provide clear rules regarding their land cultivation," Eddy said.

Eddy also called for a national traceability system in Indonesia, which would also be recognized by the EU, as a tool to minimize export rejection.

"When tariff barriers are gone but nontariff rules like EUDR are unmet, the zero-tariff facility becomes meaningless," he said.

Global markets 'wide open' with IEU-CEPA

Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), also warned that the EUDR could emerge as a significant barrier.

"What companies see as additional costs, European consumers view as necessities," Bhima told DW Indonesia.

"In tariff terms, Indonesia can now compete more strongly with other vegetable oil producers. But environmental standards must not be seen as obstacles. With IEU-CEPA, the door to global markets is already wide open — certification and due diligence must follow quickly," he said.

EU tracks Indonesia's environmental protection

Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto has told the Antara News Agency that Indonesian palm oil would enjoy zero-tariff access as soon as the agreement takes effect, with no long transition period.

The minister said the deal could lead to greater acceptance for crude palm oil and its derivatives in the European Union, despite lingering stigma over deforestation and regulatory barriers.

The European Union is keeping a close watch on environmental protections in Indonesia. This means exports will face tighter scrutiny, including traceability of plantation origins, and pressure on European importers to prove due diligence.

Danger of 'greenwashing' to hide deforestation

Civil society groups in Indonesia have concerns of their own. WALHI (Friends of the Earth Indonesia) — the country's largest and oldest environmental advocacy organization — and Indonesia for Global Justice (IGJ) have both warned that sustainability certification schemes could simply turn into tools of greenwashing, allowing companies to project a "green" image without making meaningful changes on the ground.

Environmental activists point out that large-scale palm farming destroys biodiversity Image: AFP

The danger is that Indonesian palm oil may pass administrative checks while still leaving behind deforestation, destroying biodiversity, and violating the rights of Indigenous peoples. In other words: palm oil could pass on paper, but continue to damage ecosystems in practice.

IEU-CEPA is more than a trade deal: It is also seen as a test of Indonesia's overall narrative on palm oil.

"If EUDR standards are not met, Indonesia risks being trapped in the negative stigma of palm oil as cheap but environmentally destructive," said Bhima, from the CELIOS think-thank.

Failure, he added, could mean losing access to premium markets, which would in turn force Indonesia to rely on more price-sensitive, lower-value destinations outside the European Union.

Indonesia far behind Malaysia on palm yields

Even with these challenges, the new EU deal gives Indonesia an edge over other ASEAN palm oil exporters, especially Malaysia, which is still negotiating a free-trade deal of its own.

This edge in trade does not automatically translate into market dominance. The Indonesian Ombudsman, an independent state institution that oversees public services, reported that average national palm oil productivity is just 12.8 tons of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) per hectare (around 2.5 acres). This is far below Malaysia's 19 tons per hectare under its Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification, mounting to billions of dollars in loses for Indonesia.

Malaysia's Indigenous Penan struggle against deforestation To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

Malaysia also leads in certification standards and logistics efficiency. Yet Bhima pointed out that all ASEAN producers face the same EUDR hurdle.

"Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines must all prove their palm oil is deforestation-free — but, unlike Indonesia, they don't have the incentive of zero tariffs," he said.

Moving beyond palm oil

Expanding Indonesia's exports of crude palm oil will likely provide opportunities for exports of related products such as biodiesel, palm-based cosmetics and chemicals derived from palm oil. However, experts like Bhima warn that the benefits of the EU deal would only be maximized if Jakarta steps up regarding regulation.

"EUDR remains the ultimate test: Without credible sustainability compliance and a trusted traceability system, zero tariffs will be difficult to utilize," Bhima said.

In the end, IEU-CEPA could be a global springboard for Indonesia's palm oil — or a trap that exposes the industry's unresolved environmental and social weaknesses.

[TITLE]BP and Total deepen commitments to US with major projects:
[TEXT]
By Sheila Dang, Stephanie Kelly and America Hernandez

HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) -European oil and gas majors BP and TotalEnergies on Monday deepened their commitments to the United States, with BP approving a $5 billion offshore oil field and TotalEnergies buying into an onshore gas field.

Higher investment in U.S. oil and gas production aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump's goal to capitalise on the country's hydrocarbon resources.

BP, which currently produces around 2.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, is becoming increasingly reliant on the United States to shore up its oil and gas business following a strategic revamp announced in February to shift spending from renewables to hydrocarbons.

INCREASING US EXPOSURE

BP has vowed to increase its U.S. production to just over 1 million boed by the end of the decade, or just under half of its global target of 2.3 million to 2.5 million boed in that timeframe.

Its $5 billion Tiber-Guadalupe project in the Gulf of Mexico, expected to begin production in 2030, will include a floating 80,000 boed platform to tap into an estimated 350 million boe in recoverable resources, BP said.

BP is considering selling minority stakes in Tiber as well as another fully BP-owned Gulf of Mexico project, Kaskida, sources have told Reuters.

French rival TotalEnergies said on Monday it would buy a 49% stake in Continental Resources' onshore gas fields in the U.S. state of Oklahoma, for an undisclosed sum.

The assets will net it around 150 million standard cubic feet per day of gas by 2030, or

THIS WEEK:

By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)

Scope: This TWTW begins with comments on the EPA Endangerment Finding by Richard Lindzen and William Happer. TWTW continues with a geological paper by Leszek Mark who asserts that the current warming is largely part of a natural cycle. Then TWTW discusses an assertion in the Wall Street Journal that human emissions of carbon dioxide have made the oceans too acidic to be considered healthy.

*********************

EPA Endangerment Finding: On September 22, Richard Lindzen, Professor of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Emeritus, MIT, and William Happer, Professor of Physics, Emeritus, Princeton University, submitted their comments to Administrator Lee Zeldin of the US EPA on the reconsideration of the 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards. The highly accomplished forty-plus-page document is full of scientific evidence contradicting the Endangerment Finding. TWTW cannot adequately summarize it here but will cite some sections that may be of particular interest with the footnotes omitted. After thanking Administrator Zeldin for the opportunity to comment, the opening page states:

We are career physicists with a special expertise in radiation physics, which describes how carbon dioxide and other GHGs affect heat flow in Earth’s atmosphere. We are both members of the National Academy of Sciences. Our CVs are attached.

Our comment focuses on your request for comments as to, “The scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding are weaker than previously believed and contradicted by empirical data, peer-reviewed studies, and scientific developments since 2009 (C-2).”

In our scientific opinion, the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding (“EF”) are fatally flawed science, for two key reasons.

• It fails to consider contradictory science.

• It is not based on science; it is based on unscientific evidence.

Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) will endanger the public health and welfare. Furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself.

Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP.

Scientific details follow.”

After giving a table of contents, the Introduction states:

“The EPA Endangerment Finding is:

‘[T]he Administrator finds that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare. Specifically, the Administrator is defining the ‘air pollution’ referred to in CAA section 202(a) to be the mix of six long-lived and directly-emitted greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).’ * * * ‘The Administrator has considered how elevated concentrations of the well-mixed greenhouse gases and associated climate change affect public health by evaluating the risks associated with changes in air quality, increases in temperatures, changes in extreme weather events, increases in food- and waterborne pathogens, and changes in aeroallergens.’ 74 FR 66,497.

At the outset it is important to understand that carbon dioxide has two relevant properties, as a creator of food and oxygen, and as a greenhouse gas (GHG).

As to food and oxygen, carbon dioxide is essential to nearly all life on earth by creating food and oxygen by photosynthesis. Further, it creates more food as its level in the atmosphere increases. For example, doubling carbon dioxide from today’s approximately 420 ppm to 840 ppm would increase the amount of food available to people worldwide by roughly 40%, and doing so would have a negligible effect on temperature.

As to carbon dioxide as a GHG, the Endangerment Finding is premised on the Net Zero Theory that carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions must be reduced to Net Zero and the use of fossil fuels must be eliminated by 2050 to avoid catastrophic global warming and more extreme weather.

A key premise the EPA has asserted is, ‘The increased concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere and the resulting warming have led to more frequent and more intense heat waves and extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and retreating snow and ice.’

Further, a foundational premise of everything the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) does is that the ‘evidence is clear that carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main driver of climate change,’ where ‘main driver means responsible for more than 50% of the change.’

We demonstrate that the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding and of both the EPA and IPCC premises are fatally flawed science, for two key separate and combined reasons:

First, both fail to consider contradictory science, including:

the physics demonstrates increasing carbon dioxide and other GHGs can only cause negligible warming and cannot, have not and will not cause catastrophic warming.

as a result, increasing GHGs cannot cause increased extreme weather.

that doubling carbon dioxide from today’s level will have a trivial effect on temperature but increase the world’s food supply by 40%.

that eliminating carbon dioxide and fossil fuels will have disastrous effects for Americans, America, the poor and people worldwide.

Second, both are not based on science, and are based on unscientific evidence.

Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that GHGs will endanger the public health and, furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP.

Frankly, we also demonstrate that the Endangerment Finding is a classic example of what Peter Drucker described as government subordinating science to ‘value-judgments that are the reverse of, and largely incompatible with, any criteria one could possibly call scientific.’

Further, our opinion is that science requires urgent action to repeal the Endangerment Finding and other government actions based on it because they are policies that will destroy western economies, impoverish the working middle class, condemn billions of the world’s poorest to continued poverty and increased starvation, leave our children despairing over the alleged absence of a future, and will enrich the enemies of the West who are enjoying the spectacle of our suicide march.

Scientific details follow.”

The comment then goes into a discussion of what is and what is not, science, which TWTW has presented in previous comments by Lindzen and Happer. Section III “The Endangerment Finding Failed to Consider Contradictory Science” begins with:

“The Physics of Carbon Dioxide and GHGs Demonstrates They Cannot and Will Not Cause Catastrophic Warming and Extreme Weather

The Endangerment Finding states:

‘The scientific evidence is compelling that elevated concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are the root cause of recently observed climate change. The IPCC conclusion from 2007 has been re-confirmed by the June 2009 USGCRP assessment that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.’ 74 FR 66,518 (footnote deleted).

As a matter of physics, the scientific evidence cited by the Endangerment Finding from two government organizations, the IPCC and USGCRP, is false science. (Elaborated in section III.B and D).” [These sections are not presented in this TWTW.]

“The five most abundant GHGs are water vapor (H2O), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), and methane (CH4). Water vapor and clouds account “for more than 90% of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat.’ Thus, CO2 and all the other GHGs account for less than 10% of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat and warm the planet.

The Endangerment Finding cites six GHGs: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. 74 FR 66,516. The warming effects of methane and nitrous oxide are also so small that they are irrelevant to climate, as are the latter three.

The physics of carbon dioxide and other GHGs is that they lose their capacity to warm the planet as their concentration in the atmosphere increases because of what is called “saturation,” and according to logarithmic equations. Every doubling of CO2 causes a warming of less than 1° C, to first approximation, 0.75° C (1.4° F). The other GHGs cause only a small fraction of the warming from CO2.

Focusing on the physics of CO2, it becomes a less effective greenhouse gas at higher concentrations.”

Then the comment gives a chart which may be confusing without more explanation and then continues with:

“Most importantly, at today’s CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of approximately 425 parts per million and higher, saturation means that CO2 has little ability to absorb heat and warm the planet. Because of saturation, doubling carbon dioxide from today’s approximately 420 ppm to 840 ppm would increase the amount of food available to people worldwide by roughly 40%, and doing so would have a negligible effect on temperature, 0.75° C (1.4° F).

Saturation means that from now on, CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels and other sources will have little impact on global warming. Since CO2 at today’s level is “saturated,” for this reason alone there is no risk that the continued use of fossil fuels will cause catastrophic global warming and more extreme weather.

Moreover, the mathematics of logarithms can also be applied to temperature increases since the beginning of the Industrial Age in 1750 when carbon dioxide levels were
