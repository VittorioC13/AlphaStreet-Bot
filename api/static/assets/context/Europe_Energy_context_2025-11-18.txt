[TITLE]Greece To Supply Ukraine With US Natural Gas For Winter:
[TEXT]
By Sotiris Nikas

Nov 16, 2025 (Bloomberg) –Ukraine said it’s reached an agreement with Greece that will help secure the supply of natural gas for the coming winter heating season.

Following a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Athens on Sunday, the two sides announced that Greece’s Depa Commercial SA would supply Ukraine’s Naftogaz with US natural gas from December through March.

From the very first days of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Greece has been helping us, working together with Europe and with other partners so that we can reach the conditions under which peace becomes possible. And we truly value your support and your commitment. Today we have an… pic.twitter.com/tN83Mjnamh — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / ????????? ?????????? (@ZelenskyyUa) November 16, 2025

“Ukraine gets direct access to diversified and reliable energy sources, while Greece now becomes a hub for supplying central and eastern Europe with American liquefied natural gas,” Mitsotakis said.

The deal comes as Ukraine races to secure energy for winter after Russian airstrikes in the past month wiped out more than half of its domestic natural gas production. Kremlin forces continue regular attacks on Ukraine’s power infrastructure, causing widespread outages to gas, heating and electricity generation.

Under the framework of the prospective agreement between DEPA and Naftogaz, LNG originating from the US is expected to be transported through “Route 1,” offered jointly by the gas transmission system operators of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, the companies said.

The agreement comes as Greece seeks to become a gas-transportation hub for the region and Europe works toward a complete ban on Russian supplies. Earlier this month, Atlantic See — a subsidiary of Depa and Aktor — signed a deal with Venture Global for the purchase of at least 0.5 million tonnes per year of US liquefied natural gas for 20 years, starting in 2030.

Deliveries of American LNG have already increased, and the southern European country wants to have a key role in importing and exporting LNG via the so-called Vertical Corridor — a project to expand transit capacity for LNG flowing into Greece and moving northward to countries including Romania and Hungary as well as Ukraine.

[TITLE]Five Greek cross-border energy projects set to redraw the Eastern Mediterranean and Eastern Europe map:
[TEXT]
Newsroom November 16 08:56

Five major Greek-led cross-border initiatives are reshaping the energy landscape of the Eastern Mediterranean and Eastern Europe. Greece’s plans to become a regional gateway for energy gained new momentum after a series of agreements—signed in the presence of senior U.S. government officials and energy-sector representatives—during the Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Ministerial Meeting (P-TEC), held in Athens on November 6–7.

The project’s concern:

A new “vertical” natural gas corridor originating in Greece

A long-term agreement to import U.S. LNG and re-export it across the region

The electricity interconnection between Greece and Egypt

A proposal to supply Cyprus with natural gas from Israeli fields

Offshore drilling in the Ionian Sea to explore a potential natural gas target

Environment and Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou told the Athens–Macedonian News Agency (APE):

“The 6th session of the Transatlantic Energy Partnership (P-TEC), which concluded in Athens a few days ago, left a strong geopolitical footprint for Greece and the entire Eastern Mediterranean. This was not a meeting of words and declarations but of concrete agreements and decisions in the energy sector—with results that hold immediate and long-term value.

We capitalized on our country’s unique geographic position, its infrastructure, the clear commitment of the EU and the United States to move away from Russian gas, and Greece’s political and economic stability. As a result, Greece is becoming a gateway for American LNG to Europe and a secure starting point for the new development corridor toward Northeastern and Central Europe, while reducing Turkey’s influence on the new energy map.

Greek energy companies stood shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the world’s largest energy giants, demonstrating credibility and expertise. During P-TEC, they signed agreements of great and multi-layered significance—both for today’s energy landscape and for the decade ahead.

The work continues. We must now implement all agreements swiftly and consistently, strengthening the central artery of growth and stability for our region and for Europe as a whole.”

The Five Projects in Detail

1. The Vertical Gas Corridor

At P-TEC, the gas transmission operators (TSOs) of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine jointly submitted a request to their national energy regulators to approve two new cross-border supply routes—Route 2 and Route 3.

Route 2 will originate at the Alexandroupolis floating LNG terminal, and Route 3 will begin from the transnational TAP pipeline. Route 1, which starts from the Revithoussa LNG terminal, has already been approved.

Approval of the new routes—combined with tariff reductions and upgrades to network capacity—will enable greater volumes of gas to transit through Greece, replacing Russian gas, which under EU decisions must cease flowing to member states by the end of 2027.

These routes will also allow natural gas deliveries to Ukraine.

2. U.S. LNG Supply and Regional Re-Exports

ATLANTIC–SEE LNG TRADE (a joint venture of the AKTOR Group and DEPA Emporia) signed a 20-year agreement with U.S.-based Venture Global to import 0.5–1.5 million tonnes of LNG annually from 2030 onward. This marks Greece’s first long-term LNG supply contract with a major U.S. producer.

The company also signed 20-year Memoranda of Understanding—also beginning in 2030—with Ukraine’s Naftogaz (up to 0.7 million tonnes annually) and with Romania’s NOVA POWER & GAS and Transgaz (up to 1.4 million tonnes annually) for LNG sales.

3. Greece–Egypt Electricity Interconnection

This is a 3,000-MW electricity interconnection that includes 9.5 GW of renewable energy capacity (wind and solar) to be developed in Egypt. The project is led by Elica Interconnector of the Copelouzos Group and is currently undergoing detailed seabed mapping.

According to the company, 60 Greek industrial firms have already signed agreements to purchase power through the interconnector, with roughly one-third of the electricity intended for re-export.

4. Supplying Cyprus with Natural Gas

Energean—a company of Greek interests—has proposed supplying Cyprus with natural gas from the Israeli fields it operates. Under the proposal submitted to the governments of Cyprus and Israel, Energean would construct a new undersea pipeline linking the “Energean Power” FPSO in Israeli waters directly to Cyprus.

Israel’s Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, Eli Cohen, expressed strong support, noting that gas sales to Cyprus would enhance Israel’s regional and European standing, contribute to stability and prosperity, and generate significant state revenue.

The gas would come from Israel’s Katlan field.

5. Ionian Sea Drilling

A $100 million drilling project in “Block 2,” west of Corfu, is now a realistic prospect after ExxonMobil agreed to join the exploration consortium, acquiring stakes from Energean and Helleniq. The final decision will depend on the reassessment of seismic data; if positive, Greece could proceed with the development of production wells and the installation of the required extraction, processing, and transport infrastructure, at a total investment of around $5 billion.

A commercially viable hydrocarbons discovery would be a milestone—both for Greece and for the EU—especially if quantities can meaningfully contribute to regional energy needs.

Also under consideration is the Great Sea Interconnector, which would link Greece, Cyprus, and Israel, for which updated studies and new investors are being sought.

[TITLE]Global LNG Glut Could Upend Prices by 2026:
[TEXT]
Global LNG supply is rising and growth will accelerate in the next two years as major projects in the top exporters, the United States and China, come on stream.

Supply growth is set to outpace the global LNG demand increase, leading to an oversupplied market from the end of 2026 onwards, analysts say.

The coming glut will likely depress spot LNG prices in Asia, where the price-sensitive buyers such as South Asian importers India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh could benefit from the price drop and boost demand.

For Europe, the expected LNG oversupply would be welcome news as the EU moved to ban Russian gas and LNG from 2027 and will be looking to buy even higher volumes of the super-chilled fuel to fill the gap left by the planned halt of Russian gas imports.

If LNG prices are lower, all the better for the EU budgets and its energy security. That’s if the EU moves to significantly scale back its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which places additional barriers to LNG flows to Europe, according to gas producers, traders, the United States, and Qatar.

Related: US Oil Drilling Picks Up: Baker Hughes

If the sustainability directive remains as-is, importers of LNG may have to divert cargoes away from the EU as of 2027 due to non-compliance with the legislation, which would reduce gas supply just as Europe will have phased out Russian gas flows.

At any rate, global LNG supply is set to jump by 10.2% from this year to 475 million metric tons next year, per data from Kpler cited by Reuters columnist Clyde Russell.

The projected growth in LNG supply would equal the total annual demand of South Korea, which is currently the world’s third-largest LNG importer behind China and Japan.

Most of the supply increase will come from the United States by 2027, after which Qatar’s mega expansion of LNG supply capacity and newly approved U.S. projects will hit the market.

The U.S. is set to export 14.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG this year, up by 25% from 2024, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) this week. Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana has ramped up exports more quickly than the EIA expected, leading the administration to raise its forecast of LNG exports in the current quarter by 3% compared with last month’s outlook. The EIA expects U.S. LNG exports to increase by an additional 10% in 2026.

The supply wave of U.S. LNG will continue through this decade as LNG developers are taking advantage of market and regulatory tailwinds to approve investments in new projects.

“There’s a period of time when it would appear we’re going to see more supply coming into the market than demand will be able to absorb,” Chevron’s CEO Mike Wirth told Bloomberg TV this week.

“That probably results in lower spot prices,” Wirth added.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) also warned of oversupply in LNG markets in its annual World Energy Outlook out this week.

Available global LNG supply is set to surge by 50% by 2030, according to the agency, which estimates that about half of the new capacity is being built in the United States, and a further 20% in Qatar.

“Natural gas demand has been revised up in this year’s WEO, but questions still linger about where all the new LNG will go,” the agency noted.

The unprecedented momentum in U.S. LNG development raises the question about the risk of prolonged oversupply, Kristy Kramer, Head of LNG Strategy and Market Development at Wood Mackenzie, says.

But the wave of new supply meets robust fundamentals worldwide, Kramer wrote in an analysis.

European demand for LNG is expected to rise further as the EU shakes off dependence on Russia, while fundamentals in Asia remain “equally strong,” Kramer added.

“Lower prices will enhance LNG's affordability and potentially trigger the next phase of demand growth,” the strategist noted.

Spot LNG prices are headed higher in the near term with the peak demand during the winter in the northern hemisphere. Any material drop in prices could become visible in the latter part of 2026, if Europe hasn’t depleted its gas reserves in the winter and doesn’t need large volumes of LNG to fill up for the following winter when Russian LNG would no longer be a supply option.

[TITLE]Greece to supply winter gas to war battered Ukraine:
[TEXT]
The key gas deal was signed as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the start of a European tour - Copyright AFP Filippo MONTEFORTE

Katerina NIKOLOPOULOU, with Victoria LUKOVENKO in Kyiv

Greece signed a deal with Ukraine on Sunday to supply US-origin liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the war-battered country whose energy infrastructure has been crippled by Russian strikes.

The agreement came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Athens at the start of a European tour aimed at shoring up his country’s defences and energy supply, as it enters another gruelling winter nearly four years into Russia’s invasion.

Exhausted and outnumbered Ukrainian troops are struggling to fend off Russian forces, and both sides have been attacking each other’s energy infrastructure power stations and oil refineries as the war drags on with no sign of peace talks.

Greece’s national gas company DEPA Commercial and its Ukrainian counterpart Naftogaz announced the deal, which will run from December 2025 until March 2026, following a meeting between Zelensky and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

The agreement “marks an essential step in strengthening regional energy cooperation and European energy security”, according to a joint statement.

The deal, signed at a ceremony attended by US ambassador to Greece Kimberly Guilfoyle, will make it possible to “support Ukraine in the midst of a difficult winter”, Mitsotakis and Zelensky said.

Guilfoyle visited Zelensky at the Ukrainian embassy in Athens on Sunday, the state-run ERTNEWS tv channel reported.

“Relations between our countries are taking on a crucial new dimension: that of a new secure energy artery, stretching from south to north, from Greece to Ukraine,” Mitsotakis said.

He called the deal a “decisive step toward definitive energy independence from Russian gas” — a key goal for Europe, which has struggled to wean itself off imports.

Most European Union countries recently approved a ban on imports of Russian natural gas by the end of 2027, a decision aimed at hitting Russia’s funding for the war.

– Winter ‘a huge challenge’ –

Mitsotakis also pledged Greek support for Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction and to deepening defence cooperation, according to a joint declaration.

They plan on “enhancing security in the maritime domain, including cooperation on the development and deployment of maritime (sea) UAVs, joint exercises and training related to unmanned maritime systems, and enhanced information-sharing on maritime threats.”

The Ukrainian president expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump “for the fact that we will be able to receive natural gas not only from Greece, but also (US gas) via Greece”.

Zelensky, who is to visit France and Spain on his tour, called the agreement a “significant part of the comprehensive energy package we have prepared for this winter”.

The approaching winter poses “a huge challenge… for the Ukrainian people”, he said.

“Practically every night now, the Russians are striking our infrastructure, especially our energy infrastructure,” he said.

“Most of Ukraine’s power plants, our gas production facilities and our thermal power plants have become targets.”

Zelensky’s first visit to Greece since 2023 follows the recent announcement of major energy projects in Greece, supported by the United States.

Greek authorities plan to cooperate with US companies to increase the flow of American liquefied natural gas to Greek terminals.

Greece is “the natural gateway for American liquefied natural gas to replace Russian gas in the region,” Mitsotakis said at a conference this month in Athens hosted by the United States.

The recent launch of a Trans-Adriatic pipeline connecting Greece and Bulgaria has enabled the country to contribute to a “vertical” corridor delivering gas towards Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Hungary and Slovakia.

The opening of storage infrastructure at the port of Alexandroupolis, near the Greek-Turkish border and where American LNG arrives, has also helped undermine Russia’s market in the region.

[TITLE]IFC, Siemens, Fullerton may buy 49% stake in clean hydrogen maker Hygenco in $250 million deal:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: The World Bank’s International Finance Corp (IFC), Munich-headquartered Siemens AG, and Singapore’s Fullerton Fund Management may acquire at least 49% in Gurugram-based green hydrogen manufacturer Hygenco Green Energies Pvt. Ltd, two people aware of the development said.

Avendus Capital is managing the primary equity raise for the deal, which has an equity value of around $125 million and an enterprise value of around $250 million. IFC plans to invest $50 million equity in the company, with the remaining $75 million to be invested by Siemens AG and Fullerton Fund Management. The deal documentation is underway, and the transaction is expected to be announced in mid-December, they added.

Hygenco's co-founders Amit Bansal, Anshul Gupta and Ashish Gupta along with their associates, collectively hold a 51% equity share in the company; and the balance 49% is owned by SBICAP Ventures Limited’s SVL-SME Fund, also known as the Neev Fund II. Hygenco plans to invest $2.5 billion over three years to set up green hydrogen projects in the country. The fundraising will help the company, which plans to develop 10 gigawatt (GW) of production and distribution assets by 2030, complete its portfolio.

Green hydrogen is generated by breaking down water in an electrolyser. The hydrogen produced can be combined with nitrogen to make ammonia, avoiding hydrocarbons in the production process. Green ammonia is used to store energy and in fertiliser manufacturing. India aims to produce 5 million tonnes (mt) of green hydrogen by 2030.

Mint reported in June 2024 that IFC and several other companies had evinced interest in the transaction and had signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). These included UAE’s Masdar (Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company), Beijing-headquartered Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Australia's Macquarie Group, Japan's Sojitz Corporation, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (MHI) and Marubeni Corporation, private equity firm Actis Llp, and Gentari, a unit of Malaysia’s state-run oil and gas company Petroliam Nasional Bhd or Petronas.

An IFC spokesperson wrote in an emailed response to Mint, “ I’m afraid we would give this a pass, given the speculative nature of the query."

An external spokesperson for Fullerton Fund Management wrote, “As a matter of policy, we don’t comment on market speculation regarding potential transactions. We remain focused on identifying and supporting high-quality businesses that align with our strategic objectives, and we will share updates as appropriate."

An Avendus spokesperson in an emailed response said, “ We cannot comment on stories of this nature as per policy." A Siemens spokesperson declined comment. Queries emailed to the spokespersons of Hygenco Green Energies Pvt. Ltd, and SBI Capital Markets and SBI Ventures Ltd on Thursday evening remained unanswered.

IFC has an $8-billion portfolio in India and plans to double its annual commitments to $10 billion by 2030 from $5.4 billion in FY25. Siemens has a significant presence in the country, with its Indian arm betting on both organic expansion and targeted acquisitions to capture emerging opportunities in electrification, automation, and digitalisation space, managing director and chief executive officer Sunil Mathur said in an earlier interview to Mint.

Attracted by India’s electrification drive, Siemens AG had earlier acquired New Delhi-based C&S Electric Limited for €267 million. Fullerton Fund Management has been present in India since 2007 and recently invested in the transport company Routematic through its Fullerton Carbon Action Fund (FCAF).

This growing investor interest in India’s green hydrogen space comes in the backdrop of state-run Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) announcing the lowest rate of ₹49 per kg in August. A shift to large-scale use of hydrogen fuel could help bolster India’s geopolitical heft and its energy security, particularly in sectors such as fertilisers, refineries, steel, shipping, and road transport.

India’s playbook involves leveraging the country’s landmass and low solar and wind tariffs to produce low-cost green hydrogen and ammonia for export to countries including Japan, South Korea, and Europe. Several state-run majors such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and GAIL Ltd, and private sector firms such as ACME, ReNew Energy, Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd and the Adani Group have announced plans to produce green hydrogen.

Experts said green hydrogen costs would fall further. “A robust policy framework is catalysing sectoral momentum. Key initiatives include the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Programme with a combined outlay of over ₹17,000 crore, production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for electrolysers and green hydrogen, and state-level policies offering fiscal and regulatory benefits. Together, these measures are expected to drive down the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) from around $5 per kg today to as low as around $0.8 to $3.3 per kg by 2030 through reductions in renewable energy tariffs, capital costs, and indirect taxes," Avener Capital wrote in a July report.

India’s push to tap clean energy sources such as green hydrogen has generated significant interest among global players. Recently, Mint reported that state-run NTPC Ltd's subsidiary NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) was in talks to supply green hydrogen to state-backed oil refiner and marketer Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and copper and aluminium maker Hindalco Industries. Malaysia's Gentari also plans to invest $1.5 billion for a 30% stake in AM Green Ammonia Holdings, a unit of AM Green, set up by Greenko Group founders Mahesh Kolli and Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty. AM Green Ammonia will produce 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of green ammonia, which is equivalent to about 1 mtpa of green hydrogen.

The government has been putting in place an enabling framework to promote this clean fuel. India’s ₹19,744-crore green hydrogen policy promises cheaper renewable power, fee waivers for inter-state power transmission, land in renewable energy parks, and mega manufacturing zones to help local industries wean themselves off fossil fuels. It aims to reduce fossil fuel imports by ₹1 trillion and prevent 50 MMT of greenhouse gas emissions every year by 2030.

India’s green energy capacity has been glowing steadily and is currently around 197GW. The country plans to add another 50GW annually and touch 500GW by 2030. The goal is to add 1,800 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2047 and 5,000 GW by 2070.

[TITLE]Athens and Kyiv sign LNG deal as Greece adopts US energy agenda:
[TEXT]
“Ukraine gains direct access to diversified and reliable energy sources, while Greece becomes a hub for supplying Central and Eastern Europe with American liquefied natural gas," Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said, emphasizing Greece’s growing role as an energy hub.

The agreement will “cover nearly €2 billion needed for gas imports to compensate for the losses in Ukrainian production caused by Russian strikes,” Zelenskyy said in a statement Sunday.

The deal was signed during a visit by Zelenskyy to Athens, attended by Mitsotakis, Greek Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou and U.S. Ambassador Kimberly Guilfoyle. The agreement signed on Sunday formalized a declaration of intent between Greece’s gas company DEPA Commercial and Ukraine’s Naftogaz.

Greece aims to showcase its importance as an entry point for American LNG, bolstering Europe’s independence from Russian gas. Athens last week signed a 20-year deal to import 700 million cubic meters of U.S. LNG a year starting in 2030, aiming to boost U.S. LNG shipments from Greece to its northern European neighbors.

“What we see for the future of Greece and the United States is Greece being an energy hub and showing this energy dominance that both of our countries can experience and work together cooperatively to achieve tremendous outcomes,” Ambassador Guilfoyle said in an interview with Antenna TV on Thursday.

“Cooperation within the framework of the 'vertical corridor' may prove to be more decisive for peace and prosperity in the region than NATO,” Energy Minister Papastavrou told a conference in Athens on Tuesday.

Greece signed a deal with Ukraine on Sunday to supply US-origin liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the war-battered country whose energy infrastructure has been crippled by Russian strikes.

The agreement came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Athens at the start of a European tour aimed at shoring up his country’s defences and energy supply, as it enters another gruelling winter nearly four years into Russia’s invasion.

Exhausted and outnumbered Ukrainian troops are struggling to fend off Russian forces, and both sides have been attacking each other’s energy infrastructure power stations and oil refineries as the war drags on with no sign of peace talks.

Greece’s national gas company DEPA Commercial and its Ukrainian counterpart Naftogaz announced the deal, which will run from December 2025 until March 2026, following a meeting between Zelensky and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

The agreement “marks an essential step in strengthening regional energy cooperation and European energy security”, according to a joint statement.

The deal, signed at a ceremony attended by US ambassador to Greece Kimberly Guilfoyle, will make it possible to “support Ukraine in the midst of a difficult winter”, Mitsotakis and Zelensky said.

Guilfoyle visited Zelensky at the Ukrainian embassy in Athens on Sunday, the state-run ERTNEWS tv channel reported.

“Relations between our countries are taking on a crucial new dimension: that of a new secure energy artery, stretching from south to north, from Greece to Ukraine,” Mitsotakis said.

He called the deal a “decisive step toward definitive energy independence from Russian gas” — a key goal for Europe, which has struggled to wean itself off imports.

Most European Union countries recently approved a ban on imports of Russian natural gas by the end of 2027, a decision aimed at hitting Russia’s funding for the war.

– Winter ‘a huge challenge’ –

Mitsotakis also pledged Greek support for Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction and to deepening defence cooperation, according to a joint declaration.

They plan on “enhancing security in the maritime domain, including cooperation on the development and deployment of maritime (sea) UAVs, joint exercises and training related to unmanned maritime systems, and enhanced information-sharing on maritime threats.”

The Ukrainian president expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump “for the fact that we will be able to receive natural gas not only from Greece, but also (US gas) via Greece”.

Zelensky, who is to visit France and Spain on his tour, called the agreement a “significant part of the comprehensive energy package we have prepared for this winter”.

The approaching winter poses “a huge challenge… for the Ukrainian people”, he said.

“Practically every night now, the Russians are striking our infrastructure, especially our energy infrastructure,” he said.

“Most of Ukraine’s power plants, our gas production facilities and our thermal power plants have become targets.”

Zelensky’s first visit to Greece since 2023 follows the recent announcement of major energy projects in Greece, supported by the United States.

Greek authorities plan to cooperate with US companies to increase the flow of American liquefied natural gas to Greek terminals.

Greece is “the natural gateway for American liquefied natural gas to replace Russian gas in the region,” Mitsotakis said at a conference this month in Athens hosted by the United States.

The recent launch of a Trans-Adriatic pipeline connecting Greece and Bulgaria has enabled the country to contribute to a “vertical” corridor delivering gas towards Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Hungary and Slovakia.

The opening of storage infrastructure at the port of Alexandroupolis, near the Greek-Turkish border and where American LNG arrives, has also helped undermine Russia’s market in the region.

[TITLE]Greece To Supply Ukraine With US Natural Gas For Winter:
[TEXT]
By Sotiris Nikas

Nov 16, 2025 (Bloomberg) –Ukraine said it’s reached an agreement with Greece that will help secure the supply of natural gas for the coming winter heating season.

Following a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Athens on Sunday, the two sides announced that Greece’s Depa Commercial SA would supply Ukraine’s Naftogaz with US natural gas from December through March.

From the very first days of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Greece has been helping us, working together with Europe and with other partners so that we can reach the conditions under which peace becomes possible. And we truly value your support and your commitment. Today we have an… pic.twitter.com/tN83Mjnamh — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / ????????? ?????????? (@ZelenskyyUa) November 16, 2025

“Ukraine gets direct access to diversified and reliable energy sources, while Greece now becomes a hub for supplying central and eastern Europe with American liquefied natural gas,” Mitsotakis said.

The deal comes as Ukraine races to secure energy for winter after Russian airstrikes in the past month wiped out more than half of its domestic natural gas production. Kremlin forces continue regular attacks on Ukraine’s power infrastructure, causing widespread outages to gas, heating and electricity generation.

Under the framework of the prospective agreement between DEPA and Naftogaz, LNG originating from the US is expected to be transported through “Route 1,” offered jointly by the gas transmission system operators of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, the companies said.

The agreement comes as Greece seeks to become a gas-transportation hub for the region and Europe works toward a complete ban on Russian supplies. Earlier this month, Atlantic See — a subsidiary of Depa and Aktor — signed a deal with Venture Global for the purchase of at least 0.5 million tonnes per year of US liquefied natural gas for 20 years, starting in 2030.

Deliveries of American LNG have already increased, and the southern European country wants to have a key role in importing and exporting LNG via the so-called Vertical Corridor — a project to expand transit capacity for LNG flowing into Greece and moving northward to countries including Romania and Hungary as well as Ukraine.

[TITLE]Momentum has shifted to affordable, reliable energy * WorldNetDaily * by Gary Abernathy, The Empowerment Alliance:
[TEXT]
This article was orginally published at The Empowerment Alliance and is re-published here with permission.

Momentum is a crucial factor in success in all walks of life. In sports, a high-performance team builds confidence and enthusiasm, often leading to a string of wins. In politics, legislative victories or a growing list of endorsements pressures others to line up in support of a cause or candidate. And in business, a rising stock or product often continues to climb because its momentum attracts attention and leads to growing demand.

In the energy business, momentum in recent years was on the side of renewables, primarily thanks to government subsidies financing wind and solar initiatives and regulations designed to erect roadblocks to legacy energy enterprises.

Clearly, things have changed. The momentum has shifted. Thanks to the Trump administration removing barriers for our most affordable and reliable energy sources, a whirlwind of activity designed to deliver natural gas to consumers across the nation is underway at a frenetic pace.

Just during the last couple of weeks of October alone, various companies announced a flurry of activity. To highlight just a few:

In Louisiana, Williams Companies unveiled a strategic partnership with Woodside Energy “to advance Louisiana pipeline and liquefied natural gas projects,” leading to more capital investment.

The deal involves an investment in the Louisiana LNG project in which Williams “will acquire 80% ownership in and become operator of Driftwood Pipeline LLC, which includes the construction of Line 200, a fully permitted greenfield pipeline connecting Woodside’s Louisiana LNG facility to multiple pipelines, including Transco and Louisiana Energy Gateway.”

Williams said it expects its investment “will total $1.9 billion in capital for development of the pipeline and LNG facilities.”

In Tennessee, East Tennessee Natural Gas, owned by Enbridge, announced that “construction on the 122-mile pipeline through the Upper Cumberland for the Ridgeline Expansion Project will begin soon.” The company said it received a notice to proceed on Oct. 7 from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Construction was expected to begin Nov. 1, according to Enbridge. “The pre-construction activity began on Oct. 20,” according to the report. The pipeline “will supply natural gas to the new Tennessee Valley Authority Kingston Energy Complex.”

In Ohio, a new bill, SB 294, mirrors federal legislation recently introduced by U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson (R) aimed at qualifying natural gas as clean energy and designed to “compel the Ohio Power Siting Board to favor energy projects it deems both ‘clean and reliable,’” as one industry site described it.

The bill would also “declare renewable sources like wind and solar ‘unreliable.’”

In Texas, Phillips 66 and Kinder Morgan Inc. announced “the commencement of a binding open season for transportation service on the Western Gateway Pipeline (Western Gateway), a newly proposed refined products pipeline system.”

The project “will facilitate the transportation of refined products from origin points in Texas to key downstream markets in Arizona and California, with connectivity to Las Vegas, Nevada via Kinder Morgan’s CALNEV Pipeline.”

[TITLE]A Breakout Year for E-Methanol:
[TEXT]
With COP30 now underway in Belém, Brazil, it can feel as though the world is backsliding when it comes to curbing emissions. Since the last climate summit, major oil companies have scaled back their climate goals, the U.S. has cancelled billions in clean-energy grants, and even Bill Gates has called for a new approach to countering climate change. But those headlines don’t reflect the inexorable progress that is being made across a variety of clean energy sectors, even if the rate of growth in some areas may be slowing.

Some of the most striking developments underway at the moment are in the “hard-to-abate” sectors where governments, industry, and climate advocates appear to find common purpose. One notable example of this progress is the rise of e-methanol, a clean fuel designed to help decarbonize the transportation and chemicals sectors. While it has been around for decades, 2025 was a breakout year for the technology as it finally transitioned from pilot schemes and small-scale projects to the first commercial plants coming online.

What Is E-Methanol?

E-methanol, a type of renewable or green methanol, is a low-carbon alternative to conventional methanol, which is used as a chemical feedstock and fuel. Instead of being derived from fossil fuels, e-methanol is synthesized from captured or biogenic carbon dioxide and green hydrogen (hydrogen produced via electrolysis using renewable energy). With these inputs, e-methanol can achieve net-zero or, in some cases, net-negative carbon emissions over its lifecycle. E-methanol is distinct from but similar to biomethanol, which produces its hydrogen directly from biomass.

As it is liquid at ambient temperature and compatible with existing storage and transport infrastructure, green methanol is seen as a practical route to decarbonize both the chemicals industry and transport segments that are difficult to electrify.

The shipping industry, in particular, has emerged as an early adopter of green methanol, with over 60 methanol-capable vessels in operation, 300 more on order, and bunkering available at around 20 ports around the world.

The chemicals sector, which makes up roughly 70% of global methanol consumption, is a major demand source for green methanol. Roughly 35% of green methanol was consumed by the chemical and petrochemical industry in 2024, and major brand-name buyers include LEGO, Novo Nordisk, and SABIC. More than 70 of the world's top 100 chemicals producers have committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, highlighting the growth potential in the green methanol space.

In aviation, synthetic methanol can technically serve as a precursor for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), with companies such as ExxonMobil working on the technology. While the space is largely dominated by biofuels, methanol-to-jet represents a promising future market for e-methanol once it scales up.

The E-Methanol Breakthrough

While e-methanol has been pursued as an alternative fuel since the 1970s energy crisis and saw several pilot projects in the early 2000s, it wasn’t until the 2020s that it began to be considered as a credible clean energy solution.

Perhaps the first major breakthrough for the fuel came in November 2021 when Maersk issued a 10-year, €500 million green bond to fund vessels capable of using methanol. This move came on the back of the IMO 2020 sulfur cap coming into effect, which limited the sulphur content in the fuel oil used on board ships.

Over the next couple of years, regulation and funding milestones helped to accelerate the rise of e-methanol. In 2022, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act was passed and included credits for both green hydrogen production and carbon capture. In 2023, the IMO tightened carbon-intensity regulations and revised its net-zero goals to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon fuels. At the same time, the EU implemented major reforms to its Emissions Trading System under the Fit for 55 package, increasing the pressure on the chemicals sector to shift toward greener feedstocks such as green methanol. Then, in 2024 and 2025, the EU further tightened regulations on ships arriving at European ports and strengthened carbon-pricing rules.

In this period, the world’s first methanol-enabled container vessel was christened, and Maersk formally ordered six more mid-sized dual-fuel methanol vessels. The future for e-methanol was looking increasingly bright, but financing and bringing sufficient supply online remained a major limitation.

The World’s First Commercial-Scale E-Methanol Plants

On Tuesday, the 13th of May, 2025, the world’s first commercial-scale e-methanol site began operations in Kassø, Denmark. The plant has a capacity of 42,000 tonnes per year of e-methanol, and its off-takers include Maersk, LEGO, and pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk. The project uses solar power from a neighbouring solar park for electrolysis and sources biogenic CO? from a local biogas plant.

Just two months later, a second e-methanol plant came online, this time in China. The project at Taonan, Jilin Province, built by Shanghai Electric, uses wind power for electrolysis and biomass conversion to produce e-methanol. This first phase of the project has a capacity of 50,000 tonnes per year of e-methanol, but its second phase is expected to boost that capacity up to 250,000 tonnes annually.

And those two projects are only the beginning.

3 Green Methanol Projects to Watch

Going forward, the project pipeline in this space is remarkable, with the Methanol Institute projecting that the world’s total renewable methanol capacity will climb to between 7 and 14 million tonnes by 2030. Of the e-methanol projects the institute is tracking, 23 have now passed feasibility and are either in the engineering phase or are already under construction. Of those projects, five are in the Americas, eight are in Europe, one is in Saudi Arabia, and nine are in Asia.

In China, the Liaoyuan Tianying project, which is currently under construction and projected to come online in 2026, is set to be the world’s largest green methanol plant with a capacity of 170,000 tonnes per year. The project is being developed by CNTY with Iceland’s CRI as the tech provider. It will use a combination of wind and solar for electrolysis and then combine the resultant hydrogen with biogenic CO2 from the direct combustion of biomass.

In Spain, the La Robla Green project is set to come online in 2028 with a capacity of 140,000 tonnes. As well as claiming to be Europe’s largest e-methanol plant, La Robla is unique for its integrated design, which includes both a biomass plant and a green hydrogen unit on site. The biomass plant, which will be run by Tresca Ingeniería using DP Cleantech technology, is set to be the world’s first green biomass plant with a negative carbon footprint. Meanwhile, the green hydrogen unit is set to be operated by Siemens Energy, and the e-methanol technology will be supplied by Johnson Matthey.

In Canada, StormFisher’s recent acquisition of the Varennes Carbon Recycling plant has set the stage for North America’s first large-scale e-methanol plant. The company will capture carbon from local emitters and produce hydrogen from hydropower for a total capacity of 72,000 tonnes of methanol per year. The acquisition of a struggling waste-biofuels project and its pivot to producing e-methanol marks a strong signal of confidence in the space. The plant, which is currently under construction, is slated to come online in 2028.

Headwinds Remain

Despite the excitement and progress in the green methanol space, there is still a long way to go before the green methanol movement truly becomes mainstream. To begin with, green methanol is still far from cost-competitive compared to fossil-fuel-derived sources. While prices are dropping, e-methanol was still two to three times the price of its fossil counterpart as of 2024, although those prices are expected to tumble as the industry scales. Furthermore, regulations like those implemented by the EU are increasing the cost of burning oil-based fuels.

As well as overcoming difficult economics, the broader clean investment environment has seen energy majors pulling back or altering commitments in the sector. Most damningly, Orsted scrapped its FlagshipONE project in 2024 due to slower-than-expected demand growth. Its partner in that project, however, has since picked it back up and is also committed not only to a FlagshipTWO project but last month announced the commercialization of its FlagshipTHREE project.

Just as with the broader energy transition, there may be doubts regarding the pace of development, but it seems the e-methanol sector is only going to grow from here.

[TITLE]IFC, Siemens, Fullerton may buy 49% stake in clean hydrogen maker Hygenco in $250 million deal:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: The World Bank’s International Finance Corp (IFC), Munich-headquartered Siemens AG, and Singapore’s Fullerton Fund Management may acquire at least 49% in Gurugram-based green hydrogen manufacturer Hygenco Green Energies Pvt. Ltd, two people aware of the development said.

Avendus Capital is managing the primary equity raise for the deal, which has an equity value of around $125 million and an enterprise value of around $250 million. IFC plans to invest $50 million equity in the company, with the remaining $75 million to be invested by Siemens AG and Fullerton Fund Management. The deal documentation is underway, and the transaction is expected to be announced in mid-December, they added.

Hygenco's co-founders Amit Bansal, Anshul Gupta and Ashish Gupta along with their associates, collectively hold a 51% equity share in the company; and the balance 49% is owned by SBICAP Ventures Limited’s SVL-SME Fund, also known as the Neev Fund II. Hygenco plans to invest $2.5 billion over three years to set up green hydrogen projects in the country. The fundraising will help the company, which plans to develop 10 gigawatt (GW) of production and distribution assets by 2030, complete its portfolio.

Green hydrogen is generated by breaking down water in an electrolyser. The hydrogen produced can be combined with nitrogen to make ammonia, avoiding hydrocarbons in the production process. Green ammonia is used to store energy and in fertiliser manufacturing. India aims to produce 5 million tonnes (mt) of green hydrogen by 2030.

Mint reported in June 2024 that IFC and several other companies had evinced interest in the transaction and had signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). These included UAE’s Masdar (Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company), Beijing-headquartered Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Australia's Macquarie Group, Japan's Sojitz Corporation, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (MHI) and Marubeni Corporation, private equity firm Actis Llp, and Gentari, a unit of Malaysia’s state-run oil and gas company Petroliam Nasional Bhd or Petronas.

An IFC spokesperson wrote in an emailed response to Mint, “ I’m afraid we would give this a pass, given the speculative nature of the query."

An external spokesperson for Fullerton Fund Management wrote, “As a matter of policy, we don’t comment on market speculation regarding potential transactions. We remain focused on identifying and supporting high-quality businesses that align with our strategic objectives, and we will share updates as appropriate."

An Avendus spokesperson in an emailed response said, “ We cannot comment on stories of this nature as per policy." A Siemens spokesperson declined comment. Queries emailed to the spokespersons of Hygenco Green Energies Pvt. Ltd, and SBI Capital Markets and SBI Ventures Ltd on Thursday evening remained unanswered.

IFC has an $8-billion portfolio in India and plans to double its annual commitments to $10 billion by 2030 from $5.4 billion in FY25. Siemens has a significant presence in the country, with its Indian arm betting on both organic expansion and targeted acquisitions to capture emerging opportunities in electrification, automation, and digitalisation space, managing director and chief executive officer Sunil Mathur said in an earlier interview to Mint.

Attracted by India’s electrification drive, Siemens AG had earlier acquired New Delhi-based C&S Electric Limited for €267 million. Fullerton Fund Management has been present in India since 2007 and recently invested in the transport company Routematic through its Fullerton Carbon Action Fund (FCAF).

This growing investor interest in India’s green hydrogen space comes in the backdrop of state-run Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) announcing the lowest rate of ₹49 per kg in August. A shift to large-scale use of hydrogen fuel could help bolster India’s geopolitical heft and its energy security, particularly in sectors such as fertilisers, refineries, steel, shipping, and road transport.

India’s playbook involves leveraging the country’s landmass and low solar and wind tariffs to produce low-cost green hydrogen and ammonia for export to countries including Japan, South Korea, and Europe. Several state-run majors such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and GAIL Ltd, and private sector firms such as ACME, ReNew Energy, Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd and the Adani Group have announced plans to produce green hydrogen.

Experts said green hydrogen costs would fall further. “A robust policy framework is catalysing sectoral momentum. Key initiatives include the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Programme with a combined outlay of over ₹17,000 crore, production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for electrolysers and green hydrogen, and state-level policies offering fiscal and regulatory benefits. Together, these measures are expected to drive down the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) from around $5 per kg today to as low as around $0.8 to $3.3 per kg by 2030 through reductions in renewable energy tariffs, capital costs, and indirect taxes," Avener Capital wrote in a July report.

India’s push to tap clean energy sources such as green hydrogen has generated significant interest among global players. Recently, Mint reported that state-run NTPC Ltd's subsidiary NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) was in talks to supply green hydrogen to state-backed oil refiner and marketer Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and copper and aluminium maker Hindalco Industries. Malaysia's Gentari also plans to invest $1.5 billion for a 30% stake in AM Green Ammonia Holdings, a unit of AM Green, set up by Greenko Group founders Mahesh Kolli and Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty. AM Green Ammonia will produce 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of green ammonia, which is equivalent to about 1 mtpa of green hydrogen.

The government has been putting in place an enabling framework to promote this clean fuel. India’s ₹19,744-crore green hydrogen policy promises cheaper renewable power, fee waivers for inter-state power transmission, land in renewable energy parks, and mega manufacturing zones to help local industries wean themselves off fossil fuels. It aims to reduce fossil fuel imports by ₹1 trillion and prevent 50 MMT of greenhouse gas emissions every year by 2030.

India’s green energy capacity has been glowing steadily and is currently around 197GW. The country plans to add another 50GW annually and touch 500GW by 2030. The goal is to add 1,800 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2047 and 5,000 GW by 2070.

[TITLE]Five Greek cross-border energy projects set to redraw the Eastern Mediterranean and Eastern Europe map:
[TEXT]
Newsroom November 16 08:56

Five major Greek-led cross-border initiatives are reshaping the energy landscape of the Eastern Mediterranean and Eastern Europe. Greece’s plans to become a regional gateway for energy gained new momentum after a series of agreements—signed in the presence of senior U.S. government officials and energy-sector representatives—during the Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Ministerial Meeting (P-TEC), held in Athens on November 6–7.

The project’s concern:

A new “vertical” natural gas corridor originating in Greece

A long-term agreement to import U.S. LNG and re-export it across the region

The electricity interconnection between Greece and Egypt

A proposal to supply Cyprus with natural gas from Israeli fields

Offshore drilling in the Ionian Sea to explore a potential natural gas target

Environment and Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou told the Athens–Macedonian News Agency (APE):

“The 6th session of the Transatlantic Energy Partnership (P-TEC), which concluded in Athens a few days ago, left a strong geopolitical footprint for Greece and the entire Eastern Mediterranean. This was not a meeting of words and declarations but of concrete agreements and decisions in the energy sector—with results that hold immediate and long-term value.

We capitalized on our country’s unique geographic position, its infrastructure, the clear commitment of the EU and the United States to move away from Russian gas, and Greece’s political and economic stability. As a result, Greece is becoming a gateway for American LNG to Europe and a secure starting point for the new development corridor toward Northeastern and Central Europe, while reducing Turkey’s influence on the new energy map.

Greek energy companies stood shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the world’s largest energy giants, demonstrating credibility and expertise. During P-TEC, they signed agreements of great and multi-layered significance—both for today’s energy landscape and for the decade ahead.

The work continues. We must now implement all agreements swiftly and consistently, strengthening the central artery of growth and stability for our region and for Europe as a whole.”

The Five Projects in Detail

1. The Vertical Gas Corridor

At P-TEC, the gas transmission operators (TSOs) of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine jointly submitted a request to their national energy regulators to approve two new cross-border supply routes—Route 2 and Route 3.

Route 2 will originate at the Alexandroupolis floating LNG terminal, and Route 3 will begin from the transnational TAP pipeline. Route 1, which starts from the Revithoussa LNG terminal, has already been approved.

Approval of the new routes—combined with tariff reductions and upgrades to network capacity—will enable greater volumes of gas to transit through Greece, replacing Russian gas, which under EU decisions must cease flowing to member states by the end of 2027.

These routes will also allow natural gas deliveries to Ukraine.

2. U.S. LNG Supply and Regional Re-Exports

ATLANTIC–SEE LNG TRADE (a joint venture of the AKTOR Group and DEPA Emporia) signed a 20-year agreement with U.S.-based Venture Global to import 0.5–1.5 million tonnes of LNG annually from 2030 onward. This marks Greece’s first long-term LNG supply contract with a major U.S. producer.

The company also signed 20-year Memoranda of Understanding—also beginning in 2030—with Ukraine’s Naftogaz (up to 0.7 million tonnes annually) and with Romania’s NOVA POWER & GAS and Transgaz (up to 1.4 million tonnes annually) for LNG sales.

3. Greece–Egypt Electricity Interconnection

This is a 3,000-MW electricity interconnection that includes 9.5 GW of renewable energy capacity (wind and solar) to be developed in Egypt. The project is led by Elica Interconnector of the Copelouzos Group and is currently undergoing detailed seabed mapping.

According to the company, 60 Greek industrial firms have already signed agreements to purchase power through the interconnector, with roughly one-third of the electricity intended for re-export.

4. Supplying Cyprus with Natural Gas

Energean—a company of Greek interests—has proposed supplying Cyprus with natural gas from the Israeli fields it operates. Under the proposal submitted to the governments of Cyprus and Israel, Energean would construct a new undersea pipeline linking the “Energean Power” FPSO in Israeli waters directly to Cyprus.

Israel’s Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, Eli Cohen, expressed strong support, noting that gas sales to Cyprus would enhance Israel’s regional and European standing, contribute to stability and prosperity, and generate significant state revenue.

The gas would come from Israel’s Katlan field.

5. Ionian Sea Drilling

A $100 million drilling project in “Block 2,” west of Corfu, is now a realistic prospect after ExxonMobil agreed to join the exploration consortium, acquiring stakes from Energean and Helleniq. The final decision will depend on the reassessment of seismic data; if positive, Greece could proceed with the development of production wells and the installation of the required extraction, processing, and transport infrastructure, at a total investment of around $5 billion.

A commercially viable hydrocarbons discovery would be a milestone—both for Greece and for the EU—especially if quantities can meaningfully contribute to regional energy needs.

Also under consideration is the Great Sea Interconnector, which would link Greece, Cyprus, and Israel, for which updated studies and new investors are being sought.

Like zombies rising from the grave to devour the living, old coal power plants have begun to shake off the dust, adding to the burden of skyrocketing electricity costs. Not to worry. They won’t last long. The so-called national “energy emergency” that promised new life to the nation’s fleet of aging coal power plants is already evaporating under the weight of new sodium-ion batteries and other economical energy storage systems that take full advantage of the nation’s abundant, economical supply of wind and solar energy.

The Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Solution

By now, everyone knows that wind and solar — especially solar — are the fastest, most accessible, and most economical domestic energy resources available in the US today, with energy storage systems adding to the mix.

That explains why renewable energy has been the overwhelming choice for new capacity additions in recent years. The numbers don’t lie. In the first half of this year, for example, renewable energy resources accounted for 93% of new capacity additions to the US grid, for a total of 30.2 gigawatts, with solar and energy storage projects accounting for 83%.

All else being equal, wind and solar capacity additions will accelerate as energy storage systems drop in cost. The first half of that equation depends on which way the winds of federal energy policy blow, but the second half is a matter of innovation and investor engagement, and that is where a fresh burst of cleantech activity has already materialized.

In recent years, researchers have been focusing on sodium-ion technology as a more economical alternative compared to the familiar lithium-ion formula for battery energy storage systems (see more sodium-ion battery background here). Advocates for a sodium-ion future suffered a setback earlier this year when the high-profile US startup Natron shut down operations at its North Carolina factory and Michigan headquarters. However, other sodium-ion innovators have already picked up the torch.

The Peak Energy Sodium-Ion Solution

Among the torch bearers is the US energy storage firm Peak Energy. The startup launched only two years ago but it came into the sodium-ion scene with a head start in experience among senior executives, including from Tesla and Apple as well as the leading global energy storage firm Powin.

Peak Energy surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar when it burst out of stealth mode in October of 2023 with a business model based on vertical integration and a cost-cutting passive cooling system, and they hit the ground running. In July of 2024, Peak nailed down $55 million in Series A funding, spearheaded by the Xora Innovation branch of Temasek along with existing investor Eclipse and strategic partner TDK Ventures. Newcomers Lachy Groom, Tishman Speyer, TechEnergy Ventures, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures, and DETV-Scania Invest also supported the Series A round.

“Peak Energy claims that its sodium-ion battery technology can offer advantages in cost, supply chain security, scale, and safety over lithium-ion, the industry’s current default battery storage choice. The funding is also expected to lay the groundwork for a domestic, giga-scale sodium-ion battery factory slated to open in 2027,” Mercom Capital reported last year.

Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Coal Power Plants

One advantage of sodium-ion technology over other formulas is its scalability, and Peak already aims to put that to the test. Earlier this year, the company launched its grid-scale sodium-ion system into the market, and last week it announced plans to build the largest sodium-ion BESS in the world, in partnership with the up-and-coming independent power producer Jupiter Power.

The initial agreement calls for a 720-megawatt sodium-ion system to be delivered to Jupiter in 2027. With Jupiter holding an option for another 4,000 megawatts between 2028 and 2030, Peak estimates that the total value of the contract could top $500 million.

As for what sparked Jupiter’s interest in a new energy storage platform when the old one is working so well, that’s a good question. There is always room for improvement. In addition to its existing portfolio, Jupiter has a 12,000-megawatt pipeline brewing in the US, and Peak Energy promises to deliver more bang for the buck.

“Peak’s sodium-ion batteries promise less degradation over their lifetime and reduced operations and maintenance costs compared to lithium-ion systems on the market today,” Peak explains, putting the 20-year improvement at 30% compared to other systems.

“Lower system degradation can also reduce augmentation requirements, meaning operators will not have to add additional battery units or components over a project’s lifetime in order to maintain storage capacity over the project’s lifespan,” Peak adds.

Peak also draws attention to its passive cooling system, which enables it to bypass fabrication, maintenance, and repair costs typical of lithium-ion systems while reducing auxiliary power costs by 97%.

Zombie Coal Power Plants Rise From The Dead To Attack The Living

Against the backdrop of falling costs for wind, solar, and utility-scale energy storage systems, it’s difficult to see how any coal power plant in the US can survive much longer. The coal industry was already bending under the weight of low-cost natural gas in the early 2000’s, and now renewables and energy storage have added to the pressure.

In addition, coal power does not necessarily meet the oversimplified, under-defined “reliability” standard set forth by US President Donald Trump’s own American Energy Dominance policy. The 932-megawatt Sandy Creek coal power plant in Texas, for example, suffered a catastrophic failure in April and restoration is not expected until March of 2027.

The pace of coal retirements, though, is complicated by existing grid conditions and rising electricity demand, among other factors. In February, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reported that the US grid would drop 8.1 gigawatts of coal power this year in scheduled retirements, including some of the nation’s largest: Intermountain Power in Utah (1.8 gigawatts), JH Campbell in Michigan (1.33 GW), and Brandon Shores in Maryland (1.27 GW). However, by February, the wheels were already in motion to push the Brandon Shores closure back to 2029. The new date was reached under an agreement between the plant operator Talen Energy, the Maryland Public Service Commission, local ratepayers and utilities, and the Sierra Club, among other stakeholders, pending a major upgrade to the regional transmission system.

In addition, coal retirements are not necessarily replaced by renewables. The Intermountain capacity, for example, will be replaced in part by a new gas power plant.

In May, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright also shook things up when he summarily ordered the JH Campbell facility to keep running 90 days past its scheduled retirement date of May 31, an order later extended to November despite the extra costs.

The JH Campbell order is just one piece of the coal puzzle. Last spring, the Energy Department announced that coal projects will share in a new federal low-cost loan pot of $200 billion, and in October, Energy Secretary Wright announced a new round of $625 million in funding specifically aimed at coal, including $375 million set aside to recommission and retrofit old power plants.

Coal industry stakeholders have begun to respond to the new incentives, but one thing is for sure. The sun will rise and the wind will blow long after the current occupant of the White House leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully one hopes, this time. When he does, a new generation of reliable, economical energy storage systems will be ready to restore the momentum to the renewable energy transition in the US.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they’ll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.

But the challenges — some say the impossibility — of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.

One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built — eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.

The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that’s ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.

Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas — such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.

“There’s speculation in there,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. “Nobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what’s speculative, what’s double-counting, what’s real, what’s not.”
