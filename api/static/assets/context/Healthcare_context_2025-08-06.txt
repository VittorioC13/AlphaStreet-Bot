[TEXT]
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capsa Healthcare, a leader in healthcare workflow and supply management solutions, today announced the acquisition of BlueBin, a recognized innovator in Kanban-based supply chain systems and predictive analytics for healthcare. This strategic move brings together two complementary capabilities that together enhance visibility, efficiency, and reliability across the entire clinical supply chain.

By integrating BlueBin’s proven methodologies and analytics with Capsa’s point-of-care and supply management technologies, the combined solution aims to reduce operational friction, improve supply availability, and return valuable time to clinical teams.

“Healthcare systems are under increasing pressure to do more with less—clinically, operationally, and financially,” said Gaurav Agarwal, Chief Executive Officer at Capsa Healthcare. “This acquisition reflects our continued commitment to developing intelligent infrastructure that equips, enables, and engineers solutions to free up clinical care and deliver measurable financial results.”

BlueBin’s solutions are currently deployed in over 250 hospitals, with a strong track record of client retention and operational impact. At Memorial Hermann Health System, BlueBin’s Kanban implementation led to $4 million in annual supply savings and an additional $2.4 million in operational efficiencies.

The BlueBin acquisition reinforces Capsa’s capability to optimize healthcare operations, reduce waste, and enhance patient care.

Clinical Focus: Reduces time clinicians spend on supply-related tasks, allowing more time for patient care

Operational Visibility: Provides real-time data on inventory levels and usage patterns

Financial Efficiency: Helps reduce supply costs and optimize inventory levels

Space Utilization: Minimizes storage footprint, freeing up space for clinical use

BlueBin’s leadership and implementation model will remain in place, with Charles Hodge continuing as President and CEO. His team’s hands-on, community-based approach to implementation will ensure continuity and success for current and future clients.

“This partnership allows us to scale our mission of ensuring the right supplies reach the right place at the right time,” said Hodge. “Together with Capsa, we’re building a smarter, more responsive supply chain that supports both caregivers and patients.”

With this acquisition, Capsa Healthcare becomes the only provider offering a complete clinical supply management solution—from warehouse to bedside—through a single partner.

[TITLE]UPDATE - Axonius Acquires Medical Device Security Specialist Cynerio for More Than $100 Million to Target Healthcare Market:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, July 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Axonius , the global leader in cyber asset intelligence, today announced that it has acquired Cynerio , a pioneer in medical device security for more than $100 million in a cash and stock transaction.

The acquisition looks to address a critical challenge for healthcare providers, where the proliferation of connected medical devices has created a vast and unprotected attack surface. These specialized assets, essential to patient care, have historically been invisible to traditional security tools, creating significant risk to both patient safety and hospital operations.

“Hospitals have been operating with a massive digital security blind spot,” said Dean Sysman, co-founder and CEO, Axonius. “The very devices essential for patient care, from infusion pumps to MRI machines, have been completely invisible to cybersecurity teams, creating a dangerous, unprotected attack surface. This acquisition will help end that.”

Sysman added, “By integrating Cynerio’s deep clinical expertise with Axonius asset intelligence, we can offer healthcare providers what they’ve been asking for: a single source of truth capable of securing their entire clinical environment.”

“In today’s healthcare environments, risk doesn’t respect the boundaries between clinical and enterprise systems. The combination of Cynerio's specialized medical device context with Axonius' foundational asset intelligence addresses this challenge directly," said Rasu Shrestha, MD, MBA, EVP and Chief Innovation and Commercialization Officer at Advocate Health, and Chairman of the Board at Cynerio. "It provides the holistic visibility required to manage the entire connected attack surface, enabling healthcare organizations to build more resilient security programs. This is a vital step forward in helping ensure technology can securely and effectively support the core mission of patient care.”

Today’s news represents a significant shift in the healthcare cybersecurity landscape. The acquisition was driven by a shared understanding that securing medical devices in a silo is no longer sufficient. Both companies recognized a growing customer demand for a single, unified platform to manage and secure the entire clinical environment—from traditional IT infrastructure to connected medical devices. By combining Axonius’ asset intelligence platform with Cynerio’s deep medical device expertise, the company is positioned to meet the immediate needs of hospitals while setting the foundation for broader Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) security.

As part of the acquisition, Cynerio co-founder and CEO, Leon Lerman, will join Axonius as senior vice president. Co-founder Daniel Brodie will join the Office of the CTO. The Cynerio team joins Axonius to accelerate the company’s expansion into the healthcare

[TEXT]
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capsa Healthcare, a leader in healthcare workflow and supply management solutions, today announced the acquisition of BlueBin, a recognized innovator in Kanban-based supply chain systems and predictive analytics for healthcare. This strategic move brings together two complementary capabilities that together enhance visibility, efficiency, and reliability across the entire clinical supply chain.

[TITLE]UPDATE - Axonius Acquires Medical Device Security Specialist Cynerio for More Than $100 Million to Target Healthcare Market:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, July 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Axonius , the global leader in cyber asset intelligence, today announced that it has acquired Cynerio , a pioneer in medical device security for more than $100 million in a cash and stock transaction.

The acquisition looks to address a critical challenge for healthcare providers, where the proliferation of connected medical devices has created a vast and unprotected attack surface. These specialized assets, essential to patient care, have historically been invisible to traditional security tools, creating significant risk to both patient safety and hospital operations.

“Hospitals have been operating with a massive digital security blind spot,” said Dean Sysman, co-founder and CEO, Axonius. “The very devices essential for patient care, from infusion pumps to MRI machines, have been completely invisible to cybersecurity teams, creating a dangerous, unprotected attack surface. This acquisition will help end that.”

Sysman added, “By integrating Cynerio’s deep clinical expertise with Axonius asset intelligence, we can offer healthcare providers what they’ve been asking for: a single source of truth capable of securing their entire clinical environment.”

“In today’s healthcare environments, risk doesn’t respect the boundaries between clinical and enterprise systems. The combination of Cynerio's specialized medical device context with Axonius' foundational asset intelligence addresses this challenge directly," said Rasu Shrestha, MD, MBA, EVP and Chief Innovation and Commercialization Officer at Advocate Health, and Chairman of the Board at Cynerio. "It provides the holistic visibility required to manage the entire connected attack surface, enabling healthcare organizations to build more resilient security programs. This is a vital step forward in helping ensure technology can securely and effectively support the core mission of patient care.”

Today’s news represents a significant shift in the healthcare cybersecurity landscape. The acquisition was driven by a shared understanding that securing medical devices in a silo is no longer sufficient. Both companies recognized a growing customer demand for a single, unified platform to manage and secure the entire clinical environment—from traditional IT infrastructure to connected medical devices. By combining Axonius’ asset intelligence platform with Cynerio’s deep medical device expertise, the company is positioned to meet the immediate needs of hospitals while setting the foundation for broader Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) security.

As part of the acquisition, Cynerio co-founder and CEO, Leon Lerman, will join Axonius as senior vice president. Co-founder Daniel Brodie will join the Office of the CTO. The Cynerio team joins Axonius to accelerate the company’s expansion into the healthcare
