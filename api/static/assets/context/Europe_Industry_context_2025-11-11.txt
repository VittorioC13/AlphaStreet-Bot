[TITLE]LBA Systems to Build TB2, TB3, Akinci and Kizilelma UCAVs in Italy:
[TEXT]
Leonardo identified three locations in Italy to build the Baykar aircraft, supported by R&D, innovation, engineering and certification centers.

Leonardo and Baykar’s joint venture LBA Systems will build the latter’s flagship UCAV products, the TB2, TB3, Akinci and Kizilelma, at three different locations in Italy, said Leonardo in a presentation of third quarter 2025 results on Nov. 5, 2025.

As part of this plan, Grottaglie in the southeast will undertake composite manufacturing of the Kizilelma; Ronchi da Legionari in the northeast will see the manufacturing and final assembly of Leonardo’s Mirach Baykar’s TB3 drones; and Villanova d’Albenga in the northwest will carry out the final assembly of the Akinci and the TB2.

Villanova d’Albenga would be a Baykar facility, according to an illustrated graphic in the presentation, while the nearby Turin site and another facility in Rome would carry out “engineering and certification” and “multi-domain technologies innovation,” respectively. Leonardo lists LBA Systems among the “Large Scale Initiatives,” alongside Leonardo Rheinmetall Military Vehicles, the Global Combat Air Program (GCAP) and the acquisition of Iveco Defence.

Drone production plans in Italy

There had been direct hints at the JV possibly identifying Baykar’s Kizilelma and Akinci to be customized by Leonardo for the European market, both in Baykar and Leonardo chiefs Haluk Bayraktar and Roberto Cingolani statements during the Mar. 6 press conference. This was followed by the visit of the large Italian government, military and Leonardo delegation, who were shown extensive demonstrations of the Kizilelma and the Akinci.

The Q3 report cited “ongoing activities to ensure regulatory approval” for the new production activities. Interestingly, the plant at Grottaglie, that would produce Baykar’s Kizilelma, also currently builds composite fuselage barrel sections for the Boeing 787 widebody aircraft.

“It’s going to be our universal adjunct fighter that can be coupled to any machine as long as you can develop the electronics for the controls and this is of course what we do,” Cingolani said according to FlightGlobal. The Ronchi dei Legionari facility, that would build the TB3s, was described by Cingolani as a “cash-cow in this category of machines”, alongside the revival of the Italian firm’s Mirach platform.

BAYKAR VE LEONARDO KIZILELMA’NIN İTALYA’DA ORTAK ÜRETİMİNE HAZIRLANIYOR Flight Global’ın haberine göre; İtalyan savunma şirketi Leonardo, Baykar Teknoloji ile kurduğu ortak girişim LBA Systems kapsamında, Kızılelma insansız savaş uçağı dâhil olmak üzere beş farklı İHA modelini… pic.twitter.com/xuYaGS0yuT — SAVTEK Dergi (@savtekdergi) November 8, 2025

The image used to represent the Mirach drone system in the Q3 results document looks like Leonardo’s Mirach 100/5. The company describes it as a “high performance, reusable Aerial Target System,” and the “standard European Armed Forces threat simulator.”

It has a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) of 330 kg, an endurance of 90 minutes and a payload of 70 kg. Because of this, Cingolani said the Mirach 100/5 acts “more like a missile than a standard drone.”

FlightGlobal also revealed that the Villanova d’Albenga plant now owned by Baykar is the same that formerly belonged to Piaggio Aerospace, whose ownership was transferred to Baykar after the Turkish firm acquired it. “We are making all the necessary investments and upgrades of the production lines. We are working on the integration and as soon as the regulatory issues are fixed – and we are working daily with the authorities, including the ministry of defence – I believe that already next year the first product will be delivered to the market,” Cingolani further said.

Fusing Turkish drones with European systems

As we had reported previously, the partnership between the Italian and Turkish companies envisages combining Baykar’s expertise in the design, development and production of unmanned aerial systems and Leonardo’s lead in mission systems, payload design, sensor fusion, C4I systems and aerospace certification in Europe. Products evolved in the partnership will target both European and global markets, with plans to also look at space technologies.

The subsequent tie up between Turkish Aerospace Industries and U.K.’s BAE Systems follows the same industrial-commercial template, for the growing need for autonomous UCAVs and wingmen drones that would be actively sought in the future. Either companies’ R&D and production capacities singularly would be inadequate to meet the massive demand.

The Turkish Kizilema, with extensive European avionics and sensors from Leonardo, could also very well be pitched as a CCA not only for the upcoming GCAP, but also the Eurofighter Tranche 5. The Q3 report said: “In the meanwhile, Leonardo is progressing in assessing the future integration between payloads and platforms – along all classes (from tactical to UCAV1).” We can expect LBA Systems to release a concept rendition over the next year of the new Kizilelma with Leonardo’s systems.

Kizilelma is also advancing

The Kizilelma, billed as Baykar’s most sophisticated UCAV and poised to be the collaborative UCAV for the Kaan fighter, is also making waves, after early in October it live fired the TOLUN and TEBER-82 guided bombs. Since late October, Baykar has released extensive footage of prototype TC-OZB5 (the fifth prototype or PT-5), flying with the MURAD-100A AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar.

Test flights with the system have taken place at least twice. Aircraft PT-5 is also integrated with the TOYGUN 100 EOTS (Electro-Optical Tracking System) under the chin. Footage from inside the Kizilelma’s ground control center shows one screen featuring the interface capturing the MURAD’s radar detection range, which Turkish sources put at 200 km.

I don’t want to comment too much on range, but there’s one thing Aselsan and Baykar want to emphasize through the official video: Kızılelma locked onto a target well over 200km away with its Murad-100A AESA radar. Disregarding the target’s RCS, I can say that the Murad AESA and… https://t.co/RV3ayQP5TP pic.twitter.com/9NQUu7QfHA — TR_tech (@T_Nblty) October 21, 2025

Poised to carry the Gökdoğan BVR and Bozdoğan WVR AAMs, as well as a variety of future longer-ranged missiles, the Kizilelma meets the bare minimum off-board sensing, and off-board criteria.

The latter would be validated only after a live air-to-air missile test with the MURAD. Even without the missile, the Kizilelma is said to offer a flexible persistent unmanned AEW&C capability. An AAM-armed version can impose a significant amount of air-denial on a certain sector, or at least complicate adversary plans.

[TITLE]Central Asian Airlines Order $7 Billion Worth of Boeing 787s in Historic Fleet Expansion:
[TEXT]
Boeing secured a series of major aircraft deals worth more than $7 billion from Central Asian airlines during the C5+1 Summit in Washington, D.C., marking a transformative moment for the region’s aviation industry. Air Astana, Somon Air, and Uzbekistan Airways collectively committed to purchasing up to 37 Boeing aircraft, including 26 of the fuel-efficient 787 Dreamliners, signaling ambitious plans to position Central Asia as a critical transit hub between East and West.

The announcements, made at the 10th anniversary summit of the diplomatic platform linking the United States with five Central Asian nations, represent the largest coordinated aircraft purchase in the region’s history and underscore growing confidence in Central Asia’s aviation potential.

Air Astana’s Record-Breaking Order

Kazakhstan’s flag carrier Air Astana announced its largest-ever aircraft purchase, agreeing to acquire up to 15 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in a deal that will grow the airline’s widebody fleet to as many as 18 aircraft. The order includes five firm commitments, five options, and five purchase rights, with deliveries scheduled between 2032 and 2035.

“Air Astana is strategically committed to boosting its service capabilities from Central Asia/Caucasus to Asia, Europe and the rest of the world over the next decade,” said Peter Foster, CEO of Air Astana. “With its customer friendly cabin, fuel efficiency and range flexibility, the fleet of up to 18 Boeing 787-9 aircraft is destined to become an outstanding success with the airline and its discerning passengers.”

The expansion builds on Air Astana’s existing commitment to three 787-9s arriving via lessors in 2026-2027, bringing the potential total fleet to 18 Dreamliners. The airline currently operates three Boeing 767-300ER widebody jets connecting Kazakhstan with destinations across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

The new aircraft will enable Air Astana to launch direct routes to North America while enhancing capacity on existing long-haul services. The carrier, which describes itself as Central Asia’s leading airline by revenue and fleet size, has operated Boeing aircraft since its founding in 2002.

Somon Air’s Breakthrough into Long-Haul Market

Tajikistan’s Somon Air made aviation history by placing its first-ever widebody aircraft order, committing to up to 14 Boeing aircraft including four 787-9 Dreamliners and ten 737 MAX 8 jets. The deal represents the airline’s largest-ever aircraft commitment and marks its entry into intercontinental operations.

“This significant investment not only marks our first widebody order but also reinforces our dedication to providing exceptional service and comfort to our passengers,” said Abdulkosim Valiev, CEO of Somon Air. “With flexibility built into this commitment, Somon Air can adjust its fleet further based on market demand.”

Currently operating six Next-Generation 737 aircraft to 25 destinations across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, Somon Air plans to use the 787-9s to launch new intercontinental routes from Dushanbe to Europe and North America. The 737 MAX 8 aircraft will modernize the carrier’s short and medium-haul operations while providing a 20-25% reduction in fuel burn compared to their predecessors.

Uzbekistan Airways Expands Dreamliner Fleet

Uzbekistan Airways converted existing purchase options into firm orders for eight Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, bringing its total order book for the widebody aircraft to 22 units. The signing ceremony was witnessed by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Uzbekistan’s Minister of Investment, Industry and Trade Laziz Kudratov.

The order builds on a significant fleet expansion agreement announced in September 2025, when Uzbekistan Airways initially ordered 14 787-9s with options for eight additional aircraft. The airline now has one of the largest 787 order books among Central Asian carriers.

“The Boeing 787 Dreamliner family has proven to be the cornerstone of our long-haul operations,” said Uzbekistan Airways Chairman Shukhrat Khudaikulov. “With this new contract, we are further strengthening both our airline’s and our nation’s position as a leading aviation hub in Central Asia, while providing our passengers with greater global connectivity.”

Uzbekistan Airways is currently the only Central Asian airline operating long-haul Boeing 787 Dreamliners, having successfully used the aircraft for almost a decade. The carrier operates international services to Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and North America, including routes to New York JFK and Resende, Brazil.

Strategic Geographic Positioning

The coordinated aircraft orders reflect Central Asia’s strategic positioning as a natural bridge between European, Asian, and Middle Eastern markets. The region’s carriers are capitalizing on their geographic advantage to develop hub-and-spoke operations that can compete with established Middle Eastern airlines.

“For the first time, Central Asia’s airlines are thinking globally,” observed a senior aviation analyst in Almaty. “With long-range aircraft such as the 787-9 entering service, airlines like Air Astana, Uzbekistan Airways and Somon Air will soon operate non-stop flights to Europe, North America and the Far East, routes that once required stopovers.”

The geographic positioning allows Central Asian carriers to offer competitive routings between Europe and Asia, potentially capturing transit traffic that currently flows through Dubai, Doha, and Istanbul.

Economic and Political Context

The deals were announced during the C5+1 Summit, a diplomatic platform established in 2015 that promotes cooperation between the United States and the five Central Asian republics: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The summit marked the 10th anniversary of the platform, celebrating a decade of progress in regional diplomacy, sustainable development, and economic cooperation.

For Boeing, the timing aligns with broader U.S. strategy to showcase American exports as a cornerstone of Washington’s engagement with the region. The combined orders are expected to support more than 20,000 jobs across the United States, according to Boeing estimates.

The deals also represent a significant vote of confidence in Boeing’s 787 program, which has established itself as the best-selling widebody aircraft in history with more than 2,250 orders from 90 customers worldwide.

Fleet Modernization and Efficiency Gains

The 787 Dreamliner offers Central Asian carriers significant operational advantages, including 20-25% better fuel efficiency compared to previous generation aircraft, extended range capabilities, and enhanced passenger comfort features. The aircraft’s advanced composite construction and efficient engines make it particularly attractive for airlines seeking to reduce operating costs while expanding route networks.

Paul Righi, Boeing Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Eurasia and India, emphasized the strategic value of the aircraft for regional carriers. “The versatility of the 787-9, combined with its outstanding performance, range, and operating economics, provides these airlines with the essential tools needed to scale their operations effectively.”

The fuel efficiency gains are particularly important for Central Asian carriers operating in a competitive international environment where operational costs can determine route viability.

Looking Ahead

The Central Asian Boeing orders represent more than fleet renewal, they signal the region’s emergence as a serious player in global aviation. With strategic geographic positioning, modern aircraft, and growing government support, Central Asian carriers are positioning themselves to compete effectively in international markets.

The success of these ambitious expansion plans will depend on the airlines’ ability to develop sustainable route networks, build brand recognition in international markets, and effectively utilize their geographic advantages to attract both point-to-point and transit passengers.

As Boeing continues production ramp-up at its South Carolina facility, the Central Asian orders contribute to the strong global demand for the 787 program while supporting American aerospace manufacturing jobs. The deals underscore the 787’s position as the preferred aircraft for airlines seeking to modernize fleets and expand global connectivity in an increasingly competitive aviation market.

[TITLE]The second coming of steel: New tycoons rise where the ‘dirty dozen’ fell:
[TEXT]
Mumbai: At the beginning of 2025, Maharashtra-based mining company Lloyds Metals and Energy Ltd made headlines for granting stock options to its blue-collar workers, including some former Maoists, as it sought to foster a sense of ownership in its workforce.

The company’s gesture made for a heartwarming story. But what didn’t garner as much attention was the news that Lloyds Metals and Energy is one of the few companies to have entered the steel sector in the last two decades. The company is setting up steel plants in Gadchiroli and Chandrapur districts in Maharashtra at a cost of ₹20,000-25,000 crore.

Lloyds is not alone; many other companies have entered the steel sector, lured by the prospects of a rapidly growing India needing the alloy to make roads, railways, infrastructure and houses for millions. They include ACME Group, a renewable energy company; Synergy Capital, which is backed by former ArcelorMittal dealmaker Sudhir Maheshwari; and Nithia Capital, which is headed by former Mittal Steel executive Jai Saraf.

Mint’s analysis reveals that the four companies have announced plans to invest upwards of ₹37,000 crore over the next few years either in primary steel manufacturing or elsewhere in the supply chain. In addition, two existing smaller companies, Shyam Metalics and Energy Ltd and Rashmi Group, have committed to invest ₹10,000 crore each to bolster their operations.

Existing large steelmakers, too, are betting aggressively on the market expanding. India’s five largest steelmakers are expected to add upwards of 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of capacity by 2030. This compares to installed capacity of

[TEXT]
Worldline on Thursday unveiled plans to raise 500 million euros ($583 million) by tapping some of France's biggest banks to fund a strategy aimed at turning around the payments firm following years of setbacks.

The two-stage capital increase will begin with a 110-million-euro reserved share sale to Bpifrance, Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas, followed by a 390-million-euro rights issue open to all shareholders.

The three lenders have committed to subscribe around 135 million euros to the rights issue.

Upon completion of the capital raise, expected in the first quarter of 2026, Bpifrance will hold a 9.6 per cent stake in Worldline, Credit Agricole will own 9.5 per cent, with BNP Paribas at 7.9 per cent.

[TEXT]
U.S. airlines canceled more than 2,500 weekend flights by Saturday evening as the Federal Aviation Administration’s mandate to reduce air traffic because of the government shutdown showed no signs of easing.

The slowdown at many of the nation’s busiest airports did not cause immediate widespread disruptions. But it deepened the impact felt by the nation’s longest federal shutdown.

“We all travel. We all have somewhere to be,” said Emmy Holguin, 36, who was flying from Miami to see family in the Dominican Republic. “I’m hoping that the government can take care of this.”

Analysts warn that the upheaval will intensify and spread far beyond air travel if cancellations keep growing and reach into Thanksgiving week.

WASHINGTON — A “substantial” number of Americans will likely miss Thanksgiving with their families because of air-travel snarls thanks to the government shutdown, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned Sunday.

“Yesterday, 18 to 22 controllers in Atlanta didn’t show up. We had 81 staffing [shortage] ‘triggers’ throughout the national airspace yesterday,” Duffy told CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“It’s only going to get worse. I look to the two weeks before Thanksgiving, you’re going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle,” he said.

Air-traffic controllers have been forced to work without pay since Oct. 1 because of the ongoing government shutdown, which reached its historic 40th day Sunday.

As a result, many of the controllers have had to pick up alternative gigs such as with Uber and DoorDash to make ends meet. Others are calling in sick or simply retiring early.

“I used to have about four controllers retire a day before the shutdown. I’m now up to 15 to 20 a day that are retiring,” Duffy said. “So it’s going to be harder for me to come back from that and have more controllers controlling the airspace.”

Before the shutdown, Duffy had been scrambling to modernize the country’s air-traffic-control system and rapidly train new controllers to deal with staffing shortages.

The transportation secretary warned that even after the end of the government shutdown, there will be lasting consequences from the closure on the air industry.

Last week, Duffy warned that up to 20% of flights could be scrapped in the coming weeks if the government shutdown rages on. Nearly 2,000 flights were cancelled Saturday, according to FlightAware.

Despite the government-shutdown-induced staffing snarls, Duffy stressed that air travel is still safe.

“We’re working overtime to make sure that it is safe to travel,” he said. “And so if we have staffing triggers in all locations, what we’ll do is we will slow traffic, which means you’ll have delays, and then airlines might cancel flights.”

All of this will likely come to a head around Thanksgiving, which is one of the busiest travel times of the year in the US.

“Many [wannabe fliers] are not going to be able to get on an airplane because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if this thing doesn’t open back up,” Duffy said.

4 Officials are struggling to deal with staffing shortages. AP

“We have controllers who, again, are making decisions to feed their families,” he said. “The problem is, they’re confronted with real economic problems.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) has announced plans to keep the upper chamber in session until lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.

[TITLE]Six FIDs, $72 Billion: U.S. LNG’s Record-Breaking Year:
[TEXT]
Despite rising project costs, developers are successfully negotiating up to 15% higher liquefaction fees because buyers in Europe and Asia are willing to pay a premium to secure American LNG supply and reduce dependence on Russian gas.

Encouraged by market conditions, U.S. developers have made final investment decisions (FIDs) on six export projects this year, contributing to a record global LNG finance tally of $72 billion.

American LNG developers have signed sales and purchase agreements for 29.5 million metric tons per year in 2025, a volume that has more than quadrupled compared to the entirety of 2024.

Europe’s rush to shake off Russian gas dependence and Asia’s push to buy higher volumes of American energy while negotiating trade deals have created a booming export deal market for U.S. LNG exporters and developers, even at increased liquefaction fees.

Year to date, American LNG developers have signed sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) for existing and future export plants for a total of 29.5 million metric tons per year, according to data from consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group cited by Reuters.

The volume of newly contracted U.S. LNG more than quadrupled between January and October compared to the 7 million metric tons per year (mtpa) contracted for the whole of 2024.

The U.S. LNG industry is now on track to have signed the second-highest export volumes on record, trailing only 2022, when buyers in Europe turned en masse to American gas as Russian pipeline supply to Europe slumped and stopped for many EU markets, including Germany.

Encouraged by the Trump Administration’s energy policy, LNG developers are taking advantage of the market and regulatory tailwinds to approve investments in new projects.

So far this year, Australia’s Woodside has announced the FID for the Louisiana LNG project and plans to start production in 2029. In July, Venture Global took FID and successfully closed the $15.1 billion project financing for the first phase of the company’s third project, CP2 LNG, together with the associated CP Express Pipeline. Top U.S. exporter Cheniere has made a positive FID for the Corpus Christi Midscale Trains 8 & 9 and Debottlenecking Project. NextDecade has decided to invest $6.7 billion in the expansion of its Rio Grande LNG facility in Texas, in the second Rio Grande expansion announced this year, while Sempra approved a $14 billion Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion.

U.S. developers of six export projects have made FIDs and secured financing so far this year, bringing total global LNG finance to a record of $72 billion, energy commodity shipping broker and advisor Poten & Partners said last month.

“Six US FIDs in one year is unprecedented– the highest number before this year was three US projects. The liquefaction finance tally could continue to climb in the final quarter of this year as a few more projects – also in the US – appear to be nearing FID,” Poten & Partners said.

In the near term, the U.S. is set to add 5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in LNG export capacity in 2025 and 2026 alone, as Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage 3 projects come online, the Energy Information Administration said in its Short-Term Energy Outlook in October. Additions to LNG export capacity are set to boost total U.S. LNG exports to 14.7 Bcf/d in 2025 and to 16.3 Bcf/d in 2026, up from 11.9 Bcf/d in 2024, according to the EIA estimates.

The surge in U.S. LNG exports and the expected jump in Qatari LNG shipments once Qatar’s mega expansion projects are completed in 2027 have stoked fears of a coming LNG glut that could depress prices.

U.S. developers appear unfazed by this prospect and are even raising their liquefaction fees as project costs soar amid persistent higher financing rates, labor shortages, and an increase in prices of materials.

In March this year, most U.S. liquefaction fees were being discussed at $2.65 per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) to $2.95 per MMBtu, “as EPC cost escalations show no sign of abating,” Poten & Partners said at the time.

“Higher raw material prices, which are seeing further escalation because of tariffs, coupled with rising labor and financing costs are having a pronounced impact on US LNG liquefaction project implementation. The cost increases make it challenging for developers to keep engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts valid as they try to move ahead with their LNG export projects,” the broker and advisor said.

Now U.S. LNG exporters and developers are asking about 15% higher liquefaction fees compared to the 2023 average of about $2 per MMBtu, Poten & Partners business intelligence head Jason Feer told Reuters this week.

And they are so far getting these higher fees in new contracts. Buyers are still willing to pay higher liquefaction fees to secure American LNG, which is seen in Europe as a means to cut off Russian supply by 2027 and in Asia as a lever to pull in tariff and trade deal talks with the Trump Administration.

[TITLE]How Britain’s Wind Boom Has Slashed Energy Bills:
[TEXT]
The United Kingdom has rapidly developed its wind energy sector over the last two decades to become one of the biggest wind power producers worldwide. As the government aims to accelerate the green transition through greater investment in renewable energies and upgrading the national grid, the U.K.’s wind sector is expected to continue growing substantially in the coming decades. Meanwhile, recent studies suggest that the deployment of more wind power has helped significantly reduce consumer energy bills.

There is approximately 15.7 GW of operational onshore wind power in the U.K., with an increase of 739 MW in 2024 through the development of projects such as the Viking (443MW), Kype Muir Extension (67.2MW), and Broken Cross (43.2MW) windfarms. In 2024, 77 onshore wind projects submitted for planning permission, a slight reduction from the 83 submissions in 2023, but far higher than the 44 submissions in 2022.

The U.K. is expected to achieve 26 GW of onshore wind by 2030, which is 3.1 GW below the target established in the U.K. Government’s Clean Power 2030 Action Plan (CP30), according to a forecasting model by EnergyPulse. The wind industry also employs around 55,000 people, a figure that is set to double to around 110,000 by the end of the decade.

The U.K. has an operational offshore wind capacity of around 14.7 GW. Construction is currently underway on six projects with a total capacity of 6.3 GW, and three of these projects have a generating capacity of 2.5 GW, with development expected to be completed in 2025. Two more (2.5GW) operators will commence offshore construction this year. There were 14 planning applications for offshore wind projects submitted in 2024, with a total capacity of 15.4 GW, making for a total offshore wind capacity pipeline of 22.85 GW. The U.K.’s offshore wind capacity is expected to reach 41.5 GW by the end of 2030, including 1.2 GW of floating wind capacity.

Wind energy was the U.K.’s largest source of electricity generation in the final quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, making it the longest stretch of time on record where renewable energy contributed more power generation than that of fossil fuels. In Q1 of 2024, wind energy generation totalled 25.3 terawatt hours (TWh), compared to 23.6 TWh from all fossil fuel sources. Wind power contributed an average of 39.4 percent of total electricity production in this period. This marked a major turning point for the U.K., which has long relied on fossil fuels for power.

In addition to helping the U.K. to achieve a green transition, it seems that wind power is also saving consumers billions, according to a recent study. An analysis from University College London (UCL) found that between 2010 and 2023, wind-generated energy decreased electricity bills by $18.7 billion and reduced the cost of natural gas by $175 billion. When green subsidies of $56.8 billion paid by consumers are factored in, it results in a total reduction of $137 billion in U.K. consumer energy bills over 13 years.

[TITLE]New U.S. nuclear power boom begins with old, still-unsolved problem: What to do with radioactive waste:
[TEXT]

Nuclear power is back, largely due to the skyrocketing demand for electricity, including big tech's hundreds of artificial intelligence data centers across the country and the reshoring of manufacturing. But it returns with an old and still-unsolved problem: storing all of the radioactive waste created as a byproduct of nuclear power generation. In May, President Trump issued executive orders aimed at quadrupling the current nuclear output over the next 25 years by accelerating construction of both large conventional reactors and next-gen small modular reactors. Last week, the U.S. signed a deal with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the country that could result in Westinghouse attempting to spinoff and IPO a stand-alone nuclear power company with the federal government as a shareholder. There's a growing consensus among governments, businesses and the public that the time is right for a nuclear power renaissance, and even if the ambitious build-out could take a decade or more and cost hundreds of billion of dollars, it will be an eventual boon to legacy and start-up nuclear energy companies, the AI-fixated wing of the tech industry and investors banking on their success. But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. Only two nuclear power plants have been built since 1990 — more than $15 billion over budget and years behind schedule — and they went online in just the last two years. Almost all of the 94 reactors currently operating in 28 states, generating

[TITLE]LBA Systems to Build TB2, TB3, Akinci and Kizilelma UCAVs in Italy:
[TEXT]
Leonardo identified three locations in Italy to build the Baykar aircraft, supported by R&D, innovation, engineering and certification centers.

Leonardo and Baykar’s joint venture LBA Systems will build the latter’s flagship UCAV products, the TB2, TB3, Akinci and Kizilelma, at three different locations in Italy, said Leonardo in a presentation of third quarter 2025 results on Nov. 5, 2025.

As part of this plan, Grottaglie in the southeast will undertake composite manufacturing of the Kizilelma; Ronchi da Legionari in the northeast will see the manufacturing and final assembly of Leonardo’s Mirach Baykar’s TB3 drones; and Villanova d’Albenga in the northwest will carry out the final assembly of the Akinci and the TB2.

Villanova d’Albenga would be a Baykar facility, according to an illustrated graphic in the presentation, while the nearby Turin site and another facility in Rome would carry out “engineering and certification” and “multi-domain technologies innovation,” respectively. Leonardo lists LBA Systems among the “Large Scale Initiatives,” alongside Leonardo Rheinmetall Military Vehicles, the Global Combat Air Program (GCAP) and the acquisition of Iveco Defence.

Drone production plans in Italy

There had been direct hints at the JV possibly identifying Baykar’s Kizilelma and Akinci to be customized by Leonardo for the European market, both in Baykar and Leonardo chiefs Haluk Bayraktar and Roberto Cingolani statements during the Mar. 6 press conference. This was followed by the visit of the large Italian government, military and Leonardo delegation, who were shown extensive demonstrations of the Kizilelma and the Akinci.

The Q3 report cited “ongoing activities to ensure regulatory approval” for the new production activities. Interestingly, the plant at Grottaglie, that would produce Baykar’s Kizilelma, also currently builds composite fuselage barrel sections for the Boeing 787 widebody aircraft.

“It’s going to be our universal adjunct fighter that can be coupled to any machine as long as you can develop the electronics for the controls and this is of course what we do,” Cingolani said according to FlightGlobal. The Ronchi dei Legionari facility, that would build the TB3s, was described by Cingolani as a “cash-cow in this category of machines”, alongside the revival of the Italian firm’s Mirach platform.

The image used to represent the Mirach drone system in the Q3 results document looks like Leonardo’s Mirach 100/5. The company describes it as a “high performance, reusable Aerial Target System,” and the “standard European Armed Forces threat simulator.”

It has a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) of 330 kg, an endurance of 90 minutes and a payload of 70 kg. Because of this, Cingolani said the Mirach 100/5 acts “more like a missile than a standard drone.”

FlightGlobal also revealed that the Villanova d’Albenga plant now owned by Baykar is the same that formerly belonged to Piaggio Aerospace, whose ownership was transferred to Baykar after the Turkish firm acquired it. “We are making all the necessary investments and upgrades of the production lines. We are working on the integration and as soon as the regulatory issues are fixed – and we are working daily with the authorities, including the ministry of defence – I believe that already next year the first product will be delivered to the market,” Cingolani further said.

Fusing Turkish drones with European systems

As we had reported previously, the partnership between the Italian and Turkish companies envisages combining Baykar’s expertise in the design, development and production of unmanned aerial systems and Leonardo’s lead in mission systems, payload design, sensor fusion, C4I systems and aerospace certification in Europe. Products evolved in the partnership will target both European and global markets, with plans to also look at space technologies.

The subsequent tie up between Turkish Aerospace Industries and U.K.’s BAE Systems follows the same industrial-commercial template, for the growing need for autonomous UCAVs and wingmen drones that would be actively sought in the future. Either companies’ R&D and production capacities singularly would be inadequate to meet the massive demand.

The Turkish Kizilema, with extensive European avionics and sensors from Leonardo, could also very well be pitched as a CCA not only for the upcoming GCAP, but also the Eurofighter Tranche 5. The Q3 report said: “In the meanwhile, Leonardo is progressing in assessing the future integration between payloads and platforms – along all classes (from tactical to UCAV1).” We can expect LBA Systems to release a concept rendition over the next year of the new Kizilelma with Leonardo’s systems.

Kizilelma is also advancing

The Kizilelma, billed as Baykar’s most sophisticated UCAV and poised to be the collaborative UCAV for the Kaan fighter, is also making waves, after early in October it live fired the TOLUN and TEBER-82 guided bombs. Since late October, Baykar has released extensive footage of prototype TC-OZB5 (the fifth prototype or PT-5), flying with the MURAD-100A AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar.

Test flights with the system have taken place at least twice. Aircraft PT-5 is also integrated with the TOYGUN 100 EOTS (Electro-Optical Tracking System) under the chin. Footage from inside the Kizilelma’s ground control center shows one screen featuring the interface capturing the MURAD’s radar detection range, which Turkish sources put at 200 km.

I don’t want to comment too much on range, but there’s one thing Aselsan and Baykar want to emphasize through the official video: Kızılelma locked onto a target well over 200km away with its Murad-100A AESA radar. Disregarding the target’s RCS, I can say that the Murad AESA and… https://t.co/RV3ayQP5TP pic.twitter.com/9NQUu7QfHA — TR_tech (@T_Nblty) October 21, 2025

Poised to carry the Gökdoğan BVR and Bozdoğan WVR AAMs, as well as a variety of future longer-ranged missiles, the Kizilelma meets the bare minimum off-board sensing, and off-board criteria.

The latter would be validated only after a live air-to-air missile test with the MURAD. Even without the missile, the Kizilelma is said to offer a flexible persistent unmanned AEW&C capability. An AAM-armed version can impose a significant amount of air-denial on a certain sector, or at least complicate adversary plans.

[TITLE]Central Asian Airlines Order $7 Billion Worth of Boeing 787s in Historic Fleet Expansion:
[TEXT]
Boeing secured a series of major aircraft deals worth more than $7 billion from Central Asian airlines during the C5+1 Summit in Washington, D.C., marking a transformative moment for the region’s aviation industry. Air Astana, Somon Air, and Uzbekistan Airways collectively committed to purchasing up to 37 Boeing aircraft, including 26 of the fuel-efficient 787 Dreamliners, signaling ambitious plans to position Central Asia as a critical transit hub between East and West.

The announcements, made at the 10th anniversary summit of the diplomatic platform linking the United States with five Central Asian nations, represent the largest coordinated aircraft purchase in the region’s history and underscore growing confidence in Central Asia’s aviation potential.

Air Astana’s Record-Breaking Order

Kazakhstan’s flag carrier Air Astana announced its largest-ever aircraft purchase, agreeing to acquire up to 15 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in a deal that will grow the airline’s widebody fleet to as many as 18 aircraft. The order includes five firm commitments, five options, and five purchase rights, with deliveries scheduled between 2032 and 2035.

“Air Astana is strategically committed to boosting its service capabilities from Central Asia/Caucasus to Asia, Europe and the rest of the world over the next decade,” said Peter Foster, CEO of Air Astana. “With its customer friendly cabin, fuel efficiency and range flexibility, the fleet of up to 18 Boeing 787-9 aircraft is destined to become an outstanding success with the airline and its discerning passengers.”

The expansion builds on Air Astana’s existing commitment to three 787-9s arriving via lessors in 2026-2027, bringing the potential total fleet to 18 Dreamliners. The airline currently operates three Boeing 767-300ER widebody jets connecting Kazakhstan with destinations across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

The new aircraft will enable Air Astana to launch direct routes to North America while enhancing capacity on existing long-haul services. The carrier, which describes itself as Central Asia’s leading airline by revenue and fleet size, has operated Boeing aircraft since its founding in 2002.

Somon Air’s Breakthrough into Long-Haul Market

Tajikistan’s Somon Air made aviation history by placing its first-ever widebody aircraft order, committing to up to 14 Boeing aircraft including four 787-9 Dreamliners and ten 737 MAX 8 jets. The deal represents the airline’s largest-ever aircraft commitment and marks its entry into intercontinental operations.

“This significant investment not only marks our first widebody order but also reinforces our dedication to providing exceptional service and comfort to our passengers,” said Abdulkosim Valiev, CEO of Somon Air. “With flexibility built into this commitment, Somon Air can adjust its fleet further based on market demand.”

Currently operating six Next-Generation 737 aircraft to 25 destinations across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, Somon Air plans to use the 787-9s to launch new intercontinental routes from Dushanbe to Europe and North America. The 737 MAX 8 aircraft will modernize the carrier’s short and medium-haul operations while providing a 20-25% reduction in fuel burn compared to their predecessors.

Uzbekistan Airways Expands Dreamliner Fleet

Uzbekistan Airways converted existing purchase options into firm orders for eight Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, bringing its total order book for the widebody aircraft to 22 units. The signing ceremony was witnessed by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Uzbekistan’s Minister of Investment, Industry and Trade Laziz Kudratov.

The order builds on a significant fleet expansion agreement announced in September 2025, when Uzbekistan Airways initially ordered 14 787-9s with options for eight additional aircraft. The airline now has one of the largest 787 order books among Central Asian carriers.

“The Boeing 787 Dreamliner family has proven to be the cornerstone of our long-haul operations,” said Uzbekistan Airways Chairman Shukhrat Khudaikulov. “With this new contract, we are further strengthening both our airline’s and our nation’s position as a leading aviation hub in Central Asia, while providing our passengers with greater global connectivity.”

Uzbekistan Airways is currently the only Central Asian airline operating long-haul Boeing 787 Dreamliners, having successfully used the aircraft for almost a decade. The carrier operates international services to Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and North America, including routes to New York JFK and Resende, Brazil.

Strategic Geographic Positioning

The coordinated aircraft orders reflect Central Asia’s strategic positioning as a natural bridge between European, Asian, and Middle Eastern markets. The region’s carriers are capitalizing on their geographic advantage to develop hub-and-spoke operations that can compete with established Middle Eastern airlines.

“For the first time, Central Asia’s airlines are thinking globally,” observed a senior aviation analyst in Almaty. “With long-range aircraft such as the 787-9 entering service, airlines like Air Astana, Uzbekistan Airways and Somon Air will soon operate non-stop flights to Europe, North America and the Far East, routes that once required stopovers.”

The geographic positioning allows Central Asian carriers to offer competitive routings between Europe and Asia, potentially capturing transit traffic that currently flows through Dubai, Doha, and Istanbul.

Economic and Political Context

The deals were announced during the C5+1 Summit, a diplomatic platform established in 2015 that promotes cooperation between the United States and the five Central Asian republics: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The summit marked the 10th anniversary of the platform, celebrating a decade of progress in regional diplomacy, sustainable development, and economic cooperation.

For Boeing, the timing aligns with broader U.S. strategy to showcase American exports as a cornerstone of Washington’s engagement with the region. The combined orders are expected to support more than 20,000 jobs across the United States, according to Boeing estimates.

The deals also represent a significant vote of confidence in Boeing’s 787 program, which has established itself as the best-selling widebody aircraft in history with more than 2,250 orders from 90 customers worldwide.

Fleet Modernization and Efficiency Gains

The 787 Dreamliner offers Central Asian carriers significant operational advantages, including 20-25% better fuel efficiency compared to previous generation aircraft, extended range capabilities, and enhanced passenger comfort features. The aircraft’s advanced composite construction and efficient engines make it particularly attractive for airlines seeking to reduce operating costs while expanding route networks.

Paul Righi, Boeing Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Eurasia and India, emphasized the strategic value of the aircraft for regional carriers. “The versatility of the 787-9, combined with its outstanding performance, range, and operating economics, provides these airlines with the essential tools needed to scale their operations effectively.”

The fuel efficiency gains are particularly important for Central Asian carriers operating in a competitive international environment where operational costs can determine route viability.

Looking Ahead

The Central Asian Boeing orders represent more than fleet renewal, they signal the region’s emergence as a serious player in global aviation. With strategic geographic positioning, modern aircraft, and growing government support, Central Asian carriers are positioning themselves to compete effectively in international markets.

The success of these ambitious expansion plans will depend on the airlines’ ability to develop sustainable route networks, build brand recognition in international markets, and effectively utilize their geographic advantages to attract both point-to-point and transit passengers.

As Boeing continues production ramp-up at its South Carolina facility, the Central Asian orders contribute to the strong global demand for the 787 program while supporting American aerospace manufacturing jobs. The deals underscore the 787’s position as the preferred aircraft for airlines seeking to modernize fleets and expand global connectivity in an increasingly competitive aviation market.

[TITLE]How Airbus took off:
[TEXT]
Would you rather fly in an Airbus or a Boeing? It seems like an easy question.

As Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 flight climbed to 16,000 feet on a January evening in 2024, passengers were stunned when a hole was blasted in the side of the plane. They were hit by howling winds as tray tables were ripped from the backs of seats. Were it not for their seatbelts, they would likely have been sucked out of the plane. It later transpired that the plug which sealed the exit door was missing four critical bolts that held it in place.

The Alaska Airlines incident fortunately didn’t result in any fatalities. Not everyone who has flown on a Boeing 737 MAX in the last few years has been so lucky.

2018 and 2019 saw two 737 crashes that killed 346 people after the plane’s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, a feature that pushes the plane’s nose down to prevent stalling, triggered repeatedly due to a faulty sensor. It later transpired that Boeing had not adequately disclosed how the system worked in training manuals.

While Boeing wrestles with lawsuits and regulatory investigations, its rival Airbus has stayed out of the headlines – a happier place for the manufacturer of commercial airliners.

Airbus is the rare success story. European governments pooled resources and subsidized their champion aggressively to face down a titan of American capitalism in a strategically vital sector. Why did Airbus succeed when so many similar initiatives crashed and burned?

Airbus prevailed because it was the least European version of a European industrial strategy project ever. It put its customer first, was uninterested in being seen as European, had leadership willing to risk political blowback in the pursuit of a good product, and operated in a unique industry.

An industry on the brink

In the early days of commercial aviation, US aerospace companies dominated the market for passenger jets.

The Buy America Act of 1933 forced the US government to buy from American producers where possible. Military orders supercharged the industry and brought significant knowledge spillovers.

The Boeing B-47 bomber, introduced in the late 1940s, pioneered the use of 35-degree swept wings, which point backwards at an angle of 35 degrees and reduce drag at high speeds. This design went on to inspire nearly every commercial airliner around the world.

Meanwhile the Boeing 707, the company’s first ever airliner, derived its fuselage from the same prototype as the KC-135 Stratotanker, a military refueling aircraft.

In the face of the US, European aerospace companies cut a sorry figure. The British Aircraft Corporation, Sud Aviation in France, and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) in West Germany were all left to compete for orders in a fragmented continental market, with little research or marketing heft. Meanwhile, European airliners who bought American planes could apply for discounted loans from EXIM, the America’s credit export agency.

Between 1960 and 1967, British and French manufacturers saw a 50 percent decline in aircraft deliveries. In 1966, the UK government had even contemplated forcibly merging and nationalizing much of the country’s industry.

European governments had poured money into their national champions in the belief that the maintenance of a civilian aerospace industry was critical for sovereignty, but it was unclear if these companies would survive the decade.

Amid this gloomy backdrop, European governments concluded that their industry’s future depended on cooperation.

The UK and France agreed to pool the resources behind Concorde in 1962 to fight what Charles De Gaulle called ‘the American colonization of the skies’, but the Germans declined to participate due to their (well-founded) skepticism
