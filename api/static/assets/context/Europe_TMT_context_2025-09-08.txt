France pushes into Taiwan's chip ecosystem with advanced packaging focus and new Foxconn tie-up

France is preparing its biggest foray yet into Asia's semiconductor heartland. At SEMICON Taipei next week, Paris will field its largest industrial delegation on record, a move that signals an ambition to plant itself firmly in the global supply chain—not through wafer fabs, but through advanced packaging.

At a recent briefing in Taipei, Franck Paris, director of the French Office, also offered new details on Foxconn's planned €250 million packaging facility in France.

A record French pavilion

The "Choose France Pavilion," first introduced at SEMICON Taiwan last year, will return in force. At least 15 companies and more than 60 delegates will represent France, the largest footprint ever at the trade fair. The group spans established names such as STMicroelectronics and Veolia, alongside start-ups working on design automation, nanometric manufacturing and quantum technologies.

The mission's reach extends beyond business. A French senator, officials from the economy ministry and a large team from CEA-Leti—the country's leading microelectronics research institute, now with a permanent presence in Taiwan—will all join. Academic workshops will touch on spintronics and circuit energy supply, areas that France hopes to turn into long-term strengths.

Why packaging, not fabs

Unlike Germany, which secured TSMC's first European wafer fab, France has chosen a different role. "Our priority is to upgrade advanced packaging," Mr Paris said, calling it the most innovative part of the industry.

The reasoning is partly strategic: France's defence and aerospace sectors require specialised chips with unusual resilience and reliability. More broadly, splitting manufacturing in Germany and packaging in France offers, in Paris's view, a complementary foundation for Europe's semiconductor sovereignty.

Paris on TSMC

Much of Mr. Franck Paris's briefing touched—directly or indirectly—on TSMC, underscoring its gravitational pull in any European semiconductor discussion.

He pointed first to SiPearl's Rhea1 processor, a French-designed energy-efficient microchip that will be manufactured by TSMC. That choice, he said, illustrates both Europe's reliance on the Taiwanese foundry and the ambition to anchor French innovation in global supply chains.

Paris also recalled that when former Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen visited France in 2024, her delegation included TSMC executives. Their encounter with French start-ups, he said, was eye-opening—an initial recognition of the advanced capabilities embedded in France's ecosystem.

The comparison with Foxconn's €250 million packaging project was deliberate. France, he stressed, never sought "a jigger factory in the TSMC way." Whereas TSMC's megafabs in Arizona or its new site in Germany are built for massive, long-run volumes, France's near-term focus is advanced packaging for defense and aerospace, sectors where performance and resilience outweigh scale.

TSMC's presence in Germany, he added, has already spurred suppliers to expand into central Europe. By the same logic, Paris hopes Foxconn's footprint in France will act as a magnet for other Taiwanese partners.

When pressed on whether France is courting a TSMC fab, he was candid: "Everyone in the world wants TSMC to invest in this place," he said. "But we need to be realistic." For now, the national strategy is to build leadership in packaging, not to replicate TSMC's colossal fabs. Still, he left the invitation open: "If TSMC wants to come to France tomorrow, they will be welcome."

Foxconn's French footprint

Central to that effort is Foxconn's planned packaging facility, a joint venture with Thales and Radiall announced in May. The plant aims to produce 100 million modules annually by 2031, marking the first significant Taiwanese semiconductor investment in France.

Mr Paris said the project is already evolving:

Broader European participation is being discussed, with new partners expected to join before year's end. The site location will be settled in the same timeframe, with at least five French regions competing to host it. Construction is projected to take two years once chosen.

The scheme is undergoing EU review for subsidy approval, with Paris lobbying for swift clearance.

He described the investment as a "breakthrough" that could attract more Taiwanese suppliers to France, particularly those tied to Foxconn's ecosystem.

Other Franco-Taiwanese collaborations are already underway, including Soitec's work with PSMC on 3D stacking and Cathay Ventures' stake in SiPearl, the French firm designing a European GPU.

Strategic ties in a geopolitical moment

France's manoeuvre is more than industrial policy. It is part of Europe's broader attempt to hedge against supply shocks, a lesson learned during COVID-19 and reinforced by escalating US-China technology tensions. For Taiwan, which sits at the centre of those rivalries, the French overture offers another avenue of strategic partnership.

Mr. Franck Paris struck an optimistic note on the deepening ties, describing it as "a very exciting moment between France and Taiwan, and more broadly between Europe and Taiwan." He said the partnership now carries "real momentum at a time when the geopolitical context makes such cooperation especially meaningful," adding that the relationship is becoming "increasingly strategic."

[TITLE]Why La Liga clubs are spending less than rivals: Guillem Balague column:
[TEXT]
Earlier this century Spanish football was in disarray. More than 20 clubs entered bankruptcy proceedings, unpaid wages dominated headlines, and debts to tax and social security authorities ballooned above £595m. In that climate, Spanish clubs were widely seen as toxic investments.

The turning point came in 2013 with the introduction of La Liga's economic control framework, inspired by Uefa's Financial Fair Play.

From then on, clubs could only spend what they generated. Salary caps were introduced, revenues had to be demonstrated before investments, and all transactions were closely monitored.

The change was dramatic as chronic debt was slashed, losses gave way to profits, and foreign investors returned. Today, funds hold stakes in clubs like Atletico, Valencia, Espanyol, Cadiz and Leganes.

Even Barcelona, despite their stature, were forced to sell assets and activate financial 'levers' just to comply, showing that the rules are applied across the board.

This was not just a sporting reform, but actually the foundation of a new industry. Clubs moved from precarious ventures to stable enterprises capable of generating thousands of jobs and contributing significantly to Spain's economy.

The transformation from chaos to professionalism is arguably La Liga's greatest success of the last decade.

The league's reforms have also gone deeper than financial oversight. Governance standards have been strengthened, transparency enhanced, and clubs encouraged to professionalise their management.

Modernisation has become a priority, with increasing emphasis on data, technology, and diversified sources of income.

Yet, the model has also revealed its shortcomings. The rigidity of the rules has often left women's teams underfunded, since clubs prioritise their men's squads to stay compliant.

Even Barcelona Femeni, the most dominant team in Europe, started the season with only 17 registered players, while rivals abroad operated with greater freedom.

Smaller sporting sections have also been squeezed, highlighting the need for future adjustments that can balance financial discipline with inclusivity.

For years, Spanish football lived on two main sources of revenue: broadcasting and player transfers. Collective TV rights, introduced in 2015, doubled annual income to

[TITLE]BMW Claims The New iX3 Could Match The X3’s Profitability:
[TEXT]
Automakers are caught between a rock and a hard place. They must continue pushing electric vehicles to meet increasingly stringent emissions regulations, or risk massive fines in the European Union. Yet EVs remain notoriously expensive to produce, mainly because battery costs are still high. More often than not, carmakers lose money selling a vehicle without a combustion engine. With some exceptions, ICE models remain far more profitable than EVs.

BMW, however, believes it has found a way to achieve margin parity between two models in the same segment, one electric and the other gasoline-powered. The new iX3 is projected to generate approximately the same profit as the X3. Chief Financial Officer Walter Mertl told Reuters the “NA5” has a real chance of being as profitable as the “G45.” It could happen as early as next year. However, the electric SUV’s first full year on sale with global availability will be 2027.

That would be a significant milestone for BMW, considering the previous-generation X3 was its best-selling product in 2024. Bolstered by a strong spec sheet, fresh design, and next-gen technology, the iX3 is shaping up to be a popular model in its own right. Its appeal will broaden once more affordable versions slot below the initial 50 xDrive. An entry-level 40 sDrive priced under $55,000 has already been confirmed, with an xDrive equivalent also on the way.

Mertl believes the iX3 and upcoming Neue Klasse models will be crucial to reinvigorating sales in China, BMW’s largest market: “We are more than competitive with this product. With increasing availability of the Neue Klasse, we will see growth in China again. Looking at our future model range, I’m not worried.”

Still, even as BMW pushes ahead with EVs, it is far from abandoning combustion engines. CEO Oliver Zipse told Politico that the EU’s 2035 sales ban on new vehicles with conventional powertrains would be a “big mistake.” He argued, “We do ourselves no favors by setting arbitrary future dates by which all industries must adapt.”

BMW is standing by its goal for EVs to account for at least half of its annual sales by 2030, but maintains it is too soon to declare an end date for combustion engines. With that in mind, the company has invested in its inline-six and V8 engines to make them compliant with Euro 7 standards. Its three- and four-cylinder powertrains are also set to remain for the long haul. The four-pot could even power a Mercedes one day.

Next year’s fully electric i3 “NA0” will not replace the traditional 3 Series sedan. An eighth-generation model, codenamed “G50,” is launching shortly after. However, the gas-powered wagon may not survive into the “G51” generation. Instead, BMW is reportedly preparing an i3 Touring, designated as “NA1.” Even so, the lineup will continue to offer a broad mix of powertrains, catering to nearly every type of customer.

Whether ICE or EV, all upcoming models will be Neue Klasse, following the biggest single investment in BMW’s history. More than 10 billion euros have been spent to roll out 40+ new or updated cars by the end of 2027.

[TITLE]Tech Tanks in Latest Jobs Report As New States Try to Attract Them:
[TEXT]
Last week’s disappointing jobs report showed U.S. job growth stalled significantly in August, with just 22,000 new jobs added, and an unemployment rate that has risen to 4.3%.

It was the worst August report since the pandemic and the market treated it accordingly, welcoming it for the potential rate cuts it may herald but wary of the slower growth it may portend.

“The labor market is showing signs of cracking,” Heather Long, Navy Federal Credit Union senior economist, wrote in a note to investors on Thursday. “It’s not a red siren alarm yet, but the signs keep growing that businesses are starting to cut workers.”

Tech was not spared

Recent employment data confirms an increasingly uneven landscape within the technology sector, reflecting a shift away from the rapid job growth that characterized the early post-pandemic years.

According to a recent analysis by research think tank CompTIA, the sector has experienced a net decline of approximately 2,700 jobs over the past year, a 0.1% decrease.

This contrasts sharply with the period from late 2020 through 2022, when tech companies collectively added over 628,400 jobs across 29 months.

However, the last two years have seen almost 100,000 of those positions cut, indicating a recalibration amid the broader economic and geopolitical shifts.

“Unevenness in the data means acknowledging the employers and job seekers struggling with a multitude of challenges but also recognizing it is not all doom and gloom,” Tim Herbert, chief research officer, CompTIA, said. “Hiring intent data continues to show employers pursuing tech talent across a range of disciplines, from AI and data science to tech support and cloud engineering.”

The hottest spot for hiring was unsurprisingly in the AI skills job listings, which leapt 94% year-over-year according to CompTIA’s AI Hiring Intent Index.

For job postings themselves, 16% were for workers with eight or more years of experience; 21% for workers in the zero to three year range; and almost a third were for workers with four to seven years of experience.

[TITLE]Most Influential Women in UK Tech: The 2025 longlist:
[TEXT]
Computer Weekly’s list of the most influential women in UK technology has been running since 2012, launched to promote a discussion surrounding the role of women in the technology sector during a time when the lack of diversity in tech was only beginning to be considered.

When it was launched, the list only featured 25 women, expanding to include 50 in 2015 to recognise even more brilliant and hard-working women in the sector.

Every year there are more nominations, so we publish the list of all of those nominated to show the huge amount of female talent that exists in tech.

This year, the longlist has grown to more than 770 women, and there will also be additions to the list of Rising Stars, and Computer Weekly’s Women in Tech Hall of Fame which recognises people who have made a lifetime contribution to the UK’s tech sector.

For the 14th year in a row, a panel of judges will choose the shortlist of 50 women, soon to be published to allow readers to vote for who they believe should receive the accolade of Most Influential Woman in UK Technology 2025.

The winner of the top 50 will be announced at Computer Weekly’s annual Diversity in Tech event, run in partnership with Harvey Nash in London in November 2025 (details to be announced).

Reader votes are counted alongside those of our judges to reach the final decision, but first we want to congratulate all of those who are being considered in this longlist of nominations.

[TITLE]Lighting As A Service Market is Poised to Attain Valuation of US$ 56.03 billion by 2033 | Astute Analytica:
[TEXT]
Chicago, Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global lighting as a service market was valued at US$ 2.79 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 56.03 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 34.80% during the forecast period 2025–2033.

Smart city initiatives represent a primary engine powering the Lighting as a Service market. Municipalities worldwide are aggressively upgrading their public lighting infrastructure. The global installed base of individually controlled smart street lights was projected to be 32.9 million units at the end of 2024. A remarkable growth trajectory forecasts this installed base to swell to 85 million units by 2029. In India's smart cities mission, a total of 8,013 projects had been approved as of June 2024. The total cost of these approved projects is valued at an impressive $19.66 billion. Progress is tangible, with 7,157 of these projects already completed as of June 2024. The value of the completed projects amounts to approximately $12.24 billion. Globally, more than 2,000 LED and smart streetlight projects are actively underway in 2024. Looking forward, cities are expected to invest a cumulative $64 billion in LED and smart streetlights by 2025.

These strategic upgrades are projected to save a staggering 97,900 GWh of electricity annually. Such energy savings translate into a yearly electricity cost reduction of $12.9 billion. Adoption rates underscore this trend, with approximately 64% of North American cities having adopted smart lighting initiatives as of 2024. In the Asia-Pacific region, an even higher figure of around 69% of cities now prioritize connected street lighting infrastructure.

[TITLE]Euro stablecoins are 0.15% of the market. Here’s how Europe catches up:
[TEXT]
The following is a guest post and opinion of Eneko Knörr, CEO and Co-Founder of Stabolut.

Months ago, in an op-ed for CryptoSlate, I warned that the EU’s flagship crypto regulation, MiCA, would achieve the opposite of its goals. I argued it would strangle euro innovation while cementing the US dollar’s dominance for a new generation.

At the time, some thought this was alarmist. Today, with grim validation, the same concerns are being echoed from within the European Central Bank itself. In a recent blog post, also highlighted by the Financial Times, ECB advisor Jürgen Schaaf described the state of the euro-denominated stablecoin market as “dismal” and warned that Europe risks being “steamrollered” by dollar-based competitors.

This warning comes at a critical time. In the traditional global economy, non-USD currencies are the lifeblood of commerce. They account for 73% of global GDP, 53% of SWIFT transactions, and 42% of central bank reserves. Yet, in the burgeoning digital economy, these same currencies are nearly invisible. The world’s second most important currency, the euro, has been reduced to a digital rounding error.

By the Numbers: A Digital Chasm

The data reveals a startling disconnect. While privately issued, dollar-denominated stablecoins command a market capitalization approaching $300 billion, their euro-denominated counterparts struggle to reach $450 million, according to data from CoinGecko. That’s a market share of just 0.15%.

This isn’t a gap; it’s a chasm. It means that for every €1 of value transacted on a blockchain, there are nearly €700 in US dollars. This dollarization of the digital world presents a profound strategic risk to Europe’s monetary sovereignty and economic competitiveness.

MiCA’s Billion-Euro Handbrake

The EU’s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation was intended to create clarity, but in its ambition to control risk, it has inadvertently built a cage. While its framework for E-Money Tokens (EMTs) provides a path to regulation, it contains a poison pill for any euro stablecoin with global ambitions.

The single biggest limitation is the €200 million cap on daily transactions for any EMT deemed “significant,” as detailed in the official MiCA text. This isn’t an accident or a simple oversight; it’s a feature designed to ensure no private euro stablecoin can ever truly succeed.

For context, the leading dollar stablecoin, Tether (USDT), regularly processes over $50 billion in daily volume. A €200 million cap isn’t a safety measure; it’s a declaration of non-ambition that makes it mathematically impossible for a euro stablecoin to function at the scale required for international trade or decentralized finance.

The motivation seems clear: policymakers are intentionally sabotaging the private sector to clear the field for their own project—the Digital Euro.

The Digital Euro: A Threat to Citizen Privacy?

By stifling private innovation, the EU is placing all its bets on a state-controlled Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This is not only a slow, centralized answer to a fast-moving, decentralized market, but it also poses a fundamental threat to the privacy of European citizens.

Physical cash offers anonymity. A transaction with a €5 note is private, peer-to-peer, and leaves no data trail. A CBDC is the opposite. It would move all transactions onto a centralized digital ledger, creating a system of granular surveillance. It gives the state the potential power to monitor, track, and even control how every citizen uses their own money. Building the euro’s future on this foundation means swapping the freedom of the wallet for a transparent digital piggy bank—a trade-off most citizens would rightly refuse.

The Global Race Europe Is Ignoring

While Brussels focuses on building its walled garden, other major economic powers have recognized the strategic importance of privately issued stablecoins. They see them not as a threat but as a vital tool for projecting monetary influence in the digital age.

Even China is reportedly exploring the role a CNY-backed stablecoin could play in internationalizing the yuan. In Japan, regulators have already passed a landmark stablecoin bill, creating clear pathways for the issuance of yen-backed stablecoins. These nations understand that the digital currency war will be won by empowering private innovation, not by centralizing control. Europe’s current path makes it a spectator in a race it should be leading.

A Policy Playbook for the Euro

If the euro is to compete, Brussels must execute a radical policy U-turn. The goal shouldn’t be to contain stablecoins but to make the EU the premier global hub for issuing them. This requires a clear-eyed strategy that recognizes private innovation will always outpace centralized solutions.

Here is a playbook for how Europe can win:

Uncap the Future: Remove the crippling €200 million transaction cap entirely. The market, not regulators, should determine the scale of a successful project. Let euro stablecoins grow ad infinitum and compete on a global stage without artificial ceilings. Fast-Track Licensing: Establish a pan-European fast-track authorization process for qualified EMT issuers to reduce time-to-market and encourage a vibrant, competitive ecosystem. Follow the US Model—Cancel the CBDC: The United States has gained its advantage by prioritizing regulatory clarity for private issuers while effectively shelving its own retail CBDC plans. Europe must do the same. Formally cancel the Digital Euro project, acknowledge the fundamental privacy risks it poses, and recognize that the single best strategy to grow the euro’s international influence is to fully support a thriving, privately issued stablecoin market.

The choice is stark: Europe can continue down its path of self-imposed digital irrelevance, or it can unleash its innovators to build the future of finance. Right now, that future is being built almost entirely with American digital dollars, and time is running out to change that.

[TITLE]Real Madrid’s plan to revolutionise injury prevention through the use of AI – report:
[TEXT]
Real Madrid have had to deal with a lot of injury problems over the past couple of years that have had a critical impact on their season.

Muscle injuries to key players, especially during the 2024/25 campaign, became a key concern for the Spanish capital club, leading to the revamp of the club’s medical department.

Use of AI as key tool to prevent injuries

According to MARCA, following the departure of Niko Mihic as head of medical services at the end of last season, Real Madrid have sought to revolutionise their methodology with one clear aim: to minimise injuries, especially muscular ones, which heavily affected the team in recent campaigns.

Given the increasing workload and the intensity of modern football, it is impossible to eliminate injuries completely. The goal, however, is to reduce them to an absolute minimum, even identifying potential problems before they occur.

To achieve this, Real Madrid’s renewed medical team are turning to a powerful ally: Artificial Intelligence.

Until now, clubs relied on tools such as GPS trackers, heart monitors, and personalised questionnaires to monitor players’ conditions. From this season, however, Real Madrid have added AI to the process, although full implementation will take two to three months.

The system integrates all medical data for each player, creating personalised profiles to generate alerts when there is a risk of injury.

Two key metrics

As per the report, Real Madrid’s medical services have added two key metrics to traditional methods, enhancing early detection of potential injuries.

The first is sectoral BIA, which analyses aspects such as resistance, reactance (reaction speed), and the phase angle (PhA). This measurement detects hidden muscle fatigue, inflammation, or micro-injuries, often unnoticed even by the players themselves.

The second is metabolomics, a technique that examines metabolites in urine and blood. It provides the ‘chemical footprint’ of physical exertion, revealing what occurs in a player’s body after each match or training session.

Both sectoral BIA and metabolomics are now integrated into the AI system. When abnormal values appear, the technology signals the need for preventive action, such as resting a player or limiting their minutes on the pitch.

Real Madrid’s new AI-based project is designed to operate at every level of the club, aiming to reduce the impact of muscular injuries across all squads.
