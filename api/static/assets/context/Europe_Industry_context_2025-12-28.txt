[TITLE]Japan materials maker to buy 53% of Stylam Ind in ₹2,030 crore deal:
[TEXT]
It is important to note that the first agreement has triggered a mandatory open offer as per regulatory guidelines, with Aica Kogyo bidding to acquire up to 26% of the public float. The second agreement, with Jagdish, Nidhi and Saru Gupta, is the flexible part of the deal. It is designed to fill the gap if, after the first agreement and subsequent open offer, the total shareholding remains below 40%.

[TITLE]Motive files for IPO, signaling next phase of fleet-tech arms race:
[TEXT]
Fleet telematics provider Motive has filed paperwork to go public, a move that could intensify competition in the commercial trucking technology market amid a prolonged freight downturn.

San Francisco-based Motive disclosed Tuesday that it filed a registration statement for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MTVE, according to company statements and regulatory filings. The company has not yet set a share price or offering size.

Motive provides AI-powered tools for fleet tracking, driver safety, compliance, equipment monitoring and spend management. Founded in 2013 as KeepTruckin, the company says it now serves nearly 100,000 customers across transportation, logistics, construction, energy and manufacturing.

Motive’s competitors in the fleet telematics market include Samsara (NYSE: IOT), Geotab (NYSE: GEO), Fleetio and Trimble (Nasdaq: TRMB), all offering comprehensive solutions for GPS tracking, ELD compliance, driver safety, fuel management and maintenance.

In September, Motive won a legal case against Samsara, with a judge ruling that Motive did not infringe on any valid Samsara patents.

Motive is backed by Alphabet’s venture capital arm, GV (Google Ventures).

For the trucking industry, Motive’s move toward public markets underscores how telematics and automation have evolved from optional add-ons into core infrastructure. Carriers continue to face thin margins, elevated insurance costs and tighter regulatory oversight — pressures that have driven adoption of dashcams, automated reporting and real-time vehicle data.

[TITLE]National Oil Companies Quietly Set The Pace For The Next Decade:
[TEXT]
The prevailing structural theme right now is that national oil companies (NOCs), in some cases and across some segments, are moving faster than the majors, outspending them, beating them in locking up supply chains, and building cash cows faster for the future. You can see it directly in upstream spending trends highlighted by the IEA Oil 2025 report, and the money is shifting this way because the NOCs have political backing, lower lifting costs, and much clearer mandates than the big listed companies.

Wood Mackenzie has warned that tighter capital conditions are forcing oil and gas companies to become more selective in business development. Neivan Boroujerdi has said this will require a more nimble and creative approach as budgets tighten. In practice, that environment favors national oil companies with the balance sheets and mandates to secure gas, chemicals, and integrated assets early, rather than defer decisions. This is no longer hypothetical. Capital is already moving in that direction.

Similarly, OPEC’s latest medium-term outlook assumes that most incremental supply growth will come from countries with state-backed producers and low-cost reserves, suggesting we will be relying on NOCs for more long-cycle investment through the decade. Rystad Energy’s recent upstream and LNG analysis shows that the majority of newly sanctioned long-life projects are either led by NOCs or depend on them as anchor partners, while IOC capital remains concentrated in shorter-cycle or brownfield work. The IEA has also been explicit that future supply security hinges on investment decisions by national producers willing to commit capital beyond typical shareholder-return horizons.

Combined, these views indicate that capacity growth and control over future supply are increasingly being set by national companies rather than listed majors.

Asia: Adding Gas, Chemicals and Transition Materials

Asia’s NOCs are not easing off hydrocarbons, but they’re tightening their grip on those parts of the supply chain that will matter most over the next decade: gas, chemicals, metals and trading. PetroChina is a case in point: It has been pulling more capital toward downstream and gas while upgrading refineries for higher-margin products, as reported by Caixin.

The LNG side of things tells a similar story. PetroChina has been layering long-term supply deals into the 2030s, according to China Daily, and then diversifying away from spot exposure with new procurement corridors.

And while Western outlets fixate on earnings, Asian media have been quicker to catch the shift into transition materials. The South China Morning Post (SCMP) notes that PetroChina wants exposure to the upstream of electrification just as much as it wants downstream oil and gas. It’s not really a transition as much as it is a hedge. They’re going for whatever powers Asian industry next.

China’s Sinopec is doing something similar, but the strategy is chemicals-heavy. As fuel demand flattens, Sinopec is putting more capital into petrochemicals, hydrogen, and CCUS. It’s also doubling down on long-term LNG to feed industrial boilers and heavy manufacturing that fall under its new policy mandates. The bigger refining margins in 2025 gave them the power to do this, according to SCMP.

CNOOC, as an outlier, is staying the course, focusing on upstream and LNG, but looking to scale both. Offshore output is rising again with new South China Sea projects being added on, and the company is buying into LNG projects up the chain rather than staying a pure buyer. The goal is straightforward: control more of the gas it needs for its power and industrial clients rather than relying on the spot market.

Petronas is expanding its LNG position and lining up more supply from projects in the Atlantic and Indian basins. At home, it is spending on gas, CCS, hydrogen and midstream work that supports the domestic power system.

India’s ONGC is adding to its overseas portfolio and increasing its access to gas. The Economic Times reports that ONGC Videsh has raised its spending outside India, and state buyers are now coordinating long term LNG procurement.

Across the region, NOCs are concentrating on the areas that support their revenue base: gas supply, refining output, chemicals and firm access to transport routes. They are securing these positions now while the opportunity is still visible.

Middle East / Gulf: Expanding Capacity and Integration

Gulf NOCs are expanding low-cost supply and increasing their integration across refining, petrochemicals and LNG.

Middle Eastern NOCs continue to take a larger share of global upstream spending, according to the IEA’s 2025 investment report. Global upstream totals are largely flat, but the region’s state producers are still increasing outlays. Most of this capital is going into long-life capacity and integrated projects rather than short-cycle additions, consistent with their role as the lowest-cost suppliers in the system.

ADNOC’s investment arm XRG has outlined the largest expansion plan in the region. It is targeting 20 to 25 million tonnes a year of gas and LNG capacity by 2035 and is adding assets in North American gas to support that target. Reuters reporting also shows ADNOC is moving its existing U.S. holdings into XRG and positioning the unit to lead further international gas and LNG deals, including in North America.

What we know for certain: ADNOC wants a larger operational and financial position in North American gas.

QatarEnergy is expanding LNG output through the North Field program and using longer-term contracts to secure demand in Europe and Asia. Based on public statements from the energy minister, Qatar expects tighter LNG balances later in the decade.

Finally, Saudi Aramco, the NOC that gets the most headline attention, is tying together upstream, downstream, gas and “new energies” into one roaring machine. Recent agreements in the United States on LNG, technology and services show Aramco placing capital directly inside key consuming markets.

The overriding Gulf strategy? Outspend everyone, integrate everything, and get as close to the customer as possible.

Latin America: Holding Output and Preserving Cash

Latin America’s state producers are trying to hold production steady while managing tight budgets and a very mixed bag of political situations.

Petrobras has more room than the others. The Brazilian NOC’s 2026 to 2030 plan shows lower headline capital spending, but the company still intends to grow pre-salt output and keep most of its money in projects that are already under way. Company filings confirm

[TITLE]Green Debt Surge Bucks Climate Policy Rollbacks:
[TEXT]
Global green bond and loan issuance has reached a record $947 billion so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.

Investors have piled into climate-friendly assets this year despite policy and regulatory rollbacks in the US and Europe, as artificial intelligence drives a boom in energy infrastructure demand.

Global green bond and loan issuance has reached a record $947 billion so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That's as stock market gauges for renewables are set for their first annual gains since 2020, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin, while shares of power-grid technology companies remain in favor.

The flows are notable in a year when US President Donald Trump backed fossil fuels and dismantled clean-energy subsidies and legislation. Europe also has rolled back some of its toughest environmental rules amid concerns

[TITLE]2025 mutual fund scorecard: Top performers, laggards, and key surprises:
[TEXT]
Calendar year 2025 has been marked by uneven equity performance, sharp style rotation, and renewed interest in hard assets and global diversification. While frontline indices delivered moderate returns, stock selection and category choice became critical, leading to wide dispersion across mutual fund categories.

Diversified equity strategies with flexibility and valuation discipline clearly outperformed, while excessive exposure to frothy segments hurt returns.

Here is the scorecard on the performance of mutual funds in the year 2025, as of 19 December.

Among mutual fund categories, going by category average, the top category by performance was silver funds. Following them in order were gold funds, international funds, auto and transportation funds, and banking sector funds.

Silver funds delivered a category average return of 128%, gold funds 71%, diversified international funds 28%, auto and transportation funds 16%, and banking sector funds 14.5%.

Here’s a closer look at top performers across individual categories in the regular option.

Equity funds Among equity categories, large and midcap funds emerged as consistent performers, benefiting from exposure to quality mid-sized companies without taking extreme risk. Flexicap and focused funds also stood out, as fund managers actively shifted allocations across market caps.

In contrast, smallcap funds struggled, as richly valued stocks corrected sharply. While a few funds managed to protect the downside, the category as a whole underperformed broader markets.

Interestingly, value and contra funds made a quiet comeback in 2025, helped by rotation into banking, infrastructure, and select PSU stocks.

Large cap funds: Performance was stable and the best among the three market-cap segments. The key drivers were valuation discipline and earnings visibility. The leader among large cap funds was ICICI Pru Large Cap Fund, which delivered 10.1%. This was followed by Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund, SBI Large Cap Fund, Aditya Birla SL Large Cap Fund, and Nippon India Large Cap Fund, delivering between 8.9% and 7.9%.

Large and midcap funds: One of the strongest diversified categories in 2025. The category benefited from select midcap participation without excessive risk. ICICI Pru led the category with 12.13%. Other top performers were SBI Large and Midcap, Mirae Asset Large and Midcap, Franklin India Large and Mid Cap, and Helios Large and Mid Cap Fund, with returns ranging from 8.4% to 6.6%.

Midcap funds: Strong absolute returns but high volatility. Stock picking proved critical, leading to sharp divergence between top and bottom quartile funds. ICICI Pru Midcap Fund led with 8.23%, followed by Mirae Asset Midcap, Invesco India Midcap, HDFC Mid Cap Fund, and Tata Mid Cap Fund, with returns from 6.6% to 4.2%. The bottom performer delivered -11.78%.

Smallcap funds: Clear underperformers among diversified equity categories. Valuation excesses corrected sharply, and stock prices plunged. Good stock pickers remained outliers. Quantum Small Cap Fund topped the category with a positive return of 1.81%, the only fund in the category with positive returns. This was followed by Sundaram Small Cap, HDFC Small Cap, PGIM India Small Cap, and ICICI Pru Smallcap Fund, with returns between -1.56% and -1.88%.

Flexicap and focused funds: Among the best risk-adjusted performers. Tactical allocation across market caps paid off, particularly for funds with a higher large-cap bias. Among flexicap funds, HDFC Flexi Cap topped with 10.11%, followed by Aditya Birla SL Flexi Cap, Tata Flexi Cap, ICICI Pru Flexicap, and Bandhan Flexi Cap, delivering between 9.8% and 8.1%. In the focused category, ICICI Pru Focused Equity delivered the highest return of 14.6%. This was followed by SBI Focused, Kotak Focused, HDFC Focused, and Aditya Birla SL Focused, with returns ranging from 14.5% to 9.1%.

Multi cap funds: Benefited from mandatory exposure across all market caps. Better downside protection than pure mid or smallcap strategies gave the category an edge. Mirae Asset Multicap Fund topped with 6.6%, followed by Groww Multicap, Bank of India Multi Cap, WhiteOak Capital Multi Cap, and Kotak Multicap Fund, delivering between 6.1% and 4%.

Value and contra funds: Quiet comeback category in 2025. Favoured by rotation into cyclicals and undervalued sectors. ICICI Pru Value Fund topped the category with 12.8%. DSP Value, HDFC Value, Groww Value, and Templeton India Value Fund followed with returns between 9.2% and 5.8%.

ELSS (tax saver funds): Moderate but steady performance. Funds with value and flexi-style mandates led the pack. HDFC ELSS Tax Saver Fund and Aditya Birla SL ELSS Tax Saver were the toppers with 8.97%. ICICI Pru ELSS Tax Saver Fund, Mirae Asset ELSS Tax Saver Fund, and Mahindra Manulife ELSS Tax Saver Fund followed with returns between 8.65% and 6.6%.

Sectoral funds – top categories Banking and financial services funds, auto and transportation, and energy funds led the sectoral pack.

Banking funds benefited from stable credit growth and margin resilience. Among banking and financial services funds, Quant topped with 20%, followed by DSP at 19.2%.

Auto funds benefited from the GST cut and strong stock performance. HDFC Transportation and Logistics topped with 19%, followed by UTI at 17.5%.

ICICI Prudential Commodities Fund delivered 12.9%, while DSP Natural Resources and New Energy Fund delivered 12.61%.

Global and international funds – international diversification paid off Global funds proved to be efficient diversifiers in 2025 when Indian markets were weak. US, China, Europe, and emerging market funds led the return chart.

DSP World Gold Mining Overseas Equity Omni FoF, a major beneficiary of the gold rally, was not only the top international fund but also the overall top mutual fund scheme, delivering a staggering 161%.

ICICI Pru Strategic Metal and Energy Equity FoF delivered 65.13%, HSBC Brazil Fund 50.91%, and Edelweiss Europe Dynamic Equity Offshore 48.00%.

Gold and silver funds – precious metals outshone equities Gold continued its momentum into 2025, but silver delivered exceptionally strong returns. SBI Silver ETF FoF delivered 130.65%, followed by Kotak Silver ETF FoF and HDFC Silver ETF FoF.

Among gold FoFs, Quantum topped with 71.85%, followed by UTI and ICICI Pru.

Hybrid funds – top categories In a year when equities struggled, hybrid funds benefited from asset allocation.

Multi asset funds: Funds with exposure to precious metals and global equities delivered the best results. Invesco India Multi Asset Allocation topped with 21.16%, followed by DSP Multi Asset, Mahindra Manulife Multi Asset, Kotak Multi Asset Allocation, and Sundaram Multi Asset Allocation, with returns between 20.8% and 18.2%.

Balanced advantage funds: ICICI Pru Balanced Advantage Fund topped with 11.45%. Aditya Birla SL BAF, SBI BAF, DSP Dynamic Asset Allocation, and UTI BAF followed with returns between 9.5% and 8.1%.

Other hybrid categories, such as aggressive hybrid, arbitrage, balanced hybrid, conservative hybrid, equity savings, and income plus arbitrage, delivered category average returns of 5.57%, 5.99%, 5.1%, 5.42%, 6.27%, and 7.11% respectively.

Also Read | Will India Post crack the mutual fund distribution code?

Debt categories – benefited from rate cuts Rate cuts improved bond valuations and were reflected in returns.

Corporate bond funds delivered a category average return of 7.4%. Franklin Corporate Debt Fund topped with 8.73%. Among gilt funds, ICICI Pru Constant Maturity Gilt Fund delivered 7.25%.

DSP Credit Risk Fund topped the credit risk category with 20.77%.

Category average returns for medium duration, short duration, low duration, ultra short duration, liquid, money market, overnight, and floater funds were 7.55%, 7.06%, 7.02%, 6.51%, 6%, 7.01%, 5.56%, and 7.39% respectively.

The diverse returns across categories in 2025 once again reinforced the importance of asset allocation across asset classes, both domestically and globally, in building a healthy portfolio.

[TITLE]National Oil Companies Quietly Set The Pace For The Next Decade:
[TEXT]
The prevailing structural theme right now is that national oil companies (NOCs), in some cases and across some segments, are moving faster than the majors, outspending them, beating them in locking up supply chains, and building cash cows faster for the future. You can see it directly in upstream spending trends highlighted by the IEA Oil 2025 report, and the money is shifting this way because the NOCs have political backing, lower lifting costs, and much clearer mandates than the big listed companies.

Wood Mackenzie has warned that tighter capital conditions are forcing oil and gas companies to become more selective in business development. Neivan Boroujerdi has said this will require a more nimble and creative approach as budgets tighten. In practice, that environment favors national oil companies with the balance sheets and mandates to secure gas, chemicals, and integrated assets early, rather than defer decisions. This is no longer hypothetical. Capital is already moving in that direction.

Similarly, OPEC’s latest medium-term outlook assumes that most incremental supply growth will come from countries with state-backed producers and low-cost reserves, suggesting we will be relying on NOCs for more long-cycle investment through the decade. Rystad Energy’s recent upstream and LNG analysis shows that the majority of newly sanctioned long-life projects are either led by NOCs or depend on them as anchor partners, while IOC capital remains concentrated in shorter-cycle or brownfield work. The IEA has also been explicit that future supply security hinges on investment decisions by national producers willing to commit capital beyond typical shareholder-return horizons.

Combined, these views indicate that capacity growth and control over future supply are increasingly being set by national companies rather than listed majors.

Asia: Adding Gas, Chemicals and Transition Materials

Asia’s NOCs are not easing off hydrocarbons, but they’re tightening their grip on those parts of the supply chain that will matter most over the next decade: gas, chemicals, metals and trading. PetroChina is a case in point: It has been pulling more capital toward downstream and gas while upgrading refineries for higher-margin products, as reported by Caixin.

The LNG side of things tells a similar story. PetroChina has been layering long-term supply deals into the 2030s, according to China Daily, and then diversifying away from spot exposure with new procurement corridors.

And while Western outlets fixate on earnings, Asian media have been quicker to catch the shift into transition materials. The South China Morning Post (SCMP) notes that PetroChina wants exposure to the upstream of electrification just as much as it wants downstream oil and gas. It’s not really a transition as much as it is a hedge. They’re going for whatever powers Asian industry next.

China’s Sinopec is doing something similar, but the strategy is chemicals-heavy. As fuel demand flattens, Sinopec is putting more capital into petrochemicals, hydrogen, and CCUS. It’s also doubling down on long-term LNG to feed industrial boilers and heavy manufacturing that fall under its new policy mandates. The bigger refining margins in 2025 gave them the power to do this, according to SCMP.

CNOOC, as an outlier, is staying the course, focusing on upstream and LNG, but looking to scale both. Offshore output is rising again with new South China Sea projects being added on, and the company is buying into LNG projects up the chain rather than staying a pure buyer. The goal is straightforward: control more of the gas it needs for its power and industrial clients rather than relying on the spot market.

Petronas is expanding its LNG position and lining up more supply from projects in the Atlantic and Indian basins. At home, it is spending on gas, CCS, hydrogen and midstream work that supports the domestic power system.

India’s ONGC is adding to its overseas portfolio and increasing its access to gas. The Economic Times reports that ONGC Videsh has raised its spending outside India, and state buyers are now coordinating long term LNG procurement.

Reuters reporting also shows ADNOC is moving its existing U.S. holdings into XRG and positioning the unit to lead further international gas and LNG deals, including in North America.

What we know for certain: ADNOC wants a larger operational and financial position in North American gas.

QatarEnergy is expanding LNG output through the North Field program and using longer-term contracts to secure demand in Europe and Asia. Based on public statements from the energy minister, Qatar expects tighter LNG balances later in the decade.

Finally, Saudi Aramco, the NOC that gets the most headline attention, is tying together upstream, downstream, gas and “new energies” into one roaring machine. Recent agreements in the United States on LNG, technology and services show Aramco placing capital directly inside key consuming markets.

The overriding Gulf strategy? Outspend everyone, integrate everything, and get as close to the customer as possible.

Latin America: Holding Output and Preserving Cash

Latin America’s state producers are trying to hold production steady while managing tight budgets and a very mixed bag of political situations.

Petrobras has more room than the others. The Brazilian NOC’s 2026 to 2030 plan shows lower headline capital spending, but the company still intends to grow pre-salt output and keep most of its money in projects that are already under way. Company filings confirm

Customer Journey Mapping Software Market Overview

1. Market Definition and Scope

The customer journey mapping software market encompasses digital tools designed to visualize, analyze, and optimize customer interactions across multiple touchpoints throughout the buying lifecycle. These platforms help organizations understand customer behavior, preferences, emotions, and pain points by integrating data from online, offline, and omnichannel sources. The scope of the market includes cloud-based and on-premises solutions used by enterprises of all sizes to improve engagement, retention, and conversion rates. Customer journey mapping software is widely applied across industries such as retail, BFSI, healthcare, IT & telecom, travel, and e-commerce. As businesses increasingly prioritize customer-centric strategies, the market has evolved from simple journey visualization tools to advanced platforms embedded with analytics, AI, and automation capabilities, enabling real-time insights and predictive decision-making.

2. Evolution of Customer Experience Management

The market has grown alongside the evolution of customer experience (CX) management from reactive service models to proactive and personalized engagement strategies. Earlier approaches relied heavily on surveys and basic CRM systems, offering limited visibility into customer journeys. Modern customer journey mapping software provides end-to-end journey orchestration, combining behavioral data, sentiment analysis, and contextual insights. This evolution is driven by rising customer expectations for seamless, consistent experiences across digital and physical channels. Organizations now leverage journey mapping tools not only to identify friction points but also to redesign processes, align internal teams, and enhance service delivery. As CX becomes a key competitive differentiator, customer journey mapping software is increasingly viewed as a strategic investment rather than a supporting tool.

3. Technology Integration and Innovation

Technological advancements play a central role in shaping the customer journey mapping software market. Integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, and natural language processing has significantly enhanced software capabilities. These technologies enable real-time journey tracking, predictive modeling, and automated recommendations to improve customer interactions. Cloud computing has further expanded market reach by offering scalable, cost-effective, and easily deployable solutions. Additionally, integration with CRM, marketing automation, contact center, and customer data platforms has strengthened the value proposition of journey mapping tools. Continuous innovation is allowing vendors to offer deeper insights, faster analysis, and more actionable intelligence, supporting data-driven CX strategies across complex customer ecosystems.

4. Deployment Models and Accessibility

The market offers a range of deployment models, including cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid solutions. Cloud-based customer journey mapping software dominates adoption due to its flexibility, lower upfront costs, and ease of integration with existing digital infrastructure. Small and medium-sized enterprises increasingly favor SaaS-based models to access advanced CX capabilities without significant IT investments. Large enterprises, particularly in regulated industries, may still adopt on-premises or hybrid solutions to address data security and compliance requirements. Improved user interfaces, low-code platforms, and visualization dashboards have made these tools accessible to non-technical users, expanding adoption beyond IT teams to marketing, sales, and customer support functions.

5. Industry Adoption Trends

Adoption of customer journey mapping software spans multiple industries, each with distinct use cases. Retail and e-commerce companies use these tools to optimize omnichannel shopping experiences and reduce cart abandonment. BFSI organizations leverage journey mapping to improve onboarding, service personalization, and customer trust. Healthcare providers apply journey insights to enhance patient experience and care coordination. Telecom and IT service providers use journey mapping to reduce churn and improve service responsiveness. As digital engagement becomes integral across sectors, industry-specific customization and vertical-focused solutions are driving broader adoption and deeper market penetration.

6. Role in Data-Driven Decision Making

Customer journey mapping software plays a critical role in enabling data-driven decision-making. By consolidating data from multiple sources, these platforms provide a unified view of the customer, supporting informed strategic and operational decisions. Organizations can measure journey performance, identify bottlenecks, and prioritize improvements based on real customer data rather than assumptions. Advanced analytics allow businesses to quantify the impact of CX initiatives on revenue, loyalty, and brand perception. This capability aligns journey mapping tools with broader business intelligence and performance management frameworks, reinforcing their importance in enterprise digital transformation initiatives.

7. Competitive Landscape and Market Maturity

The customer journey mapping software market is moderately competitive, with a mix of established enterprise software providers and specialized CX technology vendors. Market maturity varies by region, with developed markets showing higher adoption rates, while emerging economies present strong growth opportunities. Vendors compete on factors such as analytics depth, ease of integration, scalability, industry expertise, and pricing models. Continuous feature enhancements, partnerships, and acquisitions are common strategies to strengthen market positioning. As competition intensifies, differentiation increasingly depends on delivering actionable insights and measurable CX outcomes rather than standalone visualization capabilities.

8. Future Market Outlook

The future of the customer journey mapping software market is strongly aligned with ongoing digitalization and experience-driven business models. Growing emphasis on personalization, omnichannel consistency, and real-time engagement will continue to fuel demand. The integration of generative AI, advanced predictive analytics, and automation is expected to further transform journey mapping into a dynamic, self-optimizing capability. Additionally, rising awareness of customer lifetime value and retention economics will push organizations to invest more deeply in journey intelligence. Overall, the market outlook remains positive, supported by sustained enterprise focus on customer-centric growth strategies and continuous technological innovation.

[TITLE]Motive files for IPO, signaling next phase of fleet-tech arms race:
[TEXT]
Fleet telematics provider Motive has filed paperwork to go public, a move that could intensify competition in the commercial trucking technology market amid a prolonged freight downturn.

San Francisco-based Motive disclosed Tuesday that it filed a registration statement for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MTVE, according to company statements and regulatory filings. The company has not yet set a share price or offering size.

Motive provides AI-powered tools for fleet tracking, driver safety, compliance, equipment monitoring and spend management. Founded in 2013 as KeepTruckin, the company says it now serves nearly 100,000 customers across transportation, logistics, construction, energy and manufacturing.

Motive’s competitors in the fleet telematics market include Samsara (NYSE: IOT), Geotab (NYSE: GEO), Fleetio and Trimble (Nasdaq: TRMB), all offering comprehensive solutions for GPS tracking, ELD compliance, driver safety, fuel management and maintenance.

In September, Motive won a legal case against Samsara, with a judge ruling that Motive did not infringe on any valid Samsara patents.

Motive is backed by Alphabet’s venture capital arm, GV (Google Ventures).

For the trucking industry, Motive’s move toward public markets underscores how telematics and automation have evolved from optional add-ons into core infrastructure. Carriers continue to face thin margins, elevated insurance costs and tighter regulatory oversight — pressures that have driven adoption of dashcams, automated reporting and real-time vehicle data.

[TITLE]Some Florida homebuyers are using AI to get homes without agents, saving thousands:
[TEXT]
Homebuyers in Florida have quietly begun closing on homes without using an agent — relying instead on artificial intelligence to search listings, generate offers and draft contracts.

Tech startup Homa says at least 10 homes have already closed end-to-end using its AI-powered system, with several more deals currently in escrow — a shift that could challenge a commission-driven industry already rattled by a recent landmark National Association of Realtors settlement.

Homa’s platform allows buyers to self-represent, cutting out the buyer’s agent commission — typically around 2.5% to 3% — and either pocket the savings or apply them toward closing costs.

6 Florida homebuyers are increasingly turning to AI platforms like Homa to buy homes without a buyer’s agent — and save thousands in commissions. Davide Angelini – stock.adobe.com

Those savings can be substantial.

DJ, a 32-year-old pharmacist, said he bought a $420,000 home in the Tampa Bay area using Homa and saved $10,500 on a buyer’s agent commission.

In an era of rising geopolitical uncertainty, the defense sector is an area of the stock market that investing pros think is worth a closer look as 2026 approaches.

The aerospace and defense sector already enjoyed a big year in 2025, catapulted higher by geopolitical unrest and rising defense spending by the federal government.

Scott Helfstein, senior vice president of investment strategy at Global X ETFs, thinks the industry has even more room to run in 2026. He spoke to Business Insider

[TITLE]Israel to Build Independent Arms Industry, Fearing Future U.S. Embargo:
[TEXT]
Israel is embarking on a multi-billion-dollar plan to build an independent defense industry to counter potential weapons embargoes from the U.S. or European allies. “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday Israel would spend 350 billion shekels ($110 billion) on developing an independent arms industry to reduce dependency on other countries,” Reuters reported.

In May 2024, while Israel was engaged in an existential war with the terrorist group Hamas, then-President Joe Biden threatened to impose a weapons embargo. Besides the U.S., Israel’s largest defense supplier, Germany, and Britain also stopped or restricted weapons exports in the midst of the Gaza war.

While Israel, with its extensive and longstanding military ties with the U.S., may not achieve total self-sufficiency in the area, the country seeks reduce its reliance on foreign arms suppliers, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted.

“Our goal is to build an independent arms industry for the State of Israel and reduce the dependency on any party, including allies,” Netanyahu said at an Air Force event.

“We will continue to acquire essential supplies while independently arming ourselves,” he added. “I don’t know if a country can be completely independent but we will strive … to ensure our arms are produced as much as possible in Israel.”

Netanyahu:

We will strive to ensure that our weapons are produced as much as possible in the State of Israel, including some air platforms.

I have approved a total budget of 350 billion shekels for the next decade to establish an independent defense industry in the State of… pic.twitter.com/oe5ksnFVsm — Dana Levi דנה🇮🇱🇺🇸 (@Danale) December 24, 2025

The Times of Israel reported details of the plan:

Israel is working to gain as much independence as possible in its weapons production, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Wednesday, in a development he said was the result of the lessons learned during the past two years of war on multiple fronts. “I approved, along with the defense minister and finance minister, a sum of NIS 350 billion [$108 billion] over the next decade to build an independent Israeli munitions industry,” Netanyahu said in an address at a graduation ceremony for Israeli Air Force pilots. The move, he said, stemmed from a desire to “reduce our dependence on all players, including friends,” after allies including the US, UK, and Germany all imposed various restrictions on weapons sales to Israel since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. Still, he noted, many countries around the world, including Germany, “want to buy from us more and more systems.” The premier has long been calling for Israel to develop its own self-reliant military industry, and in January 2024 announced that the government would invest in a “multi-year plan to free Israel from dependence on external purchases.”

In recent months, Prime Minister Netanyahu has been calling for self-reliance in defense production. On September 16, he said that Israel wants to “build an arms industry capable of withstanding “any kind of international political constraints.”

Beating all odds, Israel’s defense industry grows at record rate

Despite threats of embargo and trade bans, the Israeli defense industry has grown at a record pace. As European countries seek to close the air defense gap amid a growing Russian threat, they look to Israeli manufacturers.

“Israel’s defense export figures for 2025 will not be published until mid-2026, but defense sources estimate that volumes will be at least similar to those of 2024, when Israeli arms companies set an all-time record with exports of approximately $14.8 billion,” Israeli technology newswebsite CTech reported Sunday. “The latest major defense deal was signed last Thursday, worth $3.1 billion, under which Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) will supply the German Air Force with Arrow 3 missile systems.”

Armed Forces across the world also seek cooperation with the Israeli military, which just fought a multi-front war, ranging from close-quarter urban warfare to long-range aerial operations.

In November, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) hosted top military officials from the U.S. and other allied nations to brief them on combat capabilities developed and honed in recent years. The IDF said in a statement that “more than 100 senior military representatives from 19 countries” came to learn about “most significant capabilities and tactics the army has developed over the past two years across various combat arenas.”

[TITLE]China Starts State-Backed Venture Funds to Support Tech Startups:
[TEXT]
China has officially launched a national venture capital fund and three large regional funds, together worth billions of dollars, as part of a push to foster home-grown tech champions and improve investment efficiency.

The National Startup Investment Guidance Fund, as well as the three vehicles covering the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta and the Greater Bay Area, began operating on Friday, according to Xinhua News Agency.

The national fund is backed by 100 billion yuan from the Ministry of Finance, financed through the issuance of ultra-long special sovereign bonds, Guo Fangming, a Finance Ministry official, said at a briefing on Friday.

The three regional funds are set up through the national fund’s equity stakes in limited partnerships and are each expected to eventually grow to more than 50 billion yuan, Huo Fupeng, chairman of the state fund, said at the same event.

China is ramping up its push for technological breakthroughs as competition with the US heats up in areas such as semiconductors. Tighter fiscal conditions — including rising debt risks and weaker revenue — have forced the government to be more disciplined
