[TITLE]Activist Ananym Capital urges LKQ to sell its European auto parts business:
[TEXT]
Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.

Activist: Ananym Capital Management

Ownership: 0.39%

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.

What's happening

On Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

Behind the scenes

LKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers.

The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers.

Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint.

Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.

LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount.

The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000 . However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock.

In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.

Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment.

Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries.

Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.

The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA.

The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA.

The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price.

While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone , and Genuine Parts , may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that.

Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.

In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time.

If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders.

Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

[TITLE]Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp. – New Financings Update:
[TEXT]
ATHENS, Greece, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp. (the “Company” or “OET”) (NYSE:ECO / OSE:OET), announced today it has entered into two new facility agreements, for the financing of the recently acquired newbuilding Suezmax vessels, each under construction at Daehan Shipbuilding Co., Ltd, to be named Nissos Piperi and Nissos Serifopoula respectively, with expected deliveries in January 2026.

On December 19, 2025, we entered into a $45.0 million facility agreement, to finance a portion of the acquisition price of the Nissos Piperi, with a prominent Greek bank (the “Nissos Piperi Facility”). The Nissos Piperi Facility contains an interest rate of Term SOFR plus 130 basis points, matures in seven years, and will be repaid in quarterly installments of $0.525 million, together with a balloon installment of $30.3 million at maturity. It will be secured by, among other things, a mortgage over the Nissos Piperi, and it will be guaranteed by the Company.

On December 19, 2025, we entered into a $45.0 million facility agreement, to finance a portion of the acquisition price of the Nissos Serifopoula, with another prominent Greek bank (the “Nissos Serifopoula Facility”). The Nissos Serifopoula Facility contains an interest rate of Term SOFR plus 130 basis points, matures in eight years, and will be repaid in quarterly installments of $0.525 million, together with a balloon installment of $28.2 million at maturity. It will be secured by, among other things, a mortgage over the Nissos Serifopoula, and it will be guaranteed by the Company.

Both facility agreements contain standard representations, warranties and covenants, including financial covenants, and are subject to standard conditions precedent, such as the delivery of the relevant vessel.

Both transactions are expected to close in January 2026.

Iraklis Sbarounis, CFO of the Company, commented:

“We are pleased to announce the final pieces of the puzzle related to the acquisition of the two resale newbuilding Suezmaxes, funded by our successful equity raise in November and now two very competitive bank facilities. We have structured these transactions to be accretive for the benefit of our shareholders, without the need to tap into our cash balance, ensuring a continued focus on our capacity for dividend distributions.

The financings further demonstrate our ability to enhance our capital structure, supported by the strong Alafouzos family relationships in the Greek banking market – relationships that we are keen to develop further. The Nissos Piperi Facility and the Nissos Serifopoula Facility, feature the most competitive financing terms within our fleet, each priced at 130 basis points over SOFR, with maturities in 2033 and 2034 respectively, and we expect such financings to contribute to improved daily debt service breakeven costs.

We are excited to put these vessels to work as soon as they are delivered to us in the first half of January, and benefit from their expected cashflow generation.”

[TITLE]Trump's Truth Social to Merge With Fusion Startup You've Probably Never Heard Of:
[TEXT]
A fusion-power startup revealed its own fusion experiment this week: A planned merger with a tech firm that seems to have little in common with its work, but which does bring access to ruling-family levels of influence.

TAE Technologies, a Foothill Ranch, California, company that has been developing a compact nuclear-fusion reactor design since 1998, announced that it would merge with Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the Florida-based parent firm of President Trump's Truth Social.

The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion, a substantial increase from TMTG's $4.16 billion market cap as of Thursday, and a step up from 2021, when its financial struggles reportedly led Trump to ask Elon Musk to buy his social network.

The transaction calls for TMTG to kick in $200 million to TAE at the signing of the deal, with $100 million more available when it files Securities and Exchange Commission paperwork. The parties predict that the deal will close in the middle of 2026, pending shareholder signoff and regulatory approval, which does not seem like much of a risk in this case.

TAE plans to spend that money to accelerate its plans to build a 50-megawatt commercial fusion electric-power plant. A merger presentation predicts that it will pick a site and begin construction in 2026, start “pre-commercial operations” in 2029, and begin commercial operations in 2031.

Fusion power, in which atoms fuse together under immense pressure to generate heat that can be turned into electricity, promises safe, zero-emission energy without the radioactive waste that nuclear fission plants leave behind.

Creating conditions similar to what allows fusion to happen inside the sun and other stars has proved to be an immensely difficult exercise; it took until 2022 for a US facility’s fusion energy output to exceed the energy input required to initiate that reaction.

Meanwhile, solar panels offer a much cheaper and proven way to turn the sun’s fusion energy into electricity; on a lower-tech scale, a clothesline technically functions as a fusion-powered clothes dryer.

But fusion’s potential, combined with the growing power needs of AI data centers, has pushed interest in the concept to its highest ever level. The “AI Action Plan” that Trump unveiled in July sees a role for fusion, while essentially ruling out the solar and wind power that the president has repeatedly attacked. Fusion also figures in Microsoft’s data-center ambitions.

TAE's plant concept involves using what it calls an “advanced beam-driven Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC)” to confine its hydrogen-boron fuel inside a superhot plasma. Before 2025, it had pitched this as a key part of electrifying transportation; in 2022, it touted its attendance at a fusion-power summit hosted at the White House and approvingly quoted President Biden’s Office of Science & Technology Policy director Alondra Nelson as saying “the world is on fire.”

Building 'Uncancellable Infrastructure'

Global warming, however, did not come up in the brief conference call TAE and TMTG hosted on Thursday morning. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes and TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer—who will share chief-executive titles in the combined firm—gave brief statements and took no questions.

"TMTG has built uncancellable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans, and now we're taking a big step toward a revolutionary technology that will cement Americans’ global energy dominance for generations,” Nunes said. “Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s, an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America’s AI supremacy, and revive America’s manufacturing base and bolster national defense.”

(Before joining TMTG in January 2022, Nunes served in the House as a Republican representing California and filed a lengthy series of defamation lawsuits—most since dismissed or withdrawn—against news organizations, journalists, Twitter, and such online critics as the unknown operator of a “DevinCow” parody account.)

“Today is a big milestone for TAE, fully recognizing the dedication and passion of our people who worked tirelessly over the last quarter century to advance our research to the point that capital is now becoming our biggest challenge,” Binderbauer said. “Fusion power is the answer, providing reliable, cost-effective, carbon-free electricity– and importantly, cost-competitive with conventional production.”

The merger announcements credit TAE with raising more than $1.3 billion in private capital to date. Truth Social may not have much of a market presence—a November report by the Pew Research Center found that only 3% of Americans had ever used it—but TMTG isn’t just another social-media or technology company.

Trump himself continues to use Truth Social far more than X, TMTG’s board of directors includes Trump’s oldest son Donald Trump, Jr., and the firm’s stock-ticker symbol is Trump’s initials: DJT.

Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) called for Congressional oversight of the deal in a post on Bluesky: “The merger between Trump Media and TAE raises significant concerns

[TITLE]Israel’s Airstrikes on Lebanese Reconstruction Equipment, Factories are War Crimes:
[TEXT]
Human Rights Watch – (Beirut) – The Israeli military’s repeated attacks on reconstruction-related equipment and other civilian facilities in southern Lebanon throughout 2025 violate the laws of war and are apparent war crimes, Human Rights Watch said today.

Residents and local municipal authorities told Human Rights Watch that the attacks have hampered reconstruction efforts and the ability of tens of thousands of displaced people to return to their homes in southern Lebanon. Over 10,000 buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed there between October 2023 and January 2025.

“Amid the ceasefire, Israeli forces have carried out attacks that unlawfully target reconstruction-related equipment and facilities,” said Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “After reducing many of Lebanon’s southern border towns to rubble, the Israeli military is now making it much more difficult for tens of thousands of residents to rebuild their destroyed homes and return to their towns.”

Human Rights Watch investigated four attacks on reconstruction-related sites, including three on six outdoor showrooms and maintenance facilities for bulldozers, excavators, and heavy-machinery in the southern Lebanese towns of Deir Seryan, Msayleh, and Ansariyeh, as well as an attack on a cement and asphalt factory in Sinay. The strikes, between August and October 2025, months after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, killed 3 civilians and injured at least 11 people.

Researchers visited the sites and interviewed 13 people, including owners of the storage and maintenance facilities, mayors of the towns, a manager at the cement and asphalt factory, a government contractor, and three people working at an international nongovernmental organization providing aid in southern Lebanon. Human Rights Watch also reviewed inventory documents and contracts provided by three site owners.

The four attacks destroyed over 360 heavy machines, including bulldozers and excavators, in addition to an asphalt and cement factory. Owners of heavy machinery sites said that they sold or rented machinery throughout various areas of Lebanon, and that some of the machines that they sold or rented were used for civilian reconstruction efforts, including rubble clearing.

“We can’t even clear the rubble [from our sites] because we’re afraid that, if we clear it, more of the machines we’re using for rubble-clearing might be struck,” said Ibrahim Karim, owner of a site in Deir Seryan. “So here, we’ve moved the rubble with our own hands.”

For each of the attacks, Israeli forces had issued statements that the equipment and materials were used by Hezbollah or “allowed,” “enabled” or were “intended” to be used by Hezbollah to “rebuild” or “reestablish” its “assets,” “activity,” or “infrastructure,” without revealing any details.

Human Rights Watch did not find evidence of military targets in and around the sites. Researchers were able to verify that some of the machinery and supplies were being utilized for civilian purposes. Researchers were unable to verify the use of all machinery and materials that were attacked but did not find any evidence of their use for military purposes by Hezbollah.

Owners and employees all said that they did not know whether they were working with Hezbollah’s military wing. They said that they do not typically ask clients for their political affiliations and that they sell and fix heavy machinery to whoever requests their services.

Hezbollah has both a military wing (known as the Islamic Resistance, or al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya) and nonmilitary organizations, such as its political party, its healthcare institutions, and its social welfare organizations. Like other Lebanese political parties, Hezbollah has thousands of members who are not actively involved in any aspect of its military operations.

However, even in instances in which civilian equipment was being sold or maintained for people with links to Hezbollah, that would not in itself make the sites or the machinery legitimate military targets.

Based on the evidence Human Rights Watch gathered, the possible contributions that the targeted machinery and sites may have been able to confer on Hezbollah’s military capability is too vague or tenuous to make these objects lawful targets. Permitting such attacks could effectively make all heavy machinery and factories producing materials for construction military objectives subject to attack.

Israeli forces have also repeatedly carried out unlawful attacks on heavy machinery for reconstruction and other vital civilian infrastructure and hampered reconstruction efforts in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

Human Rights Watch sent a letter outlining its findings and posing questions to the Israeli military on December 3. The Israeli military responded with a question, which Human Rights Watch responded to, but subsequently the Israeli military did not provide any further response to the questions posed.

The International Committee of the Red Cross’ authoritative study of customary laws of war provides that warring parties can only target legitimate military objectives: that is, objects that by their nature, location, purpose or use “make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”

The mere possibility that equipment could be used in an undefined, future contribution for military purposes, such as to build fortifications, does not constitute a legitimate military target. Individuals who order deliberate attacks on civilian objects and infrastructure are responsible for war crimes.

Israel’s key allies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, should urgently act to press Israel to cease all attacks on civilian objects and reconstruction-related efforts, including by immediately suspending military assistance and arms sales to Israel and imposing targeted sanctions on officials credibly implicated in grave crimes. Lebanon’s judicial authorities should initiate domestic investigations of serious international crimes, and the government should accede to the International Criminal Court’s Rome Statute and submit a declaration accepting the court’s jurisdiction prior to the date of accession, including since at least October 7, 2023.

“The return of tens of thousands of Lebanon’s displaced residents to their homes and villages hinges upon the ability of governments to press Israel to halt its attacks on reconstruction efforts,” Kaiss said. “They should immediately suspend arms to Israel and impose targeted sanctions on officials credibly implicated in ongoing grave crimes.”

Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect in November 2024, more than 64,000 people in Lebanon remain displaced. Ongoing Israeli strikes have killed at least 127 civilians since the ceasefire, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and have destroyed civilian infrastructure. According to UN experts, there have been “four incidents of projectiles fired from Lebanon toward Israel since the ceasefire, none of which resulted in casualties.”

The owners of two sites said that they had sold some machines to international organizations, including the UN Development Programme (UNDP), or to municipalities that were funded by donations from UNDP and USAID. At two of the sites, researchers found remnants consistent with a US-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance kit, including a tail fin remnant with markings displaying a CAGE code for Boeing and a JDAM tail unit assembly.

In addition to the attacks Human Rights Watch documented, other media outlets have reported additional Israeli strikes that, they said, have destroyed reconstruction equipment and efforts. Public Works Studio, a Lebanese research and design studio working on issues related to reconstruction, housing, and public spaces, said that between December 2024 and November 2025, the Israeli military conducted 46 attacks on vehicles working to remove rubble and clear roads in southern Lebanon, 32 attacks on prefabricated rooms and houses set-up by residents returning to their villages, and 6 on concrete mixers, quarries, stone and aluminum factories, and wood sawmills.

On November 25, the spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Thameen Al-Kheetan, said Israeli forces had “severely hampered reconstruction efforts and attempts by internally displaced people to go back to their homes in southern Lebanon,” including through attacks on the cement and asphalt factory. He said that Israeli attacks have “destroyed and damaged civilian infrastructure, including housing units, roads, factories and construction sites,” and that Israel’s recent construction of a wall, which crosses into Lebanese territory, has “affect[ed] people’s right to return to their lands.”

Deir Siryan: August 6, 15 Machines

On the night of August 6, 2025, Israeli forces struck two bulldozer maintenance facilities in Deir Seryan in southern Lebanon. The strikes killed one person, a Syrian worker at one of the sites, and injured two others, according to the owners and Lebanon’s Ministry of Health.

Researchers visited the two sites on November 21 and observed destroyed bulldozers, excavators, and other heavy machinery, as well as damaged homes. Human Rights Watch spoke to the owners of the two sites, Ibrahim Karim and Hussein Khalil Karim, who are cousins, as well as Ibrahim’s nephew, Hussein Mohammed Karim, who works with him.

Both Ibrahim and Hussein Khalil own several heavy machines, including bulldozers, excavators and cement rollers that they rent out to municipalities and private individuals working in construction and agriculture. They also own hundreds of spare parts that they use to fix machines that others bring to them. The strikes damaged all of their machinery and spare parts, as well as

European shares closed at a record high on ⁠Friday, driven by defence and insurance stocks, as investors turned optimistic with just a handful of trading days left before the end of the year after a selloff earlier this week.The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.4% to 587.50, a day after ‌logging its best ‌one-day performance in more than three weeks and ending the week up 1.7%.The index is on track for its best annual performance ‌since 2021, aided by falling interest rates and global investors diversifying from premium-valued U.S. technology stocks.Major regional markets were also higher, with Germany's DAX up 0.4% and London's FTSE 100 gaining 0.6%.Aerospace & defence stocks led sector gains, with heavyweight banks adding 0.8%. British lenders Standard Chartered, Barclays and HSBC all gained between 0.9% and 1.4%.The banking index has risen 65% so far this year, while defence is up almost 60%."Banks have been the big winner this year and we believe that they will ‌be winners ‍once again next year," said Robert Schramm-Fuchs, European equities portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, adding ‍that they were still trading at a discount to their historic ‌valuation in Europe."This does not make any sense, given the supportive environment banks find themselves in, including excess capital position and steep yield curves," he said.Personal and household goods and retail shares were the biggest decliners. Puma, Adidas and JD Sports fell between 1.2% and 3.5% after peer Nike tumbled on the impact of weak China sales on its quarterly results. Equities rebounded on Thursday after two days of tech-led losses as an unexpected slowdown in U.S. consumer price inflation strengthened expectations for further ‍Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, and the European Central Bank maintained a hawkish stance."We had a little bit of a wobble towards the end of the year these last ‍few weeks," said Daniela ⁠Hathorn, senior market analyst at ⁠Capital.com. "A lot of the downside has been focused around overinvestment, realising that maybe these (tech) companies are not going to be able to deliver the amount of growth that has been priced in for the next few years."Cruise operator Carnival's London-listed shares were the day's strongest performers, jumping 16.6% to the top of STOXX 600 after it posted an upbeat annual profit forecast and reinstated its quarterly dividend.The European Union's decision to fund lending to Ukraine through borrowing was welcomed by markets, according to analysts, after the use of joint debt was approved while avoiding a legally contentious plan to use Russia's assets.

[TITLE]Audit flags gaps, cites lapses in ex-servicemen health scheme:
[TEXT]

NEW DELHI: Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audit tabled in Parliament on Thursday flagged serious shortcomings in Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS), pointing to inadequate hospital coverage, long-pending manpower shortages, delayed payments and infrastructure gaps that have affected healthcare access for retired defence personnel and their families.It reviewed the scheme's performance between 2018-19 and 2022-23 and examined functioning of key implementing agencies, including department of ex-servicemen welfare, central organisation ECHS, regional centres, polyclinics and service hospitals.One of the most critical findings was uneven and insufficient geographical coverage of empanelled hospitals, forcing beneficiaries in several regions to travel long distances for specialised treatment. Defence ministry told auditors that it has since simplified empanelment norms and expanded the hospital network to partially address the imbalance.It also flagged chronic manpower shortages, noting categorisation of polyclinics has not been revised since the scheme's launch in 2003, despite a steady rise in the number of ex-servicemen. Staffing levels at central organisation, regional centres and polyclinics have similarly remained unchanged.The ministry informed Parliament that 1,357 additional personnel were sanctioned in Nov 2024 for 23 new and 50 upgraded polyclinics.Shortfalls in medicines, equipment and ambulances were another concern. Auditors recorded instances of delayed medicine supply, outdated equipment, aging ambulances and weak functioning of mobile medical units.The report highlighted delays in payments to empanelled hospitals and reimbursement of beneficiaries' claims, caused by inadequate allocation under MTRE.
