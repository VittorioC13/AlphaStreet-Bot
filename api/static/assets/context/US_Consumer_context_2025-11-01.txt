[TITLE]AIG to acquire the majority of renewal rights to Everest Group’s global retail insurance portfolio in $2 billion deal:
[TEXT]
Insurance giant AIG is set to acquire the renewal rights for the majority of Everest Group’s global retail insurance portfolio worth $2 billion in premiums, sources with intimate knowledge of the deal told Fortune.

The agreement with Everest, one of the world’s largest reinsurance and insurance solutions firms, is part of AIG CEO Peter Zaffino’s transformation effort at the century-old insurance company. It will also ease Everest’s loss reserve management issues after it underestimated claim costs in its U.S. casualty insurance business, leaving the firm in need of capital.

Insiders say that AIG expects to begin writing policies for existing North America Everest clients by the start of 2026. As for clients in the European Union, AIG is positioned to begin working on that portfolio during Q1 of 2026, depending on regulatory approvals.

AIG, a $44 billion insurance company, already serves more than 88 million commercial and personal customers worldwide​, operating in more than 200 countries and jurisdictions​. Everest also serves millions of policy holders, but is substantially smaller, valued at approximately $14.5 billion.

Meanwhile, Everest has hired multiple senior executives from AIG in recent years including the company’s former legal chief Anthony Vidovich, who was named executive vice president and general counsel of Everest on Oct. 16.

The Everest deal, insiders say, did not require AIG to seek out external capital or take on debt. And while AIG will obtain the portfolio and client relationships within the deal, all existing liabilities and prior exposures will remain with Everest. This specification will allow AIG to gain access to customers and future business without inheriting responsibility for claims and obligations from policies written before the transaction closed.

The move will significantly advance AIG’s portfolio growth in general insurance, a facet which, under Zaffino’s leadership, has demonstrated consistent growth. In 2024, the company wrote $23.9 billion in insurance premiums, up 6% year over year on a comparable basis. New business in 2024 reached $4.5 billion, a 9% increase. The company’s Q1 and Q2 earnings show potential further promise. New premiums written in Q1 were up 8% on a comparable basis, bringing in $4.5 billion, with Q2 premiums generating $6.9 billion.

Growth potential and avoidance of additional financial risk are particularly important to Zaffino’s vision and turnaround of AIG. The company has faced an uphill battle following its involvement in the 2008 global financial crisis. Leading up to 2008, AIG entered into enormous volumes of largely unhedged credit default swaps, insuring more than $440 billion in assets, including $57.8 billion backed by risky subprime mortgages.

When the subprime mortgage market collapsed, AIG faced huge losses and had to pay out on the credit default contracts. As investors and counterparties demanded collateral, the company’s liquidity evaporated, requiring a $182 billion government bailout, in exchange for an equity stake.

In the decade that followed, the insurer lost more than $30 billion in underwriting—a sign of excess capital, poor risk controls, and a lack of accountability for underwriting outcomes—and endured several CEO changes.

When Zaffino became CEO in 2021, AIG had undergone massive downsizing, asset sales, and management churn, but lingering operational inefficiencies and poor profitability, especially in underwriting, remained.

Since taking over, Zaffino has led an aggressive transformation strategy focused on disciplined underwriting, operational streamlining, and technological modernization. AIG has divested non-core units, reduced its risk exposure by over $1 trillion, and invested in AI capabilities. Those include partnerships with Anthropic and Palantir to build AI-driven risk assessment and operational tools aimed at improving underwriting precision and claims efficiency.

AIG’s financial performance has markedly improved, with analysts describing it as a “different company” compared to past years. In Q2 2025, the firm reported a $1.1 billion profit, reversing a $4 billion loss a year earlier which mainly reflected the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial, a life insurance and retirement solutions provider, and other portfolio changes. Adjusted after-tax income rose 56% year over year, and AIG’s earnings per share of $1.81 beat the forecast of $1.60, while revenue of $6.88 billion surpassed the expected $6.78 billion.

[TITLE]Alison Loehnis Joins JP Morgan’s Consumer and Retail Investment Banking Team:
[TEXT]
LONDON — Alison Loehnis has joined JP Morgan as a senior adviser in the consumer and retail investment banking team and will focus on luxury and lifestyle brands sector.

She was tapped by Jeannette Smits van Oyen, global head of consumer and retail investment banking at JP Morgan, and began work earlier this month. She is based in London.

Smits van Oyen said Loehnis’ “extensive leadership experience, global network and industry relationships will provide invaluable insight as we continue to strengthen our investment banking franchise across brand sub-verticals.”

She added that the bank has been advising “across a range of industry-defining transactions across sub-verticals over the past 24 months, including the take-private of Skechers; sale of Valentino to Kering, and sale of Rhode to E.l.f. While each transaction and each sub-vertical carries its own specific dynamic, the interconnectivity between them has become increasingly apparent.”

Smits van Oyen continued: “We look forward to working with Alison to enhance our sector expertise, deepen our network and relationships across the industry and accelerate idea generation for future opportunities.”

As reported, Loehnis left her role as president and ad interim chief executive officer of Yoox Net-a-porter group earlier this year. She spent 18 years at YNAP, which has since become part of Mytheresa’s publicly quoted parent company, LuxExperience.

LuxExperience picked up Yoox Net-a-porter for 555 million euros and a 100 million-euro credit facility from Compagnie Financière Richemont. In return, it handed Richemont a 33 percent stake in the wider luxury ecommerce company.

Loehnis’ tenure at YNAP was long — and eventful — with launches, mergers and corporate deals that went through — and fell through.

Loehnis, who cut her creative and commercial teeth at companies as diverse as Thomas Pink and The Walt Disney Co., joined Net-a-porter in 2007 as vice president of sales and marketing. She rose to the role of president in 2011.

During her long tenure she spearheaded some of the digital retail group’s biggest projects, heading the development of Mr Porter in 2011 and playing a key role in the launch of The Outnet, the group’s discount site.

She also introduced new categories, such as fine jewelry, expanded the group’s markets, and was celebrated as a leader in the digital luxury world.

As ad interim CEO she helmed YNAP as it prepared to be sold to Farfetch and Mohamed Alabbar. That deal was supposed to be completed by the end of 2023, but Richemont killed it after Farfetch was placed into administration, and later rescued by Coupang.

After the deal fell through, Loehnis stayed on until another buyer for YNAP could be found.

Target's merchants and designers have drawn inspiration from traveling to rodeos, ski lodges and college campuses. Some of the retailer's fall accessories have western accents, such as purses with fringe and cowgirl-inspired hats. Melissa Repko | CNBC

MINNEAPOLIS — When shoppers browse Target 's aisles this fall, they will see purses with fringe accents, dresses made of suede-inspired fabrics and hats with a cowgirl flair. As winter comes, they'll find cozy sweaters with a ski lodge spin. Target's creative team has traveled the world to find inspiration for its brands, from a rodeo in Colorado to ski lodges in the French Alps and restaurants in New York's Hudson Valley. With global trips, an artificial intelligence-powered tool and sharper critiques of its own merchandise, the big-box retailer wants to get back to its roots: designing attention-grabbing, fashion-forward clothing and home decor at an affordable price. Target's merchandise was once a competitive advantage, but even the company admits it has lost that edge. The big-box retailer's sales have declined in some categories that it's best known for, such as home goods, as competitors lure away customers. As consumers' enthusiasm for Target's offerings has faded, annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and the company expects sales to decline this year. Shares of Target have tumbled

[TITLE]What a Federal Reserve rate cut means for your finances:
[TEXT]
Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.

NEW YORK (AP) — The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point Wednesday for the second time since September. Before that, it had gone nine months without a cut.

The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another. While the rates consumers pay to borrow money aren’t directly linked to this rate, shifts affect what you pay for credit cards, auto loans, mortgages, and other financial products.

“While the full economic impact of such a move will unfold over time, early indicators suggest that even modest rate cuts can have meaningful consequences for consumer behavior and financial health,” said Michele Raneri, vice president and head of U.S. research at credit reporting agency TransUnion.

The Fed has two goals when it sets the rate: one, to manage prices for goods and services, and two, to encourage full employment. Typically, the Fed might increase the rate to try to bring down inflation and decrease it to encourage faster economic growth and increase hiring. The challenge now is that inflation is higher than the Fed’s 2% target but the job market has been weak. The government shutdown has also prevented the collection and release of data the Fed relies on to monitor the health of the economy.

Still, the Fed has projected it will cut rates once more before the end of the year.

Here’s what to know:

Interest on savings accounts won’t be as appealing

For savers, falling interest rates will slowly erode attractive yields currently on offer with certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts.

Three of the top five high yield savings accounts had rate cuts after the last Fed rate cut in September, according to Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com, while two of the big five banks (Ally and Discover/Capital One) cut their savings account rates. The top rates for high yield savings account right now remain around 4.46% to 4.6%.

Those are still better than the trends of recent years, and a good option for consumers who want to earn a return on money they may want to access in the near-term. A high yield savings account generally has a much higher annual percentage yield than a traditional savings account. The national average for traditional savings accounts is currently 0.63%, according to Bankrate.

[TITLE]Coffee Shops Step Up as Federal Government Ends Food Assistance Funding:
[TEXT]
As the U.S. government shamelessly cuts off its largest food assistance program for citizens most in need, some coffee purveyors are stepping up to help fill the gap.

Specialty coffee shops and cafes from coast to coast have taken to social channels to announce free meal programs for SNAP recipients as the federal food benefit program is set to expire Nov. 1.

No Relief in November

In a memo filled with ethically dubious political messaging this week, the USDA under the Trump administration announced “there will be no benefits” issued for the new month.

“We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,” a large red banner on the USDA homepage currently states. “They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.”

The decision is expected to affect more than 42 million Americans in 22 million households who rely on SNAP benefits each month to put food on the table, according to USDA statistics.

Coffee Shops Stepping Up

Meanwhile in Portland, Oregon, the nonprofit coffee shop Heretic Coffee Co. said it plans to serve a “SNAP breakfast” every day until benefits return or until they “go broke doing it.” Within two days, the shop had received community support of more than $86,000, according to The Oregonian.

In Clearfield, Utah, Something Wicked Coffee (formerly Bean’s Coffee) is offering free breakfast to anyone affected. “Being hungry is a real thing… I grew up on food stamps,” owner Karen Blackwood told KUTV. The shop is funneling tips into ingredients and accepting small donations to stretch the program.

In Maine, Hailey’s Kitchen Café & Bakery in Windham began handing out free meals and built a pay-it-forward wall for neighbors to chip in. “If I had to do 100 meals a day, that would be a deficit for my business… with the support of the community, I can do that,” owner Rebecca Coffin told WMTW.

In Ellsworth, Maine, Flexit Café said it will give free hot soup and coffee to SNAP/EBT customers through November or until benefits resume, according to WABI5.

In Scranton, Pennsylvania, Northern Light Espresso Bar announced a weekly hot-breakfast day for SNAP recipients in November. The company also encouraged guests to “pay it forward” to give people in need a hot drink.

DCN is monitoring this movement as it develops. These efforts, while inspiring, remain short-term responses to the ongoing food-security crisis in the U.S., where approximately one in seven households are food-insecure.

In the meantime, a coalition of Democratic governors and attorneys general have sued the Trump administration over the decision to end SNAP benefits.

Amazon’s cloud revenue rose at the fastest clip in nearly three years, helping the company forecast quarterly sales above estimates and driving its shares up 14% in after-market trading.

The company projected increased capital spending next year.

The online retailer benefited as businesses continue to spend relentlessly on artificial intelligence software development. Massive cloud demand is helping the tech company ease the pressure from softer growth at its e-commerce business, which is gearing up for the critical holiday season amid weakness in consumer confidence stemming from global trade uncertainty.

[TITLE]US retailers lowering prices on Hershey's candy ahead of Halloween: report:
[TEXT]
American retailers are offering discounts on Hershey products ahead of Halloween as the candy maker raised prices because of tariffs and cocoa inflation, Reuters reported.

Data from investment bank Jeffries and Datasembly indicated Hershey was among food makers with the largest volume of products sold at a discount in the four weeks leading up to Oct. 4, compared to the year prior, Reuters reported. The outlet also said the data showed one U.S. retailer put more than half of Hershey's seasonal candy on sale by the start of this month.

The Jeffries data reportedly covered all Hershey products, including salty snacks. Hershey announced in July it would be instituting a double-digit price increase on average on its candy, but a company spokesperson said Halloween sweets were not included in that measure, Reuters reported.

A Hershey spokesperson disputed the report's claims. In a statement to FOX Business, the spokesperson said, "Halloween candy has been discounted less, not more, than last year."

CANDY BARS RECALLED DAYS BEFORE HALLOWEEN OVER ‘LIFE-THREATENING’ ALLERGEN RISK

"According to Circana data, the percentage of Halloween candy sales (across the category) on discount is lower versus the prior year for the period ending 10/19," the spokesperson continued. "Discounts on Hershey seasonal candy are less than last year. Hershey's percentage of sales on discount is lower versus the prior year, both in dollar sales and volume (poundage), for the period ending 10/19 and season-to-date."

Hershey CEO Kirk Tanner said in an earnings call Thursday that the company is recording disappointing Halloween sales and would adjust its seasonal product and marketing strategies going forward, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Meanwhile, the cost of chocolate has surged nearly 30% since last Halloween. It's up almost 78% from five years ago, according to Circana and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while candy and gum overall have climbed 39% since February 2020.

A FinanceBuzz study found that a 100-piece bag of assorted Halloween candy now averages $16.39, up from $9.19 in 2020.

In addition to new tariffs and broader grocery inflation, experts say a global cocoa shortage tied to poor harvests and climate shifts in West Africa has sent cocoa prices soaring.

Candy makers are responding by shrinking bars and experimenting with new products, including fruit-flavored, sour, chili-coated, goo-filled and freeze-dried sweets, as well as more cocoa-free white chocolate and crème options — and candy corn, of course.

The round valued Whatnot at $11.5 billion, the company said in a Tuesday (Oct. 28) post on LinkedIn.

“We started with a simple idea: shopping should be more personal, more connected and more human,” Whatnot said in its post. “That vision has now powered more than $6 billion in live sales this year alone, and we’re just getting started.”

The company added: “We’re building Whatnot to help small business owners and entrepreneurs grow what they love into something bigger.”

Whatnot’s livestream shopping platform offers auctions, flash sales and live show giveaways, according to the company’s website. Its sellers offer products in more than 250 categories, including fashion, coins, sports and Pokémon cards, and sneakers.

The company’s latest funding round was co-led by DST Global and CapitalG, according to its post. CapitalG is Alphabet’s independent growth fund.

CapitalG said in a Tuesday post on LinkedIn that this is the third Whatnot funding round that it has co-led, with the others being a Series C in 2021 and a Series D in 2022.

The company said in the post that it has “more conviction than ever in Whatnot’s trajectory towards building one of the world’s iconic marketplaces.”

Whatnot’s focus on enthusiast communities has created a great marketplace for collectors and hobbyists as well as a livelihood for “hundreds of thousands” of small business owners, CapitalG said in its post.

“The transition to e-commerce made shopping efficient but less personal and significantly less fun,” the company said. “Whatnot has brought the joy of the hunt online, blending storefront, show and community hangout into one platform.”

PYMNTS reported in January that a convergence of physical stores and digital innovations like live shopping a reshaping the future of retail.

Whatnot raised $265 million in a Series E funding round in January. That round valued the live shopping marketplace at $4.97 billion.

The company’s co-founder and CEO, Grant LaFontaine, said at the time that Whatnot was working to promote the mainstreaming of livestream selling.

“We believe there’s a better way to shop online, and it starts with creating a platform where sellers can grow thriving businesses around the things they care about most,” LaFontaine said. “We’ve proven this leads to the happiest experience for consumers and sellers alike.”
