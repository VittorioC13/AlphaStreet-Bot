Segmental Insights

By solution analysis

Which Solution Led the Digital Manufacturing in Life Sciences Market in 2024?

The manufacturing execution systems (MES) & process automation segment captured the dominating share of the digital manufacturing in life sciences market in 2024. Mainly driven by demand for serialization, Electronic Batch Records (EBRs), and lowering labor expenses/shortages. Nowadays, the globe is promoting seamless, building-block MES platforms that adapt to complex needs, including tailored medicine. Recently, Tulip debuted a composable MES for life sciences, focusing on validated workflows and adaptability.

On the other hand, the AI, ML, and digital twin platforms segment is predicted to expand rapidly. Especially, AI and patient digital twins simulate patient responses, particularly in Alzheimer's or G12C KRAS mutation cases, for minimising trial durations and identifying efficient therapies rapidly, bypassing some physical trials. Furthermore, immersive Dassault Systèmes facilitates "Virtual Twin as a Service" for healthcare and life sciences, employs AI for virtual human body twins ("Emma") and improves processes. PapAI/Datategy offers AI layers by integrating with digital twins to provide predictive insights and boost operations across the value chain.

By deployment mode analysis

What Made the On-Premises Segment Dominant in the Market in 2024?

The on-premises segment led with the largest share of the digital manufacturing in life sciences market in 2024. Many life science firms, specifically pharma companies, deal with highly sensitive patient data, R&D, and intellectual property, which makes on-premises a preference for maximum control against breaches. The latest developments include Siemens Xcelerator adoption, FDA support for Process Analytical Tech (PAT), and modular, lean manufacturing cells for devices.

[TITLE]This is how exposed European Big Pharma is to the U.S.:
[TEXT]
Novo Nordisk CEO Maziar Mike Doustdar shakes hands with U.S. President Donald Trump during an event to announce a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to reduce the prices of GLP-1 weight‑loss drugs during an event in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 6, 2025.

Among the 10 largest biopharmaceutical companies in the Stoxx 600 health index, five have a majority of their total sales from the U.S.: Roche , Novo Nordisk , GSK , Argenx , and UCB .

But exactly how exposed are Europe's biggest pharma companies to the U.S. market?

President Donald Trump has pushed for lower drug prices for Americans through so-called Most Favored Nations drug pricing, whereby the prices in the U.S. are set at the lowest price paid by other wealthy countries. That could have a tremendous impact on companies' balance sheets.

As the largest single market for most pharma and biotech firms, higher drug prices in the U.S. — often nearly three times as costly as in other countries — are a key factor in the industry's reliance on American sales, with branded drugs commanding even steeper premiums.

Drug pricing has emerged as one of the biggest issues for pharmaceutical companies this year, as the U.S. looks to dramatically reduce the costs paid by consumers.

Argenx is the most exposed, with 85% of total sales originating in the U.S. in its last reported period.

The least exposed are Germany's Merck KGaA and Bayer , with
