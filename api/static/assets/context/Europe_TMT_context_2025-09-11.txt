[TITLE]King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard Make Albums “Name Your Price” on Bandcamp After Leaving Spotify:
[TEXT]
King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard have raised the bar. After leaving Spotify earlier this summer over the streaming platform CEO Daniel Ek’s investment in AI drone technology, the Australian psych rockers have made their music more accessible on Bandcamp by switching to a name-your-price model for fans looking to access their digital catalog.

“Can we put pressure on these Dr. Evil tech bros to do better? Join us on another platform,” the band posted to Instagram back in July. Now, after more than a month of their music being unavailable on streaming platforms, the world can purchase their jams at a lower price than the previous minimum of $10 for each album.

King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are just one of a growing group of artists fleeing Spotify in response to Ek serving as chairman of Helsing, a German company that specializes in AI military software. Xiu Xiu, Deerhoof, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor are just some of the acts that have pulled their music from Spotify for that reason.

The band is set to go back on the road next month, for a combination of orchestral shows in support of their most recent album, Phantom Island, mixed in with a series of “rave sets.” The gigs rev back up on Halloween night (October 31st) in Manchester, UK, followed by stops in London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and more before wrapping up in December in Melbourne.

LONDON -- ASML, a leading Dutch maker of chipmaking gear, is investing 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) into French artificial intelligence startup Mistral AI, the two said on Tuesday, announcing a partnership between two of Europe's top technology companies.

ASML Holding, based in Veldhoven, Netherlands, holds an important role in the global tech industry because it makes equipment used to manufacture semiconductors, including the most advanced microchips used for cutting-edge AI systems.

Mistral was founded two years ago in Paris by former researchers at Google DeepMind and Meta Platforms and quickly became a European tech darling.

The partnership underscores Europe's efforts to reduce exposure to American technology. President Donald Trump's increasingly hostile attitude to European Union tech regulations has fueled debate about whether the continent is too dependent on services provided by U.S. tech companies such as cloud computing and mobile operating systems.

Mistral makes the Le Chat chatbot but it has struggled to keep up with American AI companies like ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, and Chinese rivals like DeepSeek.

ASML's chipmaking equipment can cost hundreds of millions of dollars but the U.S. government has blocked it from selling its most advanced machines to China.

The deal gives ASML an 11% stake in Mistral, and values the startup at about 11.7 billion euros. The 1.3 billion euro investment is part of a larger funding round worth 1.7 billion euros, which also involves venture capital firms and chipmaker Nvidia.

[TITLE]Vodafone Idea moves Supreme Court against additional ₹9,450 cr AGR dues demand:
[TEXT]
Vodafone Idea Ltd has filed a fresh writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging an additional demand of ₹9,450 crore by the Union government towards adjusted gross revenue dues.

The Supreme Court had on 18 March 2020 locked Vodafone Idea’s AGR dues till 2016-17 based on calculations by the department of telecommunications (DoT), adding that no self-assessment or re-assessment of the dues would be permitted.

But DoT has now sought additional payments for up to 2018-19, Vodafone Idea said in its petition dated 8 September, which Mint has seen.

Of the ₹9,450 crore, the additional demand raised by DoT from Idea Group and Vodafone Idea (post merger in August 2018) was at ₹2,774 crore, while the demand against Vodafone Group (pre-merger) was ₹6,675 crore, according to the petition.

[TITLE]UK AI sector balloons by 85% to 5,800 companies from 2023 to 2025:
[TEXT]
A Perspective Economics study commissioned by the Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT), published last week, states that the UK’s AI sector now contains 5,800 AI companies – an increase of 85% increase over the past two years. Revenue from AI now stands at £23.9bn, according to the study.

In a foreword to the study, Feryal Clark, Parliamentary under-secretary of state for AI and digital government, said this means since 2022, the UK AI sector has grown 150 times faster than the economy at large.

Perspective Economics is a boutique economics and policy advisory firm based in Belfast, founded in 2017 by Jonathan Hobson and Sam Donaldson. It has done other government studies, including one on the UK’s cyber security sector for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.

So, how does its study construe the AI sector? Its headline companies are Google Deepmind, Darktrace, computer vision company Tractable, and energy management outfit Limejump. But it also includes Fujitsu and the London Stock Exchange Group.

It adopts a capacious definition of what constitutes an AI company, classifying them as “dedicated” or “diversified”, companies that provide AI products or services as part of a broader business offer. The companies assayed come from 22 sectors, from aerospace, through healthcare and wellness, to telecommunications.

Most of the “dedicated” suppliers are developing or applying perceptual systems, such as computer vision and image processing, speech and audio processing, multi-modal integration, and anomaly/signal detection. Companies primarily involved in developing or applying autonomous and agentic systems number 1,684, while 1,280 provide AI infrastructure and 1,265 do AI security, according to the research. The dedicated AI company revenues increased by 9% between 2023 and 2024, from £4.4bn £4.9bn.

US tech giants Amazon, Google Deepmind, IBM, and Meta have added most to estimated revenue and employment increases, while generative AI model providers Anthropic and OpenAI have seen among the largest percentage increases in estimated UK AI employment since 2023.

Since starting the study in 2022, Perspective Economics calculates that the number of full-time employees employed across both dedicated and diversified AI companies has increased by 72%, from 50,040 in 2022 to 86,139 in 2024, an increase of 36,099 workers.

In their conclusion, the study’s authors said that investment in the UK’s AI sector has mounted to a “record £2.9bn, surpassing previous highs. Renewed investor confidence is complemented by significant inward investment, with £15bn of investment announced in 2024 creating up to 6,500 jobs.”

They add that while London and the South East still account for a majority of AI activity, the doubling of AI companies in regions such as the West Midlands, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber demonstrates substantive uptake of AI related opportunities across regions.

In the study, they note that in 2023 and 2024 the North West accounted for the fourth highest share of new company incorporation, followed by the West Midlands, the South West and Yorkshire and the Humber. However, the study also shows that only 3% of new companies are in Scotland and, 1.4% in Wales, and 0.9% in Northern Ireland.

The study’s appendix registers some commentary from interviewees that enter some caveats to attempts to exaggerate the scale and scope of the UK’s AI sector.

One AI investor said: “We’re not interested in companies that have simply bolted on a bit of generative AI. We’re looking for businesses with proprietary datasets or valid imported data, and the capability to connect that meaningfully to relevant LLMs. That’s where the IP lies – and that’s what’s interesting.

“The generative AI boom has led to an explosion of companies across the country – not just in the South East and Cambridge. There are now hundreds, maybe even thousands, of companies in the North that meet the criteria for our fund. The challenge now is how to identify the right ones”.

Another registered a precise skills issue: “What is more difficult is finding data scientists who are commercially minded – people who understand business problems and can use statistics to solve them. That’s quite rare.”

And in terms of sovereign AI capability, one said: “[The UK has] some good colocation data centres, but most of our data is stored with AWS or Google.”

[TITLE]Government promises to cut regulatory 'burden' on firms:
[TEXT]
The Government has pledged to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses, as part of efforts to make Ireland more competitive.

The commitment forms part of a new Action Plan on Competitiveness and Productivity, launched today, aimed at increasing Ireland's international competitiveness and resilience.

It is designed to boost innovation, investment and productivity in key areas of the economy, in light of the evolving geopolitical and international trade environment.

The 124-page plan, which covers six key areas, sets out 85 actions, of which 26 are described as priorities.

The areas cover "Embracing Research, Innovation and Skills", "Boosting FDI and Exports and Influencing at EU Level", "Creating and Scaling More SMEs", "Regulating for Growth and Controlling Costs", "Increasing the State’s Capacity to Deliver Infrastructure" and "Growing Sustainable Irish Businesses and Boosting Regional Development".

The wide-ranging actions contained in the plan include significantly reducing regulation for SMEs, establishing a National Artificial Intelligence Office to drive innovation and uptake in AI and scaling-up funding for SMEs.

The plan also commits to publish a new national Life Sciences Strategy and provide the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission with new powers to impose administrative financial sanctions for breaches of consumer protection legislation.

A plan to establish a new Regional Enterprise Development Fund is also among the other actions, along with setting up a Stakeholder Forum of key agencies to focus on the actions required to facilitate what is described as the "swift progression of daa's planning application for the construction of infrastructure including additional pier and stand capacity at Dublin Airport to facilitate an increase in passenger numbers to 40 million per annum, while respecting independence of planning authority."

The plan was launched today by Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Simon Harris, Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke and Minister of State Sean Canney.

The Government said the delivery of the initiative was accelerated given the changing international economic and trading environment.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Simon Harris, Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment Peter Burke and Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Sean Canney

Each of the actions is being assigned to a Government Department or Agency, which will have responsibility for its delivery within a specified time period.

The implementation of the plan will be overseen by a Senior Officials Group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.

The action plan noted that when the country's performance was benchmarked against other advanced economies, "the evidence clearly indicates that Ireland's competitiveness, while strong overall, is lagging some of our competitor jurisdictions in six key areas."

The Minister for Enterprise said the plan will provide the country with the "best chance to improve our infrastructure," which he said is under pressure in the areas of energy, water, housing and competitiveness.

"Yesterday's value offering will not survive today to attract more foreign direct investment and that's why we've brought forward this plan that really will chart where investment needs to go," Minister Peter Burke said.

He said energy has been a big pressure point for the country, adding that the Government now has "a very clear pathway of bringing more energy into the system, improving our infrastructure."

On regulation, Minister Burke said Ireland does need to do things "simpler, faster and lighter."

"We are very much focused on doing things sharper, really focused on efficiency, ensuring that regulation really matches its intended purpose," he said.

"Regulation should be there to protect us. It shouldn't be there to add latency onto some of the objectives of many firms across our country," he added.

Minister Burke said the Taoiseach and his department "will lead an effort to reducing regulatory burden in a number of areas whereby we believe it has got out of hand."

Asked if the plan could result in the number of regulatory bodies being reduced, he said: "We do need to be careful, but we need to ensure that any current regulator [does] things that really achieve the goals of the Irish economy, but also of business."

"We don't want a situation whereby so many reports are contradictory and it's that cross sectoral issue that as a huge concern right across government, that some regulators ask questions that have already been answered in other areas," he stated.

The Chairperson of the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council has welcomed the plan but said that "implementation is key."

Dr Frances Ruane said the NCPC will be "monitoring what's happening, the progress that is being made, and speaking publicly to that, so we keep it on track."

She said Ireland is "lagging behind in certain areas and we're losing space". She also said while the county does "pretty well in a lot of areas, but with basic infrastructure, we're down."

"If you look at something like water, which is such a crucial infrastructure for us, and we've got delays being announced in a situation where the public good is really being undermined, I think it's really important that that's kept in the focus, and we get movement on that, and we don't allow planning and other impediments to get in the way of the government delivering for society," she stated.

Dr Ruane said the Council will call out the Government "if they're not making the progress that we see is required."

She also said it would be "really good to see the budget this year reflect what the Government has committed to in the Action Plan on Competitiveness and Productivity."

Business group Ibec has also welcomed the publication of the plan, which it described as "a very positive and important step in future-proofing Ireland's economic model in a time of global change."

Ibec's Executive Director of Lobbying and Influence, Fergal O’Brien, said over the past year we have experienced unprecedented levels of global trading uncertainty and the country's competitiveness has been significantly undermined in its vital trading relationship with the US.

He said the Action Plan sets out "practical and timebound measures to improve Ireland's overall competitiveness."

"It is vital to ensuring that we secure future international investment while creating the right conditions for Irish businesses to grow and internationalise," he added.

Mr O’Brien said the business representative group is "especially pleased" to see a number of its key asks reflected in the announcement, including "greater ambition for innovation investment, a commitment to increase public funding to match our competitors, reform of the R&D tax credit, and the development of a new national Life Sciences Strategy."

Ibec said Budget 2026 must provide the necessary resources to underpin the ambitions laid out in the plan and it said the Government must ensure accountability in delivering all aspects.

[TITLE]General Sir Jim Hockenhull’s DSEI 2025 Keynote Speech:
[TEXT]
Good afternoon. For those of you that don’t know me, my name is Jim, and I have the pleasure of both working in and being the Commander of the Cyber & Specialist Operations Command, or ‘CSOC’.

It’s a real privilege to stand before you today as the first Commander.

It is also a pleasure to be at DSEI — one of the most important and high-profile gatherings for defence and security in the world. An event where the ideas that will shape our collective future are discussed and debated, and where we come together in friendship, and crucially, in partnership.

Today is a milestone moment for my Command and for our people.

Last week, on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence and the Chief of the Defence Staff, we officially stood up Cyber & Specialist Operations Command, and today I want to set out the implications of that change.

A change which represents a transformation in posture, purpose, and mindset. A transformation which reflects the operational challenges and realities we face today.

A reality where we are in constant contact in the Cyber & EM Domain, where it’s imperative that we invest in and nurture our Specialists to continue to give us the edge.

A reality where delivering operations and operational success is a 24/7, 365 endeavour. A reality where my Command is “Always On”.

We’re living through a period of profound change in the character of warfare. From grey-zone tactics to hybrid, from the electromagnetic spectrum to space. Our adversaries are faster, more adaptive, and more unpredictable than at any point since the end of the Cold War.

Cyberattacks are now a daily reality for the UK and many of our Allies. And our adversaries are probing our networks, targeting our infrastructure, and seeking to undermine public trust.

Disinformation is used as a weapon, eroding cohesion at home and sowing doubt abroad. Drones, artificial intelligence, and autonomy, are no longer emerging technologies. They are in the fight today.

The 2025 Strategic Defence Review was clear: to make Britain safer, secure at home, and strong abroad, we must accelerate towards warfighting readiness. We must be able to deter, and if necessary, to fight today, tomorrow, and in the uncertain decades ahead.

But we must also be ready to compete today, tomorrow and into the future. And we must put NATO first, because our security is indivisible from that of our allies and partners. So, we’ll focus on doing this together.

CSOC is central to delivering on the SDR’s vision. Building on the Strong Foundations of Strategic Command, we bring together Defence’s cyber and specialist forces into one unified, four-star Command — operating as a Military Command alongside the Royal Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air Force.

We are designed to detect threats early, act decisively across all domains — Maritime, Land, Air, Space, Cyber & Electro-Magnetic.

We are the unseen force — always on, enabling global operations and operating every hour of every day to keep our nation secure.

In our brief time, I want to cover three things. Firstly, our responsibilities, and my responsibilities to CDS and Ministers as Commander CSOC. Including how we are driving the delivery of priority SDR outcomes.

I want to unpack the name a little, including our leadership of the Cyber and EM Domain for Defence and the vital contribution of our People, our Specialists.

And finally, I want to set out the importance of how we need to work in partnership, using our leadership of Defence’s Digital Targeting Web as an example.

So, our mission is to generate and operate specialist capabilities, ready to fight across all domains, to make the United Kingdom secure at home and strong abroad.

First, we deliver and enable specialist operations, including medical support.

Integrated operations that are precise and often discreet, from supporting NATO’s frontline deterrence in Europe, to protecting UK citizens and interests overseas.

Ensuring warfighting readiness while keeping our forces healthy, fit to fight and ready to respond globally.

Enabling global operations that are co-ordinated through our Permanent Joint Headquarters at Northwood, supported and underpinned by contributions across CSOC, the single Services and across the Defence Enterprise.

Second, we combat cyber and electromagnetic threats, and malign activities.

Our Defence Cyber and EM Forces will deliver advanced cyber and electromagnetic capabilities for military effect. Defending our networks and disrupting daily attacks from our adversaries, I’ll come back to them a little later.

Thirdly, we arm Defence with data, information, and intelligence.

We lead surveillance, intelligence and reconnaissance activities, turning data into insight, and insight into action.

Harnessing artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate decision-making and deliver digital precision.

This in turn underpins our work on Defence’s Digital Targeting Web. With CSOC on point to Ministers as the Lead Command for delivery of this vital initiative.

Fourthly, we advance the UK’s influence through defence diplomacy.

Our Integrated Global Defence Network, comprising of our Overseas Bases and Defence Diplomacy teams, builds and nurtures deep partnerships globally, enhancing our operational effectiveness and strengthening our ability to deter and respond to crises worldwide.

As well as a making a critical contribution to the success of UK exports, supporting the growth agenda and helping to implement the Defence Industrial Strategy.

Finally, we educate and innovate to prepare for the future.

We are investing in our people, developing specialist skills, and embracing new technologies so that our forces are ready for whatever comes next.

We are supporting, educating and enabling our next generation of leaders and operators through the Defence Academy.

We’re also responsible for a series of five high priority SDR outcomes, which need to be delivered at pace.

So, these are: standing up the Defence Cyber & EM Force, announced in the Defence Review, by November this year, including establishing the Digital Warfighting Group, by July next year.

We will deliver Defence’s Digital Targeting Web, to bring a step change in lethality.

We will improve the coherence of Intelligence capabilities across Defence, through the Military Intelligence Services.

And we will create the Defence Counter-Intelligence Unit, again by November this year.

And we will bolster our medical capabilities through an evolved Defence Medical Enterprise, across the Armed Forces, and the leadership the Defence Medical Services.

So, what’s in a name?

The leadership of Cyber & Specialist Operations Command doubles down on our leadership of the Cyber & Electro-Magnetic Domain.

Without the change, the Cyber & EM Domain is the key limiting factor in our ability to achieve a tech-enabled Integrated Force capable of out-thinking and out-manoeuvring our adversaries. We must ‘fight as one’ across the Cyber and EM Domain, to unlock its potential and to enable and amplify our ability to combat our adversaries in all domains.

A vital component of CSOC is our new Defence Cyber & EM Force.

This force will compete with and out-manoeuvre our adversaries in the Cyber EM Domain. Working closely across Government, including with the National Cyber Security Centre and with our international partners,

This new force will lead the fight in protecting UK military networks, where we have caught over 90,000 attempts by Russian speaking actors to penetrate our systems in the last two years.

It will also enhance Defence’s ability to operate in the increasingly congested and contested electromagnetic environment and will allow us to anticipate emerging threats in the Cyber & EM Domain. It will be formally established in November, when we will officially stand up the new force.

But I can say a little more
