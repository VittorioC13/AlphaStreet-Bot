NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — A group of countries that are part of the OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countries has agreed to a small boost in oil production, citing a steady global economic outlook.

The group said after a virtual meeting on Sunday that it will raise oil production by 137,000 barrels per day in November, they same amount it announced for October. The group has been raising output slightly in a series of boosts all year, after announcing cuts in 2023 and 2024.

In a statement the group said the move was due to “a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals.” It added the production adjustments may be paused or reversed as market conditions evolve.

Saudi Arabia holds significant influence in OPEC+ as the dominant member of the OPEC producers’ cartel, and Russia is the leading non-OPEC member in the 22-country alliance.

Along with Saudi Arabia and Russia, the group that met Sunday is made up of Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman. Their next meeting is scheduled for Nov. 2.

The group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Russia and some smaller producers has increased its oil output targets by more than 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, equating to

[TITLE]Golub Capital Bets $1 Billion on Private Equity's Secret Lifeline:
[TEXT]
This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Golub Capital is stepping deeper into private equity's newest obsession, committing at least $1 billion of its own capital to a fresh strategy that will back continuation vehicles the funds that let buyout firms hold their favorite assets for longer. The firm will also raise external capital for the strategy, which targets middle-market companies across the US and Europe. Greg Cashman, Golub's veteran co-head of direct lending, will lead the initiative with a dedicated team. President David Golub said the expansion marks a natural extension of the firm's lending franchise into the fast-growing world of GP-led secondaries.

The New York-based lender, managing around $80 billion, is betting that this corner of private equity could be one of the few engines of deal activity left in a sluggish exit market. The firm already has a $1.7 billion co-investment program alongside private equity partners, a base it now aims to leverage for its new strategy. Continuation vehicles often single-asset funds rolled out by private equity firms to hold prized companies longer made up nearly one-fifth of global PE exits in the first half of 2025, compared with 13% for all of last year, according to Jefferies Financial Group (NYSE:JEF). The rise signals how firms are adapting to higher rates and tougher valuations by keeping their winners in-house.

A wave of major players, including Warburg Pincus, Leonard Green & Partners, New Mountain Capital, and H.I.G. Capital, are already moving in the same direction, pitching vehicles that invest in rivals' continuation funds. Institutional investors are beginning to take notice the Teacher Retirement System of Texas recently committed $150 million to a Leonard Green secondary fund. For Golub Capital (GCP), the opportunity could be timely: by anchoring this market shift, the firm positions itself not only as a lender but as a strategic liquidity provider at a moment when private equity's traditional exit doors remain half-closed.

[TITLE]Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC): JPMorgan Bullish on Clean Energy Stock:
[TEXT]
Brookfield Renewable Corporation (NYSE:BEPC) is included among the 12 Most Promising Clean Energy Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts.

Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC): Most Promising Clean Energy Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts

Brookfield Renewable Corporation (NYSE:BEPC) is one of the clean energy stocks that look well-positioned to benefit from the rising global electricity demand as well as the AI megatrends. This is because the company has solid assets in the hydro and battery storage space that provide a key competitive moat, supporting baseload power and enabling high-value re-contracting as legacy agreements expire. Financial experts note that the asset recycling strategy and inflation-linked revenues support management’s confidence in delivering 10%+ annual FFO per share growth. The firm’s operations consist of approximately 13,948 megawatts of installed hydroelectric, wind, solar, and storage and ancillary capacity located in Brazil, Colombia, North America, and Europe.

In mid-September, an analyst from JPMorgan raised the price target on Brookfield Renewable Corporation (NYSE:BEPC) stock to $41 from $39 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. In an investor note, the analyst attributed the target raise to an updated clean energy model and establishing December 2026 targets versus December 2025 previously.

While we acknowledge the potential of BEPC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BEPC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

[TITLE]Oil Majors Brace for Dividend Drought as Sub-$70 Crude Bites:

Sub-$70 oil is squeezing margins, forcing Exxon, Chevron, and BP to rethink $100 billion in annual returns.

Dividends to Dry Up as Sub-$70 Crude Squeezes Supermajors

- Amidst fears of oversupply and tariff-impacted demand slowdown, global oil majors are widely expected to start cutting their shareholder payouts as sub-70 oil prices loom large over the horizon.

- Most majors need oil prices above $80 per barrel to sustain current levels of dividends and share buybacks, with France’s TotalEnergies already flagging that it will reduce buybacks from Q4 2025 onwards.

- Most US oil firms have been primarily focused on job cuts lately, with ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips announcing significant layoffs (the former to the extent of 20-25% of global workforce).

- Five leading supermajors (Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and TotalEnergies) are

If OpenAI wants to win the AI race, it may need to bring its own power supply.

The ChatGPT maker has signed a multibillion-dollar partnership deal with AMD to deploy 6 gigawatts of the semiconductor company's artificial intelligence chips. Just last week, OpenAI and chip designer Nvidia announced a deal for 10 gigawatts of computing power.

OpenAI has said that it desperately needs access to more compute in order to realize its ambitious growth strategy, but its recent chip deals have begotten another crucial need: more power.

In the US, the AI race has strained the electric grid to a near-breaking point. Utilities are reporting the need for
