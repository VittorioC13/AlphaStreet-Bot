Medical startup MAUI Imaging announced Tuesday it has raised $14 million in Series D funding to develop ultrasound technology that can glimpse beyond traditional devices.

While ultrasounds are mostly used for soft tissue, MAUI says it's developing a system to see through and around traditional barriers like bone, gas, fat, instruments, and implants. The company aims to expedite diagnosis and treatment, particularly in trauma scenarios, given that this kind of imaging typically requires CT or MRI scans.

A father-son duo founded MAUI — an acronym for Multiple Aperture Ultrasound Insonification — out of their Silicon Valley garage in 2006.

The late Don Specht started developing the technology while building space telescopes at Lockheed Martin, and sought — alongside his son David, a former Air Force flyer-turned-entrepreneur who serves as MAUI's CEO — to apply it to the human body.

"We had to wait for Moore's Law to catch up," David Specht said of MAUI's long developmental road.

The company emerged from stealth in August 2024 with a $4 million Department of Defense contract to study its applications in the field. The military is particularly interested in using the portable system for trauma assessment by corpsmen or medics with minimal training, Specht said.

"They're trying to move the decision-making point as far forward as possible because they don't have enough doctors," Specht said.

He added that MAUI's imaging results in a massive trove of data that could be useful for AI health tools.

MAUI counts eight employees and eight consultants, and it has raised roughly $40 million to date.

The Series D included equity funding and was led by ultrasound device company Acertara, which now has exclusive distribution rights to the system. The average sales price for the system is $85,000, plus maintenance costs, Specht said.

While the FDA has cleared the device for traditional ultrasound uses, MAUI — which has 160 patents — will use data gleaned from its clinical trials with the military as it seeks clearance to make claims about seeing through and around obstructions.

Here's a look at the pitch deck MAUI Imaging used to raise its $14 million Series D. Some slides and details have been redacted in order to share the deck publicly.

[TITLE]Spear AI secures $2.3M seed funding and $6M Navy contract for submarine AI technology:
[TEXT]
Spear AI, a startup founded by two U.S. Navy veterans, has secured $2.3 million in seed funding and a $6 million contract from the U.S. Navy. The company aims to revolutionize underwater surveillance using artificial intelligence. Michael Hunter, a former Navy SEAL analyst, and John McGunnigle, a retired nuclear submarine commander, launched Spear AI in 2021.

The Washington-based company specializes in interpreting passive acoustic data, which is underwater sound collected by hydrophones and other listening devices. Underwater acoustic data is mostly unstructured and unlabeled, making it challenging for traditional AI systems to analyze. Spear AI’s solution includes deployable sensors that can be attached to buoys or vessels, along with AI-driven software that labels and organizes the data.

This enables advanced machine learning models to extract actionable intelligence from the ocean of noise. The $6 million Navy contract focuses on deploying Spear AI’s data-labeling tool, designed to support more accurate threat classification and improve response times to evolving underwater risks. This capability is critical as rival powers increase submarine deployments, and information asymmetry under the sea remains a major vulnerability for naval forces.

Securing underwater intelligence with AI

The $2.3 million seed funding round was backed by venture capital firms focused on artificial intelligence and national defense technologies. The capital will fuel the company’s growth, including a planned expansion of its 40-person workforce, which the founders say will double in the coming months.

Beyond military use, Spear AI is exploring commercial applications, such as monitoring undersea infrastructure like oil pipelines and subsea internet cables. The startup also plans to offer consulting services, helping clients embed AI capabilities into their operations, particularly in complex, high-risk environments where accuracy and reliability are critical. However, the growing use of AI in warfare capabilities has raised concerns about an AI arms race.

The U.S. has expressed concerns about China’s potential in developing super military technologies powered by AI, prompting restrictions on some chip exports to China. Chinese Premier Li Qiang warned that artificial intelligence development must be weighed against security risks, emphasizing the need for global consensus. As global tensions rise and the Pentagon pushes to modernize its forces, startups like Spear AI are expected to play a growing role in reshaping 21st-century defense strategies.

The company’s AI-first approach could redefine how threats are detected and neutralized in domains like undersea warfare, where surveillance has historically lagged due to technical limitations. With the support of their recent funding and the Navy contract, Spear AI is poised to make significant strides in enhancing underwater surveillance, presenting new possibilities for both military and civilian applications.

[TITLE]India's AI boom hides dependency risks under Trump deregulation:
[TEXT]
India's AI boom hides dependency risks under Trump deregulation

India may benefit in the short term from a renewed US push to ease restrictions on artificial intelligence exports, but the shift could deepen its long-term reliance on American chipmakers and AI technology providers, analysts say.

Quick gains, lasting dependencies

The Trump administration released its AI Action Plan on July 23, 2025, following Executive Order 14179 issued in January 2025. The order directed officials to draft a strategy to strengthen US leadership in artificial intelligence and reduce regulatory barriers.

"In the short-term three to five-year period, Trump's AI Action Plan supports the AI infrastructure and AI-for-everyone growth across Asia, including India, with easy access supported by deregulation," said Dr. Danish Faruqui, CEO of Fab Economics, a US-based boutique semiconductor fab/OSAT greenfield projects advisory and datacenter investment advisory firm.

However, he warned that India and other Asian nations could return to pre-2020 levels of reliance on US-based companies for critical AI infrastructure.

"In the longer term 7 to 10 years effect, it dampens the urgency for developing domestic solutions for AI chip design, architectures, semiconductors, connectivity solutions, LLM and other components across the AI value chain, as all Asian nations like in the pre-2020 era would now after five years again be reliant on US headquartered AI players for AI infrastructure needs that serve as AI led growth vision for every nation," he said.

US chip exports set to resume

The AI Action Plan marks a reversal in US policy, lifting restrictions on AI semiconductor exports that were imposed through executive orders during the Biden administration.

"Key US-headquartered players like AI hardware companies Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Micron, and Seagate are now cleared to ship to Asian countries the previously sanctioned products, such as AI chip products across compute, networking, memory, and storage components of datacenter infrastructure, including Nvidia H20, AMD MI 308, Intel Gaudi, and Micron's HBM3E," Faruqui said.

According to Fab Economics' proprietary modeling, this change could drive major growth in AI datacenter infrastructure across the region.

"The Asian datacenter business growth from 2025 to 2029 holds potential for over US$1.2 trillion of AI chip consumption across compute, networking, memory, and storage, driven by over 30 GW of AI infrastructure projects, including announced, ground-breaking, and speculative projects based on policy announcements. This growth is mostly captured by US-headquartered AI players, culminating in over US$345 billion in cumulative annual revenue growth for US players," he said.

India's trillion-dollar crossroads

India has laid out a US$10 trillion economic vision centered around AI-led growth. But that goal depends heavily on scaling up AI infrastructure, most of which still relies on imports from US firms.

"India's US$10 trillion economic vision is predicated on AI-led growth, which in turn relies on domestic AI hardware infrastructure scale-up to drive AI use cases across public, enterprise, and individual levels," Faruqui said. "AI hardware infrastructure supply currently needs to be imported in India, which is mostly produced by US-headquartered AI value chain players across compute, networking, memory, connectivity, and storage datacenter infrastructure components like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Micron, and Seagate."

To avoid over-reliance, Fab Economics advises India to rethink its AI infrastructure investment policy and simultaneously pursue domestic capability building.

"Specifically for India, this is a seize-it-all moment, as it competes for AI infrastructure, domestic and FDI-based projects with other Asian countries," he said.

"India must recalibrate and develop an AI datacenter investment policy amidst recent changes, one that is attractive globally and meets all success factors required for AI infrastructure site selection and setup," Faruqui added.

"In parallel, India must focus on aggressive development of domestic AI hardware and software stack components by garnering support from both US and non-US partners, though treading carefully to balance geopolitical guardrails on AI technology to ensure sustained access."

The balancing act ahead

India's AI strategy now stands at a pivotal juncture. While deregulation under Trump's AI Action Plan opens the door to faster infrastructure growth through access to high-performance US chips, it also risks reinforcing external dependencies that could limit the country's ability to shape its own AI future.

The influx of foreign technology, though beneficial in the short term, may reduce the urgency for investing in homegrown semiconductor and AI stack development.

To mitigate this, policymakers must pursue a dual-track approach that involves welcoming foreign investment while also advancing domestic capabilities at speed. By recalibrating its AI datacenter policies and fostering partnerships with both US and non-US players, India can position itself as a competitive and self-reliant hub for AI innovation without compromising long-term resilience.

[TITLE]4 M&A trends keeping bankers busy this summer: JPMorgan:
[TEXT]

Forget summer Fridays.

The notion of "summer lull" has been gone from Wall Street since the pandemic, said Anu Aiyengar, global head of advisory and M&A at JPMorgan Chase. And it's never been more true than now: M&A activity has been rebounding even amid fears that Trump's trade wars could slow the economy.

"The last week of May and June and early July have all been pretty active with a good cadence of deal announcements," Aiyengar told Business Insider. "And more importantly, our pipeline and conversations continue to be active as well."

The bank on Wednesday released a report showing that M&A in the first half of the year hit its highest levels since 2022, driven largely by large deals. Here are four of the top trends keeping bankers busy as we head into a not-so-sleepy August:

Bigger is better

JPMorgan said total deal volume soared 27% to $2.2 trillion in the first half of 2025, including a 57% increase in deals over $10 billion.

Deals over $1 billion rose 72% — a 20-year high, the bank said.

Sector by sector

The bank said 7 out of 9 sectors saw double-digit volume growth, including:

Financial institutions (+56%)

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

Media & communications (+51%)

Diversified Industries (+41%)

M&A volumes seemed to favor technology (23%) and diversified industries (22%), the bank said.

Pie chart JPMorgan

Private equity dealmaking

Private equity firms, known in M&A parlance as financial sponsors, have ramped up dealmaking, leading to $168 billion in take-private deals in the first half of 2025, the highest levels since 2022, the bank said.

Four mega-deals accounted for more than 50% of that volume—indicating a highly concentrated but aggressive deployment of capital.

Minority stakes
