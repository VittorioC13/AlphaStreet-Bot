The transaction is subject to FIFCO shareholder and regulatory approvals. The deal has been approved unanimously by the board of directors of FIFCO, which includes representatives of FIFCO’s key shareholders. Completion is expected in H1 2026.

Amsterdam, 22 September 2025 – HEINEKEN N.V. (‘HEINEKEN’) today announced it has signed a binding agreement to acquire the multi-category beverage portfolio and proximity retail business of the Florida Ice and Farm Company S.A. (‘FIFCO’). This transaction builds on a long-standing partnership that began in 1986 and was strengthened in 2002 with the acquisition of a 25% stake in FIFCO's beverages business in Costa Rica, Distribuidora La Florida.

The deal further advances HEINEKEN’s EverGreen strategy, driving premiumisation, innovation, and growth across high-potential markets. Costa Rica will become one of HEINEKEN's top 5 operating companies by operating profit, expanding its presence with a diverse portfolio of beverage brands - including the iconic Imperial beer - and a well-established retail network.

The transaction also includes Panama, where HEINEKEN will acquire the remaining 25% of HEINEKEN Panama, securing full ownership of the country’s fastest-growing brewer. In addition, it further strengthens HEINEKEN’s regional presence through an equal partnership in Nicaragua’s market-leading beer and beyond beer company, as well as ownership of diversified food and beverage operations in Guatemala.

Upon completion, HEINEKEN will acquire the following FIFCO interests:

75% stake in Distribuidora La Florida, covering its beverages, food, and retail division - which includes more than 300 proximity retail outlets in Costa Rica (Musmanni & Musi) - and overall operations, extending into El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras; FIFCO is exploring strategic alternatives for FIFCO USA.

75% stake in Nicaragua Brewing Holding, which holds a 49.85% indirect stake in Compañía Cervecera de Nicaragua, Nicaragua’s leading beverage company.

25% minority interest in HEINEKEN Panama.

100% stake in FIFCO’s beyond beer business in Mexico.

Following completion, HEINEKEN and/or its affiliates will hold 100% ownership of Distribuidora La Florida, HEINEKEN Panama and FIFCO Mexico, and 49.85% of Compañía Cervecera de Nicaragua. (See illustrative shareholding structure attached).

HEINEKEN Chairman of the Executive Board and Chief Executive Officer, Dolf van den Brink:

“Today marks a transformative milestone for HEINEKEN as we join forces with FIFCO to unlock new growth opportunities. By integrating FIFCO’s iconic brands, deep market expertise, and exemplary sustainability credentials, we are accelerating our EverGreen strategy and entering new profit pools across Central America. This partnership is grounded in decades of shared values and trust, providing a robust foundation for long-term value creation. I am excited to welcome FIFCO's talented team, and am confident that our shared strengths - HEINEKEN’s global best practices and FIFCO’s unmatched local knowhow - will drive excellence and deliver exceptional growth for our employees, customers, and stakeholders throughout the region.”

FIFCO Chairman of the Board, Wilhelm Steinvorth:

“This agreement honours FIFCO’s legacy and brings complementary strengths that expand the organisation’s capabilities, operational reach, and future potential. FIFCO and HEINEKEN have shared a successful long-term partnership, built on strategic alignment, shared values, and a deep commitment to sustainability. Today, we are proud to take this step forward with an admired company that respects our cultural identity and offers a global platform for our iconic brands - like Imperial - to thrive and evolve.”

Strategic rationale

The transaction builds on HEINEKEN's current exposure to attractive Central American growth markets which enjoy large and growing profit pools. Distribuidora La Florida and Compañía Cervecera de Nicaragua are both strategically positioned as market-leading multi-category beverage businesses with strong margins, rivalling global best-in-class benchmarks.

Costa Rica benefits from stable macro fundamentals, including a strong currency, growing population, and approximately 3% real GDP per capita growth.

The beverage categories (beer, beyond beer, soft drinks) are among the largest and fastest-growing consumer categories in Central America, with the acquired portfolio expected to deliver solid volume growth.

Consolidating the multi-category beverage leader in Costa Rica: Well-established market leadership in beer (approximately 2.0 million hl), supported by iconic local and international brands, and an unparalleled route-to-consumer model. Leading pan-regional beyond beer portfolio (approximately 0.5 million hl) across multiple brands with leading brand power. Second largest soft drinks player (approximately 2.5 million hl), producing its own brands, such as Tropical, and being the bottling licensee for PepsiCo. The transaction will strengthen HEINEKEN's existing relationship with PepsiCo. Well-positioned adjacent businesses including wines and spirits distribution, staple foods, and a retail business with more than 300 proximity outlets.

HEINEKEN gains full ownership of HEINEKEN Panama, one of the leading brewers growing approximately 20% CAGR (2019–2024) with year-over-year market share gains.

Expansion of HEINEKEN’s footprint in Central America: Compañía Cervecera de Nicaragua holds a leading beer and beyond beer portfolio with a fully integrated water and soft drinks operations, and a retail business with more than 250 proximity outlets. A food and soft drinks platform in Guatemala, and a portfolio of fast-growing beyond beer brands in Mexico.

Under HEINEKEN’s ownership, the Costa Rica business is expected to unlock revenue and cost synergies through the application of HEINEKEN's best practices across commercial execution, logistics and brewery operations.

Financial impact for HEINEKEN

Total cash consideration paid for the equity stakes acquired by HEINEKEN will be approximately US$3.2 billion implying an acquisition multiple of 11.6x EV/EBITDA based on 2024 results.

Distribuidora La Florida, which was previously accounted for as investment in associate with results reported under share of net profit/loss from associates, will be consolidated. 2024 results reported under local accounting policies amount to: Net Revenue of US$1,132m, EBITDA of US$334m and Operating Profit of US$278m (excluding FIFCO USA).

The 49.85% ownership stake in Compañía Cervecera de Nicaragua will be accounted for as investment in associates and joint ventures and the results will be treated as share of profit/loss of associates and joint ventures.

The acquisition of the 25% minority interest in HEINEKEN Panama will reduce HEINEKEN's non-controlling interest in HEINEKEN Panama to zero.

Run-rate cost savings of approximately US$50 million are anticipated through the application of HEINEKEN’s proven best practices.

The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to operating margin and EPS (beia).

Post-transaction, HEINEKEN’s Net Debt is expected to increase by €3.2 billion and HEINEKEN's pro-forma Net Debt / EBITDA (beia) ratio is expected to increase modestly. HEINEKEN remains committed to return to its long-term target of below 2.5x.

HEINEKEN will continue to make progress on the previously announced share buy-back programme of €1.5 billion which is not affected by the proposed transaction.

Driving sustainable economic development across Central America

In line with its EverGreen strategy, HEINEKEN is deeply committed to driving long-term, sustainable growth across its operations. Through its Brew a Better World programme, it has set ambitious goals to deliver positive environmental and social impact. Recognising the strong complementarities with FIFCO’s programme and its embedded ESG strategy (FIFCO Sostenibilidad Expansiva), HEINEKEN will continue to invest in sustainable economic development and promoting responsible consumption throughout the region.

Next steps

Completion of the transaction between HEINEKEN and FIFCO is subject to customary regulatory approvals and the approval by the general shareholders’ meeting of FIFCO, which will take place in October 2025. The transaction is expected to be completed in H1 2026.

The deal has been approved unanimously by the board of directors of FIFCO, which includes representatives of FIFCO's key shareholders.

Further announcements will be made as and when appropriate. HEINEKEN and FIFCO will work closely together towards the completion of the transaction, ensuring a smooth integration, with a joint focus on continuity for employees, customers, and partners.

[TITLE]Europe residency gets harder to buy as Trump sells gold card:
[TEXT]
While President Donald Trump is creating new options for the world’s wealthy to move to the US, Europe has been heading in the opposite direction.

The continent is pulling back on its so-called golden visa programs after they failed to deliver the hoped-for benefits and in some cases backfired. That’s especially true for Portugal, where one of Europe’s most popular programs led to foreigners bidding up homes at the expense of locals.

In most but not all cases, the threshold for residency in Europe was much lower than the $1 million price tag on the Trump Gold Card — part of a broader upheaval of US immigration policy, which includes charging companies a $100,000 to hire college-educated workers from abroad.

Here’s an overview of Europe’s golden visa programs:

Portugal

The country ended the real estate path to a residency permit in 2023 in a bid to ease property prices. But an alternative route still exists.

Aimed at bolstering Portugal’s capital base, applicants must put at least €500,000 ($590,000) into an approved investment or venture capital fund. To qualify, the entities need to have more than 60% of resources in domestic assets, including bonds, stocks or local projects like farming and solar panels.

If opting to donate to a non-profit group, the amount goes down to €250,000, or as low as €200,000 if the organization benefits an area with a low-population density. The program has been popular with US, Brazilian and Chinese nationals.

Wealthy foreigners only have to spend one week a year in Portugal for the first year, and 14 days every subsequent two-year period to qualify for a fast-track to residency.

It’s had some strange effects like increasing the value of avocado farms and contributing to stock market gains. A classic-car museum in a small village has also raised money to improve its collection.

UK

A special visa for foreigners who invest significant sums in Britain has been discussed as part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s plans to blunt the economic blow from recent tax hikes and wider curbs on work permits.

An investor visa is possible for people willing to fund sectors seen as strategically important, such as artificial intelligence, clean energy and life sciences, Bloomberg previously reported.

While the British government is wary

[TITLE]GENFIT Reports First-Half 2025 Financial Results and:
[TEXT]
Cash and cash equivalents totaled €107.5 million as of June 30, 2025, excluding the €26.5 million milestone invoiced in May 2025 (received in July 2025) upon pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European countries

€33.5 million in revenues, including the €26.5 million milestone invoiced in May 2025

Strong 1H25 sales trajectory reported by Ipsen for Iqirvo® in PBC in July, followed by U.S. market exit of key competitor in September

Following discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF announced last week, cash runway projected to extend beyond 2028 1 , offering optionality for business development initiatives

GNS561 in CCA: Phase 1b data expected by end of 2025

G1090N in ACLF: safety data (healthy volunteers) and markers of efficacy expected by end 2025

Lille (France), Cambridge (Massachusetts, United States), (Zurich, Switzerland); September 22, 2025 – GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases, today announced its first half 2025 financial results and provided a corporate update.

Pascal Prigent, CEO of GENFIT, commented: “Although our recent discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF was disappointing news, it was the right decision for patients. Since we embarked in ACLF, we have engaged with many healthcare professionals, regulators, and patient associations, and we’re more convinced than ever by the importance of developing novel therapeutic options in this underserved indication. Of course, risk is inherent to drug development, but we mitigate it with six programs underway, and two data sets expected by the end of the year. Following the discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF, we anticipate a substantial reduction in our operating expenses. This will extend projected cash runway beyond 2028 and offer optionality as we continue to explore new mechanistic approaches to tackle the multiple dimensions of ACLF care.”

I. 1H25 Business highlights and main events after the reporting period2

Acute on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF): Discontinuation of VS-01 program, refocused on UCD

On September 19, 2025, GENFIT announced its decision to discontinue its VS-01 program in ACLF, and reprioritize its development on Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD):

GENFIT’s decision followed the occurrence of a peritonitis case reported as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in the UNVEIL-IT® clinical trial evaluating VS-01 in patients with ACLF grade 1, 2 or 3a and ascites and subsequent review and feedback from the independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC). The committee concluded that the trial could continue but required additional data and monitoring. Despite the possibility to move ahead with the study, GENFIT decided – after considering the target population’s clinical profile as well as the implications of this type of safety signal for the benefit/risk ratio of VS-01 in this indication – to discontinue both UNVEIL-IT® and the proof-of-concept study evaluating VS-01 in patients with Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) grades 2 to 4 in the presence of Acute Decompensation (AD) or ACLF grade 1 and ascites.

GENFIT will continue the preclinical evaluation of VS-01 in UCD, a genetically driven disorder characterized by acute hyperammonemic crisis (HAC). The condition, patients and drug administration set-up will be very different from what they were in ACLF. There is a significant unmet medical need in this indication, and based on ammonia clearance data, we believe VS-01 has the potential to be a useful therapeutic option for children affected by this disease.

GENFIT remains fully committed to ACLF and associated conditions such as Acute Decompensation (AD) or Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE). ACLF is characterized by a critical unmet medical need, with no approved treatment options for patients facing poor prognosis and life-threatening risks. Since we embarked in this therapeutic area, we have engaged in multiple KOL interactions and observed growing interest in this indication, together with clear support for our clinical strategy. This feedback reinforces our confidence in our plan and validates our positioning. In this context, we ambition to accelerate the development of the four other assets currently under development in ACLF, which are all based on different mechanisms of action and use different routes of administration. We hope to deliver positive results, as we move forward, starting with safety data and early markers of efficacy on healthy volunteers with G1090N, expected at the end of this year. Other programs in the ACLF pipeline are SRT-015, CLM-022 and VS-02-HE.

Earlier in May 2025, GENFIT participated at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) International Congress 2025 with several posters presenting its latest progress in ACLF. The congress highlighted the growing importance of ACLF within the hepatology community.

PBC: new milestone payment, encouraging sales performance of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by our partner Ipsen and withdrawal of key competitor in the US market

In May 2025, Ipsen’s Iqirvo® (elafibranor) was granted pricing and reimbursement in Italy for Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). This major step unlocked a new €26.5 million milestone payment under our Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen, due upon pricing and reimbursement of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European markets.3

In July 2025, Ipsen reported “accelerated sales growth of €59m in the first half of 2025 in the U.S. and in Europe (mainly Germany & the U.K.) driven by increasing uptake from new patients, switch and market expansion sales for Iqirvo® 4”.

In September 2025, Intercept Pharmaceuticals, a wholly owned biopharmaceutical subsidiary of Alfasigma S.p.A., announced its decision to withdraw OCALIVA® (obeticholic acid) from the US market for the treatment of PBC.5 This decision followed a request from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We expect this to create a market dynamic that should support the sales trajectory of Iqirvo® by our partner Ipsen.

PSC: positive late-breaking Phase 2 data for elafibranor presented by Ipsen at EASL Congress 2025

In May 2025, Ipsen presented data from its late-breaking abstract on elafibranor, highlighting favorable safety profile and significant efficacy in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). Should elafibranor be approved in a second indication after PBC, GENFIT would also be eligible for milestone payments and royalties under the Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen.

CCA: acquisition of full intellectual property rights for GNS561 from Genoscience Pharma

In early 2025, GENFIT completed the acquisition of the full intellectual property rights for GNS561 from Genoscience Pharma, expanding upon the limited rights initially obtained through a license at the end of 2021. GENFIT acquired all patents and patent applications, know-how, and data held by Genoscience Pharma necessary for the development, manufacturing, and marketing of GNS561 worldwide.*

Financing: Closing of royalty financing agreement with HCRx significantly extends cash runway

The Royalty Financing6 agreement signed in March 2025 has significantly extended GENFIT’s cash runway, beyond the end of 2028, enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds, ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing, and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not converted or repurchased and cancelled 7 and iv) the discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF as outlined above.

Corporate governance updates

Following the retirement of Chief Medical Officer Carol Addy on June 30, 2025, a new CMO has been appointed and will officially assume the role at the end of the year.

Chief Scientific Officer Dean Hum will retire, effective as of September 30, 2025. He will be replaced by Sakina Sayah-Jeanne, currently EVP Research & Translational Science and member of the Executive Committee since she joined GENFIT in 2023. Pascal Prigent, CEO of GENFIT, commented: “I’m delighted to officially welcome Sakina as our new Chief Scientific Officer. Having already demonstrated outstanding leadership since she joined GENFIT, she is uniquely positioned to guide our scientific strategy and execute on the plan. And on behalf of everyone at GENFIT, I want to thank Dean for his considerable contribution since GENFIT’s inception in 1999. Dean has been instrumental over the years in moving our programs forward, including elafibranor in PBC. As Dean transitions into retirement, we are grateful that he will remain active as advisor, continuing to share his expertise.”

At the June 2025 Annual Meeting, Mr. Tristan Imbert was appointed by our shareholders as director for a three-year term and joined the Audit Committee and ESG Committee.

Extra-financial performance

In May 2025, GENFIT published its annual Extra-Financial Performance Report (fiscal year 2024), highlighting its latest initiatives and providing insights on the evolution of key performance indicators. In terms of recognition, ISS ESG increased our rating from C+ to B- maintaining our “Prime status”.

II. 2H25 and beyond: key milestones and outlook

ACLF pipeline

G1090N – Safety data and early markers of efficacy are expected by the end of 2025, and will serve to optimize the design of the proof-of-concept study targeted to start in the first half of 2026, with the objective to generate efficacy data by the end of 2026.

SRT-015 – Current work on an improved formulation aims at increasing exposure. Pending positive development, the launch of a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.

CLM-022 – Current experiments aim at confirming therapeutic efficacy using different disease models relevant for AD and ACLF as well as starting formulation development and first toxicological studies in 2025. Pending further positive developments, a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the first half of 2027.

VS-02-HE – We intend to develop VS-02-HE as a unique oral formulation designed to act in the gut where ammonia is primarily produced, minimizing systemic absorption of ammonia while reducing glutamine levels in the brain. Completion of Investigational New Drug-enabling nonclinical studies and formulation development are expected by the end of 2025. Pending further confirmation, a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the second half of 2027.

Other life-threatening diseases

GNS561 in CCA – Data readout from the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial are expected by the end of 2025.

VS-01-HAC (pediatric indication) – Following feedback from the FDA (U.S.) and PDCO8 (Europe), the pivotal juvenile toxicology study in Göttingen Minipigs started and data are expected before the end of 2025. Following discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF, additional preclinical work will be conducted before moving into the clinic. Depending on the outcome of preclinical work, a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.

III. 1H25 Financial highlights

Cash and cash equivalents

As of June 30, 2025, GENFIT had €107.5 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with €81.8 million as of December 31, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025 exclude the milestone payment of €26.5 million invoiced in May 2025 (received in July 2025), following the approval of pricing and reimbursement for Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by three major European countries.

We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements beyond the end of 2028, enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds, ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing, and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not converted or repurchased and cancelled9 and iv) the discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF as outlined above.

In the first half of 2025, cash utilization mainly stems from our research and development efforts, notably UNVEIL-IT®, our Phase 2 clinical trial of VS-01 in ACLF (and related proof-of-concept study); GNS561, as part of its Cholangiocarcinoma program; NTZ, as part of its ACLF program; SRT-015, as part of its ACLF program; and CLM-22, as part of its ACLF program.

Revenues and other income

Revenues and other income amounted to €35.7 million in the first half of 2025, compared to €61.2 million in the first half of 2024.

Substantially all revenue is attributable to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Ipsen in 2025, including i) royalty revenue from worldwide sales (excluding Greater China) of Ipsen's Iqirvo® (elafibranor) totaling €6.9 million and ii) milestone revenue from pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by three major European countries totaling €26.5 million.

Operating expenses

Operating expenses amounted to €35.6 million in the first half of 2025, compared to €30.0 million in the first half of 2024).

Substantially all of the increase in operating expenses is due to research and development expenses, which amounted to €25.1 million in the first half of 2025 (compared to €19.0 million in the first half of 2024). Specifically, there was increased spending related to contracting costs, which amounted to €13.4 million in the first half of 2025 (compared to €7.8 million in the first half of 2024), primarily reflecting increased activities related to VS-01 in ACLF .

Financial results

For the half-year ended June 30, 2025, financial income amounted to a loss of €10.2 million, compared to a loss of €0.9 million for the same period in 2024. The increase relates to debt issuance costs and financial charges from the Royalty Financing agreement.

Net loss

The first half of 2025 resulted in a net loss of €10.0 million, compared with a net profit of €30.3 million in the first half of 2024.
