Vodafone Ireland and Atlantic Technological University (ATU) have won €4.6 million from the European Union to develop digital training for engineering and construction apprentices in the west of Ireland.

They are developing a system based at ATU’s Co Donegal campus with Italian tech company FifthIngenium that will combine classroom teaching with remote and virtual training for students.

They have secured €4.6 million for the project from the EU Connecting Europe Facility’s digital fund which, along with their own investment, will bring the total spend on the plan to €6.25 million, said a statement on Monday.

ATU, Vodafone and FifthIngenium will develop virtual construction labs allowing students to practice building using digital models, systems that simulate real building environments and 3D video streaming to teach technical skills.

The initiative will make education “more accessible, especially for people living in rural areas or those balancing work, study and apprenticeship programmes”, they said.

Vodafone and ATU noted that the Government recently pledged to promote careers in construction by expanding apprenticeships, boosting recruitment and improving training opportunities.

James Lawless, Minister for Further and Higher Education, will launch the programme on Monday.

The Republic needs “skilled talent in construction and engineering”, he said in advance of the launch.

“By enabling access to high-quality training nationwide, we are ensuring that Ireland is equipped to deliver the projects that will shape our future,” said Mr Lawless.

Sheila Kavanagh, network director at Vodafone Ireland, said access to training depends on strong digital infrastructure.

“This initiative will give us the ability to train people faster and smarter,” she added.

Prof Graham Heaslip of ATU predicted the project has the potential to revolutionise training.

He added that it demonstrates the university’s ability to attract international industry partners.

Roberto Mangano, chief operations officer at FifthIngenium, said the project is an important step in modernising apprenticeships and giving engineers and construction professionals the digital skills they need.

The partners secured the EU cash with the aid of Vodafone’s Connected Education Programme.

ATU has campuses in Donegal, Galway and Sligo. Its Co Donegal base will pilot the digital apprenticeship project.

[TITLE]Why Does the End of the World Look So Profitable?:
[TEXT]
The stock market is hitting record highs. GDP growth is in the green. Tech valuations are defying gravity... fueled by a promise that artificial intelligence is going to generate trillions of dollars in wealth.

And yet... everything feels kinda…terrible?

Jobs are disappearing, not in a crash, but in a slow fade. Prices for essentials remain stubbornly high. The divide between the digital economy and physical reality has never been wider.

We are told this is just a transition period. We are told that "efficiency" is messy... but necessary.

But the unease you feel isn’t irrational. The green arrows on the stock charts aren't measuring the health of the everyday economy anymore. They are measuring the success of a takeover.

We are watching a fundamental shift in how the state operates. Sovereignty is shifting from public institutions to a network of private entities. And in many ways, we are holding the door open for them.

[TITLE]Tesla, Netflix, and ON Semiconductor: 3 Unusually Active Cash-Secured Put Options to Sell Now:
[TEXT]
By the time my commentary goes out Friday morning, several economic data points will have been released, including the University of Michigan’s U.S. Consumer Sentiment Index for December, and the Core PCE (personal consumption expenditure) price index for September.

Economists expect both to move very little in either direction, a good news, bad news report if you’re an investor. While it’s nice to see consumer sentiment improve, albeit slightly, inflation remains an issue despite tariffs causing less of a problem than initially predicted.

Investors most likely are looking ahead to next week and a possible rate cut. The Dec. 10 Federal Reserve meeting puts the possibility of a rate cut at over 80%. That’s good news for stocks. We’ll see soon enough.

In yesterday’s options trading, there were approximately 1,341 calls and puts that were unusually active, with DTEs (days to expiration) of seven days or more.

With share prices relatively inflated -- the Shiller P/E ratio is above 40, the highest level since 1999 -- my focus today is on potential cash-secured puts to sell to generate income while getting better entry points for stocks worth owning for the long haul.

Here are three possibilities from yesterday’s unusually active put options.

Have an excellent weekend.

[TITLE]Nexperia spat shows automotive supply chains vulnerable to geopolitics:
[TEXT]
Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

The semiconductor shortage created over the ownership of the chip manufacturer Nexperia in the Netherlands is not just a governance dispute, it’s a warning shot across the bow for the automotive industry.

That’s the view of Moody’s Supply Chain Director Sapna Amlani, who believes automakers have to build more varied and robust supply chains to avoid similar disruptions.

The crisis at Nexperia began when the Dutch government seized temporary control of the China-owned company citing security concerns. China responded by stopping exports of semiconductors to the company until a settlement was reached in November.

However, the risk to supply chains for automakers remains an active threat to vehicle production, said Amlani in an email to WardsAuto.

“For procurement leaders, this is more than a temporary disruption,” she said. “It signals a structural risk: geopolitical decisions can instantly reshape sourcing economics. Even with China easing restrictions, governance breaches and quality concerns persist. Future risks could come from tighter EU controls or retaliatory measures from Beijing.”

Here’s what else Amlani shared

[TITLE]Why Analysts Say ASML Is the Top Semiconductor Pick Heading Into 2026:
[TEXT]
ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the AI Stocks in Focus This Week. On December 1, Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock with a €1,000.00 price target. The firm is optimistic on the stock driven by positive momentum for lithography demand.

Analysts have labeled ASML as its Top Pick in European semiconductors as demand strengthens across memory and logic, and new EUV tool cycles and DRAM transitions signal healthier margins heading into 2026.

DRAM cycle and foundry spending are anticipated to support ASML’s order book and sales through fiscal years 2026 and 2027. A recent Asia trip by the firm has further reinforced its belief regarding a memory supercycle and likely near-term upside for ASML’s orders.

Analysts have also highlighted "unprecedented memory demand" with limited DDR5 inventory visibility and DDR4 tightness. ASML is well-positioned to benefit from continued DRAM demand, including commodity DRAM, strong memory pricing, and DRAM technology transitions to HBM4.

It has also been confirmed that TSMC will add 3nm capacity in Taiwan instead of Japan. This implies increased foundry spending and is likely to translate into more 3600d shipments in fiscal year 2026 and provide near-term EUV sales upside for ASML.

ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) develops and sells advanced semiconductor equipment, including lithography, metrology, and inspection systems for chip manufacturing.

While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]SEALSQ Makes Strategic Investment in EeroQ to Accelerate Its “Quantum Made in USA” Strategy:
[TEXT]
Geneva, Switzerland, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES) ("SEALSQ" or "Company"), a company that focuses on developing and selling Semiconductors, PKI, and Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products, today announced a strategic investment in EeroQ, a U.S.-based quantum chip design company pioneering a breakthrough approach to building a quantum computer using electrons on helium (eHe). This investment aligns with SEALSQ’s Quantum Made in USA strategy and reinforces its commitment to strengthening the United States and Europe’s leadership in quantum-resistant technologies and future quantum computing platforms.

Earlier this year, SEALSQ launched the SEALQUANTUM.com investment, which aims on investing up to $35 million in startups engaged in quantum computing. Two investments have been finalized, including a partnership with ColibriTD for quantum-as-a-service solutions and the acquisition of the French ASIC design firm IC’ALPS. This new investment in EeroQ is the first that the Company is making in the USA as part of its “Quantum Made in USA” strategy.

EeroQ: Breakthrough Quantum Chip Technology Aligned with SEALSQ’s Roadmap

Founded in 2017, EeroQ aims to build a large-scale quantum computer based on single electrons trapped on superfluid helium, a technology originally proposed in the late 1990s and now made feasible thanks to major advances in materials science, microfabrication, and cryogenic engineering.

EeroQ’s design offers several key advantages that align with SEALSQ’s long-term strategic priorities:

Ultra-compact form factor: Unlike other QC architectures requiring datacenter-scale cryogenic infrastructure, EeroQ’s qubits — based on the smallest particle in nature — enable the design of quantum processors as small as a thumbnail.

[TITLE]RWA: AT&T/UScellular license deal part of the “death of mobile wireless competition”:
[TEXT]
The Rural Wireless Association (RWA) today criticized the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Wireless Telecommunications Bureau’s approval earlier this week of AT&T’s acquisition of spectrum licenses from Array Digital Infrastructure (known as UScellular at the time of the deal).

The $101.8 billion deal, which was announced in early November 2024, is part of Array Digital Infrastructure’s effort to divest itself of licenses that were not included in the company’s acquisition by T-Mobile. The licenses are in the lower 700 MHz and 3.45 GHz ranges. T-Mobile had agreed to purchase UScellular’s operations and some of its licenses early in May 2024.

The FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau portrayed the deal as posing little risk and agreed that a significant upside potential exists.

“Based on our review of the record and our competitive analysis, we conclude that the risk of public interest harm is low. We find it unlikely that the proposed acquisition of 700 MHz and 3.45 GHz spectrum would allow AT&T to foreclose entry, raise rivals’ costs, or otherwise harm the public interest,” the decision reads.

“In addition, we substantially credit the Applicants’ claims that the instant transaction will produce public interest benefits including the provision of additional products and services to AT&T’s customers, faster customer speeds, and a better overall customer experience.”

The RWA released a statement criticizing the FCC decision

[TITLE]Americans are losing jobs at an alarming rate: Tech, telecom, retail hit hardest:
[TEXT]
Layoffs in America

Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

Telecom and technology: Automation and restructuring lead the wave

Retail, food, and services: Shifts in demand and economic pressures

Non-profits and media: The impact of funding cuts and economic uncertainty

Drivers of job cuts: Restructuring, AI, and policy decisions

Hiring slows as companies brace for a leaner future

A labour market in transition

As 2025 nears its close, the US labour market is revealing a stark reality: The year has been defined by unprecedented layoffs and a cautious approach to hiring. According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, employers announced 71,321 job cuts in November, a 24% increase over the same month last year and the highest November tally since 2022. While this figure is significantly lower than October’s 153,074 cuts, it signals a labour market in recalibration, with both economic conditions and technological disruptions reshaping employment landscapes.Year-to-date, 1,170,821 layoffs have been recorded, marking a 54% rise over 2024 and the highest since 2020, when the pandemic triggered over two million cuts, according to the report. Historically, November has rarely seen layoffs surpass 70,000, with spikes only during major economic crises such as the 2001 recession, the 2009 financial crisis, and the 2020 pandemic. This pattern underscores the gravity of current trends. The data has been presented by Challenger, Gray & Christmas report.The most affected sectors highlight the structural shifts transforming the economy. Telecommunication providers, led by Verizon, announced 15,139 layoffs in November, bringing the sector’s total to 38,035 for the year, a staggering 268% increase over 2024. These cuts reflect a broader recalibration as telecom companies optimize networks for AI integration, 5G expansion, and rising operational costs.The technology sector continues to dominate private-sector layoffs, with 12,377 announced in November and a yearly total of 153,536, up 17% from last year. Firms cite restructuring, AI-driven efficiency gains, and cost management as primary reasons. The irony is pronounced: The very sector driving innovation is simultaneously reducing its workforce at scale, highlighting the disruptive potential of automation.Beyond tech and telecom, traditional sectors are also experiencing pronounced turbulence. Retailers cut 3,290 jobs in November, taking the annual total to 91,954, a 139% jump from 2024. The combination of softening consumer demand, tariff uncertainties, and evolving shopping habits has forced companies to recalibrate workforce levels.Similarly, the food processing sector, particularly meat and beef handlers, recorded 6,708 layoffs in November, totaling 34,165 for the year, a 26% increase from 2024. Rising supply costs and global market fluctuations have left companies with little choice but to streamline operations.The services sector, encompassing cleaning, staffing, and outsourcing firms, also faced pressure, announcing 5,509 layoffs in November and 69,089 for the year. These numbers illustrate that even the support backbone of the economy is vulnerable when corporate demand slows.The non-profit sector has borne the brunt of shrinking government support, rising operational costs, and declining donations. Through November, these organizations announced 28,696 layoffs, up 409% from last year, reflecting the sector’s growing vulnerability to policy shifts and fiscal constraints.Media companies recorded 17,163 cuts in 2025, an 18% increase from last year, though newsrooms specifically reported 2,254 layoffs, down 50% from 2024. This highlights the sector’s uneven recovery, as digital transformation and advertising revenue pressures reshape content creation and distribution.A closer look at the reasons behind layoffs reveals a complex interplay of corporate strategy and macroeconomic pressures. Restructuring led November’s layoffs, accounting for 20,217 cuts, bringing the year-to-date total to 128,255. Companies continue to realign their operations to manage costs and boost efficiency.Artificial Intelligence is now an explicit driver, responsible for 6,280 layoffs in November and 54,694 for the year. Since 2023, AI has triggered 71,683 announced cuts, highlighting its transformative effect on the workforce.Economic conditions, including softening demand, tariffs, and market uncertainty, contributed to 15,755 layoffs in November, totaling 245,086 for the year. Meanwhile, government-led initiatives, tracked under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), remain the leading cause of 2025 layoffs, with 293,753 planned reductions, including 20,976 downstream cuts impacting contractors and non-profits.Amid the surge in layoffs, hiring intentions are declining sharply. Employers announced 497,151 planned hires through November, down 35% from last year and the lowest year-to-date figure since 2010. Seasonal hiring is at its lowest level since 2012, with no new plans reported in November, highlighting a cautious approach as companies prioritize efficiency over expansion.The data paints a portrait of an economy at a structural crossroads. High-profile sectors like technology and telecom are reshaping their workforce around AI and automation. Traditional sectors such as retail, food, and services are recalibrating in response to changing demand and costs. Meanwhile, nonprofits and government-dependent entities face cascading cuts due to funding constraints.The real narrative extends beyond raw numbers: The US is moving toward a labour market where efficiency, automation, and strategic realignment increasingly outweigh workforce expansion. For workers, this presents both a challenge and an urgent call to adapt to a rapidly evolving employment landscape.The question facing the nation is clear: As layoffs and hiring freezes persist, how will the American workforce navigate the twin pressures of technological disruption and economic recalibration in 2026?

[TITLE]Creative Churn: Indian advertising agencies dread layoffs as AI upends industry globally:
[TEXT]
Artificial intelligence (AI) is causing an upheaval in the global advertising industry, and the ripples of layoffs and cost cuts are being felt in India as well.

AI tools now enable clients to develop content, and they are outsourcing less and less work to advertising agencies. The industry is in turmoil, forcing two of the Big 5 advertising holding companies–Omnicom and Interpublic Group–to merge globally. That has triggered a wave of job cuts, and local agencies are also bracing for a shakeup.

“The Indian advertising market is going through a seismic shift. The creative work is now getting done by clients’ in-house teams. AI tools are used for creating advertisements across platforms as campaigns become hyper-personalised," said Rajesh Sethi, partner and leader Media, Entertainment and Sports, PwC India. “By leveraging AI, organisations are becoming more productive and efficient. However, this transformation may influence entry-level roles in the industry and gradually reshape the traditional business models of advertising agencies."

Digital advertising was already on the rise. Clients are now betting on it even more, given a large youth population, expanding broadband access, and deeper consumption of online content. A PwC report estimates Indian internet advertising to expand from ₹6.25 billion in 2024 to ₹13.06 billion in 2029.

Late last month, NYSE-listed Omnicom and Interpublic Group announced a $13 billion merger. With global revenues exceeding $25 billion, the combined post-merger Omnicom will become the world’s largest advertising network.

In India, London-based WPP remains the largest, comprising media agencies such as Ogilvy, Burson and GroupM, which was rebranded as WPP in May.

Still, the merger between Omnicom and Interpublic Group (IPG) has already killed several well-known agencies, including FCB, DDB, and MullenLowe. There will be 4,000 layoffs worldwide, Omnicom’s top management told the Financial Times last week. Executives Mint spoke to said the India offices will also be impacted.

Senior executives on radar

"The newer age, more adaptable agency networks like Publicis and Omnicom are better and more centrally run," one senior executive close to the Omnicom-IPG merger said, requesting anonymity. "IPG is more of a holding company of the past, where there is just one financial entity with many more entities in it, which do not need to be connected with each other. The new age model of networks functions more like Omnicom and Publicis does, where advertisers buy into these main brands and not into the brand name of one of the many agencies they own."

The senior executive pointed out that these agencies and business units have separate finance, admin, and other teams. “All of this adds up to cost to the client, all costs that the client does not really need to eat."

Much of those cost efficiencies will now come from layoffs and the removal of overlapping functions. While India is not a significant cost centre for these global networks, which lean heavily on the US and European markets, much of the cost efficiency here is likely to come from cutting duplicate C-suite roles, the executive said. As much as 40% of such senior executive roles could go in the next few months, although major layoffs have not started yet, the executive added.

IPG operates agency networks FCB, McCann, MullenLowe and IPG Mediabrands, while Omnicom runs two verticals—the Omnicom Media Group for media buying, planning and investment agencies; and the Omnicom Advertising Group for the group’s creative agencies.

A creative agency offers services such as creating ad films and building brand marketing campaigns, while a media buying agency buys and plans media inventory and where these ads can be placed.

Omnicom Advertising Group, Omnicom Media Group, and WPP India declined to respond to Mint’s queries.

‘Dread throughout’

The second-order effects of the global merger are being felt in other agency networks.

“We had a townhall in November assuring us that there will not be any layoffs, but there is dread throughout the agency," the vice president of one of the largest creative agencies in India said, requesting anonymity. “We are getting to know of colleagues who are put on a performance improvement plan (PIP), and they are worried the next stage is retrenchment."

An employee with low appraisal ratings is put on a PIP, and the process is ideally meant to help the employee improve performance, but it could also be a step toward getting laid off.

“Much of the agency cutting has happened in the creative services and not in media buying and planning," Naresh Gupta, founder of independent agency Bang In The Middle, said. “The networks today are not interested in buying a pure creative service agency. You need to build a media practice, or you will get acquired if you run something like an influencer agency."

Doubt and unrest

Multinational advertising firm Publicis Groupe said it is upskilling teams and building hybrid roles.

“The industry is undergoing a period of global transformation led by AI, shifting client priorities and consolidation, and for us this has meant being intentional with talent—prioritising future-facing roles across data, tech, AI, commerce, media and integrated strategy," said Publicis Groupe India spokesperson in an emailed response to queries. The firm noted that its AI-led capabilities will “augment" and not “replace" talent.

A 40-year-old senior executive from Mumbai got retrenched last month from an advertising tech firm, and AI-driven creatives were one of the primary reasons. “For the past one year, the clients came up with their own creatives through AI prompts and the team just could not keep up," said the executive, who was given two months of severance pay. “Some of the firms are recruiting freelancers for client servicing, which until now was the work of the core teams in the agencies."

A senior HR executive at one of the leading agency holding companies said things are not so “bad with us yet, but increments are impacted".

“Everyone is waiting and watching how things will turn out with this big merger—leadership changes, how businesses and P&Ls will be impacted for everyone in the business in terms of market share," the executive said. “The same goes for talent–everyone is anticipating heavy layoffs in the merger. In general, there is unrest."

[TITLE]What bubble? Asset managers in risk-on mode stick with stocks:
[TEXT]
There’s a time when investments run their course and the prudent move is to cash out. For global asset managers who’ve ridden double-digit gains in equities for three straight years, that time is not now.

“Our expectation of solid growth and easier monetary and fiscal policies supports a risk-on tilt in our multi-asset portfolios. We remain overweight stocks and credit,” said Sylvia Sheng, global multi-asset strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.

“We are playing the powerful trends in place and are bullish through the end of next year,” said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer at DWS. “For now we are not contrarians.”

“Start the year with sufficient exposure, even over-exposure to equities, predominantly in emerging market equities,” said Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, EMEA chief investment officer at Lombard Odier. “We don’t expect a recession in 2026 to unfold.”

Those assessments came from Bloomberg News interviews with 39 investment managers across the US, Asia and Europe, including at BlackRock Inc., Allianz Global Investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Franklin Templeton.

More than three-quarters of the allocators were positioning portfolios for a risk-on environment through 2026. The thrust of the bet is that resilient global growth, further developments in artificial intelligence, accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus will deliver outsize returns in all fashion of global equity markets.

The call is not without risks, including simply its pervasiveness among the respondents, along with their overall high degree of assuredness. The view among the institutional investors also aligns with that of sell-side strategists around the globe.

Should the bullishness play out as expected, it would deliver a stunning fourth straight year of bumper returns for the MSCI All-Country World Index. That would extend a run that’s added $42 trillion in market capitalization since the end of 2022 — the most value created for equity investors in history.

That’s not to say the optimism is without merit. The artificial intelligence trade has added trillions in market value to dozens of firms plying the industry, but just three years after ChatGPT broke into the public consciousness, AI remains in the early phase of development.

No Tech Panic

The buy-side managers largely rejected the idea that the technology has blown a bubble in equity markets. While many acknowledged some pockets of froth in unprofitable tech names, 85% of managers said valuations among the Magnificent Seven and other AI heavyweights are not overly inflated. Fundamentals back the trade, they said, which marks the beginning of a new industrial cycle.

“You can’t call it a bubble when you’re seeing tech companies deliver a massive earnings beat. In fact, earnings from the sector have outstripped all other US stocks,” said Anwiti Bahuguna, global co-chief investment officer at Northern Trust Asset Management.

As such, investors expect the US to remain the engine of the rally.

“American exceptionalism is far from dead,” said Jose Rasco, chief investment officer at HSBC Americas. “As artificial intelligence continues to spread around the globe, the US will be a key participant.”

Most investors echoed the sentiment expressed by Helen Jewell, international chief investment officer of fundamental equities at BlackRock, who suggested also searching outside the US for meaningful upside.

“The US is where the high-return high-growth companies are, so we have to be realistic

[TITLE]FO° Exclusive: $650 Billion a Year? The Numbers Behind the AI Boom Don’t Add Up:
[TEXT]
Editor-in-Chief Atul Singh and FOI Senior Partner Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer who now advises companies, governments and organizations on geopolitical risk, discuss rising fears of a US stock market bubble, with particular attention to technology and artificial intelligence. Their concern is not simply that equities are expensive, but that today’s valuations reflect expectations the real economy may be unable to meet. Drawing on warnings by market experts, fiscal data and consumer indicators, they argue that the American economy is showing strains beneath the surface while markets continue to price in near-perfect economic conditions. The gap between financial optimism and economic reality, they suggest, is widening dangerously.

The AI boom and extreme market concentration

Atul opens by highlighting warnings from Albert Edwards, the global strategist at French bank Société Générale, who sees the US equity market — especially tech and AI stocks — in the midst of a classic bubble. Some major technology firms are trading at roughly 30 times forward earnings, a level Atul calls “a ridiculous figure.” These valuations, Edwards argues, leave little margin for error.

The discussion stresses that such optimism depends on extraordinary assumptions. Citing estimates from JPMorgan Chase, Atul notes that for companies to earn a 10% return on projected AI capital expenditure by 2030, they would collectively need around $650 billion in annual AI revenues — roughly $400 per year from every iPhone user. While some fund managers remain bullish, arguing AI-led productivity gains justify this optimism, many investors view the revenue assumptions as implausible.

Market gains are also highly concentrated. Roughly 60% of recent stock market growth has come from just seven firms: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. The remaining 40% of the market is up as well, but far less dramatically. This concentration amplifies systemic risk, as any correction among a handful of firms could reverberate across the entire market.

Inequality, consumers and the fragile base of demand

The US economy ultimately depends on consumer demand, even if that reality is often obscured by soaring asset prices. Glenn underlines that consumption today is increasingly driven by the wealthy. Around 80–86% of the gains from recent tax cuts have flowed to the top 1% of Americans, while the bottom 80% have seen little or no growth in disposable income for years.

This imbalance matters because wealthy households cannot replace mass demand. Glenn sums it up starkly: “1,000 billionaires cannot buy as many cars as 100 million lower-middle-class Americans.” If middle- and lower-middle-class consumers cannot afford homes, cars or basic goods, economic momentum weakens regardless of stock prices.

Atul turns the conversation to the declining role of entrepreneurs. Building small, innovative firms has become much more difficult as large corporations dominate markets. Historically, smaller companies have driven job creation and experimentation in both the US and Europe. Their erosion, Glenn adds, pushes the economy toward oligopoly — less competition, weaker innovation and slower long-term growth.

Time lags, tariffs and mounting economic strain

A central theme of the discussion is what Glenn calls the “lag factor” in economic policy. Despite commentators’ claims that new tariffs have had little immediate impact, policy effects take time. Even small changes in short-term interest rates can take around six months to affect the economy, while longer-term rates and fiscal measures often take 18 months or more.

Dismissing these delays may prove dangerous. Although tariff revenues have risen and trade flows have not collapsed, uncertainty itself is already affecting behavior. CEOs faced with shifting rules and arbitrary implementation hesitate to make long-term investment decisions. Supporters inside the Trump administration counter by likening the US market to a Disneyland theme park, arguing that trading partners will continue to accept lower margins because there is no substitute — a view closely associated with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who administration insiders credit with engineering a delicate balancing act between trade pressure and market stability.

Supporters also point to the US–China trade deal, which they argue removed Chinese export controls on rare earths, halted retaliation against US semiconductor firms and reopened Chinese markets to American agricultural exports. Critics respond that this confidence underestimates how quickly countries adapt when costs rise. Glenn points to rising housing costs, weak youth employment, a growing deficit and slowing construction as indicators of a slowdown in the economy.

Atul reinforces this view with insider insights from within Washington, DC. Sources in the US Treasury worry not just
