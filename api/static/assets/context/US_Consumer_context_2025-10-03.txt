In a relief to the Reliance Industries arm Reliance Retail , appellate tribunal NCLAT has set aside a petition against the leading retailer, which in 2023 reduced the equity share capital of the company, saying non-promoters were offered a "fair value" of their shares.Reliance Retail had in 2023 decided to reduce and cancel 78,65,423 equity shares of the company, held by the minority shareholders , other than the promoters/holding company.Observing that non-promoter shareholders were offered a "fair value" of their shares during the exercise and an overwhelming majority voted in favour of the resolution, the appellate tribunal upheld the earlier order passed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and said it found "no reason to upset a reasoned order passed" by it.The NCLAT, while referring to previous judgements, said "selective reduction is permissible if objecting shareholders are paid a fair value of their shares".On July 4, 2023, the board of Reliance Retail Ltd (RRL), through a special resolution, approved the proposal to reduce and cancel 78,65,423 equity shares of the company, held by minority shareholders, other than promoters/holding company.The company had then offered Rs 1,380 per share to shareholders other than its promoter and holding company, which constituted only 0.09 per cent of the total shareholding.This was challenged by one N G Joshi, a shareholder of RRL having 129 shares, constituting 0.0000014 per cent of the authorised and issued paid-up capital of the company before the Mumbai bench of the NCLT, which had on January 5, 2024 dismissed the petition.As an intervenor, he had objected to the reduction of share capital, alleging that such a reduction is against the minority interest and is not permitted under Section 66 of the Companies Act, 2013, since RRL is forcefully removing its shareholders, and promoters are increasing their stakes by using this process.Subsequently, an appeal to the NCLT order was also filed before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which also dismissed it last week.Passing its order, a two-member NCLAT bench observed that the special resolution for reduction of the share capital was passed with 99.99 per cent approval and Rs 1,380 per share, consideration paid by RRL was at a premium of 56 per cent to its fair value determined by two independent valuers.The six-page-long NCLAT noted that Article 56 of the Articles of Association of RRL permits the company to reduce its capital in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules.Moreover, the Regional Director and ROC (Registrar of Companies) have not objected to the reduction of share capital, though it was remarked by the Regional Director that the proposed reduction is a selective reduction.NCLAT also observed the appellant held mere 129 shares and no other shareholder of RRL has filed any appeal against the NCLT order.Moreover, it is settled law the question of reduction of share capital is treated as a matter of domestic concern, it is the decision of the majority which prevails, the appellate tribunal said."Thus once it is established that non-promoter shareholders are being paid a fair value of their shares and at no point of time it was suggested the amount paid was less and where an overwhelming majority voted in favour of resolution, we find no reason to upset a reasoned order passed by the NCLT," said NCLT bench comprising Member (Judicial) Justice Yogesh Khanna and Member (Technical) Ajai Das Mehrotra.

[TITLE]What Wall Street Is Saying About Nike’s Q1 Win: Retail, China + More:
[TEXT]
If the early read on Nike Inc.’s Win Now turnaround plan is any indication of future success, then the sportswear and sneaker brand racked up multiple wins in the first quarter — and Wall Street took notice of both the good and the bad.

“This quarter, our Win Now actions drove momentum in the areas we prioritized first: running, North America and wholesale partners. It showed that we’re making the right choices. Consumers are responding. We’re getting some wins under our belt,” Elliott J. Hill, Nike’s president and CEO told analysts during the firm’s first quarter earnings call Tuesday after the equity markets closed.

For now, North America is leading the turnaround, and Hill said that the spring order book is up year-over-year, indicating that Nike’s retail partners “are gaining trust in us.”

He noted the new formation of Sport Offense — the alignment of the three brands, Nike, Jordan and Converse, into more nimble, focused teams by sport — to get the teams closer to the athletes who buy Nike’s product. “That’s why the Sport Offense is going to be so critical to our success,” he explained. “We’ll gain sharper insights to fuel innovation in storytelling and connect with the communities of each sport in more meaningful ways.”

Hill sees the new alignment as a competitive advantage available only to Nike: “We believe the opportunity to serve so many athletes across sports with three distinct brands in retail channels at every price point is an advantage that no one else has in our industry.”

Hill also said that organizing by sport also provides a clearer point of view, citing to the House of Innovation in New York as one example where the retail experience was redesigned by sport.

“I walked the floors in early September and we’re now able to take a consumer into a world of Jordan, a world of Nike Running or a world of Nike Global Football. It’s an immersive sport experience and the refresh has already led to double-digit revenue increases. That clarity works in small format doors as well,” Hill explained.

Another example is the redesign of the South Congress store in Austin, Tex., to focus only on running and training, and sales have “significantly increased,” Hill told investors.

Another win has been its running business, which Hill said provides an “early window into the impact we expect out of Sport Offense.” He said the running team moved fastest into the new formation and learned from athletes that they want “big cushioning, stability or an everyday shoe that returns energy” from their running shoes, and that Nike moved quickly to redesign the Vomero, Structure and Pegasus. He also said the plan is to apply learnings from running to more sports and sport culture, including global football, basketball, training and sportswear, adding that each sport is in a different stage of development.

While the early read on running shoe sales has been a show of strength, Drake MacFarlane, research analyst at M Science, cautioned that “performance running isn’t everything,” noting that there are other aspects of Nike’s business that still needs work, particularly China.

“China results are a little disappointing in my view,” MacFarlane said, noting that Nike cited the promotional environment there. “I’d like to see that improve a little bit more meaningfully, since it’s still a pretty decent chunk of their business.”

Nike’s China business was down 10 percent for the quarter, and Hill said in the fourth quarter call that the country is facing structural challenges in the marketplace. Because Nike believes in the long-term opportunity in China, the company plans to make larger investments in that marketplace. But with over 5,000 mono-brand stores in China, Hill said Tuesday that “this will take investment, and it will take time.” He also said the company is “testing and resetting new consumer concepts” in China.

The M Science analyst also said he’d like to see more clarity on how Nike plans to revitalize its sportswear business, one area that Hill said is a focus for the company. “I am very curious to see what Nike does with apparel. Apparel was not performing in the last quarter and that is before they launched the NikeSkims collaboration with Kim Kardashian‘s Skims brand,” MacFarlane said. “I think re-engaging with a female consumer is the right move. I definitely think Adidas has benefited from a more fashion-conscious, female consumer over the past several years.”

But the analyst also raised some questions. “You can look on the website, you might see a couple of things out of stock, but that’s not necessarily indicative of how much stock was originally there,” he noted, adding that Kardashian is more for a millennial audience, and he’s not so sure if the brand would resonate with the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha demographic.

Laurent Vasilescu, senior equity analyst at BNP Paribas, noted that second quarter revenue guidance was down low-single digit, “suggesting that it’s not getting better sequentially,” and added that September weakness could lean away from bullishness to more toward bear territory.

Needham analyst Tom Nikic said that while top-line trends were improving, there were still some pain points, including incremental tariff headwinds. And Telsey Advisory Group’s Cristina Fernández said that the positives were “tempered” by continued headwinds on profitability, including tariff costs rising to $1.5 billion from an earlier estimate of $1 billion. She also noted lower customer traffic to the digital channel due to fewer promotions year-over-year. In addition, “promotions are now expected to be higher in China and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), as well as at Converse in order to match inventory levels to demand,” she said.

But even with the headwinds, there’s still enough good news to be a bit more bullish

[TITLE]Is Now The Time to Attract Long-Term Investment for Domestic Production?:
[TEXT]
One of President Donald Trump’s once-stated goals around tariffs has been increased domestic manufacturing.

But, at times, the end goals—and the industries the president wants to impact most—have been convoluted. Trump seems to have a vested interest in competing with China, increasing domestic manufacturing and securing favorable deals in negotiations with other countries. But as the administration continues to negotiate, what’s been the impact on domestic manufacturing?

At Sourcing Journal’s annual Fall Summit, Joseph Ferrara, co-founder and CEO of U.S.-based Ferrara Manufacturing; Sheng Lu, professor & graduate director of fashion & apparel studies at the University of Delaware and Bill McCann, executive director of the United States Footwear Manufacturers Association (USFMA), joined Kate Nishimura, senior news & features editor at Sourcing Journal, to discuss the outlook for made in the U.S.

Much of the conversation around nearshoring and onshoring has been onslaught by Trump’s at-times aggressive strategy toward China. While the tariff rates have temporarily flattened out, Trump at one point levied a triple-digit duty on Chinese goods inbound into the U.S. That strategy spooked brands and retailers that have high reliance on the Asian nation, but Lu said it hasn’t yet caused an uptick in U.S. exports or manufacturing, as far as his data shows.

Part of the reason for that, he said, is that many domestic factories lack the same capabilities that Chinese factories have built up in recent decades.

“If you want to be considered China’s alternative, you will need to offer similar kinds of products [to those] China currently puts on [the] market. But remember, China is not a place from where U.S. companies source T-shirts, source basic items. Instead, brands and retailers, they source a great variety of products from China—but this is not what Western hemisphere suppliers can mostly do,” Lu said.

Lu said part of the problem is the lack of lead up. Trump’s tariffs have been a whirlwind that has seen a slew of brands and retailers considering changing their typical sourcing strategies. While many companies may have an interest in purchasing U.S.-made products, the lack of scalability for certain items can make it hard to justify large-batch purchasing.

“Two-thirds of U.S.-based apparel mills, they have fewer than 10 people. You can think

[TITLE]Naadam Cashmere Sweater Review: Save 24% Off Deal With Promo Code:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

It’s finally — gloriously — the season of the sweater, and that first chill in the air merits an examination of just how dependable and chic your current cashmere collection is. If, upon taking stock of the situation, you find yourself at a loss (or, as The Neighbourhood once sang, with holes in said sweaters), your seasonal upgrade should come in the form of the $98 The Original Cashmere Sweater from Naadam: which boasts thousands of five-star reviews, has attained an impressive level of TikTok popularity, and, as a “thank you” for being a devoted reader, can now be yours for less.

With the WWD-exclusive code WWD75, you can get two of the brand’s original sweaters for $75 each ($150 total), until October 4. A deal this good is rare to find, so we can’t emphasize enough how important it is to get to shopping, stat.

For the sake of offering only the most honest, tried-and-true advice, I was lucky enough to trial the sweater style in its Tomato and Peacock Blue colorways over the span of two days, evaluating factors like softness, breathability (especially on unventilated subway cars, let me tell you), and aesthetics in context of my overall fall ensembles.

[TITLE]Carhartt Opens First New York City Store in Flatiron District:
[TEXT]
Carhartt is making its move into Manhattan.

The Dearborn, Mich.-based workwear company is opening its first New York City store on Thursday in the Flatiron District — a 5,000-square-foot unit at 936 Broadway, on the corner of 22nd Street.

The location was one of several that the company explored when searching for a spot in the city. It had considered the Empire State Building, but opted for the Flatiron area in order to be more accessible to the local community, said Chad Cornstubble, senior vice president of direct-to-consumer for Carhartt.

“We’re very data-oriented in how we choose our stores and we felt this location was most relevant to our customers,” he said.

The store will mark the 57th unit for Carhartt, which is on track to raise that number to around 100 by 2030. Among the other cities where it will open stores in the near term are Sioux Falls, S.D.; Tempe, Ariz.; Prosper, Texas, and Memphis, Tenn. “We’re very methodical and want to make sure the locations are brand right,” Cornstubble said.

The stores also must be able to attract Carhartt’s core customer: the skilled worker. Although most people might be surprised, “New York City has a large amount of skilled tradespeople,” said Susan Hennike, chief brand officer, citing the large number of carpenters, electricians, construction workers and other blue-collar workers who live or work in the area.

Cornstubble said that although the store is located in Manhattan, it will be similar to units in other cities. “Our product mix is not different,” he said. “We stay true and authentic to who we are.”

The only difference is that the Flatiron store will be able to showcase more of the assortment because it’s larger than most of the other units. “It will have a broader assortment because of its size,” he said. “Only 30-35 percent of our assortment makes it into most stores, but New York City will have greater breadth.”

The store also retained some of the “bones” from the original space, including columns, Cornstubble said, and it will also feature a couple of New York-specific design details and graphics.

The assortment will be primarily men’s, but womenswear is seen as a growth area for Carhartt and is being given more space and prominence in new and remodeled stores. “Women’s is 20-25 percent of the mix in new doors but is only 10-15 percent in our older doors,” Cornstubble said.

Starting last year, Carhartt began offering products that featured women’s-specific fits and functionality. “There’s such an opportunity with women in the skilled trades,” Hennike said. Although the core messaging is the same regardless of gender — quality, durable products — the women’s line is “built specifically for her.” A new denim program will be launching in October to complement the workpants, sweatshirts, Ts and other pieces targeted to women, she said.

What Carhartt is not doing, however, is chasing the fashion customer who has embraced the brand. “We’re happy to take the halo, but we’re going to stay true to who we are,” Cornstubble said. “We may offer new colors and fits, but everything is still rigorously tested for breaks and tears. We never waver from authenticity.”

“We welcome everybody to the brand,” Hennike added. “We’ve become attractive to the street because we’re authentic. And durability has been our point of differentiation for 136 years.”

While brick-and-mortar may be the focus for the brand as it opens the Flatiron store, e-commerce also continues to be important. “It’s rapidly growing and doing quite well,” said Cornstubble of the company’s digital business which has been updated to include more storytelling such as that centered around the 50th anniversary of the Active Jac jacket that is currently featured on the homepage.

At the same time, wholesale continues to be key for Carhartt. Although they declined to reveal how much of the business is wholesale versus retail, Hennike said: “Our wholesale partners are very important to us.”

Cornstubble added that Carhartt looks at its retail stores as a complement to its wholesale business. Business usually increases for wholesalers when Carhartt opens a store in a community and the two work closely together to ensure the consumer is serviced.

“We don’t care where the sales come from,” Cornstubble said. “We just want to serve the community.”

To introduce itself to the New York City community, Carhartt will be giving away its K87 pocket T-shirt that was customized with a New York City logo. Because the company is expecting a large crowd, Cornstubble said Carhartt ordered double the number it usually produces for a store opening. “They’re going to go fast,” he predicted.

Shoppers will also gain triple loyalty points for qualifying purchases on the opening weekend and will also take home some gifts with purchase.

To promote the store, Carhartt will continue to lean into its Made Possible campaign that celebrates those in the skilled trades.

While this is the first Carhartt store in New York, there are two Carhartt Work in Progress units in the city: one in SoHo and the other in Williamsburg in Brooklyn that are separately owned and operated.

The Carhartt Co. was founded by Hamilton Carhartt in Detroit in 1889 as a workwear brand and it is still owned and operated by his descendants. In 1989, Swiss national Edwin Faeh started importing the workwear to Europe. He holds the global license for the line and created Carhartt WIP in 1994, offering trendy alternatives inspired by the utilitarian core collection.
