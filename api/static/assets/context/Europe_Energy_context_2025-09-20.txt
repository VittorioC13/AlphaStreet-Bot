Rome: Dorf Ketal , one of the biggest global manufacturers and suppliers of specialty chemicals, is in advanced negotiations to buy Italmatch Chemicals SpA of Italy for $1.6 billion from current owners Bain Capital , said people in the know. Both sides have entered deal exclusivity talks and hope to finalise shareholder terms (SPA) in the next few weeks before a formal announcement is made at the month end, they said.The ambitious move, which will be the Mumbai-headquartered company’s biggest acquisition if successful, underscores the consolidation trend in the industry since last year. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co agreed to take over Germany’s Covestro AG in a €12 billion deal in 2024. Last October, Lone Star signed an agreement to sell specialty chemicals company AOC to Nippon Paint Holdings Co. Closer home, JSW Paints acquired a lion’s share of Akzo Nobel’s India business for $1.6 billion.Dorf Ketal (DK) was founded in 1992 by first-generation entrepreneurs and brothers Subodh and Sudhir Menon, who run the company. It’s a leader in the hydrocarbons chemicals value chain — oil and gas exploration, refining, petrochemicals and downstream retail fuel pumps — with a global portfolio and diverse applications across industrial segments.The company, which is privately held, posted a domestic revenue of Rs 5,479 crore in FY24. Revenue for the six months to September 2024 was Rs 2,961.3 crore.Dorf Katel vice chairman Subodh Menon and Bain Capital declined to comment. Mails sent to Italmatch did not generate a response till presstime.The Italmatch acquisition is aimed at diversifying into adjacencies and offering a wider range of products and services, said the people cited. Genoa-based Italmatch operates in four key business segments — water and oil treatment; lubricants, flame retardants and plastic additives; performance products; and personal care. The company led by chief executive officer Sergio Iorio has doubled down on specialty chemical additives used to produce flame retardants and fabric softeners as well as lubricants and water treatment. It has a strong presence in the US and operates 20 manufacturing plants globally, including nine in the EU. That would complement Dorf Katel’s worldwide footprint.In FY24, as per industry sources, Dorf Ketal had made a bid for Pune-based Aquapharm Chemicals, predominantly for its water treatment business, which is a key area for the Menons as well. The company was eventually acquired by Kolkata-based Phillips Carbon Black Ltd. (PCBL), part of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group.Dorf Ketal had been planning an IPO and even filed a DRHP but that was withdrawn last week on account of this transaction.Interestingly, the company's CEO Iorio will be rolling over his stake to ensure management continuity.“Italmatch’s foray into the water segment is what is especially attractive for Dorf Katel. Chemicals used in water treatment in the ethanol industry or even oil and gas refining is a fast-growing segment that Dorf wants to capitalise on,” said an executive in the know. “DK has grown inorganically and its ambitions too have been rising as it has been successful in integrating their global buys.”Since 2003, DK has made at least a dozen acquisitions, buying units and divisions from companies as diverse as ExxonMobil, UOP, Clariant’s North American land oil business to local firm Khyati Chemicals and Pune-based Elixir Soltech. Most of its R&D, product knowhow and IP has been acquired through M&As, posing an entry barrier for competitors. In 2022, it expanded to Latin America, one of the largest oil-producing regions in the world and the fastest-growing in pulp, with strong potential for developing sustainable chemistries derived from plant-based sources like ethanol, soy and other crops.The Italian company too has gone through several rounds of private equity ownership. Bain Capital acquired control of Italmatch from Ardian SAS in 2018. Subsequently, it sold a minority stake in Italmatch to Saudi Arabian Industrial Investments Co, also known as Dussur. Under Bain, Italmatch has expanded through organic growth and bolt-on deals. It signed a binding agreement in 2024 to purchase a majority stake in Brazilian rival Alcolina, which specialises in water treatment for bioethanol, sugar production and industrial applications. The US buyout fund has also helped the company to double earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda). FY24 revenue touched €686 million with sales volumes rising 8% from the previous year. Adjusted ebitda rose 17% from € 115 million to €134 million, as per a July 2025 announcement, while contribution margin grew 10%, reaching € 276 million versus €251 million in the previous year. It also has €690 million of outstanding bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Italmatch has historically grown through M&As and has made several acquisitions in the water additives and lube additives space. The business has managed to maintain a 20-21% ebitda margin profile despite a challenging business environment in chemicals globally, said the industry executive cited above. One of Dorf Ketal's biggest strengths has been the R&D and product knowhow - majority of the IP has been acquired through their M&As (Fluid Energy, UOP Inc, DuPont and Johnson Mathey) and has acted as big entry barrier for competitors. The Menons have also been savvy buyer of oilfield and specialty chemical businesses around the world and has generally known to be a value buyers.Morgan Stanley is advising Dorf Ketal as well as solely underwriting the entire financing.One of the obvious synergies for Dorf Ketal would be to move some of the EU-based manufacturing and rationalise the sites. Over the years, it has become a ‘wells to wheels’ company, delivering solutions across every stage of the value chain, from extraction to end-use.Its plants are located in India, Brazil and Canada in addition to contract manufacturing capabilities in the Netherlands. It’s R&D units are in India, Brazil, Singapore and Canada, with several marketing offices across the world."Global speciality chemical deals of a certain critical size (> $100 mn EBITDA) have been priced in the 10-14 (x) EV / EBITDA range," said Navroz Mahudawala, founder Candle Patners, an advisory firm. "However considering the current ongoing challenges in the chemical sector esp in Europe a buyer may get better pricing compared to traditional historical multiples and most sellers may be more realistic in terms of valuations. The ongoing year (CY 2025), has been challenging for most companies across various segments and we definitely will see a decline in EBITDA margins for most speciality chemicals companies."The market for global specialty chemicals has increased from $1.03 trillion in 2021 to $1.14 trillion in 2023 and is estimated to further go up to $1.43 trillion in 2028 owing to an increase in demand from end-use industries such as automotive, construction, electronics, pharmaceuticals and food and beverages. Europe is a significant market for specialty chemicals.

[TITLE]Avoiding sanctions: Takeaways from AP's report on a secret deal between Russia and Vietnam:
[TEXT]
BANGKOK (AP) — Russia is a key supplier of military goods to Vietnam, providing it with fighter jets, tanks and ships. Moscow's ongoing war against Ukraine, however, has given rise to international sanctions and the United States, European Union and others are threating more unless Russia relents.

Internal Vietnamese documents obtained by The Associated Press reveal that Hanoi and Moscow have prepared for this possibility, establishing a complex system through which Vietnam can conceal its payments to Russia for defense goods by avoiding any open transfers of cash through the global banking system.

Here are some takeaways from AP's report:

How does it work?

The system established last year uses Vietnam's profits from joint oil and gas ventures with Russia to pay for defense goods bought on credit from Moscow.

Final details of the mechanism were laid out in a 2024 memo obtained by the AP from the Vietnam Oil and Gas Group, known as Petrovietnam or PVN, to Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade ahead of a visit to Hanoi by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Under the system, Vietnamese profits from the Rusvietpetro joint venture in Siberia are sent to Moscow to pay back credit extended for military purchases. Vietnam’s profits exceeding the loan repayments are then transferred to Russian state-owned oil and gas company Zarubezhneft in Russia. And finally in Vietnam, Zarubezhneft uses its joint venture company there to transfer an equal amount of money to PVN, effectively avoiding any international financial transfers.

Why does it matter?

The system has been put in place at a precarious time when the U.S. is trying to strengthen ties with Vietnam as a bulwark against growing Chinese assertiveness in Southeast Asia, and has ongoing trade negotiations after the White House imposed 20% tariffs on Hanoi, while at the same time President Donald Trump is threatening even more stringent sanctions on Moscow.

The European Union has also added a raft of new sanctions to pressure Putin to end the war, and Trump recently issued an executive order doubling tariffs on India to 50% to pressure New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil and military equipment, which he said was helping enable the war against Ukraine.

The AP obtained the documents related to the mechanism from a Vietnamese official who said that he was part of a faction opposed to closer ties to Russia at the risk of jeopardizing the growing relationship with Washington. He provided the documents on condition of anonymity to protect himself from possible reprisals from Vietnam’s authoritarian government.

The U.S. State Department refused to comment specifically on the documents or the payment plan designed to skirt American sanctions, referring comments to the Vietnamese government. It reiterated broadly, however, that “our sanctions remain in place.”

Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry, PVN and the Foreign Ministry did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment on the payment scheme. Russia’s Finance Ministry, which conducted the negotiations for Moscow, also did not respond.

Is it necessary?

Experts say the mechanism is probably not needed to avoid sanctions that are in place right now, but indicates the two countries are exercising an abundance of caution by putting a system in place to avoid possible future secondary sanctions - sanctions that could be put in place on companies and governments that deal with sanctioned Russian entities.

The main threat of secondary sanctions comes from the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, measures adopted during Trump’s first term, which make it possible to impose sanctions on countries or people with commercial dealings with Russia’s military-industrial complex.

“If you want to insulate yourself from any kind of risk, you then basically avoid cross-border transactions and create these kind of offsetting payment schemes,” said. Ben Hilgenstock, a senior economist at the Kyiv School of Economics who is an expert on Russian sanctions and analyzed the Vietnamese documents for the AP.

PVN’s general director, Le Ngoc Son, spells out the concerns in the June 11, 2024, document that outlines the agreement, writing that: “In the context of the U.S. and Western countries imposing sanctions on Russia in general and removing Russia from SWIFT in particular, this payment method is considered relatively confidential and appropriate because money only circulates within the territory of Vietnam and Russia and Vietnam does not have to worry about the risks of being affected by the U.S. embargo.”

[TITLE]AP Exclusive: Russia, Vietnam using energy profits to avoid possible US sanctions for arms deals:
[TEXT]
The Vietnamese government document that was leaked in 2023 and the newer government document from last year were provided to The Associated Press by an official who said that he was part of a faction opposed to closer ties to Russia at the risk of jeopardizing the growing relationship with Washington. He provided the documents on condition of anonymity to protect himself from possible reprisals from Vietnam's authoritarian government.

News that the unorthodox arrangement was in the works leaked in 2023. But rather than shutting it down, an internal document from last year reveals that Russia and Vietnam finalized and implemented it, while also making agreements to ensure it would produce sufficient funds for future military purchases.

The Trump Organization, the president's family business, also broke ground earlier this year on a $1.5 billion luxury golf complex outside the capital, Hanoi, after Vietnam fast-tracked approval. The president's sons run the organization, but financial disclosures in June indicated that Trump himself benefits from many of its activities .

The European Union has also added a raft of new sanctions to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war, and Trump recently issued an executive order doubling tariffs on India to 50% to pressure New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil and military equipment , which he said was helping enable the war against Ukraine.

The revelation comes at a precarious time when the U.S. is trying to strengthen ties with Vietnam as a bulwark against growing Chinese assertiveness in Southeast Asia , and has ongoing trade negotiations with Hanoi after the White House imposed 20% tariffs, while at the same time President Donald Trump is threatening even more stringent sanctions on Moscow.

Under the system, Vietnam has purchased Russian military equipment including fighter jets, tanks and ships on credit from Moscow, then paid that credit back from its share of profits from a joint Vietnam-Russia oil company operating in Siberia. Such transactions are irregular in international financial markets and in this case are designed to keep cash quietly flowing even if sanctions aimed at ending Russia's war on Ukraine are strengthened, the documents make clear.

BANGKOK (AP) — Russia and Vietnam have developed a back-door method of concealing arms deal payments to avoid American and other Western sanctions, using the profits from joint oil and gas ventures to pay off defense contracts without any open transfers of cash through the global banking system, according to internal Vietnamese documents obtained by The Associated Press.

Story Continues

The U.S. State Department refused to comment specifically on the documents or the payment plan designed to skirt American sanctions, referring comments to the Vietnamese government. It reiterated broadly, however, that “our sanctions remain in place.”

“Those engaging in certain transactions or activities with sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions risk or be subject to an enforcement action,” the State Department said in an email to the AP this week.

Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry, the Vietnam Oil and Gas Group, known as Petrovietnam or PVN, and the Foreign Ministry did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment on the payment scheme. Russia’s Finance Ministry, which conducted the negotiations for Moscow, also did not respond.

“It’s not your typical flexible financing. It’s not your typical offset or counter-trade provisions,” said Evan Laksmana, who leads the Southeast Asian Security and Defense research program for the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.

“It is,” Laksmana said, “next-level stuff.”

How the arrangement works

The mechanism involves using Vietnam’s profits from a joint Vietnam-Russia oil venture in Siberia, Rusvietpetro, to repay loans for military purchases while avoiding transactions through the global SWIFT network system, which powers most international financial transfers and is overseen by the United States and other Western nations. In effect, it's a series of transactions that skip carefully laid global financial pathways, keeping transactions secret.

Final details of the agreement were laid out last summer in the 2024 memo obtained by the AP, from PVN to Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade ahead of a visit to Hanoi by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The plan outlined involves:

—First, Vietnamese profits from the Rusvietpetro joint venture in Siberia are sent to Moscow to pay back credit extended for military purchases;

—then, Vietnam's profits exceeding the loan repayments are transferred to Russian state-owned oil and gas company Zarubezhneft in Russia;

—finally, in Vietnam, Zarubezhneft uses its joint venture company there to transfer an equal amount of money to PVN, effectively avoiding any international financial transfers.

[TITLE]Europe’s Impossible Choice: AI Development or Net Zero?:
[TEXT]
Guest essay by Steve Goreham

This year, European nations announced plans to pursue artificial intelligence. National leaders announced AI spending goals totaling hundreds of billions of euros in efforts to catch up to the United States. But AI requires huge amounts of electrical power, conflicting with Europe’s commitment to achieve a Net Zero power grid.

Since ChatGPT released their AI chatbot in November of 2022, artificial intelligence has exploded. In only two years, the AI revolution became the driving force in the US high-tech industry. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and other firms will spend over $100 billion this year building and upgrading data centers to run AI. Nvidia, the dominant supplier of AI graphics processor units (GPUs), became the most valuable company in the world, its market capitalization soaring from $300 billion to $4.3 trillion in less than three years.

Artificial intelligence requires vast amounts of electricity. AI processors run 24 hours a day, enabling computers to think like humans. When servers are upgraded to support AI, they consume 6 to 10 times more power than when used for cloud storage and the internet. Data centers consumed 4% of US power at the start of 2024 but are projected to consume 20% within the next decade.

The need for new generating capacity for AI now drives US electricity markets. Coal-fired power plant closures have been postponed in Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and other states. Nuclear plants are restarting in Iowa, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Dozens of small modular reactors are on the drawing board. More than 200 gas-fired plants are in planning or under construction, including more than 100 in Texas. Companies building AI data centers are constructing their own on-site power plants, unwilling to wait for grid power. The pursuit of artificial intelligence is rapidly replacing obsolete US Net Zero policies.

For more than 25 years, Europe enacted policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in order to try to “mitigate” dangerous human-caused climate change. The European Green Deal of 2019 seeks to make Europe the first “climate-neutral continent.” The European Climate Law of 2021 provides legal force for the European Green Deal, calling for a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and for achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050. Nations have been installing wind and solar facilities and closing traditional power plants to reduce emissions. Today,

[TITLE]Exxon is Shaking Up the EV Battery Market:
[TEXT]
The company has expanded its involvement in the EV battery supply chain through the acquisition of synthetic graphite maker Superior Graphite and its previous entry into lithium mining in Arkansas.

Sales of electric vehicles are growing strongly despite a certain unevenness in this growth across the globe. But overall, this growth is not strong enough to give battery researchers a break—work is still underway for batteries that are more reliable, faster to charge, and longer-living. In that, the EV industry may have a somewhat unlikely champion—none other than oil supermajor Exxon.

Last week, Exxon announced it had invented a new graphite molecule that could extend the life of an electric vehicle battery by as much as 30%. “We’ve invented a new carbon molecule that will extend the life of the battery by 30%,” chief executive Darren Woods said, as quoted by Bloomberg. It’s a “revolutionary step change in battery performance.” Woods added that several electric vehicle manufacturers were testing the new molecule.

The news came just days after Exxon said it had taken over a synthetic graphite maker, Superior Graphite, “to complement our planned entry into the battery anode graphite market.” The company said synthetic graphite is used in both EV batteries and battery storage systems. Exxon added that synthetic graphite was “a game changer” since it was easier to produce than mining natural graphite, which made it cheaper and more consistent in quality, which meant that “we can scale faster and smarter, all while producing a better graphite than what is available in the market today.”

The acquisition and the newly announced invention follow Exxon’s foray into lithium mining in 2023. The supermajor said it had plans to produce lithium in Arkansas and become a leading EV battery supplier by 2030 two years ago, despite stumbling EV sales in its home market. Exxon is targeting first lithium production for 2027 and is also evaluating growth opportunities globally. By 2030, the company aims to be producing enough lithium to supply the manufacturing needs of more than a million EVs per year.

With the latest developments, the energy major will have covered most of the supply chain for electric vehicle batteries. All it would need is demand—and that might become a problem before long. Earlier this month, Rho Motion reported that global sales of electric cars had gone up by a solid 15% in August. Since the start of the year, EV sales in Europe have swelled by 31%, with Germany and the UK boasting a sales rise of 45% and 31%, respectively, and Spain seeing a twofold increase in the period. In the United States, EV sales have accelerated as well, although by a much smaller margin.

These numbers look strong, and they are strong. However, the only reason behind this strength is state subsidization—and the money for that always runs out. The example here was Germany, which tried to phase out EV subsidies, only to see a slump in sales and reinstate the subsidies. In the U.S., EV subsidies end in September, which, according to the global August EV sales report, is what has motivated the jump in sales by people who want to take last-minute advantage of the subsidy.

Meanwhile, in the world’s biggest EV market, growth is slowing and the government is taking aim at the health of the industry with measures that will further soften the rise in sales. In August, EV sales in China grew at the slowest pace in 18 months, and the government is preparing a clampdown on cutthroat competition in the industry and not strictly legal practices aimed at milking the government for EV subsidies such as selling so-called zero-mileage used cars.

Once the subsidy money runs out, EV makers that survive would be on their own—with Exxon and its lithium and battery technology on their side. It would be interesting to see if the oil major would stick to its EV bets when the sales tide turns.

[TITLE]Gevo Executes Deal with Biorecro to Accelerate Multi-Year Carbon Credit Offtake and Business Expansion:
[TEXT]
Gevo’s carbon business expands, enabling a consistent new revenue source for Gevo, and strengthens Biorecro’s BECCS project portfolio with an in-operation project.

ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO) announced today that its subsidiary, Net-Zero Richardton, LLC, has signed a Carbon Dioxide Removal Sales Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Biorecro North America, LLC (“Biorecro”) for the commercialization of carbon dioxide removal credits generated at the Gevo North Dakota facility. This Agreement is for voluntary credits and is expected to generate approximately $26 million in revenues for Gevo over five years with the option to expand the volumes under the transaction. Gevo and Biorecro are able to provide immediate, operational solutions for companies with hard-to-abate emissions; solving demand needs today with the supply of high-integrity durable carbon removal credits from Gevo North Dakota, which are certified by Puro.earth.

“This deal with Biorecro demonstrates the demand for high-quality carbon dioxide removal credits,” says Dr. Paul D. Bloom, Chief Business Officer for Gevo. “While biofuel markets can be volatile, the demand for our cost-effective carbon abatement solutions is starting to provide new, stable revenue streams to deliver value to our customers and shareholders.”

“We are proud to be part of Gevo’s bold and forward-thinking commitment to bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (“BECCS”),” says Henrik Karlsson, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Biorecro. “As a global BECCS project developer, our team at Biorecro is excited to share our expertise with Gevo and leverage their capacity to grow this critical carbon removal sector in this project and beyond.”

The Gevo North Dakota site has been certifying up to 165,000 tonnes of stored CO 2 per year since 2022 as one of the first BECCS and industrial-scale carbon removal projects to become operational globally.1 The site has the appropriate geological formation and operational Class VI well for CCS, with the ability to store up to an estimated 1 million tonnes of CO 2 per year. The supply of credits is certified by Puro.earth, generating a CORC (or CO 2 Removal Certification) that can be bought, sold and retired by customers and adheres to strict standards for 1,000-plus-years permanence and other key quality parameters required by customers. Gevo North Dakota is supplying customers with CORCs today that are ready to be utilized immediately.

_____________________________

1 Gevo purchased the assets now known as Gevo North Dakota on January 31, 2025. The assets were previously owned and operated by Red Trail Energy, LLC prior to Gevo’s purchase.

At Gevo North Dakota, biogenic CO₂ is captured and securely stored underground, enabling the generation of carbon removal credits. Today, biogenic CO₂ has additional value when permanently stored, generating carbon removal credits that help customers offset emissions. Biogenic CO 2 is a coproduct that is produced along with protein feed and fuel in our process and has many pathways via carbon capture, utilization and storage (“CCUS”). Carbon dioxide is often used in industrial applications, including the food-and-beverage industry and enhanced oil recovery (“EOR”) in petroleum production.

“Biorecro is a leader in this field,” says Alex Clayton, Chief Business Development Officer at Gevo. “We’re pleased with our first deal and look forward to the potential for developing more projects. Biorecro understands this market, and the global customers they will serve with an ongoing supply of CORCs from Gevo North Dakota should feel confident in the rigorous validation of our carbon-abatement project.”

[TITLE]Trump Says Putin 'Let Me Down,' Allies Must Stop Buying Oil:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had “really let me down,” but insisted allies must stop purchasing oil from Russia if they want the US to further intervene and pressure the Kremlin to end the war in Ukraine.

“Very simply, if the price of oil comes down, Putin is going to drop out,” Trump said Thursday following a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. “He’s going to have no choice. He’s going to drop out of that war.”

Trump indicated he’d be willing to consider other efforts to punish Putin, but he signaled those moves would be contingent on allies ending purchases of Russian energy.

“I’m willing to do other things, but not when the people that I’m fighting for are buying oil from Russia,” Trump said.

The European Union is looking at ways to more quickly phase out Russian liquefied natural gas imports. There are also plans for a potential meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly gathering in New York next week.

One US proposal that’s been advanced calls for secondary tariffs of as much as 100% on goods from China and India as well as other trade restrictions meant to curb the flow of Russian energy and prevent the transfer of dual-use technologies into Russia.

But aggressive steps including cutting off energy purchases are unlikely to be accepted by some nations that can block joint European Union actions, leaving talks at a stalemate and prompting questions

[TITLE]Europe’s Impossible Choice: AI Development or Net Zero?:
[TEXT]
Guest essay by Steve Goreham

This year, European nations announced plans to pursue artificial intelligence. National leaders announced AI spending goals totaling hundreds of billions of euros in efforts to catch up to the United States. But AI requires huge amounts of electrical power, conflicting with Europe’s commitment to achieve a Net Zero power grid.

Since ChatGPT released their AI chatbot in November of 2022, artificial intelligence has exploded. In only two years, the AI revolution became the driving force in the US high-tech industry. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and other firms will spend over $100 billion this year building and upgrading data centers to run AI. Nvidia, the dominant supplier of AI graphics processor units (GPUs), became the most valuable company in the world, its market capitalization soaring from $300 billion to $4.3 trillion in less than three years.

Artificial intelligence requires vast amounts of electricity. AI processors run 24 hours a day, enabling computers to think like humans. When servers are upgraded to support AI, they consume 6 to 10 times more power than when used for cloud storage and the internet. Data centers consumed 4% of US power at the start of 2024 but are projected to consume 20% within the next decade.

The need for new generating capacity for AI now drives US electricity markets. Coal-fired power plant closures have been postponed in Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and other states. Nuclear plants are restarting in Iowa, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Dozens of small modular reactors are on the drawing board. More than 200 gas-fired plants are in planning or under construction, including more than 100 in Texas. Companies building AI data centers are constructing their own on-site power plants, unwilling to wait for grid power. The pursuit of artificial intelligence is rapidly replacing obsolete US Net Zero policies.

For more than 25 years, Europe enacted policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in order to try to “mitigate” dangerous human-caused climate change. The European Green Deal of 2019 seeks to make Europe the first “climate-neutral continent.” The European Climate Law of 2021 provides legal force for the European Green Deal, calling for a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and for achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050. Nations have been installing wind and solar facilities and closing traditional power plants to reduce emissions. Today,

[TITLE]Octopus Energy Plans to Spin Off Technology Arm:
[TEXT]
Octopus Energy Group Ltd. plans to spin off Kraken Technologies Ltd., a software platform that helps utilities manage the transition to cleaner energy.

Kraken has been key to Octopus Energy’s growth into the UK’s largest electricity supplier, leapfrogging industry incumbents to serve more than 7 million customers in the country. The software allows it to balance out power flows to households as energy-transition technologies like electric vehicles, home batteries, solar panels and heat pumps become more widespread.

The software platform is already being licensed to other energy providers such as Electricite de France SA, serving more than 70 million household and business accounts worldwide. Committed annual revenue has increased fourfold to $500 million in just three years and the spinoff will accelerate the expansion, Octopus said in a statement on Thursday.

“Kraken is now a globally successful business in its own right,” Chief Executive Officer Amir Orad said in the statement. “Completing our journey to full independence is a strategic and inevitable next step.”

Tim Wan has joined Kraken as its chief financial officer, the same role he previously held at US software firm Asana Inc., according to the statement. He was involved in Asana’s US listing in New York in 2020.

Kraken could be valued at as much as $14 billion, Sky News reported in July, citing a person familiar with the matter, who also said the spinoff could be part of plans for Octopus Energy to sell a stake in Kraken to external investors.

The demerger and any stake sale could “bring transparency to the value of Kraken,” said Martin Young, founder of consulting firm Aquaicity Ltd. He said that could be a precursor to further sales in the future, and possibly an initial public offering.

“Separation offers a cleaner structure and puts to bed the question: ‘Is Octopus a supplier with a tech arm attached, or a tech company that has a supplier as a shop window?” Young added.

Previous Moves

Octopus Energy itself followed a similar path when it moved from being wholly owned by Octopus Group to taking in outside capital to fund its rapid growth. In 2020, it agreed to sell a 20% stake in the power supplier to Origin Energy Ltd. in a deal that valued the company at more than £1 billion ($1.4 billion). It later attracted investment from Generation Investment Management, the sustainable fund co-founded by former US Vice President Al Gore.

Octopus Energy said in January that it had become the UK’s largest energy supplier just nine years after the company started, overtaking legacy providers such as Centrica Plc’s British Gas. The rapid decarbonization of the country’s electricity has transformed the business landscape for utilities, occasionally sending power prices below zero when wind power generation surges.

At times when renewable energy is abundant in the UK, suppliers can use Kraken’s software to offer cheaper deals to customers and incentives for them to ramp up demand, for example by charging their electric cars. This helps manage the fluctuations in electricity flows that come with a more renewables-heavy grid.

[TITLE]Gevo Executes Deal with Biorecro to Accelerate Multi-Year Carbon Credit Offtake and Business Expansion:
[TEXT]
Gevo’s carbon business expands, enabling a consistent new revenue source for Gevo, and strengthens Biorecro’s BECCS project portfolio with an in-operation project.

ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO) announced today that its subsidiary, Net-Zero Richardton, LLC, has signed a Carbon Dioxide Removal Sales Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Biorecro North America, LLC (“Biorecro”) for the commercialization of carbon dioxide removal credits generated at the Gevo North Dakota facility. This Agreement is for voluntary credits and is expected to generate approximately $26 million in revenues for Gevo over five years with the option to expand the volumes under the transaction. Gevo and Biorecro are able to provide immediate, operational solutions for companies with hard-to-abate emissions; solving demand needs today with the supply of high-integrity durable carbon removal credits from Gevo North Dakota, which are certified by Puro.earth.

“This deal with Biorecro demonstrates the demand for high-quality carbon dioxide removal credits,” says Dr. Paul D. Bloom, Chief Business Officer for Gevo. “While biofuel markets can be volatile, the demand for our cost-effective carbon abatement solutions is starting to provide new, stable revenue streams to deliver value to our customers and shareholders.”

“We are proud to be part of Gevo’s bold and forward-thinking commitment to bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (“BECCS”),” says Henrik Karlsson, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Biorecro. “As a global BECCS project developer, our team at Biorecro is excited to share our expertise with Gevo and leverage their capacity to grow this critical carbon removal sector in this project and beyond.”

The Gevo North Dakota site has been certifying up to 165,000 tonnes of stored CO 2 per year since 2022 as one of the first BECCS and industrial-scale carbon removal projects to become operational globally.1 The site has the appropriate geological formation and operational Class VI well for CCS, with the ability to store up to an estimated 1 million tonnes of CO 2 per year. The supply of credits is certified by Puro.earth, generating a CORC (or CO 2 Removal Certification) that can be bought, sold and retired by customers and adheres to strict standards for 1,000-plus-years permanence and other key quality parameters required by customers. Gevo North Dakota is supplying customers with CORCs today that are ready to be utilized immediately.

_____________________________

1 Gevo purchased the assets now known as Gevo North Dakota on January 31, 2025. The assets were previously owned and operated by Red Trail Energy, LLC prior to Gevo’s purchase.

At Gevo North Dakota, biogenic CO₂ is captured and securely stored underground, enabling the generation of carbon removal credits. Today, biogenic CO₂ has additional value when permanently stored, generating carbon removal credits that help customers offset emissions. Biogenic CO 2 is a coproduct that is produced along with protein feed and fuel in our process and has many pathways via carbon capture, utilization and storage (“CCUS”). Carbon dioxide is often used in industrial applications, including the food-and-beverage industry and enhanced oil recovery (“EOR”) in petroleum production.

“Biorecro is a leader in this field,” says Alex Clayton, Chief Business Development Officer at Gevo. “We’re pleased with our first deal and look forward to the potential for developing more projects. Biorecro understands this market, and the global customers they will serve with an ongoing supply of CORCs from Gevo North Dakota should feel confident in the rigorous validation of our carbon-abatement project.”

[TITLE]Michael Hudson: Who Writes the New Rules as Power Shifts Away from the US?:
[TEXT]
Yves here. In a wide-ranging discussion, Michael Hudson discusses some of the implications of the US loss of economic dominance, which Trump is accelerating via his misguided attempts to preserve US hegemony. He points out that debt levels in Global South countries are often crippling and require writedowns, not mere restructurings. He also describes the ongoing project of developing non-dollar payment systems, Ukraine corruption and China’s development-oriented approach to lending.

1. How do you view Southeast Asia’s market opening to the US?

Even if they open their markets, as Japan also just did, this doesn’t mean that Asian countries are actually going to import more American autos or American rice or American products, because Asians prefer Asian cars, like so many Americans prefer Asian cars. The Japanese especially prefer their own rice or even Korean rice to American rice. So on the surface, it looks like the United States is going to achieve huge new markets. The question is whether the Asians are going to respond in the way that Canada did to a kind of nationalistic resentment against the United States bullying them into trying to open their markets and make America the main winner in any deal. If America is the winner in an international trade deal, that means the other country must be a loser. And the populations of other countries don’t like to be losers. They’re feeling increasing resentment. So what seems to be a victory for Trump in the very first look turns out to be he planting the seeds for resentment and a reaction against The United States. You’re seeing this already in Japan, for instance, when Japan is beginning to talk with Korea and China
