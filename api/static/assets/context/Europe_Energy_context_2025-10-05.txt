[TITLE]Nayara Energy Adapts to EU Sanctions With Rupee Oil Payments:
[TEXT]
Nayara Energy, the Indian refiner that was slapped with EU sanctions because of its partial ownership by Rosneft, has started to recover from the blow, turning to payments in rupees for the oil it sources from the Russian company.

Bloomberg reported that Nayara had sought help from the Indian government and was currently working with local banks, including the State Bank of India, to pay for its crude oil purchases in local currency, according to unnamed sources.

Nayara Energy accounts for some 8% of India’s total refining capacity. It operates a 400,000-bpd refinery in Vadinar, which is the second-largest in the country. The facility is 49% owned by Russia’s Rosneft. Currently, the Vadinar facility is operating at 75% of capacity, and the level is rising, one of the Bloomberg sources told the publication.

The European Union included Nayara Energy in its 18th sanction package against Russia, announced in July. The sanctions disrupted the refinery’s operations, stranding tankers carrying fuels produced at the refinery en route to their destinations and prompting cancellations of purchase orders for the facility. That’s despite the fact that Nayara Energy was not really exporting any fuels to the European Union. Its main market in Europe was the UK, which has not adopted special sanctions against the company.

Meanwhile, Saudi Aramco and Iraq’s state oil marketing company SOMO stopped selling crude oil to the Nayara Energy refinery following the approval of the EU’s 18th sanction package. As a result, the refinery has boosted its intake of Russian Urals.

Also as a result of the sanctions, Nayara Energy has increased its focus on the domestic market. The company supplies more than 6,500 fuel stations in India, per Bloomberg, and has started selling more to a fellow refiner, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Nayara Energy has started loading more crude into floating storage and using tankers under Western sanctions to export its fuels.

[TITLE]The Net Zero Consensus Is Breaking Down in Britain:
[TEXT]
Once upon a time the promise of Net Zero enjoyed such universal support that a Tory government signed the UK’s Net Zero pledge into law. Today, the Tories say they’d scrap it – while alarm bells are ringing as the costs of the policy become clearer.

In June 2019, Prime Minister Theresa May passed a law – with near unanimous parliamentary backing and pretty much no debate – committing the UK to achieve Net Zero by 2050.

She hailed the move as a “historic step” that would make the UK the first major economy in the world to set such a legally binding target.

“Now is the time to go further and faster,” she said – “for our children” – and it was framed as a moral issue, a moment to be on the right side of history.

And while everyone was patting themselves on the back, and as the lofty ambition was turned into legal text, the UK accelerated down a path that is only now being fully understood.

If Theresa May hadn’t signed the 2050 into law someone else would have, such was the consensus and such was the sense of inevitability whipped up in those heady pre-Covid, pre-War days.

And where has it taken us?

The UK has the highest cost of energy in the developed world – for households and businesses – and we’ve been putting wind farms faster than our energy infrastructure can handle them – leading to a situation where we – taxpayers, bill payers – will pay £1bn this year to wind farm operators to turn off those wind farms when it’s too windy.

We’ve put the cart before the horse

Vast sums are then spent on replacement gas power to keep the lights on. And that’s almost certainly imported gas, by the way, as we’ve rather gone off producing our own.

It’s a problem known as ‘curtailment’ – too much wind produces too much power and it would overwhelm the congested network and so they’re simply switched off.

The National Energy System Operator, which runs the grid, says the cost of this – the constraint cost – could surge to £8bn a year by 2030.

We’ve put the cart before the horse. Windfarms were the great visible manifestation of our Net Zero drive – but we haven’t built the pylons and cables to make them worthwhile – something that will take years and cost billions.

Related: New Quantum Breakthrough Could Lead to Super-Efficient Electronics

There’s no problem with ultimately attaining a state of Net Zero emissions; the problems lie in the law, the target date and the consequences of an ill-thought through rush.

High energy costs are forcing chemical, cement and manufacturing plants to close. Energy investment and associated manufacturing are heading for the US. The North Sea is viewed as an awkward relic rather than a natural asset and the combination of green levies, subsidies and taxes are making a mess of the entire system.

Conservatives repent

Today the Conservatives, the moral and political architects of the 2050 target, say they’d scrap their law. They’ve seen the light. The Institute of Economic Affairs says the Tories’ announcement is “the first step back to sanity” – pointing out that the Climate Change Act was “the biggest central planning mistake since the Soviet Union’s Five Year Economic Plans.”

Kemi Badenoch says “Climate change is real. But Labour’s laws tied us in red tape, loaded us with costs, and did nothing to cut global emissions. Previous Conservative governments tried to make Labour’s climate laws work – they don’t.”

She said that the Conservatives would make the North Sea the “cornerstone” of UK energy policy by ending a ban on new oil and gas exploration, and that as Prime Minister her priorities would be “growth, cheaper energy” and a renewed commitment to protecting the environment.

Even Labour, whose climate change secretary Ed Miliband is a full blown High Priest of Net Zero zealotry, is considering rowing back from some of its bolder commitments. That would certainly please the unions, who have been shouting at the deindustrialisation unleashed by the Net Zero sprint.

Miliband policies “a disaster”

Sharon Graham, boss of the Unite union, has called for Miliband to be sacked, labelling his Net Zero plan “a disaster” and accusing him of being “completely irresponsible” with the UK’s energy security and jobs in the oil and gas sector. And she’s right. Oil refineries are closing. Chemicals plants are closing. And the promised green jobs boom is felt more in consultancy and the civil service than in any factory.

Ahead of the Budget, the British Chambers of Commerce have called on the government to remove the windfall taxes imposed on oil and gas producers in the North Sea, saying the policy puts the UK at a “competitive disadvantage.”

Meanwhile, our energy demands are going to skyrocket – not least given all the hungry new data centres unveiled in recent weeks.

It seems when it comes to energy the best approach is to do everything, everywhere, but not all at once.

We need nuclear, and we’re getting more of it. We need the North Sea, but we’re ashamed of it. We need renewables – but only when the network can actually take the power and we shouldn’t be spending vast sums to subsidise biomass energy that burns wood from South America shipped to the UK and is somehow, supposedly, green. And we do need to look again at the law of the land – the feel-good commitment to be Net Zero by 2050.

The Tories and Reform have woken up to this. It seems many in Labour have, too, though it’s likely Ed Miliband will barricade himself in his office with hostages before recognising the political and economic reality that’s coming into focus.

Policies change. They evolve. They adapt to meet circumstances. They encounter problems and breakthroughs at unexpected moments. They do not always conform with political aspirations and timelines and badly-written law, and it seems that the penny is beginning to drop.

[TITLE]Oil Rises as Trump Warns Hamas:
[TEXT]
Oil climbed as US President Donald Trump warned Hamas of stark consequences if it doesn't agree to his plan to end the war in Gaza. The comments overshadowed an impending OPEC+ decision on crude supplies.

West Texas Intermediate futures rose 0.7% to settle near $61 a barrel, but were down 7.4% for the week. Trump set a Sunday evening deadline for Hamas to accept his proposal. The president earlier said Israel would have his "full backing" to destroy Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the US and EU, if it rejects the deal.

The approaching deadline is increasing concerns of a wider conflagration that could disrupt oil flows from the Middle East, the source of about one-third of the world's supplies. Any premium associated with the two-year conflict in Gaza had previously dissipated as the conflict failed to materially affect supplies.

Elsewhere, Ukraine claimed an attack on Russia's Orsk oil refinery near the border with Kazakhstan. Traders have honed in on Russian flows over recent weeks amid intensifying Ukrainian attacks on the country's energy infrastructure.

Still, those tailwinds weren't enough to shake prices out of their bearish stupor. Oil has declined four out of the past five sessions amid expectation OPEC+ will discuss fast-tracking supply hikes. Meanwhile, efforts by the Trump administration to keep oil exports flowing from northern Iraq, as well as a US government shutdown, have added to bearish sentiments.

The OPEC+ meeting comes as the oil market heads for a record surplus next year, according to the International Energy Agency. Traders have been closely watching China's buying, which has until now helped prevent a surfeit in a narrow set of hubs in the US Midwest and Northwest Europe.

"Looking back at the past four days' performance, it is tempting to conclude that the long-awaited glut expected to characterize the second half of the year is finally loudly knocking on the doors of our market," Tamas Varga, an analyst at brokerage PVM, wrote in a report.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries raised output by 400,000 barrels a day in September, formally completing the restart of 2.2 million barrels a day shuttered by the group and its partners in 2023, according to a Bloomberg survey.

[TITLE]Munich Airport temporarily shut after drones reported in latest sightings in EU airspace:
[TEXT]
By MATTHIAS SCHRADER

MUNICH (AP) — Authorities temporarily shut down Munich Airport overnight after several drones were seen in the area, in the latest mysterious drone overflights in the airspace of European Union member countries.

Germany’s air traffic control restricted flights at the airport shortly after 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Thursday and then halted them altogether, the airport said in a statement. Seventeen flights were unable to take off, affecting almost 3,000 passengers, while 15 arriving flights were diverted to three other airports in Germany and one in Vienna, Austria.

Flights in and out of the airport resumed at 5 a.m. (0300 GMT), said Stefan Bayer, a spokesperson for Germany’s federal police at Munich airport.

Authorities were not immediately able to provide any information

[TITLE]BlackRock's infrastructure play gets a boost as Minnesota approves buyout:

MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota regulators voted unanimously Friday to approve an investment group's takeover of a power company over the objections of the state attorney general, big industrial electricity buyers and consumer advocates.

In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers.

The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence.

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center in Minnesota Power’s territory in the northern part of the state, a lucrative prospect for the utility's owner.

Opponents also expressed fear that the sale would encourage more such deals across the U.S.

Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change under BlackRock and that the deal’s cost wouldn't affect electric rates.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five of the utility commissioners, sided with Allete and BlackRock.

The state Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power and the investors negotiated a package of modifications this summer that included additional financial and regulatory safeguards. The department's attorney, Richard Dornfeld, told the commission the changes will protect the public interest.

The commission's chair, Katie Sieben, agreed.

“Because of the collective work of partners, stakeholders, labor, environmental groups and others, we’ve made the overall package better for Minnesota Power customers,” Sieben said.

Opposing the deal were the state attorney general’s office and industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other iron mine owners, Enbridge-run oil pipelines, and pulp and paper mills.

Allete argued that BlackRock will have an easier time raising the money that Minnesota Power needs to comply with a state law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Previously, an administrative law judge recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence revealed the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with “a high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,” and “assumed the absolute worst in these investors.” But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest.

Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval.

“Private equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans," Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement. The national nonprofit says it seeks to bring transparency and accountability to the private equity industry.

[TITLE]State regulators approve sale of Allete:
[TEXT]
ST. PAUL — Minnesota regulators signed off on the final approval needed to sell Allete to a pair of private investment firms.

The five-member Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Friday voted unanimously to approve the sale of Minnesota Power’s Duluth-based parent company to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners.

ADVERTISEMENT

The $6.2 billion deal, announced in May 2024, drew concern over private equity’s ownership of a utility and the potential for rising electricity rates.

“We are grateful to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission for their thorough review and approval of this important and strategic partnership, and recognition that this is in the public interest,” Bethany Owen, chair, president and CEO of Allete, said in a news release following the decision.

“Today’s decision caps a comprehensive public process and positions ALLETE well to meet the significant infrastructure demands of the clean-energy transition without compromising the high-quality service and commitments to reliability and affordability that define our company,” Owen said.

Local Regulators should deny sale of Allete, judge recommends The non-binding opinion will inform the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on whether it should approve the sale this fall.

The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, a consumer advocacy group, several environmental groups and Minnesota Power’s largest industrial customers were opposed to the sale, and an administrative law judge in July recommended, in a nonbinding opinion, that the PUC reject the deal as it wasn’t in the public interest.

The role of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, came under particular scrutiny. Groups opposed to the deal feared Minnesota Power would favor deals that would benefit other BlackRock-owned companies at the expense of ratepayers.

But Commissioner Hwikwom Ham disagreed, arguing that the fiduciary responsibility of CPP and BlackRock-owned GIP would prevent that and that the PUC itself could protect ratepayers from this in future rate cases.

“The Commission’s confidence that they have the capacity, authority, and objectivity to regulate the likes of BlackRock — a financial behemoth that has tentacles in every part of the global economy — rings hollow, especially when they already oversee regular utility rate hikes that families struggle to afford,” said Maggie Schuppert, director of strategic intiatives for CURE, one of the environmental groups opposed to the deal.

“It will fall on community and ratepayer advocates, utility watchdogs, and the public itself to hold these entities and the PUC to account and mitigate the harms of this decision,” Schuppert said.

Meanwhile, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, unions, a different consumer advocacy group and several clean energy groups supported the deal.

Allen Gleckner, chief policy officer of clean energy group Fresh Energy, said the group lent its support for the sale of Minnesota Power when it decided the deal “would significantly mitigate risk to the transition to clean energy in Minnesota.”

“We applaud the Commission for remaining focused on the substance of the issues at hand and what’s in the public interest of Minnesotans,” Gleckner said.

Local State agency drops opposition to Allete purchase The Department of Commerce had previously expressed concern over the role of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, in the purchase of Minnesota Power’s parent company.

Allete, which has long been publicly traded on the stock market, has maintained that going private under the ownership of GIP and CPP would allow it to more quickly and reliably access the money needed to fund its transition away from coal and carbon emissions and reach Minnesota’s law requiring 100% of the state’s electricity to be carbon-free by 2040.

PUC Chair Katie Sieben said that while it “drove me nuts” to hear that the acquisition was needed to meet that law, she believed the PUC should approve the deal because investment was necessary to ensure reliability and affordability.

“Whether Minnesota Power is publicly traded or privately held, it needs to comply with the laws of the state of Minnesota, including the state's 2040 carbon-free law. … Minnesota Power does need massive amounts of investment,” Sieben said. “That's not due to the state's carbon-free law necessarily, but also due to the fact that many of the utilities' assets are at end of age and need investment.”

ADVERTISEMENT

She added that support from commissioners came at different stages of the process, as parties involved in the proceedings reached agreements that got “it over the net benefit threshold of what would be in the public interest.”

Throughout the nearly year and a half that the deal was in front of the PUC, and in particular the last few weeks, Allete, GIP and CPP have agreed to a series of commitments, including:

Pausing rate hikes for a year.

Reducing its return on equity from 9.78% to 9.65% after the deal closes and then capping future ROE at 9.78% through 2030 to limit rate increases over the next five years.

Paying $50 million, from CPP and GIP, to customers in the form of bill credits by 2032.

Considering alternatives to its recent plan to bring another 750 megawatts of new natural gas energy capacity online as it seeks to retire its last coal-fired units at the Boswell Energy Center in Cohasset.

Reconsidering the proposed Nemadji Trail Energy Center natural gas power plant in Superior.

Dedicating $50 million to fund new clean energy technologies.

Dedicating $10 million to fund energy efficiency upgrades for low-income customers.

Forgiving up to $3.5 million in unpaid bills and providing $20 monthly bill credits to qualifying low-income customers.

Some PUC members said Friday that they had originally been skeptical about the deal, and Commissioner Joseph Sullivan said he had been opposed to the deal as recently as the Sept. 25 oral arguments but ultimately supported the sale Friday.

Local Regulators weigh Allete sale The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission is expected to vote on whether Minnesota Power's parent company should be sold to a pair of private investment firms Oct. 3.

“I still do have concerns in the out years … I’m concerned about what happens in the future, 10-15 years from now,” Sullivan said. “But I do think that the benefits in the near term and medium term clearly outweigh the status quo and clearly show that the partners, the parties, are taking very serious their commitment to the state.”

He acknowledged the concerns residents of Northeastern Minnesota have about the deal and instructed Minnesota Power, GIP and CPP to build credibility with the public and customers.

“If you don’t build that credibility,” Sullivan said, “that will redound unfavorably to everybody.”

This story was updated at 2:40 p.m. Oct. 3 with details from Friday's meeting and reaction to the deal's approval. It was originally posted at 11:24 a.m. Oct. 3.

Allete argued that BlackRock will have an easier time raising the money that Minnesota Power needs to comply with a state law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Previously, an administrative law judge recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence revealed the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with “a high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,” and “assumed the absolute worst in these investors.” But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest.

Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval.

“Private equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans," Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement. The national nonprofit says it seeks to bring transparency and accountability to the private equity industry.
