[TITLE]Verb Technology Company (Nasdaq: VERB) Successfully Closes $558 Million Private Placement to Launch First Publicly Listed TON Treasury Strategy Company, in Partnership with Kingsway Capital:
[TEXT]
LAS VEGAS, Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verb Technology Company, Inc. (Nasdaq: VERB) (“the Company”), today announced the successful closing of its previously announced upsized and oversubscribed $558 million private placement (“PIPE transaction”), in partnership with Kingsway Capital (“Kingsway”). The completion of the PIPE transaction marks a critical milestone in the Company’s plans to become the first and largest publicly traded treasury reserve of Toncoin ($TON). $TON is the native cryptocurrency of TON blockchain, the blockchain integrated with Telegram, one of the world's most widely used messaging platforms.

The PIPE transaction, which priced approximately 58.7 million shares of common stock, included participation from over 110 institutional and crypto-native investors, led by Kingsway and anchored by Vy Capital, Blockchain.com, Ribbit Capital, and Graticule (GAMA). Additional investors include CMCC Global, Pantera, MEXC Ventures, ParaFi Capital, Luxor Capital, Arrington Capital, Animoca, Kraken, Primitive Ventures, BitGo, FalconX, Orbs Group, The Open Platform (TOP), TVM Ventures, Kenetic, Hivemind Capital, UNCAP, Pacific Coast Venture Partners, and several high-profile crypto founders like Guy Young, Founder of Ethena Labs.

“As the exclusive blockchain infrastructure powering Telegram’s Mini App ecosystem, we believe in the utility and potential growth in adoption of Toncoin,” said Manuel Stotz, incoming Executive Chairman. “With today’s completed placement and the backing of an exceptional list of investors, we are building a next-generation treasury platform to define a new category of digital asset reserves.”

Company Strategy

The Company plans to immediately begin using the majority of the net proceeds from the PIPE transaction to acquire $TON, which will serve as its primary treasury reserve asset. The strategy is expected to generate sustainable staking rewards to initiate, manage, and grow the Company’s $TON exposure in a cash flow positive manner. The Company intends to rebrand as TON Strategy Co. (“TSC”) to reflect its new direction. In addition, the Company will continue to operate its existing business units, each of which leverages its social commerce technology and video marketing expertise, which are expected to expand.

[TITLE]Software firm MeridianLink to go private in $2 billion deal with Centerbridge:
[TEXT]
U.S. financial software provider MeridianLink said on Monday it would be acquired by investment firm Centerbridge Partners in a $2 billion deal, taking it private roughly four years after its New York debut.

Optimism around potential rate cuts and easing economic uncertainty amid progress on trade deals have laid the groundwork for a pickup in private-equity buyouts. Dealmaking appetite for software businesses has also remained robust this year.

MeridianLink shareholders will receive $20 apiece in cash for each share held, implying a 26 per cent premium to the stock's last close. Shares of the Irvine, California-based company, which powers digital lending and account opening for financial institutions, jumped 24 per cent in afternoon trading.

"Industry consolidation has been a key theme in fintech and we view the multiple as reasonable," said William Blair analyst Cristopher Kennedy.

"We have long held the belief that MerdianLink would represent an attractive asset as the company generates strong EBITDA margins at around 40 per cent."

The deal also highlights the growing trend of money managers seeking strategic control of technology companies driving digital transformation in financial services.

Centerbridge is also not new to the fintech space, having acquired bank tech firm CSI in a $1.6 billion deal in 2022.

"As the pace of change across the finance and tech sectors continues to accelerate, MeridianLink is uniquely positioned to help financial institutions enhance their digital lending and credit reporting capabilities," said Centerbridge's Jared Hendricks and Ben Jaffe.

Founded in 1998, MeridianLink caters to nearly 2,000 community financial institutions and reporting agencies. Its revenue rose 8 per cent to $84.6 million during the three months ended June 30, while net loss narrowed to $3 million.

Centerview Partners and J.P. Morgan are advisers to MeridianLink on the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Goldman Sachs is advising Centerbridge.

[TITLE]Norway’s wealth fund cuts ties with Israeli firms over Gaza concerns:
[TEXT]
Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has sold its shares in 11 Israeli companies, citing the “serious humanitarian crisis” in Gaza as the reason for the move, reports The Associated Press.

The announcement was made Monday by Norges Bank Investment Management, which oversees the fund known globally as the Oil Fund.

The fund, which channels Norway’s oil and gas revenues into global investments, confirmed that as of the end of the first half of 2025, it held stakes in 61 Israeli companies. Last week, it decided to divest from 11 firms that fall outside the Norwegian Finance Ministry’s equity benchmark index. The sales were finalized over the past few days.

The fund did not disclose the names of the affected companies.

In addition to the divestment, the Oil Fund is terminating contracts with external managers operating in Israel and will bring all Israeli investments under direct management.

“These measures were taken in response to extraordinary circumstances. The situation in Gaza is a serious humanitarian crisis,” said Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, as quoted by AP. “We are invested in companies that operate in a country at war, and conditions in the West Bank and Gaza have recently worsened. In response, we will further strengthen our due diligence.”

Tangen added that the restructuring “will simplify the management of our investments in this market” and reduce the number of companies monitored by the fund’s ethics council.

The fund’s management also revealed that it began intensifying scrutiny of Israeli investments last fall, resulting in the sale of shares in “several” companies.

Monday’s announcement comes several days after Norway's Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg confirmed that the country's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund will make adjustments to its handling of Israeli investments.

The review was prompted by reports indicating that the fund had invested in Bet Shemesh Engines Ltd., an Israeli jet engine company that provides maintenance services to Israel's armed forces, including its fighter jets.

Despite calls from some parliamentarians, Norway’s legislature voted in June against a proposal to divest from all companies operating in what it refers to as “occupied Palestinian territories.”

The fund, guided by ethical principles set by the Norwegian parliament, has already blacklisted 11 companies for assisting Israel's "occupation," most recently Israeli petrol station chain Paz and Israeli telecommunications company Bezeq .

Norway, together with Ireland and Spain announced last May that they intended to recognize the “State of Palestine”.

[TITLE]Simba's acquisition of M1 may drive down mobile plan prices, analysts say:
[TEXT]
SINGAPORE: Mobile plan prices in Singapore could fall following Simba Telecoms’ proposed acquisition of M1 Limited, as rival telcos adapt to the company’s disruptive pricing strategy, analysts said.

Known for its affordable mobile plans with large data bundles, Simba is expected to push the local telco industry into a new phase of competition, especially as it leverages M1’s nationwide infrastructure to strengthen its own network coverage.

On Monday (Aug 11), asset manager Keppel announced plans to sell M1 to Simba, with the transaction expected to be completed within months, pending approval from the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).

"For retail customers, this acquisition is good news because Simba is known for its low-cost, high-data mobile offerings," said Ms Shirley Tee, deputy director for industry and innovation at Nanyang Polytechnic's School of Business Management.

"This will likely pressure other telcos to either lower their prices or improve their own service bundles to remain competitive."

She added that the new entity could introduce novel billing approaches such as usage-based pricing or AI-personalised plans.

Enterprise customers, such as large firms and organisations, may also benefit from more competitive pricing and attractive bundled offerings across mobile, broadband and information and communication technology (ICT) services, Ms Tee said.

Professor Lawrence Loh from the National University of Singapore Business School said the move signals growing consolidation in the telecoms sector.

“Disruptive pricing plans and agile asset-light strategies may be the way forward for market players to survive and thrive,” he said.

He noted the development mirrors global trends where legacy providers are challenged by digital-first entrants.

Tech industry observer Oo Gin Lee said bills may fall if Simba extends its “no frills, cheap access services” to M1's customer base. A tiered system could also be introduced, offering premium services to legacy M1 customers while retaining Simba’s low-cost model for existing users.

Still, Ms Tee cautioned that fewer players in the market could eventually reduce pricing diversity if not properly regulated.

BETTER CONNECTIVITY AND CAPACITY

The acquisition would allow Simba to tap M1’s physical infrastructure – such as base stations and cell towers – to strengthen signal strength islandwide.

Founded in 1994, M1 has an advanced telecommunications network. Simba, the youngest of Singapore’s four fully licensed mobile network operators, holds full 4G and 5G spectrum rights.

Prof Loh said the combined strengths of both entities would enhance customer offerings.

“M1 has the technology advantage with its advanced network while Simba has emerged as an innovative consumer service provider,” he said.

“The transfer will allow the M1 to scale in a focused way in the telecoms industry.”

Mr Oo added that while it is unclear if spectrum rights are part of the deal, Simba is likely to gain from M1’s existing physical infrastructure, such as base stations and cell towers, to improve its signal strength.

Thompson’s pivot could revolutionize global internet access

Former NBA champion trades basketball for stratospheric connectivity mission targeting 3 billion unconnected people

Picture an NBA champion deciding that connecting billions of people to the internet matters more than chasing another championship ring. That’s exactly what happened when Tristan Thompson announced his groundbreaking new role as World Mobile’s first Chief Digital Equity Officer, launching a mission that could make his basketball achievements look small compared to bridging the global digital divide.

Thompson’s transition from professional basketball to telecommunications pioneer represents one of the most unexpected career pivots in recent sports history. While other retired athletes chase broadcasting gigs or coaching opportunities, Thompson is literally reaching for the stratosphere with hydrogen-powered aircraft designed to bring internet access to the 3 billion people who still live without reliable connectivity.

This isn’t just another celebrity endorsement or token corporate role. Thompson’s appointment signals a fundamental shift in how athletes view their post-competition impact, choosing to tackle systemic global problems rather than simply capitalizing on their fame. Sometimes the most important victories happen far away from basketball courts.

Digital divide mission targeting unexpected locations

Thompson’s awareness campaign reveals connectivity gaps in places most people never imagine, including affluent areas like Hidden Hills in Los Angeles and pockets of inner-city Cleveland. This strategic focus on hidden infrastructure problems challenges assumptions
