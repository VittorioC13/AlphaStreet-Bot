Asia-Pacific markets slid Friday, tracking losses on Wall Street, as technology stocks continued to come under pressure and Fed rate-cut doubts swirled. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.77% to close at 50,376.53, while the Topix slid 0.65% to end the trading day at 3,359.81. Japanese giant SoftBank plunged nearly 9% in early trading, marking its third consecutive day of decline after it said Tuesday it had sold its entire stake in Nvidia . Shares of the conglomerate closed 6.57% lower. South Korea's Kospi fell 3.81% to 4,011.57, and the small-cap Kosdaq was 2.23% lower at 897.9. Index heavyweight Samsung Electronics slipped more than 3%, while SK Hynix , which supplies memory chips to Nvidia, fell 5%. The South Korean strengthened 0.72% to 1,460.0 against the after the finance minister said Friday that the country's FX authorities will consult major market players, including the national pension fund and key exporters, on ways to stabilize the won, Reuters reported.

According to the report, Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol told senior economic officials that steps were needed to tackle the structural mismatch in U.S. dollar supply and demand, amid growing concerns over currency market volatility. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 1.36% to 8,634.5. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 1.79%, while mainland's CSI 300 dipped 1.57% to 4,628.14 after government data Friday showed China's slowdown worsened in October, dragged by soft consumer demand and a deepening property downturn. Fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, contracted 1.7% for the first ten months of the year, steepening from a 0.5% decline in the January-to-September period. Industrial output expanded 4.9% year on year in October, missing expectations for a 5.5% jump and slowing down from a 6.5% rise in the prior month. Retail sales climbed 2.9% in October from a year earlier, topping expectations for a 2.8% growth in a Reuters poll, but softening from a 3% year-on-year rise in September. The Chinese onshore yuan rose to a one-year high of 7.0908 against the dollar, data from LSEG showed.

[TITLE]Tencent’s $280 Billion Rally May Extend as Games Boost Earnings:
[TEXT]
As fears grow over concentration in technology stocks amid a possible bubble in the artificial intelligence trade, investors are piling into Tencent Holdings Ltd. shares as a safer bet.

The company is expected to be one of the few China tech megacaps reporting positive profit growth in upcoming results, as bruising price wars drag down peers’ earnings. A strong showing in its online games business could help extend the rally that has added around $280 billion to Tencent’s market value this year.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The stock is up 4.5% this month reflecting that optimism, while rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. have fallen in Hong Kong. Bears have retreated on Tencent since earlier this year, with short interest at less than 0.1% of its free float, S&P Global data show.

“Tencent offers very defensive growth in this kind of environment because they have less competition,” and the stock is cheap, said Elinor Leung, managing director of Asia telecom & internet research at CLSA Ltd. She rates Tencent as her top pick.

The shares have surged 58% this year, but still trade at a substantial discount to global tech peers including Amazon.com Inc. and Nintendo Co. on earnings-based multiples.

Alibaba has seen larger stock gains as it grabbed bigger headlines on the AI front, but Tencent has been making progress with its Hunyuan model. It’s also utilizing generative technology in game creation and other areas of its business empire, while embedding AI features in long-running titles including .

Games based on such unique intellectual property draw strong player loyalty that boost price resiliency, in marked contrast to the steep discounting being employed by Chinese online food-delivery firms and electric-vehicle makers to attract customers.

Investors are less skeptical on the subsector as a result. Tencent, along with its music unit and game peer NetEase Inc., have the lowest level of short bets relative to their free floats on the Hang Seng Tech Index, according to S&P Global data.

In its report for the September-ended quarter due later Thursday, Tencent is expected to post earnings growth of 5% versus the previous year. That compares with declines of more than 60% estimated for peers like Alibaba and JD.com that are taking bigger hits from competition, tariffs and China’s economic slowdown. Meituan is seen falling to a loss.

[TITLE]CNBC's The China Connection newsletter: Xpeng attempts a global transformation:
[TEXT]
This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

The big story

Cultural shifts are subtle yet fundamental for any company aiming to succeed beyond its home market. When I visited Chinese electric car company Xpeng 's new headquarters in Guangzhou last week, what stood out wasn't just how shiny it was compared to the building I'd visited last year, but the fluency of its global mindset, down to the small details like accurate English translations in signs and presentations. It went beyond the cursory "innovation" banners often seen in China. Leaders of Xpeng's autonomous driving, robotics and flying car units each delivered 40-minute presentations entirely in English — including their decks — without any translation device. In conversation with reporters, Xpeng founder and CEO He Xiaopeng even declared a ten-year goal to generate half of the company's sales from outside China. He has reason to be upbeat. Xpeng notched 12 straight months of more than 30,000 deliveries each, and exported a small but growing number of cars: 29,000 in just three quarters. That was more than double what Xpeng shipped from a year earlier.

Xpeng's global ambitions reflect a broader trend across China. In the last year or so, overseas expansion has become a top priority for nearly every Chinese company — an eagerness that Joe Ngai, chairman of McKinsey Greater China, said he's never seen. "It's astonishing what this phenomenon is," he said, noting that fierce competition in China is driving local companies to seek higher profit margins abroad. But he cautioned it won't be easy, and that local partnerships would be important. Overseas markets only accounted for 8% of total revenue for the 50 largest Chinese companies as of 2021, according to McKinsey. That is far below 31% in overseas revenue for the largest U.S. companies, the data showed.

[TITLE]Japan’s Nikkei 225 falls 3% as Asia markets track Wall Street's tech-led decline:
[TEXT]
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 3.22% to 48,702.98, while the Topix declined 2.88% to 3,251.1. South Korea's Kospi was down 3.32% to 3,953.62, while the small-cap Kosdaq dropped 2.66% to 878.7.

Asia-Pacific markets fell Tuesday, led by declines in Japan and South Korean benchmark indexes, following a tech-led slide on Wall Street.

Yields on Japan's 20-year government bonds rose almost 4 basis points to 2.78%, the highest since July 1999, data from LSEG showed. Yields on the 10-year government bond rose around 2 basis points to 1.751%.

Overnight in the U.S., stocks pulled back, plagued once again by declines in tech, as Wall Street awaited key releases this week, including Nvidia earnings and the September jobs report.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 557.24 points, or 1.18%, to close at 46,590.24, as losses in the artificial intelligence chip darling, along with Salesforce and Apple, pushed the blue-chip index lower. The S&P 500 sank 0.92% to end the day at 6,672.41, while the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 0.84% to settle at 22,708.07.

Nvidia dropped almost 2% ahead of the company's third-quarter results, which are scheduled for after the bell on Wednesday. The chipmaker and other names in the AI trade were under pressure recently as investors grew anxious about stretched valuations. Blue Owl Capital, a private credit lender, shed nearly 6% amid concerns about its heavy lending tied to the AI data center buildout.

[TITLE]Stocks stutter with focus on Fed, tech after US reopen vote:
[TEXT]

Asian markets trod water Thursday as euphoria over the end of a record US government shutdown petered, with focus back on Federal Reserve interest rates and tech bubble worries.

Lawmakers in Washington voted Wednesday night to send Donald Trump legislation to end the 43-day stoppage that shuttered key services and suspended the release of data crucial to gauging the state of the world’s top economy.

However, even with the US president expected to sign the bill, the mood on trading floors was less upbeat than earlier in the week, when a deal was announced.

Investors will now be able to get a long-awaited glimpse of the reports that have been held up by the closure, particularly the Fed as it decides whether or not to meet expectations and cut rates next month.

Even then, the White House said figures on jobs and consumer prices for October were not likely to be released as statistics agencies were unable to collect the necessary data.

“Reopening also doesn’t mean an instant snap-back to normal for the real economy. When you starve a system of staffing and pay for six weeks, the backlog doesn’t vanish just because a bill passed at 8 pm,” wrote Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.

“The shutdown ends with a vote and a signature; the aftershocks show up in queues, call centres and cash-flow stress far away from the Capitol dome.”

Meanwhile, concerns continue to mount that this year’s AI-led market rally may have pushed valuations too high and led to a bubble in the tech sector that could burst at any time.

Some have warned that the hundreds of billions invested in artificial intelligence has been overdone and the return could take time to come through.

Observers suggested that the recent tepid performance in several high-flying firms may be a sign of that, with the Nasdaq dropping for two days.

The S&P 500 has also struggled of late, though the Dow on Wednesday ended at a record amid speculation that traders are shifting from tech into industrials.

The mixed showing on Wall Street was reflected in Asia, where Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Manila and Wellington fell.

Tokyo edged up while Jakarta and Shanghai were flat.

Oil prices extended losses after plunging around four percent Wednesday after OPEC’s monthly crude market report forecast an oversupply in the third quarter.

That came just a month after it had predicted a deficit in the period.

The commodity has come under pressure of late amid easing tensions in the Middle East and increasing output by OPEC and other key producers.

And the International Energy Agency earlier this year estimated a record surplus in 2026.

Attention is also on Tokyo after Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said Wednesday the government was keeping an eye on currency markets as the yen continued to weaken.

She told parliament that “the government is watching for any excessive and disorderly moves with a high sense of urgency”.

Since her remarks, the unit has weakened further to around 155 per dollar, prompting speculation that authorities could step in to provide support.

The currency has come under pressure following dovish comments from Japan’s central bank that tempered best on another interest rate hike and as the US moved towards reopening its government.
