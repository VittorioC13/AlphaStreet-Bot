[TITLE]Software firm MeridianLink to go private in $2 billion deal with Centerbridge:
[TEXT]
U.S. financial software provider MeridianLink said on Monday it would be acquired by investment firm Centerbridge Partners in a $2 billion deal, taking it private roughly four years after its New York debut.

Optimism around potential rate cuts and easing economic uncertainty amid progress on trade deals have laid the groundwork for a pickup in private-equity buyouts. Dealmaking appetite for software businesses has also remained robust this year.

MeridianLink shareholders will receive $20 apiece in cash for each share held, implying a 26 per cent premium to the stock's last close. Shares of the Irvine, California-based company, which powers digital lending and account opening for financial institutions, jumped 24 per cent in afternoon trading.

"Industry consolidation has been a key theme in fintech and we view the multiple as reasonable," said William Blair analyst Cristopher Kennedy.

"We have long held the belief that MerdianLink would represent an attractive asset as the company generates strong EBITDA margins at around 40 per cent."

The deal also highlights the growing trend of money managers seeking strategic control of technology companies driving digital transformation in financial services.

Centerbridge is also not new to the fintech space, having acquired bank tech firm CSI in a $1.6 billion deal in 2022.

"As the pace of change across the finance and tech sectors continues to accelerate, MeridianLink is uniquely positioned to help financial institutions enhance their digital lending and credit reporting capabilities," said Centerbridge's Jared Hendricks and Ben Jaffe.

Founded in 1998, MeridianLink caters to nearly 2,000 community financial institutions and reporting agencies. Its revenue rose 8 per cent to $84.6 million during the three months ended June 30, while net loss narrowed to $3 million.

Centerview Partners and J.P. Morgan are advisers to MeridianLink on the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Goldman Sachs is advising Centerbridge.

Trump launches 'Manhattan Project' as one of America's largest companies set to be nationalized

Posted on by DFG

The Trump administration has launched their own 'Manhattan Project' as reports have suggested one of America's largest chipmakers could be partly nationalized.

Intel, the largest chip fabricator in the US, has been in talks with Donald Trump over a potential government stake in the company.

While the percentage stake the government is asking for has not been made public, nationalizing a company is typically reserved for national emergencies.

The government nationalized a number of banks after the 2008 financial crisis and key logistics companies during World War II.

It comes amid concerns that America relies too heavily on TSCM, a chip manufacturer in Taiwan. China has repeatedly threatened to invade the island nation.

If China were to invade, it would throttle America's ability to compete in the booming chipmaking industry that is being driven by artificial intelligence arms race.

'This feels like the Manhattan Project - or the run-up to World War II,' MIT AI computer scientist Dave Blundin said on a podcast with MIT engineer Peter Diamandis.

'It's every bit as important as the space race was, as the nuclear arms race was. Actually, it's more important.'

American companies like Nvidia and AMD design AI chips but they are fabricated in Taiwan. Intel is unique as the only major US company that both designs and fabricates its own chips.

Intel's advanced abilities to manufacture semiconductors would allow the US to give up its reliance on foreign fabrication plants (fabs), especially in Taiwan which controls more than 60 percent of the market, in order to power artificial intelligence, defense and the economy.

The talks remain ongoing and finer details continue to be made clear, but the idea would be that the US government would pay for the stake in the company, one person close to the matter told Bloomberg.

Often gives you the worst of both worlds. Why not let nVidia supplant Intel, or let Intel recede into server chips and legacy machinery. Motorola and IBM receded from being big chip players.

It feels like we’re selling out our tech advantage for a quick buck — about $2 billion from Nvidia’s $15 billion and AMD’s $800 million in sales. These chips will help China build smarter weapons and surveillance systems, which directly compromises America’s security. This is a true national security problem, a dangerous move. We’re treating critical technology like a bargaining chip when we should be protecting our lead in AI. This deal really needs to be stopped.

Why are we helping China’s CCP ? Communism must be fought, not nourished.

[TITLE]Trump warned by top Senate Democrats to rethink advanced AI chip sales to China:
[TEXT]
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, right, speaks alongside President Donald Trump about investing in America, at the White House in Washington, on April 30, 2025.

Six Senate Democrats on Friday released an open letter asking President Donald Trump to reconsider his decision to allow tech giants Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell AI semiconductor chips to China in exchange for 15% of revenue from the sales.

The letter — signed by Senators Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Jack Reed, D-R.I.; Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Christopher Coons, D-Del.; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. — was in response to an Aug. 11 announcement by Trump that Nvidia and AMD would pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses.

"Our national security and military readiness relies upon American innovators inventing and producing the best technology in the world, and in maintaining that qualitative advantage in sensitive domains. The United States has historically been successful in maintaining and building that advantage because of, in part, our ability to deny adversaries access to those technologies," the letter states.

"The willingness displayed in this arrangement to 'negotiate' away America's competitive edge that is key to our national security in exchange for what is, in effect, a commission on a sale of AI-enabling technology to our main global competitor, is cause for serious alarm," the letter continues.

Senators also warned that selling advanced AI chips — specifically Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips — to China could help strengthen its military systems, a claim that Nvidia denies.

In a statement to CNBC, a Nvidia spokesperson said: "The H20 would not enhance anyone's military capabilities, but would have helped America attract the support of developers worldwide and win the AI race. Banning the H20 cost American taxpayers billions of dollars, without any benefit."

A request for comment on the letter from AMD was not immediately returned.

[TITLE]Nvidia and AMD’s ‘special treatment’ shakes up the global chip supply chain:
[TEXT]
Donald Trump’s decision to let Nvidia and AMD export AI processors to China in exchange for a cut of their sales will have repercussions far beyond the U.S.

The semiconductor supply chain is global, involving a wide array of non-U.S. companies, often based in countries that are U.S. allies. Nvidia’s chips may be designed and sold by a U.S. company, but they’re manufactured by Taiwan’s TSMC, using chipmaking tools from companies like ASML, which is based in the Netherlands, and Japan’s Tokyo Election, and using components from suppliers like South Korea’s SK Hynix.

The U.S. leaned on these global companies for years to try to limit their engagement with China; these efforts picked up after the passage of the CHIPS Act and the expansion of U.S. chip-export controls in 2022. Washington has also pressured major transshipment hubs, like Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, to more closely monitor chip shipments to ensure that controlled chips don’t make their way to China in violation of U.S. law.

Within the U.S., discussion of Trump’s Nvidia deal has focused on what it means for China’s government’s and Chinese companies’ ability to get their hands on cutting-edge U.S. technology. But several other countries and companies are likely studying the deal closely to see if they might get an opening to sell to China as well.

Trump’s Nvidia deal “tells you that [U.S.] national security is not really the issue, or has never been the issue” with export controls, says Mario Morales, who leads market research firm IDC’s work on semiconductors. Companies and countries will “probably have to revisit what their strategy has been, and in some cases, they’re going to break away from the U.S. administration’s policies.”

“If Nvidia and AMD are given special treatment because they’ve ‘paid to play’, why shouldn’t other companies be doing the same?” he adds.

Getting allies on their side

The Biden administration spent a lot of diplomatic energy to get its allies to agree to limit their semiconductor exports to China. First, Washington said that manufacturers like TSMC and Intel that wanted to tap billions in subsidies could not expand advanced chip production in China. Then, the U.S. pushed for its allies to impose their own sanctions on exports to China.

“Export controls and other sanctions efforts are necessarily multilateral, yet are fraught with collective action problems,” says Jennifer Lind, an associate professor at Dartmouth College and international relations expert. “Other countries are often deeply unenthusiastic about telling their firms—which are positioned to bring in a lot of revenue, which they use for future innovation—that they cannot export to Country X or Country Y.”

This translates to “refusing to participate in export controls or to devoting little or no effort to ensuring that their firms are adhering to the controls,” she says.

Paul Triolo, a partner at the DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, points out that “Japanese and Dutch officials during the Biden administration resisted any serious alignment with U.S. controls,” and suggests that U.S allies “will be glad to see a major stepping back from controls.”

Ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and its trading partners could weaken export controls further.

Chinese officials may demand a rollback of chip sanctions as part of a grand bargain between Washington and Beijing, similar to how the U.S. agreed to grant export licenses to Nvidia and AMD in exchange for China loosening its controls on rare earth magnets.

Japan and South Korea may also bring up the chip controls as part of their own trade negotiations with Trump.

‘Expect continuing diversions’

A separate issue are controls over the transfer of Nvidia GPUs. The U.S. has leaned on governments like Singapore, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates to prevent advanced Nvidia processors from making their way to China.

Scrutiny picked up in the wake of DeepSeek’s surprise AI release earlier this year, amid allegations that the Hangzhou-based startup had trained its powerful models on Nvidia processors that were subject to export controls. (The startup claims that it acquired its processors before export controls came into effect).

As of now, the two chips allowed to be sold in China–Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308–are not the most powerful AI chips on the market. The leading-edge processors, like Nvidia’s Blackwell chip, cannot be sold to China.

That means chip smuggling will continue to be a concern for the U.S. government. Yet “enforcement will be spotty,” Triolo says. “The Commerce Department lacks resources to track GPUs globally, hence expect continuing diversions of limited amounts of GPUs to China via Thailand, Malaysia, and other jurisdictions.”

Triolo is, instead, focused on another loophole in the export control regime: Chinese firms accessing AI chips based in overseas data centers. “There is no sign that the Trump Commerce Department is gearing up to try and close this gaping loophole in U.S. efforts to limit Chinese access to advanced compute,” he says.

How much will the global supply chain change?

Not all analysts think we’ll see a complete unraveling of the export control regime.

“The controls involve a complex multinational coalition that all parties will be hesitant to disrupt, given how uncertain the results will be,” says Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology. He adds that many of these chipmakers and suppliers don’t have the same political heft as Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company.

Yet while these companies may not be as politically savvy as Nvidia, they’re just as important. TSMC, for example, is the only company that can manufacture the newest generation of advanced chips; ASML is the only supplier of the extreme ultraviolet lithography machines used to make the smallest semiconductors.

“I don’t believe it’s leverage that the Trump administration will easily give away,” says Ray Wang, a semiconductor researcher at the Futurum Group.

[TITLE]A Trump Intel stake could make national security the new ‘too big to fail’:
[TEXT]
US President Donald Trump is preparing to direct the government to take a direct stake in Intel , according to multiple media reports, as the White House continues to extend its influence into corporate America citing national security concerns.

Intel, once one of the world’s most important chip makers and a vital part of the U.S. tech landscape, has struggled to match the pace of growth from Asia-based rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. It has been eclipsed in the race to develop artificial intelligence chips by domestic players Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.

That has left the U.S. reliant on foreign tech supply chains, a shift that both the president and former President Joe Biden have deemed a threat to national security.

However, while the Biden administration looked to address those concerns through the CHIPS and Science Act, which earmarked $53 billion in support for the semiconductor sector, the Trump administration looks set to take a more direct route. According to the Wall Street Journal, how the government could take a stake in Intel is now being hashed out.

Intel declined to comment to Barron’s. White House spokesman Kush Desai said reports of deals not announced by the administration should be regarded as speculation.

“It’s tricky to think about how this could work, and it is unprecedented in terms of the marriage of politics and private enterprise" said Paul Argenti, professor of management and corporate communication at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, during an interview with CNBC on Friday.

“Semiconductors are a really strategic asset, there’s no question about that," he added. “But government as a shareholder brings real governance risks."

In fact, the president is taking a new tack when it comes to U.S. industrial policy. He has made deals tied to the China-based sales of Nvidia and AMD and taken a so-called golden share in the $14 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan’s Nippon Steel. The Defense Department is taking a $400 million stake in the rare-earth metals producer MP Materials.

An Intel stake, if such a deal happens, would be different. The closest parallel is to the government’s broader effort to bail out Wall Street during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, which involved the U.S. taking a large stake in the insurer American International Group. Deeming AIG “too big to fail," the government provided it with loans and equity in the region of $182 billion, exiting the group with a $23 billion profit in 2012.

Intel is like AIG in that it is critical to an important element of the U.S. economy, the tech sector, as the largest American company that both designs and manufactures its own chips. Although it lost around $2.9 billion last quarter, it still carries an investment-grade credit rating and has a market value of more than $100 billion.

Its plans to build a $30 billion factory hub in northern Ohio, however, have been replete with delays. The hub isn’t likely to be up and running until early next decade.

While Intel isn’t close to failing, its role in the tech sector and potential for it to be a player in AI means it is important for it to succeed.

“Winning the AI Race is nonnegotiable," Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late last month. “America must continue to be the dominant force in artificial intelligence to promote prosperity and protect our economic and national security."

Earlier this year, Trump administration officials looked into a possible deal that would have allowed Taiwan Semi to operate Intel’s foundry business as part of a joint ownership structure. The Wall Street Journal reported, however, that the president wasn’t sold on the idea of foreign control of a business seen as critical to national security.

A government stake in Intel would give lenders to the company the reassurance of the nation’s ironclad credit rating as a backstop, likely removing any concerns about access to capital for its Ohio project. But it could also leave Intel vulnerable to dictates from the White House as it attempts to define its strategy under new CEO Lip Bu-Tan.

“Intel is simultaneously dealing with tough competition, a lack of an AI pipeline, and a capex-intensive manufacturing business that continues to generate heavy losses and which remains well-behind industry leader TSMC that is rapidly building a U.S. presence," said Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya in a recent client note.

That level of complexity makes the government’s decision to get involved directly even more challenging, particularly in a sector that is undergoing rapid change.

Government stakes in key industries aren’t always profitable, either. The AIG investment ultimately paid off, but taxpayers lost around $10 billion from the rescues of Ford Motor, General Motors, and Ally Financial at around the same time.

They also haven’t seen a dime of profit from the U.S.’s five decades of support for the passenger railroad Amtrak.

“Picking winners in real time carries major risks," said Argenti of Dartmouth College. “If Intel delivers, this is going to look like a genius, visionary move. If not, it becomes a very expensive lesson in government overreach, which I think is potentially what we’re looking at here."

While India is yet to make significant headway in setting up advanced semiconductor fabs , its broader chip-making ambitions are beginning to take shape with a sharp strategic focus on mature-node manufacturing.Targeting the 28nm-65nm range, India aims to cater to the growing demand in sectors such as automotive, telecom, and industrial electronics.In a detailed analysis, Bastion Research observed that, unlike the global race for cutting-edge nodes, India is positioning itself to fill a critical gap in the global supply chain by producing essential, widely used chips."Though today there is not much to share as far as India's progress in establishing semicinductor fab is concerned, one thing is clear, India's semiconductor ambitions are taking shape with a strategic focus on mature-node manufacturing, a smart move considering the vast demand for 28nm-65nm chips in sectors like automotive, telecom, industrial electronics, etc. While global giants dominate the cutting-edge node space, India is wisely positioning itself to manufacture mature nodes and filling a big gap," the report added.The observation points out that India's semiconductor ambition today is quite similar to where Taiwan and South Korea were in the 1970s-1990s.The observation highlights that India's role in system integration within the semiconductor value chain is rapidly evolving, positioning the country at the forefront of global capabilities.With a deep pool of talent and a robust ecosystem, India excels in integrating semiconductor components into high-tech systems for sectors like automotive electronics, telecommunications, consumer devices, and medical technologies.India is already delivering world-class, high-quality integration services. What sets India apart is its ability to match global standards, both in capability and talent, and its swift progression towards scaling these operations to meet the growing demand for advanced semiconductor-based solutions, the report added.The observation highlighted that India is well poised to capture a larger share of the global market, as the China +1 strategy has become a powerful global trend, which is pushing companies to diversify their supply chains and look for alternatives to China."China +1 strategy has become a powerful global trend, pushing companies to diversify their supply chains and look for alternatives to China. This has fueled India's growth in system integration, as the country is increasingly seen as a reliable and cost-effective partner in the global supply chain," the analysis stated.In 2021, the Indian government launched the Semicon India Programme (also referred to as Indian Semiconductor Mission (ISM) 1.0) with Rs 76,000 Crore in incentives to attract global manufacturers, build fabs, packaging units (OSAT & ATMP, discussed later in detail), and a local supply chain to reduce reliance on imports. The initial focus is on mature-node fabs (28nm to 65nm), not bleeding-edge nodes like 5nm or 3nm, which are dominated by TSMC and Samsung.Earlier this month, the Centre cleared four new semiconductor manufacturing projects with a total investment of Rs 4,600 crore under the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM). These semiconductor units will be set up in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Punjab.The approvals take the total India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) portfolio to 10 projects across six states with cumulative investments of Rs 1.6 lakh crore.Addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that made-in-India semiconductor chips will be available in the market by the end of this year, marking a major milestone in India's technological journey.India has already approved the construction of six semiconductor plants.In May, the Union Cabinet approved India's sixth semiconductor manufacturing unit in Jewar in western Uttar Pradesh . It will be established near Jewar Airport through a joint venture between the HCL Group and Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn.Among the five semiconductor plants, four are in Gujarat: Tata Electronics-PSMC Semiconductor fab, CG Power-Renesas-Stars Microelectronics ATMP unit, Micron Technology's ATMP unit, and Kaynes Semicon ATMP unit, while the Tata Semiconductor Assembly and Test (TSAT) Unit is in Assam.

[TITLE]AI boom in Australia: Amazon investment sparks debate on artificial intelligence and housing shortage – Jason Murphy:
[TEXT]
But what do we actually get for the money? Just data centres.

If I was making a list of things Australia should be doing with concrete and air-conditioning, it would not include making data centres. What we need desperately, what we are horribly short of, is homes.

House prices are zooming up, and not just from speculation.

We’ve had huge inflation in the cost of building. Building a house from scratch costs around A$500,000, depending on its size and location. Maybe as much as a million bucks. And the inflation data tell us that price is up 39% compared with 2020.

Even renovation costs a bomb. Chucking a renovation on a small old home is now an A$500,000+ activity.

Jeff Bezos' Amazon wants to build data centres in Australia. Photo / Getty Images

Why is building houses expensive? For a lot of reasons.

One is the tradie shortage. Prices for getting the plumbing and wiring and framework of a house all put in are up sharply. Concrete slabs cost a fortune now.

When it comes to these data centres, Amazon is supplying the capital, the money, which is nice. But money is not something Australia is super short of.

We have trillions in the national superannuation fund that’s just plonked in the sharemarket. (In fact, we have more super funds than the whole sharemarket is worth, so we now have to invest in other countries’ sharemarkets too.)

What we are short of is skilled people. Unemployment is at a historically low 4.3% right now. Unemployment among trades workers (people whose last job was in the trades) is
