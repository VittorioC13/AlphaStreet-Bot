This week some New York City teachers are taking advantage of their union’s latest perk: training offered in partnership with tech giants on how artificial intelligence can help them with their jobs.

Over the summer, the American Federation of Teachers announced it would partner with Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic to create the National Academy for AI Instruction. While some educators were eager for tips on how to reduce paperwork and tailor instruction to diverse learners, others worried

[TITLE]Trump admin favors Paramount Skydance in race to buy Warner Bros. Discovery: sources:
[TEXT]
The Trump administration favors Paramount Skydance to buy Warner Bros. Discovery – and a number of rival bidders are likely to face stiff hurdles from US regulators in the blockbuster auction, On The Money has learned.

That puts Paramount Skydance – the newly formed media giant headed by CEO David Ellison, the son of software magnate and longtime Trump backer Larry Ellison – clearly in the catbird seat as Warner Bros. Discovery kicks off a process to sell itself this week, according to a government official with direct knowledge of the matter.

Warner Bros Discovery, known as WBD, owns both the No. 1 ranked studio, the No. 3 ranked streaming services, as well as cable channels like HBO and CNN.

4 WBD CEO David Zaslav believes he can make a case to the Trump administration that they should allow deals outside of Paramount Skydance, appealing to free market types in the administration. Christopher Sadowski

“Who owns Warner Bros. Discovery is very important to the administration,” a senior Trump administration official told On The Money. “The Warner board needs to think very seriously not just on the price competition but which player in the suitor pool has been successful getting a deal done.

“And that points to the Ellisons,” the senior administration official added.

With the exception of Paramount Skydance, most of the reported potential suitors for WBD – Netflix, Amazon, and Comcast – come with various forms of baggage that could hamper approvals from key US agencies like the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department’s antitrust division, these sources say.

For Comcast, that baggage includes the anti-MAGA coverage of the cable giant’s far-left network MSNBC. It also includes NBC, which the president believes channels anti-Trump messaging not only on its newscasts but also in entertainment programming like “Saturday Night Live,” where Trump is mocked on a weekly basis.

“The odds that (Comcast CEO) Brian Roberts is going to be able to expand and buy CNN or whatever is low,” the official added. “Maybe Brain Roberts comes up w grand detente with the president but I don’t think that will happen and that’s the key.”

For Netflix and Amazon, which are eyeing chunks of WBD including its studio and streaming units, hurdles involve significant antitrust concerns. Netflix is already the No 1 streamer while WBD is No 3. Amazon, meanwhile, is under a consent decree from the Federal Trade Commission over alleged marketing abuses.

WBD CEO David Zaslav, meanwhile, believes he can make a case to the Trump administration that they should allow deals outside of Paramount Skydance, appealing to free market types in the administration.

Comcast is likewise expected to argue that it should be allowed to bid and possibly buy WBD because it has announced that it is spinning out its lefty cable network MSNBC into a separate unit, sources said.

Nevertheless, insiders said Zaslav in particular will be forced to consider regulatory hurdles that not only include antitrust concerns but also the Trump administration’s willingness to crack down on what it sees as rampant left-wing bias across the mainstream media.

“Warner really needs to think really hard

[TITLE]Earnings live: Intel stock surges, Ford rises after-hours, Deckers drops:
[TEXT]
Earnings season is ramping up as Tesla (TSLA), Netflix (NFLX), General Motors (GM), and Ford Motor Company (F), among others, report results this week.

As of Oct. 17, 12% of S&P 500 companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts are expecting an 8.5% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter. If that figure holds, it would mark the ninth straight quarter of positive earnings growth but a deceleration from the 12% earnings growth reported in Q2 of this year.

Expectations were slightly lower coming into the quarter, as analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report a 7.9% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter.

Source: FactSet

This week, results from Netflix, Tesla, GE Aerospace (GE), Coca-Cola (KO), Ford, General Motors, and Intel Corporation (INTC) headline the earnings calendar following earnings from the major financial institutions last week.

A wide swath of sectors will be represented, from airlines Southwest Airlines (LUV) and American Airlines (AAL) to toymakers Mattel (MAT) and Hasbro (HAS) to telecom providers AT&T (T) and T-Mobile (TMUS). Reports from consumer plays, such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Deckers Outdoors (DECK), are expected to provide an update on consumer spending, which continues to prop up the economy.

The weekly earnings calendar also features quarterly releases from Philip Morris (PM), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Texas Instruments (TXN), Capital One (COF), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), 3M (MMM), Elevance Health (ELV), Haliburton (HAL), Galaxy Digital (GLXY), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), GE Vernova (GEV), Hilton (HLT), Blackstone (BX), Union Pacific (UNP), Honeywell (HON), Norfolk Southern (NSC), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Baker Hughes (BKR), PG&E (PCG), Tractor Supply Company (TSCO), TransUnion (TRU), Sanofi (SNY), and more.

[TITLE]Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq jump as Trump confirms Xi meet, earnings flood in:
[TEXT]
US stocks climbed on Thursday as the US confirmed a highly anticipated meeting with China next week and investors parsed through a fresh batch of quarterly results after Tesla (TSLA) and IBM (IBM) earnings fell short.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) drifted 0.3% higher.

President Trump said a long-anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi is scheduled for next Thursday, offering reassurance to markets unsettled by rising tensions.

Meanwhile, oil futures spiked more than 5% after the US placed sanctions on Russia's giant producers, piling pressure on President Putin to end the war in Ukraine. Brent crude (BZ=F) rose to settle above $65 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled above $61.

Elsewhere, Tesla shares pared earlier losses to gain 2% after the EV maker posted mixed third quarter results on Wednesday, kicking off the “Magnificent Seven” earnings cycle. IBM stock dropped around 1%, as stronger-than-expected profits were offset by in-line software revenue that nevertheless disappointed investors.

After reporting quarterly results before the open, American Airlines (AAL) stock jumped as the carrier's fourth quarter earnings guidance topped expectations. Shares in T-Mobile (TMUS) dipped as the telecom company's customer base grew more than expected.

Results from struggling chipmaker Intel (INTC) take center stage after the bell.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been receiving pitches for the US to take stakes in several quantum computing companies, the Wall Street Journal reported — the latest move in its push to become a shareholder in critical sectors. Shares of IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti Computing (RGTI), and other targeted companies surged on the news.

On Friday, the delayed release of the September Consumer Price Index report will provide investors with a rare look at the inflation picture. Government data has come to a virtual standstill amid the ongoing government shutdown.

[TITLE]Stocks Retreat on Chipmaker Weakness and Renewed China Tensions:
[TEXT]
View of the trading floor of New York Stock Exchange by Lev Radin via Shutterstock

The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Wednesday closed down -0.53%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down -0.71%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed down -0.99%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) fell -0.52%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) fell -0.96%.

Stock indexes settled lower on Wednesday as the broader market was under pressure throughout the session, with chipmakers selling off after Texas Instruments forecasted Q4 revenue that fell below expectations. Also, Netflix closed down more than -9% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 EPS. Other corporate earnings results on Wednesday were supportive for stocks. Intuitive Surgical rose more than +13% after boosting its worldwide Da Vinci procedure growth forecast for the whole year. Also, Capital One Financial rose more than +1% after reporting better-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS.

Stock losses accelerated Wednesday afternoon after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is considering broad restrictions on exports to China made with US software in retaliation for China’s latest round of rare earth export restrictions.

The markets are focusing on progress in US-China trade talks, as President Trump reiterated his threat on Monday to boost tariffs on Chinese goods “if there isn’t a deal” by November 1. President Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in South Korea.

US MBA mortgage applications fell -0.3% in the week ended October 17, with the purchase mortgage sub-index down -5.2% and the refinancing sub-index up +4.0%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -5 bp to 6.37% from 6.42% in the prior week.

The shutdown of the US government continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including the last three weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the September payroll report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the September consumer price report, which was initially scheduled to be released last Wednesday, will be released this Friday. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingers, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don’t align with President Trump’s priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

The markets this week will focus on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. Also, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 that have provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results are expected to beat analysts’ expectations, the highest in a year. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

The markets are pricing in a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

Overseas stock markets settled lower on Wednesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.84%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.07%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.02%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) on Wednesday closed up +1.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield fell -1.4 bp to 3.949%. T-notes recovered from early losses on Wednesday and settled slightly higher. Wednesday’s slump in stocks, sparked by renewed China trade tensions, triggered short covering in T-notes and pushed prices higher. T-notes maintained modest gain on Wednesday due to strong demand for the Treasury’s $13 billion auction of 20-year T-bonds that had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.73, better than the 10-auction average of 2.63.

T-notes have ongoing support due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

European government bond yields were mixed on Wednesday. The 10-year German bund yield rose +1.1 bp to 2.563%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 6.5-month low of 4.369% and finished down -6.0 bp to 4.417%.

UK Sep CPI rose +3.8% y/y, unchanged from Aug and weaker than expectations of +4.0% y/y. Sep core CPI unexpectedly eased to +3.5% y/y from +3.6% y/y in Aug, weaker than expectations of +3.7% y/y.

ECB Vice President Guindos said, “The current ECB interest-rate level is adequate as the path forward for inflation looks positive,” and risks to the outlook for consumer-price growth are balanced.

Swaps are discounting a 2% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

US Stock Movers

Texas Instruments (TXN) closed down more than -5% to lead chipmakers lower after forecasting Q4 revenue of $4.22 billion to $4.58 billion, with the midpoint below the consensus of $4.50 billion. Also, ON Semiconductor (ON) closed down more than -5%, and Microchip Technology (MCHP) closed down more than -4%. In addition, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Marvell Technology (MRVL), and Intel (INTC) closed down more than -3%. Finally, Analog Devices (ADI), KLA Corp (KLAC), ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), GlobalFoundries (GFS), Lam Research (LRCX), Micron Technology (MU), and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI) all closed down by more than 2%.

Cryptocurrency-exposed stocks retreated on Wednesday as the price of Bitcoin fell more than -2%. As a result, Coinbase Global (COIN), Galaxy Digital (GLXY), MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Strategy (MSTR) closed down more than -4%.

Lennox International (LII) closed down by more than -10% to lead losers in the S&P 500 after cutting its full-year EPS forecast to $22.75-$23.25 from a previous estimate of $23.25-$24.25.

Netflix (NFLX) is down more than -10% to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q3 EPS of $5.87, well below the consensus of $6.94.

AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) closed down more than -10% after announcing a private offering of $850 million of convertible senior notes due 2036.

Manhattan Associates (MANH) closed down more than -4% after reporting that its Q3 remaining performance obligations (RPOs) amounted to $2.077 billion, below the consensus of $2.088 billion.

Mattel (MAT) closed down more than -3% after reporting Q3 net sales of $1.74 billion, weaker than the consensus of $1.84 billion.

Commercial Metals (CMC) closed down more than -3% after Jeffries downgraded the stock to hold from buy.

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) closed up more than +13% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after boosting its worldwide Da Vinci procedure growth forecast for the whole year.

Avery Dennison (AVY) closed up more than +9% after reporting Q3 adjusted EPS of $2.37, better than the consensus of $2.33, and announcing a pact with Walmart where Walmart will use Avery’s sensor technology that brings RFID-enabled labels to Walmart’s fresh-food departments.

Energy producers and energy service providers rallied on Wednesday after the price of WTI crude oil rose more than +2% to a 1-week high. Halliburton (HAL) closed up more than +4% and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) closed up more than +3%. Also, Phillips 66 (PSX), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Valero Energy (VLO) closed up more than +2%.

[TITLE]Vocus scores three new federal government contracts:
[TEXT]
The federal government has awarded Vocus three telecommunications contracts valued at around $6 million over the next three years.

The three contracts, with the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA), the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC), are for internet services across each agency.

The contracts with DFAT and ACIC are new, while the DTA's renewed contract with Vocus includes an expanded scope.

DTA chief operating officer Tom Gilmartin confirmed to iTnews that its $707,000 internet services arrangement with Vocus also includes an infrastructure upgrade.

“As part of the service offering, Vocus will upgrade the DTA's network appliance to provide improved network traffic controls and strengthened security.” Gilmartin said.

Vocus is expected to commence the upgrade in November.

The telco’s contract with DFAT is expected to be of a similar scope and valued at $2.7 million.

Vocus has telecommunications contracts with DFAT before. However, iTnews understands that this agreement involves a new contract rather than a renewal of an existing one.

A spokesperson for DFAT said that the it related “provision of internet and carriage services to DFAT domestic sites, including infrastructure and bandwidth enhancement where required”.

The spokesperson added that Vocus commenced work at the department in October.

A spokesperson for ACIC confirmed to iTnews that its $2.3 million agreement with Vocus was also a new contract rather than a renewal of a previous arrangement. However, it declined to provide details of the contract, citing agency policy.

In January 2024, telecommunications services at the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) were split between Optus and Vocus.

Vocus became the internet and data carriage contractor for the department, disrupting Optus’ position as DHA’s dominant network service provider.

Vocus' network footprint is currently undergoing a major expansion as it is absorbs infrastructure included in its $5.25 billion deal to buy TPG's enterprise, government, wholesale fixed-line and fibre assets.

The telco received final government approvals to go ahead with the purchase in In July.
