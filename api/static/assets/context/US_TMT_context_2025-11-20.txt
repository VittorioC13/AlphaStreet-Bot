[TITLE]Microsoft's Latest Software Tools Raise IQ Of AI Agents:
[TEXT]
Microsoft introduced a host of artificial intelligence-powered productivity tools designed to integrate AI into business workflows.

The post Microsoft's Latest Software Tools Raise IQ Of AI Agents appeared first on Investor's Business Daily.

[TITLE]The software companies most likely to be acquired as AI eats the world:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The threat of AI has sent shockwaves through the software sector, hammering share prices and creating, in the words of analysts at RBC Capital Markets, a rare opportunity for "opportunistic" buyers.

Once-high-flying software companies are now trading at deep discounts as investors worry about how generative AI could upend SaaS business models. That same anxiety, the analysts argue, is laying the groundwork for a new wave of dealmaking.

According to RBC, software M&A activity has surged 78% this year, with private-equity deal volume more than doubling as sponsors hunt for bargains.

"We continue to see software underperform on concerns around AI and as this underperformance drags on in spite of better-than-expected results, we may see more buyers opportunistically step in and take advantage of dislocations, particularly in private equity," the analysts wrote in a recent note to investors.

A chart showing software M&A activity RBC Capital Markets

While noting they have no knowledge of any such deals, the analysts listed potential targets, all of which have solid customer bases and cash flow but limited AI narratives. Private-equity buyers, less constrained by quarterly earnings pressure, could move quickly to take these companies private, reset expectations, and rebuild them for an AI-first world.

While regulatory scrutiny remains a hurdle for mega-cap tech acquirers, financial sponsors are freer to strike. RBC expects deal momentum to accelerate as sentiment stabilizes and valuations remain depressed. For investors, the AI scare that crushed software stocks might soon become the catalyst for a new consolidation boom, one driven not by hype, but by hard-nosed value hunting.

Here's RBC's view on which software companies are potential mergers and acquisitions targets and why:

Asana (ASAN): Under pressure amid rising AI-native competition and ongoing industry consolidation, the workplace and project management company remains a potential takeover target despite its founder-controlled voting structure.

Box (BOX): With growth stagnating and shares undervalued, the cloud content management company could attract private equity buyers seeking to reset expectations or strategic acquirers interested in its horizontal content platform.

Confluent (CFLT): Positioned attractively in the data streaming layer, Confluent could appeal to a strategic buyer seeking deeper data infrastructure capabilities.

Coursera (COUR): Despite headwinds in EdTech, Coursera's large learner base and AI partnerships make it an appealing target for strategic buyers or as a cornerstone for a PE-led rollup.

Dropbox (DBX): Lacking the scale advantages of larger cloud storage rivals, Dropbox could become a target if new products underperform, with greater value realized as part of a bigger platform.

DocuSign (DOCU): If the e-signature company's identity access management pivot fails to gain traction, DocuSign could attract private equity interest, though its valuation may deter many bidders.

Elastic (ESTC): Elastic's GenAI momentum and leadership in search make it a logical target for strategic consolidation.

Five9 (FIVN): With strong contact-center-as-a-service (CCaaS) technology and margin improvement potential, Five9 could appeal to enterprise companies such as Salesforce or Cisco, or to private equity once leadership stabilizes.

Fastly (FSLY): Its solid edge-computing technology and reasonable valuation could make Fastly an attractive target to acquirers such as Google or Cisco.

Gen Digital (GEN): With stable margins, strong cash flow, and revenue synergies, the cybersecurity and fintech platform could be a compelling buyout candidate for private equity.

GitLab (GTLB): GitLab's growing presence in developer security operations and GenAI developer tools positions it as an appealing strategic acquisition.

ZoomInfo (GTM): This company's valuable customer relationship management data and integration potential make it a fit for large platforms such as Salesforce or a PE candidate for operational optimization.

N-Able (NABL): Its foothold in the fragmented managed service provider and small and medium-sized enterprise market makes N-Able an attractive consolidation play for private equity.

NICE (NICE): Misunderstood by markets and undervalued, NICE's CCaaS and compliance businesses could unlock value through a takeover or breakup.

Nutanix (NTNX): As hybrid-cloud adoption grows, Nutanix's scale and SaaS shift could make it a strategic target for major IT vendors.

PagerDuty (PD): PagerDuty fits as a logical acquisition to strengthen an integrated IT operations platform.

Qualys (QLYS): High margins and leadership in vulnerability management make Qualys an attractive consolidation target within the cloud security sector.

Rapid7 (RPD): Following restructuring and a pivot from cybersecurity toward DevSecOps, Rapid7's improved cash profile could appeal to private equity buyers.

Teradata (TDC): Its progress in cloud analytics positions Teradata as a potential acquisition target for large vendors or PE firms.

Varonis (VRNS): Focused on data security and governance, Varonis is well placed for a strategic GenAI-driven acquisition.

Zoom (ZM): While a sale is unlikely soon, Zoom's best-in-class video platform could entice acquirers seeking synergies in AI and collaboration.

[TITLE]Creator Tayla Cannon receives $1.1 million investment from Slow Ventures’ Creator Fund to build PT software:
[TEXT]
In 2023, Tayla Cannon moved from Australia to the U.S. for a job in a city she’d never seen before.

“No family, no friends, just a fresh start,” she told TechCrunch. A sufferer of chronic back pain, she first started working in physiotherapy, thinking it was helping make a difference in the lives of others. Yet the traditional physiotherapy model never quite lit a spark in her.

She moved to interventional cardiology but only became more disillusioned with the physical rehab model with “its localized, reactive, and volume-based nature,” she said.

Meanwhile, in her spare time, she became a content creator, sharing her perspective online about “proactive” and “holistic” ways people can get rid of pain.

That took on a life of its own.

She now has more than 130,000 followers on Instagram, a company called Athletic Rebuild, which provides rehab and performance coaching for athletes, and now, a platform called Rebuildr, a HIPAA-compliant and mentorship app to help rehab professionals run their own businesses online, set to launch early next year.

“I wasn’t trying to build a business; I was just putting my brain on the internet and helping people rethink what care could look like.”

Cannon and her works caught the eye of Slow Ventures, which announced on Tuesday that it invested $1.1 million as a seed round. She is one of the first creators to receive a check from Slow Ventures’ $60 million Creator Fund, which seeks to back content creators and influencers making an impact online.

Cannon said she had no plan when she started sharing her thoughts on social media in 2024 and then decided to make this her profession. “There was no strategy, no roadmap, and certainty no business model behind it,” she said. She credits what most content creators do for her success — remaining authentic and sharing unfiltered but genuine thoughts.

Expanding a brand on social media is not without challenges, however. Her social media presence, and therefore brand, was growing fast, which was good but also a problem. She was instantly faced with the need to understand business logic, consumer acumen, and content strategy to connect with new audiences. “None of which are taught in healthcare,” she continued. “We’re trained to help people, not to build brands.”

The turning point came when she actually realized she was the bottleneck to her own business. “I couldn’t keep scaling something that depended solely on me. I had to build something that could grow without me,” she said, adding that she ended up hiring people to help her with her projects.

[TITLE]AT&T Boosts 5G Capacity Nationwide:
[TEXT]
AT&T has deployed mid-band spectrum acquired from EchoStar to increase 5G download speeds by up to 80% across the country, the carrier announced yesterday.

By deploying the mid-band spectrum to nearly 23,000 cell sites, AT&T has increased capacity and speeds for customers in more than 5,300 cities across the contiguous U.S.

AT&T said that it expects the deployment to support strong and sustained growth in its high-value base of customers who subscribe to both its home internet and 5G wireless services. In addition, AT&T expects to achieve long-term operating efficiencies, as the acquisition of these licenses will reduce the need to boost network capacity through the construction of additional cell sites.

AT&T claimed that it has invested more capital than any other company in U.S. telecommunications infrastructure over the last five years, including adding spectrum, and progress in Open RAN.

“We’ve put EchoStar spectrum to work on our network and customers are already feeling the difference,” AT&T Chief Operating Officer Jeff McElfresh said in a prepared statement about the 5G network enhancements.

“This gives us the runway to expand availability of AT&T Internet Air for consumers and businesses and add even more download speed to our 5G service. We’re setting the bar for what it means to be the best advanced networking company in America.”

In August, AT&T and EchoStar announced two related agreements to expand the wireless spectrum licenses owned by AT&T — allowing them to make the 5G network upgrades announced this week — and deepen the companies’ cooperation in the operation of EchoStar’s Boost Mobile brand.

At the time, AT&T acquired approximately 30 MHz of spectrum in the 3.45 GHz mid-band and approximately 20 MHz nationwide in the 600 MHz low-band for about $23 billion.

What if the future of artificial intelligence wasn’t just shaped by algorithms and data but by the very hardware powering it? OpenAI’s bold move to develop its own custom AI chips could be just that, a fantastic option with the potential to disrupt the entire industry. In a world where Nvidia dominates with an iron grip on 80% of the AI hardware market, OpenAI’s decision to break free from this dependency isn’t just strategic; it’s innovative. Imagine a scenario where AI systems like ChatGPT operate faster, more efficiently, and at a fraction of the cost, all while sidestepping the bottlenecks of supply chains and skyrocketing GPU prices. Could this be the unfair advantage that reshapes the AI landscape?

This deep dive the team at AI Grid explores the high-stakes gamble OpenAI is taking to design proprietary chips tailored to its needs. You’ll uncover how this shift could address critical challenges like rising operational costs and performance limitations while also sparking a ripple effect across the tech industry. But it’s not all smooth sailing, chip development is a labyrinth of technical, financial, and geopolitical hurdles. As OpenAI positions itself to challenge Nvidia’s dominance, the implications for innovation, accessibility, and competition are profound. Could this be the beginning of a new era where custom hardware defines the future of AI?

OpenAI’s Custom AI Chips

TL;DR Key Takeaways : OpenAI is developing custom AI chips to reduce costs, optimize performance, and decrease dependency on Nvidia, which currently dominates the AI hardware market.

Specialized AI chips are critical for improving computational efficiency, scalability, and energy consumption in advanced AI applications like natural language processing and machine learning.

Nvidia’s 80% market share in AI hardware creates financial and strategic challenges for organizations like OpenAI, prompting the need for alternative solutions.

Custom chip development is a complex, resource-intensive process, with OpenAI likely adopting a “fabless” model by outsourcing manufacturing to companies like TSMC.

OpenAI’s initiative could disrupt Nvidia’s dominance, increase competition in the AI hardware market, and make AI tools more affordable and accessible to businesses and consumers.

The Growing Need for Specialized AI Hardware

AI systems demand extraordinary computational power to process vast amounts of data and execute millions of simultaneous calculations. General-purpose processors, such as CPUs, often lack the efficiency required for these tasks. While GPUs (graphics processing units) have been adapted to handle AI workloads, they were originally designed for rendering graphics in gaming, leaving room for optimization in AI-specific applications. This has fueled the development of specialized AI chips, which are engineered to deliver enhanced speed, efficiency, and scalability.

Specialized hardware is critical for advancing AI capabilities. By optimizing chips for specific tasks, organizations can achieve breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning.
