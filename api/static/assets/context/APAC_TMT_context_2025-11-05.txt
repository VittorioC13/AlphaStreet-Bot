Chinese shares climbed to a decade high on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping began a high-stakes meeting, fuelling cautious optimism for a potential trade-war truce that will help sustain bullish market sentiment.Investors appeared heartened by early signs of cooling tensions between the world's top two economies after recent escalations, while also positioning defensively with a sense of deja vu that the real deal may offer far less to celebrate."We are going to have a very successful meeting," Trump said as he shook hands with Xi, adding that the pair might sign a trade deal on Thursday.Xi said via a translator that he's ready to "continue working with Trump to build a solid foundation for China-U.S. relations."The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index reversed early losses, rising as much as 0.2% to 4,025.70 in morning trading, reaching its highest since 2015, driven by hopes for de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade dispute.Banking, insurance and liquor sectors led gains as sentiment remained cautious.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.6% after resuming trade following a holiday on Wednesday.Trump, in South Korea on the final leg of his trip around Asia, has struck an optimistic tone

[TITLE]In a world of crypto and ‘exotic instruments’, traditional exchanges are thinking about how they ‘stay relevant’:
[TEXT]
Good morning, Asia editor Nick Gordon, filling in for Allie Garfinkle.

Fortune just wrapped up its Global Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The agenda featured several financial sector luminaries: Barclays CEO C. S. Venkatakrishnan, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, DBS CEO Tan Su Shan and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio.

I had to enjoy the Forum remotely this year due to another mega-event (the APEC CEO Summit in South Korea). But I made sure to tune in to Monday’s mainstage session with Eng. Khalid Abdullah Al Hussan, CEO of the Saudi Tadawul Group; Bonnie Chan, CEO of HKEX; and Bob McCooey, vice chair of Nasdaq.

After a couple of down years, blockbuster IPOs have come back this year. The U.S. was home to two of the year’s biggest listings: CoreWeave on the Nasdaq and Figma on the NYSE, which raised $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion respectively. Hong Kong’s listings are dwarfing those in the U.S.: battery maker CATL’s secondary listing in the Chinese city is still the year’s largest IPO, raising $5.5 billion back in May.

The global competition for IPOs can seem cutthroat at times, as exchanges pitch friendly regulations, investor knowledge, and deeper pools of capital to win listings from their competitors.

But Nasdaq’s McCooey on Monday claimed that he spent a lot of time suggesting that executives look at home first, before looking abroad.

“I believe that most companies belong in their local markets. I firmly do,” he said. “I don’t go to Hong Kong, China, Tokyo, Singapore, Argentina, and try to convince companies not to list in their local markets, because most companies do belong there.” (Lest one think McCooey was being too charitable, he also said Nasdaq has “the strongest value proposition” for those companies that do decide to list overseas.)

Exchanges aren’t just competing against each other anymore. “The pace of change–on the alternative platforms, on the sophistication of investors–it’s unheard of,” Al Hussan, from Tadawul, said. “I have been in this business for the last 18, 19 years. You wake up every morning, there’s a new channel, there’s a new way of doing things, there’s a new requirement.”

Chan, from HKEX, agreed, noting that budding investors have a lot more options, like cryptocurrency, commodities and other “exotic instruments.”

“We’re entering into a stage where exchanges are not really competing with one another,” she said. “We’re working together with one another to make sure that we all stay relevant.”

Still, Chan can certainly feel secure

[TITLE]Chinese stocks: investors study Beijing's 5-year plan for hints on future market forces:
[TEXT]
In a sign of how critical technology will be for China's growth in the following five years, the proposal had 46 references to the word, compared with 36 in the plan for 2020-2025.

Chipmakers, robotics companies, high-end manufacturers and stocks linked to domestic consumption were set to emerge as outperformers in the long run, according to brokerages including Guotai Haitong Securities and Huajin Securities.

"The five-year plan is expected to reset investment themes and the valuation system on the capital market," said Wang Jun, a strategist at BOC International in Shanghai. "The new productive force represented by tech self-reliance, the green transition and an upgrade of domestic demand may run through the policy front and investment themes in the next five years. We expect long-term capital such as mutual funds and insurance funds to further tilt towards those industries of strategic value."

[TITLE]Most Asian markets rise on lingering trader optimism:
[TEXT]
Wall Street: — © Digital Journal

Most stocks rose in Asian trade Monday after a busy last week, with optimism supported by another AI-led tech rally on Wall Street.

Investors returned from the weekend in relatively good spirits after an upbeat end to October that saw China-US tensions ease, a Federal Reserve interest rate cut and healthy earnings from market darlings including Amazon.

Traders are also hoping for key US jobs data to be released later in the week, though the ongoing government shutdown — with Democrats and Republicans no closer to a reopening deal — could cause them to be suspended again.

While the government closure has not had any major impact on markets, analysts warned it could begin to affect Americans.

“The shutdown could soon feasibly become the longest on record, though markets remain largely unperturbed,” wrote Chris Weston at Pepperstone.

“Public frustration is expected to build this week as (food) benefits for lower-income families are paused, and disruptions increase for domestic travel. New enrolments for Americans seeking access to Affordable Care Act plans may also become increasingly problematic.”

After April’s plunge sparked by US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs blitz, world markets have surged with Wall Street’s three main indexes and several others hitting record highs.

Those gains have come on the back of expectations — and the delivery — of Fed rate cuts as well as a seemingly unending race to invest in artificial intelligence.

That has pushed valuations of some firms to eye-watering levels, with chip titan Nvidia becoming the first $5 trillion firm last week.

Wall Street’s gains Friday were tracked in most of Asia at the start of the week.

Hong Kong, Singapore, Wellington and Taipei all advanced, while Seoul piled on more than one percent to a record as investors cheered a thawing of ties between South Korea and China.

There were losses in Shanghai, Sydney and Manila. Tokyo was closed for a holiday.

Investors were keeping tabs on any new developments after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met last week and agreed a deal to ease China’s rare earth curbs and lower US tariffs.

Still, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Sunday that the White House could again hike levies on China if it blocked rare earth exports.

Oil prices edged up after the OPEC+ alliance said it would lift output again in December but would pause production in the first three months of 2026.

Gold prices hovered around $4,000 after China said it was scrapping a tax incentive on buying the commodity.

The precious metal has tumbled from its October 20 record above $4,381 as investors cashed out, following a more than 60 percent surge since the start of the year.
