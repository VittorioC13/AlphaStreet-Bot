Montney Expansion and NuVista Energy Acquisition to Support Ovintiv (OVV) Future Growth; Citi Remains Bullish

On November 18, 2025, The Fly reported that Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) saw Citi reduce its price target from $54 to $52, while reiterating a “Buy” rating.

Previously, on November 6, 2025, Evercore ISI increased its price target on Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) from $43 to $47, while maintaining an “Outperform” rating. The price revision reflects the company’s Q3 results, which exceeded analyst expectations. Moreover, the investment firm cited the company’s strategic Montney expansion as a key catalyst fueling its future growth. Furthermore, its acquisition of NuVista Energy in early November is expected to enhance its cash flow and streamline the portfolio, the firm noted.

Meanwhile, Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) reported its Q3 results on November 5, 2025. The quarter marked a generation of $351 million in free cash flow and production at the high end of guidance. The consistency shown in the cash flow generation comes despite the over $10 per barrel drop in WTI oil prices since the first quarter of 2024. The company’s confidence was bolstered during the quarter, leading to a 10,000 BOE/day increase in full-year production guidance and $50 million reduction in capital investment.

Furthermore, the company’s acquisition of NuVista, announced on November 4, is expected to add approximately 100,000 BOE/day in 2026 and 930 net 10,000-foot equivalent wells. Additionally, the company’s efforts to reduce target debt to $4 billion remain on track, thanks to the Anadarko divestiture. The company recorded $267 million in adjusted earnings, alongside non-GAAP free cash flow of $351 million after capital expenditures of $544 million.

[TITLE]Ottawa, Alberta agree to broad outlines of energy deal, including support for pipeline:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

Prime Minister Mark Carney and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith have agreed to the broad outlines of a memorandum of understanding that would give Alberta special exemptions from federal environmental laws and offer political support to a new oil pipeline to the B.C. coast, CBC News has learned.

The deal is set to be formally announced at a joint Carney-Smith news conference in Calgary on Thursday.

It would be contingent on Alberta embracing a stricter industrial carbon pricing regime and a multibillion-dollar investment in carbon capture from the Pathways Alliance of oilsands companies, according to sources who spoke to CBC News.

CBC News spoke with multiple sources with knowledge of the plan or who had been briefed on it, but were not authorized to speak publicly before the memorandum of understanding (MOU) is released.

The historic agreement could reset the relationship between the two levels of government, which have been at odds with each other for some time. The announcement is expected to come with a major public relations push, including an event involving the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, the prime minister, the province’s premier and other Albertan politicians.

The deal is expected to include carve-outs for Alberta on federal greenhouse gas regulations that it has long opposed, including Ottawa’s net-zero clean electricity regulations. The deal would see Ottawa suspend those regulations if Alberta agrees to strengthen its industrial carbon price.

Placing an effective carbon price on large emitters, such as the oil and gas industry, is widely acknowledged among climate policy experts as one of the most effective tools to reduce harmful emissions.

All of this could make the federal government’s proposed oil and gas emissions cap unnecessary, paving the way for its removal. The Carney government argued the cap would be obsolete if those conditions were met when it outlined its Climate Competitiveness Strategy in the 2025 budget.

The budget also announced the federal government will tweak rules in the Competition Act that crack down on companies engaging in misleading advertising on environmental claims, what’s known as greenwashing.

The Alberta government and industry groups have called for a repeal of those laws.

WATCH | Concerns over lifting tanker ban: First Nations, experts warn of catastrophic risk in lifting B.C. oil tanker ban | Duration 2:16 A potential new oil pipeline from Alberta to B.C. is shedding light on the dangerous B.C. waters that tankers would have to navigate if it's built. CBC's Janella Hamilton dives into the implications and the worries.

Thursday’s agreement is expected to contain language around the need for Alberta to negotiate with the B.C. government as it advances work on a pipeline to ship oil to the northwest coast.

CBC News and others have already reported that the energy accord is expected to contain wording on a path forward on an Alberta to northwest B.C. oil pipeline and exemptions to a ban on oil tankers from the northern tip of Vancouver Island to the Alaska border.

The MOU is also expected to include language around the need for Indigenous ownership and equity, along with the need for tripartite engagement with B.C.

B.C. Premier David Eby told reporters that he spoke with the prime minister on Monday morning, who told him the details were not finalized.

Adrian Dix, B.C.'s energy and climate solutions minister, suggested that Thursday's agreement is focused on a speculative pipeline without a settled route or confirmed buyers.

"The reason this is an MOU … is there ain't no project here," Dix told reporters.

He also pointed out that Smith is set to face her party's membership at a United Conservative Party convention in Edmonton this weekend.

"Timing is a priority for Alberta because, apparently, there is a political convention this weekend. And apparently Alberta needs to unite the right."

Appearing before a parliamentary committee on Monday, Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson was asked whether the government would create an exemption to the tanker ban.

"We have been clear with proponents. If they have support of First Nations and jurisdictions, we will work with them to clear whatever barriers there are," he said.

The Alberta government wouldn't elaborate on the details shared with CBC News.

"We hope to have more to share in the coming days," said Sam Blackett, a spokesperson for the Alberta premier.

The agreement will also include an emphasis on getting the $16.5-billion Pathways Alliance carbon capture and storage project done.

The proposal by the consortium of oilsands companies would involve trapping greenhouse gas emissions from facilities in northern Alberta and transporting them by pipeline to an underground storage hub near Cold Lake, Alta.

The early details of the MOU amount to a "historic betrayal of Canada's climate commitments and Indigenous rights," said Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada.

"The carbon pollution from expanding oil production to fill a massive, new pipeline will overwhelm any potential reductions involved."

[TITLE]Oil Extends Slump As Traders Assess Outlook For Deal On Ukraine:
[TEXT]
Crude has slumped this year, with futures on course for a fourth monthly loss in October, in what would be the longest losing streak since 2023. The decline has been driven by expanded global output, including from OPEC+, with the International Energy Agency forecasting a record surplus for 2026. Traders are closely monitoring whether a deal on Ukraine will materialize, and if sanctions on Russia will be lifted — developments that could inject more supply.

“If we do reach an agreement here, and it’s a very big if, the global glut gets a lot worse once sanctions are removed,” said Robert Rennie, head of commodity research at Westpac Bank Corp. “We see Brent capped above $65 — and see it headed lower into 2026 — though this week will all be about the ebb and flow of European, Ukrainian and US commentary on how the peace plan is evolving.”

[TITLE]Oil Prices Sink 2.6% After Zelenskyy Agrees to Work on Peace Deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices dropped again on Friday morning, bogged down by fresh news that Ukraine's Zelenskyy agreed to work with Washington on a peace plan, a development that could ultimately add fresh barrels into an already fragile market.

At the time of writing, West Texas Intermediate for December delivery had slipped by 2.51% to $57.52 per barrel...

Brent crude, for its part, had fallen 2.19% to $61.99...

A continued pullback would mark the third consecutive daily decline for WTI, putting the U.S. benchmark on track for a weekly loss of over 4%, a reflection of broader concerns over global supply growth and a weakening demand outlook

News of Zelenskyy considering the peace proposal comes on the same day that new U.S. sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil officially take effect, targeting key subsidiaries in an effort to restrict Kremlin revenue from fossil-fuel sales. While those sanctions should tighten supply, that has largely been baked into markets at this point.

Russian Urals crude, already discounted due to sanctions, has been trading as much as $23 per barrel below other global grades, evidence that sanctions are having an effect.

In the U.S., crude stockpiles unexpectedly fell by 3.4 million barrels last week on the back of strong refinery activity. But the bullish inventory surprise failed to lift prices as traders remained focused on the geopolitical picture.

Energy markets also faced macro-driven pressure, with Asian stocks declining sharply after Thursday’s U.S. employment data clouded expectations for imminent Federal Reserve rate cuts, boosting the dollar and intensifying risk-off sentiment.

A stronger greenback, the currency hit a broad rally against major and commodity-linked currencies, further weighed on dollar-priced crude.

OPEC+ remains a fundamental force in the overall bearishness of oil markets, with the group committed to boosting production in December before halting output increases in early 2026. If oil prices continue to tumble, then markets will look to the group to rein in its output.

In the short term, markets will remain fixated on Kyiv and Washington for the next major signal, one that could determine the trajectory of crude heading into December.

[TITLE]Norwegian billionaire left to rue Mainstream Renewable deal as losses hit €1.2bn:
[TEXT]
Mainstream has racked up huge losses amid turbulence in its main market Chile and challenges in the green energy development sector

For Aker ASA, the Norwegian industrial powerhouse that began life as a boat builder, a deal to buy Eddie O’Connor’s Mainstream Renewable Power in January 2021 was a springboard to float one of its portfolio companies weeks later.

“Combining Mainstream’s global organisation and renewable assets with Aker’s 180-year track record of building and developing industrial companies is another step in line with our long-term strategy for value creation,” said Øyvind Eriksen, chief executive of Aker ASA.

Aker Horizons, the unit going through the initial public offering (IPO), was handed Mainstream, after the group agreed to buy a 75 per cent stake, in a deal that valued the Irish business at €900 million.

A 20 per cent spike in Aker ASA’s own shares within days of the Mainstream deal suggested investors in Oslo thought it had snapped up a bargain in the wind and solar energy developer, with projects spanning Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific.

But it was a moment many of the 600 wealthy Irish individuals who backed O’Connor when he set up the company in 2008 – with hopes he could replicate the stunning €1.8 billion achieved for Airtricity, his previous venture – had long doubted would ever arrive.

Theirs had been a hair-raising ride. The financial crisis battered initial plans, and for a decade the company survived by selling developments early – and on the cheap – to keep the lights on. Things finally turned with the transformational sale of a large wind farm project off the coast of Scotland for more than €600 million in 2018.

For O’Connor, who died early last year, the 2021 deal delivered a fifteenfold gain on the €30 million he had put into Mainstream. He and a handful of others rolled over a 25 per cent stake.

However, 60 cent of the small Irish investors opted to sell out entirely in 2021, rather than reinvest some money in the Aker Horizons deal – walking away with

[TITLE]Hyperscalers Crash the Grid as Big Tech Becomes a Power Trader:
[TEXT]
America’s hyperscalers are looking to ensure the electricity for their huge data centers by entering the supply side of the market—power trading.

Meta, Microsoft, and Apple, to name a few, have either requested or obtained authorizations from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale power.

Meta Platforms, for example, seeks to incentivize long-term commitments in power-generating capacity by expanding into power trading and having the flexibility to contract electricity from future power plants, according to Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy.

Currently, power plant developers are careful about committing investments in the long term, which is not enough to meet the demand from AI and data centers.

Power capacity developers “want to know that the consumers of power are willing to put skin in the game,” Meta’s Parekh told Bloomberg in an interview last week.

“Without Meta taking a more active voice in the need to expand the amount of power that’s on the system, it’s not happening as quickly as we would like,” the executive added.

U.S. power utilities are investing a record amount of money into transmission and grid connection. But current forecasts of AI-driven power demand vary so much that there is a massive margin of error, analysts and utility officials told Reuters Events in June.

The U.S. market faces “a moment of peak uncertainty,” according to Rebecca Carroll, senior director of market analytics at energy advisor Trio.

Related: New Monster Gas Wells Are Outperforming Legacy Haynesville Deposits

Electric utilities face a high degree of uncertainty over future revenues as the boom of AI data centers generates widely varying forecasts of peak demand in many areas across the country.

If utilities overestimate their future demand, they risk overbuilding new capacity that will not be met by consumption. A possible overbuild would come at the expense of the American ratepayers, who have already seen electricity prices rising at a faster pace than U.S. inflation over the past three years.

The era of stagnated power demand in the United States ended about two years ago when hyperscalers started the race to develop AI-driven solutions and build huge data centers across the U.S.

America’s five largest hyperscalers are set to hike spending on data centers by 50% to over $300 billion in 2025, according to estimates by Wood Mackenzie.

U.S utilities have already committed to add 116 gigawatts (GW) of large load to their networks, equivalent to around 15% of U.S. peak electricity demand in 2024, the energy consultancy reckons.

The venture into power trading from hyperscalers could give utilities more certainty that their future new capacity will find customers.

“We’re seeing a breakdown between the demand and supply sides of the market, with the biggest actors playing on both sides,” WoodMac’s Ben Hertz-Shargel told Bloomberg.

“To better orchestrate growth, you need some of the largest buyers of electricity to actively support the buildout of the supply side.”

If Meta and other tech giants commit to long-term purchase agreements, power capacity developers will be more willing to invest in long-lead plant construction.

Meta alone is investing $600 billion in the U.S. by 2028 to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion, the company said earlier this month.

The company says it’s making additional investments in energy supply and these have so far helped to add more than 15 GW of new energy projects to the grid across 27 states, representing more than $16 billion in capital investments.

It’s not only clean energy that will power the huge data centers of the hyperscalers—natural gas will play an important role, too.

For example, Meta’s new data center in Richland Parish in Louisiana, worth over $10 billion, will source electricity from three new gas-fired power plants after the Louisiana Public Service Commission this summer approved an agreement that paves the way for Entergy Louisiana to build these plants.

“Importantly, Meta is paying its share of the costs for the infrastructure needed to support its operations, ensuring that other customers are protected from those expenses,” Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO, said in August.

[TITLE]NDP calls for ownership and regulatory review of Nova Scotia Power:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

NDP Leader Claudia Chender is calling on the premier — who recently appointed himself energy minister — to launch an ownership and regulatory review of Nova Scotia Power.

Claudia Chender made the request in a letter to Premier Tim Houston on Monday.

“We have a utility that is not performing in any of the ways we measure performance,” she said in an interview.

“And now we have a premier who has appointed himself the energy minister and has promptly taken himself on the road. What we need is an energy minister who’s going to prioritize power affordability for Nova Scotians.”

Looking at options

Houston has recently made trips to Alberta, the United States and Europe, all to promote energy generation opportunities in the province, including onshore and offshore wind and natural gas, as a means of spurring economic development.

But Chender said those promotional efforts are happening at the same time as Nova Scotia Power customers are seeing their bills increase and the utility continues to deal with the fallout of a massive data breach this year that resulted in the theft of personal information of hundreds of thousands of people.

Her letter to Houston says Nova Scotians are paying on average $400 a year more for their electricity since the PCs formed government in 2021.

“What we need to do is understand how that could be better. I think that’s government’s job, is to figure out how we can deliver these services in the best way possible.”

Govts move away from utility ownership

Chender’s party has advocated for a low-income power rate and a one-time rebate of 10 per cent for all customers as ways to help soften the blow of increased costs.

Adam Fremeth, the E.J. Kernaghan Chair in Energy Policy at Western University’s Ivey Business School, said governments across the country have moved away from utility ownership.

“It tends to go in the other direction, that there’s efforts to bring private capital into the investment of these types of utilities to allow them to have more flexibility and have a bit more discipline,” he said in an interview.

“Private directors and those with know-how in these areas tend to bring a lot more discipline to management and how these organizations are run.”

Putting aside the massive cost that would go into making Nova Scotia Power a public utility again, Fremeth said there are other aspects that would make it a complicated transaction.

NDP Leader Claudia Chender says the PC government has not done enough to address increasing power rates in Nova Scotia. (Jeorge Sadi/CBC)

He said studies have shown that governments tend not to be as efficient when it comes to running electric utilities and they tend only to step in if the private market is unable to resolve or fix problems.

Aside from ownership of the utility, Chender said a review could also consider ownership of the electricity grid and programs that could help ease the burden for low-income customers.

Her letter to Houston also raised concerns

The financing represents a significant strengthening of Eos’ balance sheet, providing the financial flexibility needed to scale manufacturing, accelerate commercial pipeline and backlog conversion, and capture rapidly expanding demand for American-made long duration energy storage. The offerings were oversubscribed, demonstrating strong investor confidence in Eos’ market potential and progress against its strategic plan.

“This was an opportunistic move to strengthen Eos for the scale in front of us,” said Nathan Kroeker, Eos Chief Commercial Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. “Retiring a significant portion of the 2030 notes and securing a lower cost of capital while bringing in meaningful new cash gives us the flexibility to support manufacturing expansion and the growing demand for long-duration energy storage.”

The refinancing meaningfully enhances the Company’s capital structure by lowering its cost of capital, reducing interest expense, and adding substantial liquidity to support the next phase of operational growth and U.S.-based production. This strengthened position comes as Eos’ commercial pipeline has reached $22.6 billion as of September 30, 2025, representing approximately 91 GWh of identified long duration energy storage demand across data centers, utilities, and industrial customers, supporting the Company’s plans to scale manufacturing to meet evolving market needs.

“This financing positions Eos to compete from a position of strength,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “With a stronger balance sheet and a more efficient capital structure, we can scale with speed and certainty at a time when the world is entering an energy supercycle. Long-duration storage is becoming essential infrastructure, and this transaction gives Eos the ability to invest in U.S. manufacturing, meet accelerating demand, and lead the market as this cycle unfolds.”

Use of Proceeds

Proceeds from the Offerings were used to:

Repurchase $200 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 6.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030.

Add approximately $474 million of cash to the balance sheet as adjusted for the Offerings, net of initial purchaser discounts and commissions, prior to the deduction of expenses.

Department of Energy Warrants

Concurrently, the Company announced the issuance to the U.S. Department of Energy of a warrant to purchase up to 570,000 shares of common stock. As part of the Trump Administration’s review of the Office of Energy Dominance Financing loan portfolio, both parties collaborated to strengthen the transaction structure: Eos secured from the DOE the flexibility to pursue advantageous private market capital as its business scales rapidly, while the DOE gained the mechanism to share in potential equity upside that eventually can be converted into additional return for the U.S. government.

Public Warrants

In addition to the financing, and in the fourth quarter, holders of Eos public warrants exercised approximately 7 million warrants prior to the expiration, adding an additional $80.2 million of cash to the balance sheet. The combined effect of the warrants exercised and financing further enhances the Company’s liquidity and advances its path toward sustained manufacturing scale and commercial execution.

[TITLE]Coloradans shouldn’t pay for Xcel’s coal mistakes (Opinion):
[TEXT]
Just last year, Colorado was leading the Mountain West in the transition from dirty coal plants to clean energy. Federal funding was assisting on rural clean energy while coal plant retirement dates were on track to meet the state’s critical climate goals.

How quickly things change.

This year the Trump administration is resisting coal’s decline with unprecedented executive orders and by actively canceling and stalling clean energy projects meant to bring down energy prices, killing thousands of renewable energy jobs.

Unfortunately, some Pueblo County leaders and Congressman Jeff Hurd joined in and informed Colorado regulators that they intend to ask President Trump to keep coal-fired operations at Pueblo’s Comanche 2 and 3 coal units continuing indefinitely.

The sudden push to keep coal burning is a slap in the face to Colorado voters who have supported renewable energy, more affordable bills, and who are demanding cleaner air. Surely they could expect Gov. Polis to step in to defend the state’s critical climate goals, right?

Apparently not. In a shocking twist, the state of Colorado just sided with Xcel Energy and petitioned regulators to keep the Comanche 2 unit open past its retirement date scheduled for the end of the year to cover for Comanche 3’s most recent, massive outage.

In effect, this agreement would allow Xcel Energy to charge customers for its own mistakes. If approved, Xcel Energy can run Comanche 2 for an additional year without clear guidelines to restrict pollution. This means the company could run Comanche 2 past its retirement date in addition to Comanche 3 once it’s repaired. Instead of one coal unit burning in 2026, there could be two — a full abandonment of previous commitments, which could increase air pollution and potentially raise energy costs for Coloradans.

Comanche 3 has been a reliability disaster and its pollution contributes to disease and cancer. Given its high cost–both financially and in its toll on public health–and its frequent outages, backtracking on coal retirements has nothing but downsides for Pueblo and Xcel ratepayers.

As a local environmental justice policy advocate, I’ve participated in an enormous amount of debates over what to do
