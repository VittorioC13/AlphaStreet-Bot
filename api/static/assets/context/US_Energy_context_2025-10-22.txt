[TITLE]Kurdistan’s Oil Exports Top 200,000 Bpd amid Fragile New Deal:
[TEXT]
Crude oil exports from Iraq’s semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan have reached 205,000 barrels per day (bpd), but the oil flows via a pipeline to the Turkish point of Ceyhan could be under threat again.

Oil exports from Iraq’s northern region of Kurdistan via the Iraq-Türkiye Pipeline to Ceyhan resumed on September 27, after two and a half years of halt over disagreements between the federal Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) over how export revenues should be distributed.

Crude from Kurdistan is now steadily flowing at a rate of about 205,000 bpd, according to details on output and exports obtained by the Kurdistan24 news outlet.

Yet, the fragile three-party agreement signed by the federal Iraqi government, the KRG, and most of the foreign firm operating in Kurdistan could unravel, the Kurdish website reports.

The federal government in Baghdad has reportedly failed to adhere to the agreement—it has failed to pay to the international oil companies their contractually obligated financial dues to cover operational costs and investment returns, according to Kurdistan24.

Eight foreign companies operating in Kurdistan have signed agreements with the KRG and the Federal Government of Iraq to enable the restart of international crude exports from the region.

This agreement paved to way to the restart of exports, which were halted for two and a half years, after they were shut in in March 2023 due to a dispute over who should authorize the Kurdish exports.

The federal government in Baghdad and the regional Kurdish government in Erbil squabbled for more than two years over who should be responsible for the oil exports and the subsequent revenue distribution.

Under the agreement to restart oil exports, hailed as historic by Iraq’s federal government, KRG began delivering at the end of September about 190,000 bpd of crude to Iraqi state marketing company SOMO. Kurdistan is also entitled to keep 50,000 bpd to use for local consumption.

[TITLE]OPEC Chief: The World Needs $18.2 Trillion in Oil and Gas Investment:
[TEXT]
OPEC highlights the International Energy Agency's (IEA) shift in narrative regarding new oil and gas investments, while consistently advocating for timely investments to meet growing demand and offset decline rates.

Primary energy demand is expected to increase by 23% by 2050, with oil still accounting for 30% of total global energy consumption, necessitating $18.2 trillion in oil industry investment.

OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais emphasizes the critical need for continued investment in oil and gas, projecting their substantial role in the global energy mix until 2050.

The world needs more investment in oil and gas as they will continue to account for a large part of the global energy mix in 2050, OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais said on Wednesday, reiterating the cartel’s view that investment in new supply will be needed in the foreseeable future.

Primary energy demand will jump by 23% by 2050, Al Ghais said in remarks to the Russian Energy Week conference in Moscow, as carried by Reuters.

And oil will still represent 30% of total global energy consumption in 2050, OPEC’s Secretary General said.

Growing economies, urbanization, and rising population numbers lead “to one clear signal that the world will need much more energy than it is consuming today,” Al Ghais added.

Earlier this year, OPEC said in its annual World Oil Outlook (WOO) that oil demand is set to continue rising through 2050, with consumption expected at 123 million barrels per day (bpd) then, up from about 104 million bpd this year.

The world needs global oil industry investment of $18.2 trillion out to 2050, Al Ghais wrote in a foreword to the outlook.

“It is vital that these investments are made for consumers and producers everywhere, as well as for the effective functioning of the global economy at large,” he added.

Last month, OPEC noted the “cautionary tale” of the International Energy Agency (IEA). The agency said in a new report that the world needs to develop new oil and gas resources just to keep output flat amid faster declining rates at existing fields, in a major shift in its narrative from 2021 that ‘no new investment’ is needed in a net-zero by 2050 scenario.

Acknowledging the IEA’s U-turn, OPEC said that “However, the IEA has not referenced how its own advocacy of its Net Zero Emissions Scenario or its own prognosis of peak oil demand have discouraged investments and contributed to uncertainty about long-term oil demand.”

“In contrast to the IEA’s U-turning on this important issue, OPEC has consistently advocated for timely investments in the oil industry to account for decline rates and meet growing demand,” OPEC said, commenting on the IEA’s new stance.

“It is vital that all stakeholders are consistent in recognizing this and do not return to rhetoric that there should be no investment in new oil projects.”

[TITLE]China’s Battery Giants Flood Overseas Markets As Exports Surge 220%:
[TEXT]
Last year, China's battery industry average utilization rate cratered to just a third of maximum capacity amid severe overcapacity following years of massive investment and expansion. This put smaller manufacturers under severe pressure and fueled further industry consolidation, while also forcing producers to increasingly seek overseas markets. Luckily, these efforts appear to be paying off: China Energy Storage Alliance has reported that Chinese battery storage forms secured ~200 overseas orders totalling 186 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the first half of this year, good for a more than 220% year-over-year surge. Not surprisingly, just 5.34 GWh– less than 3% of the total--came from the United States amid hefty tariffs by the Trump administration compared to nearly 60% that came from the Middle East, Europe and Australia.

Back in April, the Trump administration imposed duties of up to 3,521% on solar imports from Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand, with the finalized tariffs applying to shipments from China’s solar heavyweights, including JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) and Trina Solar. Further, Chinese firms are increasingly diversifying their production bases in a bid to mitigate growing tariff risks from Washington. Currently, Chinese solar manufacturers have installed ~80% of overseas capacity including solar wafers, solar cells and modules in Southeast Asia.

“The industry used to say that you either go overseas or exit the game,” said Gao Jifan, chairman of Trina Solar. “Now, due to tariffs, simply exporting isn’t enough; you must also localise production abroad.”

China’s battery storage sector is also benefiting from a rebound by the local markets thanks to policy support by Beijing. China’s National Energy Administration recently unveiled a plan to mobilize 250 billion yuan (~$32 billion) in new investment to build 180 gigawatts of new energy storage capacity by 2027. Lately, Chinese companies that operate in the energy storage space have been posting robust growth as fundamentals continue to improve. During the first half of 2025, 47 of 55 listed companies in the Chinese energy storage sector were profitable. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (OTCMKTS:CATL), one of the largest li-ion battery manufacturers in the world, reported H1 2025 operating revenue of RMB178.886 billion ($25.15 billion), good for a 7.3% increase year over year while net profit attributable to shareholders clocked in at RMB30.485 billion, up 33.33%. In its interim report, CATL revealed that sustained rapid growth in demand for energy storage cells driven by the global clean energy transition has been driving its impressive performance.

That said, battery storage expansion is expected to be a global trend: energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie has projected that global investment in battery storage will reach approximately $1.2 trillion by 2034. This investment will be needed to support the installation of over 5,900 GW of new wind and solar capacity during that period. The report emphasizes that advanced, grid-forming battery technology is crucial for maintaining grid stability as renewable energy sources become more prevalent.

U.S. Battery Storage Explodes

For years, battery systems have only played a marginal role in U.S. electricity networks, with power utilities focusing more on building out capacity from natural gas plants and renewable energy sources. According to energy data portal Cleanview, five years ago, the United States had 74 times more wind farm capacity and 30 times more solar capacity than battery capacity within its power generation system.

However, steady cost declines coupled with rising energy density levels have encouraged utilities to ramp up their battery installations, with battery storage output now exceeding other power sources in certain power markets. And, it’s boom time for the U.S. utility-scale battery storage market: currently, there are only around 5 times more solar and wind capacity in the country compared to battery capacity, thanks in large part to a 40% decline in battery prices since 2022. Currently, 19 states have installed 100 MW or more of utility-scale battery storage. According to Cleanview, there are just under 30,000 megawatts (MW) of utility battery capacity across the U.S., good for a massive 15-fold increase since 2020. For some context, the U.S. solar sector has added 84,200 MW over the timeframe, while the wind sector has increased its capacity by just 7,000 MW. Falling costs is the biggest reason for the surge in U.S. battery deployments: according to financial advisory and asset management firm Lazard the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for utility-scale solar farms paired with batteries ranges from $50-$131 per megawatt hour (MWh). This makes the pair competitive with new natural gas peaking plants (LCOE of $47 to $170 per MWh) and even new coal-fired plants with LCOE of $114 per MWh.

According to Lazard's 2025 LCOE+ report, new-build renewable energy power plants are the most competitive form of power generation on an unsubsidized basis (i.e., without tax subsidies). This is highly significant in the current era of unprecedented power demand growth in large part due to the AI boom and clean energy manufacturing. Renewables also stand out as the quickest-to-deploy generation resource, with the solar plus battery combination often boasting far shorter deployment times compared to constructing new natural gas power plants. California is, by far, the national leader in utility-scale battery storage, accounting for ~13,000 MW or about 42% of the national total. According to the California Energy Commission, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has installed ~21,000 MW of solar capacity and ~12,400 MW of battery capacity, allowing the state to rely heavily on batteries during peak demand periods.

Republican lawmakers on Monday moved to declare Coal Week, amplifying the Trump administration’s push to expand U.S. coal output and keep aging plants online, the Washington Times reported. The resolution coincides with new executive actions to “reinvigorate” coal, including directives signed in April to boost production and preserve baseload capacity, as outlined in a White House executive order.

The message to miners and utilities is that federal support is rising for coal as part of an energy-security agenda centered on domestic supply.

[TITLE]Why Jet Engines Could Power the AI Data Centers Boom:
[TEXT]
Data-center developers are running into a severe power bottleneck as they rush to build bigger facilities to capitalize on generative AI’s potential. Normally, they would power these centers by connecting to the grid or building a power plant onsite. However, they face major delays in either securing gas turbines or in obtaining energy from the grid.

At the Data Center World Power show in San Antonio in October, natural-gas power provider ProEnergy revealed an alternative—repurposed aviation engines. According to Landon Tessmer, vice president of commercial operations at ProEnergy, some data centers are using his company’s PE6000 gas turbines to provide the power needed during the data center’s construction and during its first few years of operation. When grid power is available, these machines either revert to a backup role, supplement the grid, or are sold to the local utility.

“We have sold 21 gas turbines for two data-center projects amounting to more than 1 gigawatt,” says Tessmer. “Both projects are expected to provide bridging power for five to seven years, which is when they expect to have grid interconnection and no longer need permanent behind-the-meter generation.”

Bridging Power Gaps With a New Kind of Aeroderivative Turbine

It is a common and long-established practice for gas-turbine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like GE Vernova and Siemens Energy to convert a successful aircraft engine for stationary electric-power generation applications. Known as aeroderivative gas turbines, these machines have carved out a niche for themselves because they’re lighter, smaller, and more easily maintained than traditional heavy-frame gas turbines.

“It takes a lot to industrialize an aviation engine and make it generate power,” says Mark Axford, President of Axford Turbine Consultants, a gas-turbine consultant and a valuation expert for used turbines.

For example, GE Vernova’s LM6000 gas turbine was derived from GE’s successful CF6-80C2 turbofan engine which was widely used on commercial jets. The CF6-80C2 was first released in 1985, and the LM6000 appeared on the market five years later. To make it suitable for power generation, it needed an expanded turbine section to convert engine thrust into shaft power, a series of struts and supports to mount it on a concrete deck or steel frame, and new controls. Further modifications typically include the development of fuel nozzles that let the machine run on natural gas rather than aviation fuel, and a combustor that minimizes the emission of nitrogen oxides, a major pollutant.

“There just aren’t enough gas turbines to go around and the problem is probably going to get worse,” says Paul Browning, CEO of Generative Power Solutions, formerly the head of GE Power & Water (now GE Vernova) and Mitsubishi Power. Contact GE Vernova to order an LM6000 today and you might be told the waiting list is anywhere from three to five years. You’d hear the same from Siemens Energy for its SGT-A35 aeroderivative gas turbine. Some large, popular, models have even longer waiting lists.

For contrast, “a PE6000 from ProEnergy can be delivered in 2027,” Tessmer says.

ProEnergy buys and overhauls used CF6-80C2 engine cores—the central part of the engine where combustion occurs—and matches them with newly manufactured aeroderivative parts made either by ProEnergy or its partners. After assembly and testing, these refurbished engines are ready for a second life in electric-power generation, where they provide 48 megawatts, enough to power a small-to-medium data center (or a town of perhaps 20,000 to 40,000 households). According to Tessmer, approximately 1,000 of these aircraft engines are expected to be retired over the next decade, so there’s no shortage of them. A large data center may have demand that exceeds 100 MW, and some of the latest data centers being designed for AI are more than 1 GW.

An overhaul returns an engine and its components to as-new condition. Each of its thousands of parts are disassembled, cleaned, inspected, and then repaired or replaced as needed. In this way, the engine is renewed for another long cycle of run time. Apart from the engine core, every part inside the PE6000 turbine is manufactured to ProEnergy’s specifications. “We can overhaul the high-pressure core of any CF6-80C2 and fabricate all the low-pressure components,” Tessmer adds.

ProEnergy sells two-turbine blocks with the standard configuration. It consists of gas turbines, generators, and a host of other gear, such as systems to cool the air entering the turbine during hot days as a way to boost performance, selective catalytic reduction systems to reduce emissions, and various electrical systems. The company focuses solely on one engine, the CF6-80C2, to streamline and simplify engineering and maintenance.

The PE6000 was originally intended for use by utilities that needed more capacity during peak hours. The data-center boom has turned that expectation on its head—data-center operators want these engines to provide power to the entire facility. They run on natural gas and, when being started, can be up and running in 5 minutes. If one needs maintenance, it can be swapped out with a spare within 72 hours. Emissions levels average 2.5 parts per million for nitrogen oxide, which is well below EPA-regulated levels (generally below 10 to below 25 parts per million, depending on the use case). Since 2020, ProEnergy has fabricated 75 PE6000 packages and now has another 52 being assembled or on order.

Lengthy Grid-Connection Delays Mean More Business

Multiple factors contribute to this popularity. Besides the surge in data centers, there’s often a lengthy wait for transmission lines, which may face local opposition and require permits from multiple municipalities or states. “Aeroderivative gas turbines are gaining ground as a bridging technology that runs behind the meter until the utility is able to supply grid power,” says Tessmer.

Tessmer has seen examples of eight-to-ten-year delays on permitting alone. If connecting to the grid continues to take years, at least in some areas, and if gas turbine manufacturers don’t dramatically boost output, bridging power could become an indispensable enabler of the buildout of AI infrastructure.
