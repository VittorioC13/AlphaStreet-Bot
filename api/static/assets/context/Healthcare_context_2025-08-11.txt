Austin, TX, Aug. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HID, a worldwide leader in trusted identity solutions, today announced it has acquired Intelligent Observation, a leading platform provider for hand hygiene compliance, designed to enable healthcare facilities to reduce hospital acquired infections (HAIs) through proper hand hygiene practices. The addition of Intelligent Observation expands HID’s offering and relevance in the Healthcare RTLS space to further meet the growing needs of healthcare facilities.

“Patients enter the hospital looking to get better, not to catch an infection,” said Björn Lidefelt, EVP and Head of HID. “Welcoming Intelligent Observation into our RTLS portfolio enables healthcare providers to prevent hospital acquired infections and create a safer patient experience.”

The Intelligent Observation platform includes hardware that detects when healthcare workers are near a hand sanitation area, and records whether the individual sanitizes appropriately. The results are then communicated to Intelligent Observation’s cloud-based dashboard where data is stored and formulated into reports. The platform utilizes SaaS and near-field magnetic induction (NFMI) technology, which enables efficient compliance reporting and tracking for hospital administrators.

The patented platform consists of wearable NFMI devices, which are worn by healthcare staff and offer centimeter-level location accuracy, as well as an interactive SaaS dashboard that provides near real-time, granular compliance data to healthcare administrators. For example, administrators can view data across facilities, at the facility level, and even view room-level compliance, including isolation rooms.

Provided information from the dashboard includes handwashing duration with soap and water, as well as easy to use infection tracing tools. Furthermore, the platform can generate individual hand hygiene scorecards that are delivered directly to the inbox of staff to self-monitor and inform employee training.

Marc Bielmann, SVP and Head of Identification Technologies, HID, said, “We are committed to providing a robust, best-in-class RTLS experience to help healthcare facilities meet their growing needs. Adding Intelligent Observation is yet another step in our journey to enabling safe and efficient workplaces using real-time location data.”

Founded in 2019 and headquartered in Miami, Florida, Intelligent Observation is now part of HID’s Identification Technologies Business Area. The Intelligent Observation platform will merge into HID’s RTLS Business Unit and benefit from HID’s sales and other global functions to support its offering.

“At Intelligent Observation, we are dedicated to reducing HAIs through innovative and intuitive technologies,” said Seth Freedman, CEO, Intelligent Observation. “Now, as part of HID, we are excited to continue this mission and help even more healthcare professionals where it matters most.”

[TEXT]
VERO BEACH, Fla., Aug. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Processa Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: PCSA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing Next Generation Cancer (NGC) therapies for cancer patients, today announced that it has secured a strategic investment and that it is evaluating corporate cryptocurrency treasury strategies as part of its broader financial and growth objectives.

We believe that strategic engagement with emerging financial technologies, including select cryptocurrencies with potential yield-generating capabilities, may offer novel avenues to diversify our capital base and enhance financial flexibility, while providing an opportunity for long-term value creation.

While we remain committed to rigorous compliance with all applicable regulatory standards, we recognize the potential for blockchain-based assets to contribute meaningfully to the funding of our clinical development programs. This approach could allow us to reduce dilution for existing shareholders, access additional sources of capital, and position the company at the forefront of biotech-fintech convergence.

We are evaluating these opportunities with a focus on long-term value creation, transparency, and responsible stewardship of investor capital.

George Ng, CEO of Processa stated, “We continue to deliver on the operational commitments, seeking meaningful therapies for patients, while exploring innovative financial strategies that can support optimal outcomes for Processa’s shareholders and stakeholders.”

[TITLE]HID Acquires Intelligent Observation to Strengthen Its Healthcare RTLS Portfolio:
[TEXT]
Austin, TX, Aug. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HID, a worldwide leader in trusted identity solutions, today announced it has acquired Intelligent Observation, a leading platform provider for hand hygiene compliance, designed to enable healthcare facilities to reduce hospital acquired infections (HAIs) through proper hand hygiene practices. The addition of Intelligent Observation expands HID’s offering and relevance in the Healthcare RTLS space to further meet the growing needs of healthcare facilities.

“Patients enter the hospital looking to get better, not to catch an infection,” said Björn Lidefelt, EVP and Head of HID. “Welcoming Intelligent Observation into our RTLS portfolio enables healthcare providers to prevent hospital acquired infections and create a safer patient experience.”

The Intelligent Observation platform includes hardware that detects when healthcare workers are near a hand sanitation area, and records whether the individual sanitizes appropriately. The results are then communicated to Intelligent Observation’s cloud-based dashboard where data is stored and formulated into reports. The platform utilizes SaaS and near-field magnetic induction (NFMI) technology, which enables efficient compliance reporting and tracking for hospital administrators.

The patented platform consists of wearable NFMI devices, which are worn by healthcare staff and offer centimeter-level location accuracy, as well as an interactive SaaS dashboard that provides near real-time, granular compliance data to healthcare administrators. For example, administrators can view data across facilities, at the facility level, and even view room-level compliance, including isolation rooms.

Provided information from the dashboard includes handwashing duration with soap and water, as well as easy to use infection tracing tools. Furthermore, the platform can generate individual hand hygiene scorecards that are delivered directly to the inbox of staff to self-monitor and inform employee training.

Marc Bielmann, SVP and Head of Identification Technologies, HID, said, “We are committed to providing a robust, best-in-class RTLS experience to help healthcare facilities meet their growing needs. Adding Intelligent Observation is yet another step in our journey to enabling safe and efficient workplaces using real-time location data.”

Founded in 2019 and headquartered in Miami, Florida, Intelligent Observation is now part of HID’s Identification Technologies Business Area. The Intelligent Observation platform will merge into HID’s RTLS Business Unit and benefit from HID’s sales and other global functions to support its offering.

“At Intelligent Observation, we are dedicated to reducing HAIs through innovative and intuitive technologies,” said Seth Freedman, CEO, Intelligent Observation. “Now, as part of HID, we are excited to continue this mission and help even more healthcare professionals where it matters most.”

[TITLE]Capsa Healthcare Acquires BlueBin to Advance Intelligent Clinical Supply Management:
[TEXT]
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capsa Healthcare, a leader in healthcare workflow and supply management solutions, today announced the acquisition of BlueBin, a recognized innovator in Kanban-based supply chain systems and predictive analytics for healthcare. This strategic move brings together two complementary capabilities that together enhance visibility, efficiency, and reliability across the entire clinical supply chain.

By integrating BlueBin’s proven methodologies and analytics with Capsa’s point-of-care and supply management technologies, the combined solution aims to reduce operational friction, improve supply availability, and return valuable time to clinical teams.

“Healthcare systems are under increasing pressure to do more with less—clinically, operationally, and financially,” said Gaurav Agarwal, Chief Executive Officer at Capsa Healthcare. “This acquisition reflects our continued commitment to developing intelligent infrastructure that equips, enables, and engineers solutions to free up clinical care and deliver measurable financial results.”

BlueBin’s solutions are currently deployed in over 250 hospitals, with a strong track record of client retention and operational impact. At Memorial Hermann Health System, BlueBin’s Kanban implementation led to $4 million in annual supply savings and an additional $2.4 million in operational efficiencies.

The BlueBin acquisition reinforces Capsa’s capability to optimize healthcare operations, reduce waste, and enhance patient care.

Clinical Focus: Reduces time clinicians spend on supply-related tasks, allowing more time for patient care

Operational Visibility: Provides real-time data on inventory levels and usage patterns

Financial Efficiency: Helps reduce supply costs and optimize inventory levels

Space Utilization: Minimizes storage footprint, freeing up space for clinical use

BlueBin’s leadership and implementation model will remain in place, with Charles Hodge continuing as President and CEO. His team’s hands-on, community-based approach to implementation will ensure continuity and success for current and future clients.

“This partnership allows us to scale our mission of ensuring the right supplies reach the right place at the right time,” said Hodge. “Together with Capsa, we’re building a smarter, more responsive supply chain that supports both caregivers and patients.”

With this acquisition, Capsa Healthcare becomes the only provider offering a complete clinical supply management solution—from warehouse to bedside—through a single partner.
