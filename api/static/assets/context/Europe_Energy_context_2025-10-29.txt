[TITLE]Energy Demands Fuel Global Nuclear Revival, With 262 Small Modular Reactors to Be Deployed by 2040:
[TEXT]
LONDON, Oct. 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Rapid industrial electrification, green energy imperatives, skyrocketing data center deployments, and transmission and distribution grid capacity constraints are prompting energy stakeholders to adjust the energy mix in favor of nuclear power through Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). According to a new report from global technology intelligence firm ABI Research, 262 SMRs will be deployed globally by 2040, representing an aggregated energy generation capacity of 42 gigawatts (GW). While significant momentum is not expected until 2030, strong growth is anticipated in the second half of the next decade.

2024 Logo

"SMRs offer a wide range of benefits," said Dominique Bonte, Vice President, End Markets and Verticals. "Their inherent upgradeability, flexibility, scalability, and rapid deployability make them suitable for a wider range of more granular, grid-based, and on-site deployment scenarios, such as data centers and industrial sites."

SMRs provide clean, reliable, high-density, load-following energy sources within small security perimeters, reducing permitting complexity. Moreover, a new generation of SMR designs feature innovative fail-safe passive safety mechanisms and improved sustainability through nuclear waste recycling and optimized lifecycle management, both of which will be instrumental in establishing a more favorable public opinion.

The fledgling SMR ecosystem comprises both established companies such as Rolls Royce SMR and GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy, with a long tail of challengers and startups like X-energy, NuScale Power, Aalo Atomics, Holtec, Oklo, Moltex Energy, Stellaria, and Deep Atomic. It benefits from government support in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as from a healthy investment climate, with startups like NuScale Power and Oklo having gone public and players like X-energy raising private funding from investors including Amazon.

The main barriers to SMR adoption include long regulatory approval cycles for new nuclear designs, as well as lengthy site permitting and environmental impact assessments. While regulators will hold the keys to SMR success, it's unlikely that a timely alternative capable of meeting future clean energy demands will emerge, with fusion prospects still remote. For most governments, going ahead with SMRs will be very tempting and, in some cases, even unavoidable, to prevent economic slowdowns caused by energy constraints, particularly when it concerns powering the GW datacenters of the future.

These findings are from ABI Research's Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) – Technologies, Applications, and Forecasts application analysis report, part of the company's Smart Energy research service, which includes research, data, and ABI Insights.

[TITLE]New Study: Plug-In Hybrid EVs Nearly As Dirty As Gas Vehicles:
[TEXT]
Electric vehicle skeptics often squawk that battery-electric vehicles like Teslas are nowhere nearly as friendly to the environment as their proponents claim. Well, the truth is a bit more nuanced. Whereas the initial manufacturing of EVs, particularly their batteries, does have a significantly higher carbon footprint than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, many life cycle assessments consistently show that EVs have significantly lower total greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline or diesel vehicles once they are on the road. Unfortunately, this does not apply equally for all BEVs: a new study by Transport and Environment (T&E) has revealed that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) have a carbon and emissions footprint in real life conditions comparable to gas cars, much higher than previously thought.

A T&E analysis of 127,000 PHEVs registered in the EU in 2023 found that they emit 135g of CO2 per km on average, more than 80% of the 166g of CO2/km produced by petrol and diesel vehicles on average. This means PHEVs produce nearly 5x higher C02 emissions in the real world compared to levels recorded under lab-conditions, and that they lower emissions by only 19% compared to ICEs and not the 75% figure often cited by manufacturers.

Not to be confused with traditional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the main difference between PHEVs and HEVs is that PHEVs have a larger battery that can be charged externally, while HEVs use a smaller battery that is recharged internally through regenerative braking and the gasoline engine. This allows PHEVs to drive significantly longer distances on electricity alone, whereas HEVs primarily rely on the gasoline engine with the electric motor acting as a support for better fuel efficiency. Unfortunately, the larger and heavier batteries in PHEVs result in higher fuel consumption and increased emissions. PHEVs fire up gas engines to provide extra power under demanding driving conditions such as higher speeds or steep inclines, leading to a consumption of ~3 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers even while operating in electric mode. This results in PHEVs emission 68g of CO2 per kilometer when operating on an electric-only-mode, or

[TITLE]New dynamics over Russian oil:
[TEXT]
The US President, Donald Trump, believes that imposing sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies will impact Kremlin’s finances. According to reports, Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has said they will not have much of an impact on its economy.

While the two battle it out, what it will do is test the diplomatic strength of big oil consumers like India and the overall vulnerability of the global oil market due to uncertainty in pricing. No sooner were the sanctions announced, there was a spike in prices before stabilising.

Technically, Indian refiners are not banned from buying Russian-origin crude, but they must avoid transactions with the sanctioned companies and their subsidiaries.

On its part, India has been maintaining the stance that its economy comes first and wherever it gets cheap oil it will opt for it. There has been no diktat yet to the oil companies to cut down on sourcing Russian oil, according to those associated with the developments.

The concern for New Delhi is not supply but pricing. As much as 85-90 per cent of India’s crude requirement is met through imports. The Budget has taken an average of $70/barrel for crude pricing; as of October 24, 2025, Indian refiners sourced their crude oil at $68.37 a barrel.

Not only India, even the US will be affected by high crude oil prices.

According to energy expert Narendra Taneja, “Rosneft and Lukoil are key players in the global oil supply system. Rosneft, in fact, is the third biggest producer in the world. The American president has sanctioned these two big Russian corporations, but not the Russian oil per se — so there are still no American or European sanctions on Russian oil. The American game is clear: harass the buyers of Russian oil without causing any significant disruption in the supply of Russian oil into the global oil supply chains.”

The two sanctioned companies are estimated to account for 50 per cent of Russia’s oil production. Therefore, prices can hurt even if supplies are not a problem.

“Clearly, the US has left enough headroom for Russian oil to find its way for exports one way or another. Trump knows any major disruption in oil supply from Russia will lead to higher oil prices, hitting American economy and his loyal voters the most.... However, the fear of secondary sanctions by the US against any buyer of Russian crude is real and may force many buyers to recalibrate their sourcing strategy,” Taneja added.

“My sense is Trump does not want to go full force after Moscow yet, leaving all channels open for negotiations on Ukraine. Given a chance, Trump wants to build business bonhomie with the Kremlin,” he said, adding “therefore, let us wait and watch how all this new sanctions business go.”

Array of obstacles

According to Umud Shokri, Energy Strategist and Senior Visiting Fellow at George Mason University, “By hitting Rosneft and Lukoil, Washington anticipates generating formidable hurdles for any business dealings with them, effectively curbing Russia’s petroleum outflows and eroding its energy-driven income streams. For India, a top importer of Russian oil, these measures pose a thorny array of obstacles.”

Major Indian refineries — both public and private — depend heavily on Russian supplies routed through pathways dominated or shaped by Rosneft and Lukoil, he said, adding that “the penalties heighten the threat of delivery interruptions and regulatory entanglements, compelling these operators to swiftly overhaul their sourcing tactics. To sustain vital inputs for refining and chemical production, India might need to broaden its supplier base or pivot to unaffected Russian intermediaries and traders.”

“The impending November 21 enforcement date injects immediate pressure, demanding that refineries adapt to shifting regulatory landscapes and supply chains in a compressed time-frame. Even if Indian purchasers turn to round

[TITLE]EU Climate Ambitions Face Mounting Political Opposition:
[TEXT]
Europe’s clean-energy crusade has hit a wall of its own making. The EU’s leaders vowed to slash emissions by 90% by 2040, but as electricity bills climb and factories falter, the political consensus that once seemed unshakable is beginning to crack. What began as a climate ambition is turning into an economic rebellion.

Next month will see world leaders gather for COP30—the climate conference that sees countries make political and financial pledges in a bid to arrest what many argue is irreversible planetary destruction. This year, the EU has been uncharacteristically slow in finalizing its latest round of pledges. The reason for this tardiness was a rising wave of criticism from some EU member states that have started feeling the pinch of transition costs.

The advertising said switching to wind and solar will lower electricity bills. Reality suggests it has been the other way round: wind and solar need to be backed up by baseload generation, and that generation needs financial support to keep standing by for when needed, adding to electricity bills instead of lowering them. Governments have also increased taxation on electricity to be able to financially support that very same transition that would, the argument goes, ultimately make energy so very cheap.

That moment is far in the future, if there at all. In the meantime, Europeans are struggling to make ends meet because when energy is expensive, everything else is expensive as well. Their leaders are struggling to convince their voters they would need to endure more pain to make the transition work—except there is zero certainty it would work, even with more financial pain. The reason: the EU’s overwhelming dependence on imports. The European Union, unlike China, cannot pursue the energy transition safe in the knowledge that it is using its own resources and boosting its own economy. The European Union is almost entirely dependent on resources from overseas to pursue the energy transition it views as vital and unquestionably necessary.

In fairness, China overdid the economic boost through stimulating transition-related industries. In Europe, the opposite is happening: the dependence on imported raw materials and components, stemming from rising local energy costs that are hurting the competitiveness of local manufacturers, has led to creeping deindustrialization. It is this deindustrialization that has pitted national leaders against the central ruling organ of the bloc and stalled the push for new net-zero pledges ahead of COP30. The consensus on the unquestionable nature of the transition is pretty much gone.

“There’s a concern that the cost of emissions-reduction regulations could fuel inflation alongside high energy costs that have already been hurting the EU’s industrial competitiveness,” one BloombergNEF told its sister publication, commenting on the EU’s troubles in finalizing its 2040 emission reduction targets. Those were supposed to be finalized last week, and it was, in a way—with some pretty major concessions to critics of the current political trajectory of the bloc. Just a year ago, these concessions would have been unthinkable. Now, they are just the start of what could end up being an unwinding of the net-zero narrative.

The 2035 ban on the sales of internal combustion engine cars, for instance, will be subject to a review to see if it is still achievable, which it is not and has never been, despite all the subsidies being thrown at EV makers and buyers. Even with all these subsidies, electric cars remain a small portion of the total car fleet on EU roads.

Carbon credits were also discussed as a means of pursuing the 2040 net-zero target instead of direct emissions cuts, which some national leaders argue would wreck their economies—and they are not wrong. “These ideological proposals [2040 climate target] are more proof that Brussels bureaucrats have already lost basic contact with reality. They have no idea what economic danger the European, and unfortunately, the Slovak industry is in,” Slovakia’s environment minister, Tomas Taraba, said last month in comments on the net-zero target discussions.

The frank statement reflects the views of many business executives not only in Slovakia but across the EU. Warnings about compromised competitiveness because of exorbitant energy costs have been raining down on Brussels for years now. Brussels, that is, the European Commission, has been promising to do something about it, but without interfering with its emission-cutting plans. So far, the best it has come up with is extending the emission-trading scheme that would lead to further hikes in costs as it penalizes the transport sector and households for using hydrocarbon energy, and cutting red tape for wind and solar.

Wind and solar, by the way, are struggling because overcapacity is more frequently leading to negative electricity prices, which have compromised the profitability of developers and operators, making them rethink their future investment plans. The EU leadership has a lot on its plate, and the meal’s name is Reality Check. "We need decarbonization, but decarbonization must never mean deindustrialization,” the German finance minister said recently. That’s quite a conundrum.

[TITLE]Petrofac's 7,300 Jobs at Risk:
[TEXT]
UK energy services provider Petrofac Ltd has filed to enter administration after the latest plans to restructure its balance sheet unexpectedly fell through, putting thousands of jobs at risk.

The company has applied to the High Court of England and Wales to appoint administrators, according to a statement on Monday. It comes after European grid operator TenneT canceled Petrofac’s work at a large offshore energy project in the North Sea, rendering the financial restructuring unviable.

The firm employs around 7,300 people globally and has been trying to strike a deal with creditors for over a year, while safeguarding key business deals that could keep the firm afloat. Its collapse would raise the pressure on the UK government to protect British jobs, with the Labour administration already coming under fire for blocking new North Sea oil licenses.

[TITLE]Trump Drops Hammer on Russia’s Oil Giants. Will He Follow Through?:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump appears to have come to the view long-held by others who know how his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin operates that the war in Ukraine must finally cause him hard-hitting consequences before it can come to an end. After all, the Little Emperor’s geopolitical game plan has always been to keep pushing until he runs into a force greater than his own, whether that is in Ukraine or further westwards in Europe. Indeed, the only reason that Putin did not use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine after it was apparent his forces would not secure the seven-day victory he had anticipated was that it was made clear to him that if he did so then Washington and its allies would destroy Russia’s troops and equipment in Ukraine, as well as sink its Black Sea fleet, according to former CIA director and retired four-star army general David Petraeus. As it now stands, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte aptly said last week: “The truth is that Putin is running out of money, troops, and ideas. President Trump said it very well: ‘They should stop where they are now’. And now it’s high time to increase pressure on Russia, so we can finally get a fair and just peace for Ukraine.” One step away from direct military engagement of the Russian military on Ukrainian soil by NATO forces is the full use of Tomahawk cruise missiles that could strike deep into Russia, including Moscow, and one step before that is choking off the financing for the war. As most of this comes from Russia’s continued oil and gas exports, this is what the U.S. and European Union (E.U.) of 27 countries focused on last week.

[TITLE]Wind power has saved UK consumers over £100 billion since 2010 – new study:
[TEXT]
Renewable energy is often pitched as cheaper to produce than fossil fuel energy. To quantify whether this is true, we have been studying the financial impact of expanding wind energy in the UK. Our results are surprising.

From 2010 to 2023, wind power delivered a benefit of £147.5 billion — £14.2 billion from lower electricity prices and £133.3 billion from reduced natural gas prices. If we offset the £43.2 billion in wind energy subsidies, UK consumers saved £104.3 billion compared with what their energy bills would have been without investment in wind generation.

UK wind energy production has transformed over the past 15 years. In 2010, more than 75% of electricity was generated from fossil fuels. By 2025, coal has ceased and wind is the largest source of power at 30% – more than natural gas at 26%.

This massive expansion of UK offshore wind is partly due to UK government subsidies. The Contracts for Difference scheme provides a guaranteed price for electricity generated, so when the price drops below this level, electricity producers still get the same amount of money.

The expansion is also partly due to how well UK conditions suit offshore wind. The North Sea provides both ample winds and relatively shallow waters that make installation more accessible.

The positive contribution of wind power to reducing the UK’s carbon footprint is well known. According to Christopher Vogel, a professor of engineering who specialises in offshore renewables at the University of Oxford, wind turbines in the UK recoup the energy used in their manufacture, transport and installation within 12-to-24 months, and they can generate electricity for 20-to-25 years. The financial benefits of wind power have largely been overlooked though, until now.

Our study explores the economics of wind in the energy system. We take a long-term modelling approach and consider what would happen if the UK had continued to invest in gas instead of wind generation. In this scenario, the result is a significant increased demand for gas and therefore higher prices. Unlike previous short-term modelling studies, this approach highlights the longer-term financial benefit that wind has delivered to the UK consumer.

Central to this study is the assumption that without the additional wind energy, the UK would have needed new gas capacity. This alternative scenario of gas rather than wind generation in Europe implies an annual, ongoing increase in UK demand for gas larger than the reduction in Russian pipeline gas that caused the energy crisis of 2022.

Given the significant increase in the cost of natural gas, we calculate the UK would have paid an extra £133.3 billion for energy between 2010 and 2023.

There was also a direct financial benefit from wind generation in lower electricity prices –

[TITLE]NewHydrogen Reveals Massive Source of Heat for ThermoLoop:
[TEXT]
The Company’s technical team has determined that the immense heat generated by current and future power plants can be used to power its ThermoLoop process

SANTA CLARITA, Calif., Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NewHydrogen, Inc. (OTCQB: NEWH), the developer of ThermoLoop™, a breakthrough technology that uses water and heat instead of electricity to produce the world's cheapest clean hydrogen, today revealed that the Company’s technical team has determined that the immense heat generated by current and future power plants can be used to power its ThermoLoop process.

Now under development, ThermoLoop is a novel thermochemical process that uses inexpensive heat instead of expensive electricity to dramatically reduce the cost of clean hydrogen production.

Recently, the NewHydrogen technical team completed preliminary design and economic studies on integrating ThermoLoop with current and future power plants. The team concluded that power plants are an ideal source of constant and reliable baseload heat for powering the ThermoLoop process.

ThermoLoop can be retrofitted into current and future power plants. The benefits of this integration are twofold: power plants produce constant high temperature heat and high temperature steam – the two key ingredients needed for ThermoLoop to make cost-effective clean hydrogen.

In coal, gas or nuclear power plants, heat is produced first and then converted to electricity by mechanical turbine generators with relatively low efficiency. By coupling directly to heat from power plants and chemical process furnaces, ThermoLoop can eliminate most electricity use and overcome fundamental limits that have prevented electrolyzers from unleashing the Hydrogen Economy. The Company believes ThermoLoop has the potential to be far more cost-effective than electrolyzers in both capital and operating cost, unlocking the full potential and benefits of clean hydrogen.

Driven by population growth and the insatiable demand for AI, a substantial number of new power plants will be built in the future, thereby providing an even greater source of distributed, always-on heat to make large amounts of cheap clean hydrogen.

Currently, there are 2,500 coal power plants, 4,500 gas power plants and 440 nuclear power plants in the world. According to the World Nuclear Association, almost all major market research organizations forecast an increasing role for nuclear power as an environmentally benign way of producing reliable electricity on a large scale. The number of coal and gas plants are projected to go down. There are currently 70 nuclear reactors under construction across the world, and 110 new reactors are planned, providing up to 543 gigawatts of power by 2030. These estimates do not include the substantial buildout planned in the United States.

In September 2025, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright, speaking at the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, announced that the United State will add 300 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity by 2050. He noted that the primary way to achieving this goal is through the deployment of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). SMRs are a new class of compact nuclear reactors, ranging from 30 to 1,000 megawatts of thermal energy, designed for distributed power generation to serve datacenters, cities and regions. In 2024, Google signed the world’s first SMR power purchase agreement for up to 500 megawatts, with the first 50-megawatt plant sited in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Highlighting the potential scale, Dr. Eric McFarland, Chief Technology Officer of the Company, stated, “A small 50-megawatt SMR, for example, coupled with ThermoLoop (assuming 50% energy efficiency) could potentially produce approximately 54 metric tons of hydrogen per day. This is enough to fuel 54 standard 1-ton hydrogen fueling stations, handling 10,000 hydrogen fueled passenger vehicle fill-ups per day. This is the kind of scale and high reliability needed to enable a true Hydrogen Economy.”

Steve Hill, CEO, added, “Power plants new or existing, anywhere in the world, could integrate with ThermoLoop to enable around-the-clock, dedicated production or cogeneration of clean hydrogen. Based on our meaningful progress in the lab, we will soon be ready to hold discussions with current and future power plant owners, operators and developers

[TITLE]Wind power has saved UK consumers over £100 billion since 2010 – new study:
[TEXT]
Renewable energy is often pitched as cheaper to produce than fossil fuel energy. To quantify whether this is true, we have been studying the financial impact of expanding wind energy in the UK. Our results are surprising.

From 2010 to 2023, wind power delivered a benefit of £147.5 billion — £14.2 billion from lower electricity prices and £133.3 billion from reduced natural gas prices. If we offset the £43.2 billion in wind energy subsidies, UK consumers saved £104.3 billion compared with what their energy bills would have been without investment in wind generation.

UK wind energy production has transformed over the past 15 years. In 2010, more than 75% of electricity was generated from fossil fuels. By 2025, coal has ceased and wind is the largest source of power at 30% – more than natural gas at 26%.

This massive expansion of UK offshore wind is partly due to UK government subsidies. The Contracts for Difference scheme provides a guaranteed price for electricity generated, so when the price drops below this level, electricity producers still get the same amount of money.

The expansion is also partly due to how well UK conditions suit offshore wind. The North Sea provides both ample winds and relatively shallow waters that make installation more accessible.

The positive contribution of wind power to reducing the UK’s carbon footprint is well known. According to Christopher Vogel, a professor of engineering who specialises in offshore renewables at the University of Oxford, wind turbines in the UK recoup the energy used in their manufacture, transport and installation within 12-to-24 months, and they can generate electricity for 20-to-25 years. The financial benefits of wind power have largely been overlooked though, until now.

Our study explores the economics of wind in the energy system. We take a long-term modelling approach and consider what would happen if the UK had continued to invest in gas instead of wind generation. In this scenario, the result is a significant increased demand for gas and therefore higher prices. Unlike previous short-term modelling studies, this approach highlights the longer-term financial benefit that wind has delivered to the UK consumer.

Central to this study is the assumption that without the additional wind energy, the UK would have needed new gas capacity. This alternative scenario of gas rather than wind generation in Europe implies an annual, ongoing increase in UK demand for gas larger than the reduction in Russian pipeline gas that caused the energy crisis of 2022.

Given the significant increase in the cost of natural gas, we calculate the UK would have paid an extra £133.3 billion for energy between 2010 and 2023.

There was also a direct financial benefit from wind generation in lower electricity prices –

[TITLE]UK Sets £1.08 Billion Offshore Wind Budget In 2030 Push:
[TEXT]
The UK government will offer an annual £1.08 billion support budget for new offshore wind projects under its next renewable electricity auction, with £900 million dedicated to fixed-bottom developments and another £180 million for floating offshore wind farms to be delivered from 2028, the Independent reported.

The government said the expanded budget aims to spur investment in clean power capacity as part of its wider ambition to decarbonize the UK’s electricity grid by 2030, cut household bills, and strengthen energy security. Developers will compete in the next round of Contracts for Difference (CfD) auctions to secure fixed prices per megawatt hour for the power they generate.

“Our competitive new auction process will allow us to buy the right amount of clean power at the right price on behalf of the British people, so we can take back control of our energy,” the Independent cited Energy Minister Michael Shanks as saying, adding that the plan represents “another step towards delivering the clean power this country needs to end our reliance on volatile global gas prices, ensuring our energy security and bringing down bills for good.”

According to Pranav Menon, senior researcher at Aurora Energy Research, the proposed funding may not be sufficient to achieve the government’s clean power targets. Menon told Bloomberg that if auction prices remain similar to last year’s, the allocation would likely secure around 4.9 GW of new capacity, which is well below the 7-9 GW needed to stay on course for the 2030 goal.

The UK aims to boost its offshore wind power capacity to between 43 GW and 50 GW by 2030, up from roughly 15 GW today. While the total CfD budget has increased from £800 million in 2024, the fixed-bottom portion has narrowed slightly as the government carved out a separate pot for floating projects. Industry analysts note that the move reflects a rebalancing of support rather than a cut.

The offshore wind sector continues to face headwinds from inflation, grid-connection delays, and supply chain constraints. These pressures have forced several major developers, including Ørsted, Shell, and Equinor, to cancel or delay high-profile projects in recent years.

Europe remains the world’s largest offshore wind market, accounting for roughly 92% of global floating wind capacity, while Asia-Pacific is projected to expand the fastest, growing nearly 160% annually through the end of the decade.

Support under the CfD scheme is funded through consumer energy bills rather than general taxation. If wholesale power prices fall below the guaranteed contract price, developers receive a top-up payment; if prices rise above it, the difference is returned to consumers.

While the increased budget marks a stronger push for clean energy, developers warn that persistently high costs and tightening supply chains could still make meeting the UK’s 2030 offshore wind targets an uphill task.

[TITLE]GE Vernova Turbine Will Power New Indiana Gas-Fired Plant:
[TEXT]
Energy development group Maple Creek Energy LLC said it has secured an agreement to purchase a GE Vernova 7HA.03 gas turbine in a single-shaft configuration, along with associated services, for the first phase of the company’s two-phase Maple Creek natural gas-fired power project in Sullivan County, Indiana.

The installation is being developed by Advanced Power, a privately-owned global developer, manager, and owner of power generation infrastructure, along with BDC Power Holdings, a Bechtel company. Advanced Power is headquartered in Switzerland, with U.S. offices in Boston, Massachusetts, and Houston, Texas. Infrastructure investor ArcLight Capital Partners is the owner of Maple Creek and is funding the equipment procurement.

GE Vernova is a sponsor of POWER’s Experience POWER event in Denver, set for Oct. 29-31 at the Hyatt Regency Convention Center hotel. Clive Nickolay, CEO—Heavy Duty Gas Turbines & Aeroderivatives for GE Vernova, will sit down with POWER Senior Editor Darrell Proctor at the event on Wednesday, Oct. 29, at 4 p.m., for a discussion of the company’s technology and the future of gas-fired power generation.

The agreement announced October 27 includes existing permits, land control, and transmission interconnection. The companies said they expect the project, a two-phase, gas-fueled electric-generation facility with more than 1.2 GW of generation capacity,, will enter commercial operation as soon as 2029. Officials in a news release on Monday said the “project will utilize lower-carbon natural gas and recovered steam in a combined-cycle configuration to deliver flexible, more sustainable energy to the MISO [Midcontinent Independent System Operator] grid.”

“Advanced Power’s expertise is delivering complex, modern power projects on time and on budget, while navigating the hurdles that emerge in a changing energy landscape,” said Tom Spang, CEO of Advanced Power. Spang told POWER, “Long equipment lead times have become one of those challenges, yet through disciplined planning, rigorous due diligence, and structured execution, we continue to develop facilities that generate reliable power and help empower communities.”

Bechtel Serves as EPC Lead

Bechtel Infrastructure & Power Corp. will serve as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor for the facility.

“Developing these grid-scale generation projects typically takes years, and this agreement with GE Vernova marks a pivotal milestone in the execution of a project that began in 2021,” said Spang. “Maple Creek will soon be ready to deliver reliable, dispatchable power to one of the fastest-growing load centers in the country. Advanced Power’s depth of experience in developing CCGT [combined-cycle gas turbine] facilities will strive to deliver a project designed for speed, flexibility, and performance—exactly what Indiana utilities and hyperscalers need to support growing demands for power and grid reliability.”

The companies noted that “securing GE Vernova’s power generation equipment eliminates a critical development risk: long-lead equipment procurement, at a time when global supply chain constraints continue to challenge other new generation projects. MISO projects an increase of up to 30 gigawatts [GW] in additional demand over the next decade, driven by ongoing factors such as the onshoring of manufacturing, continued electrification of the economy, and now, advancements in centers in the digital economy. We believe Maple Creek is uniquely positioned to meet this surge with scalable, lower-carbon power sooner than other proposed projects.”

“GE Vernova is honored that Advanced Power and BDC Power Holdings LLC have selected to develop the Maple Creek project with our most advanced 7HA.03 gas turbine technology, a testament to our commitment to helping accelerate new generation capacity to support demand growth in the United States,” said Dave Ross, president and CEO of GE Vernova’s Gas Power business in the Americas.

Maple Creek is part of Advanced Power’s broader development portfolio, which includes more than 12 GW of thermal and renewable generation projects and more than 9 GWh of energy storage. Click here to learn more about Advanced Power’s projects in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.
