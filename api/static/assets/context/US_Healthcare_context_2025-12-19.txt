[TITLE]Longeveron Granted U.S. Patent for Method of Treating Female Sexual Dysfunction Using its Proprietary Stem Cell Therapy:
[TEXT]
The patent relates to methods of administering therapeutically effective amounts of isolated allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to female patients with sexual dysfunction in order to increase sexual quality of life

Female sexual dysfunction is an extremely common unmet medical need which can have a major impact on quality of life in otherwise healthy women

Longeveron anticipates entering into licensing or partnering agreements for the potential development and commercialization of stem cell therapy for this indication

MIAMI, Dec. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Longeveron Inc. (NASDAQ: LGVN), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing cellular therapy for life-threatening, rare pediatric and chronic aging-related conditions, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted a patent covering administration of the Company’s proprietary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for the treatment of female patients with sexual dysfunction and improvement in sexual quality of life.

U.S. Patent No. 12,496,316, entitled “Treatment of Sexual Dysfunction and Improvement in Sexual Quality of Life,” provides Longeveron with patent rights in the United States through 2038. Further patent term extension may occur along with regulatory exclusivity extensions.

Female sexual dysfunction is an extremely common yet under-researched issue affecting up to 46% of women, with few to no treatment options. Importantly, female sexual dysfunction is increasingly common with advancing age, and affects otherwise healthy individuals. This patent adds to Longeveron’s growing patent portfolio relating to conditions preferentially affecting aging populations.

Longeveron anticipates entering into licensing or partnering agreements for the potential development and commercialization of stem cell therapy for this indication.
