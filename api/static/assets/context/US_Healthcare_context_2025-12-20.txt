[TITLE]Crucial Innovations Retains FOCUS Capital Partners to Support Strategic Growth and Investment Initiatives:
[TEXT]
LONDON, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Crucial Innovations Corp. (“CINV” or “the Company”), an international pioneering medical cannabis company, announced that it has formally retained FOCUS Capital Partners (“FOCUS”), a global leader in the middle-market investment banking sector with specialized advisory capabilities across 11 industries and a worldwide network of senior bankers.

“Partnering with FOCUS is a pivotal milestone for CINV,” said CINV CEO JP Doran. “FOCUS brings a rare combination of broad investment-banking expertise and deep, sector-specific knowledge of the global medical cannabis industry.

As part of its longer-term corporate roadmap, CINV continues to progress toward becoming a public company and aspires to pursue a listing on a major U.S. exchange, including Nasdaq, in 2026, subject to market conditions, regulatory requirements, and corporate readiness. This ambition reflects CINV’s focus on governance, scale, transparency, and global investor accessibility as it advances its international growth strategy.

[TITLE]Guidepoint Qsight, Skytale Issue Joint Report on Medical Aesthetic Non-Surgical Spend, Finds 5% Surge in 2024:
[TEXT]
New York, NY, USA, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. aesthetics industry’s measured growth driven by demand for neurotoxins and GLP-1s, signaling shifting patient demand and a maturing industry

Total non-surgical U.S. spend was $20.5 billion in 2024

Neurotoxins continue to grow moderately, especially among Gen X and Millennials

Dermal fillers down 3% y-o-y: legacy products lost share, new fillers growing respectably

Biostimulatory injectables and medical weight loss are emerging growth segments

Regionally, the Midwest performed best and saw growth while showing signs of saturation

Consolidating platforms and PE expected to drive integration and value creation

New operational challenges in clinical settings include skilled labor acquisition and retention

Guidepoint Qsight, a leading provider of data and analytics services for the medical aesthetics sector, and Skytale, a leading investment banking and management consulting firm serving healthcare and consumer businesses, have released a new edition of their seminal report on the state of the U.S. aesthetics industry, a guide through its transition from rapid post-pandemic expansion into a new phase of maturity.

The report cites that the U.S. aesthetics industry had a strong 2024, growing 5% year-over-year from 2023, bringing total U.S. non-surgical spending to $20.5 billion. This follows a pattern of strong growth since the market contraction in 2020. Certain segments saw more growth than others; however, neurotoxins continued on their upward trajectory, while legacy categories such as dermal fillers and energy-based devices saw more mixed performance.

“Aesthetics continues to grow, but the drivers look different than they did just a few years ago,” said Andrew Mantis, General Manager of Guidepoint Qsight. “Neurotoxins are still outperforming, while other categories recalibrate and patient preferences evolve. It reflects a sector moving from rapid expansion into true maturity.”

Various factors, including the 55% growth of GLP-1 weight loss drugs in 2024, have fueled a shift in the aesthetics market, with investors becoming increasingly attuned to revenue diversification and quality, patient loyalty and retention, and average spend per patient. The report includes an analysis of practices by region and by patient retention, spend, gender, and generational cohort.

“We’ve seen a significant uptick in deal volumes, signaling that private equity firms have a significant amount of capital available for strategically investing in emerging industries such as medical aesthetics,” said Ben Hernandez, CEO and Managing Director of Skytale. “As the medical aesthetics market continues to mature and more private equity sponsors build platforms, the focus on data collection and aggregation will be a primary focal point as larger groups look to grow strategically and implement change across their organizations. This continued data collection will be instrumental in enhancing the medical aesthetic industry.”

[TITLE]Clinic Secret Unveiled: How This GLP-1 Weight Loss Platform Enables At-Home Access to Ozempic, Semaglutide & Tirzepatide - Clinic Secret:
[TEXT]
Intro: Clinic Secret Enters the Spotlight as GLP-1 Telehealth Platforms Gain National Attention

New York City, NY, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As demand for medically supervised weight management continues to rise across the United States, telehealth platforms focused on GLP-1–based treatment access are gaining heightened visibility in 2025-2026. Recent developments in digital healthcare delivery, combined with expanded clinical adoption of GLP-1 receptor agonists, have reshaped how eligible adults engage with prescription-based weight loss care. Against this backdrop, Clinic Secret has emerged as a structured telehealth platform designed to facilitate access to GLP-1 medications through licensed medical review and remote consultation protocols.

Clinic Secret operates within a growing category of virtual healthcare services that aim to streamline the clinical intake process, reduce geographic barriers, and support continuity of care without requiring in-person clinic visits. The platform’s model reflects broader healthcare trends emphasizing telemedicine efficiency, patient screening standardization, and prescription fulfillment logistics aligned with regulatory requirements.

Industry observers note that GLP-1–focused platforms have expanded rapidly following increased awareness of medications such as Ozempic, semaglutide and tirzepatide, which are prescribed under medical supervision for weight-related metabolic management. Clinic Secret positions itself within this evolving landscape by offering a centralized digital pathway that connects eligible individuals with licensed providers, clinical assessment workflows, and prescription fulfillment coordination.

This announcement-style overview examines Clinic Secret’s operational framework, clinical philosophy, eligibility guidelines, and safety considerations, providing clarity on how the platform functions within established telehealth and pharmaceutical standards. The following sections outline Clinic Secret’s structure, treatment approach, and performance-focused design, without reference to consumer preferences or competitive positioning.

What Is Clinic Secret? An Overview of the GLP-1 Weight Loss Platform

Clinic Secret is a telehealth-based healthcare platform designed to facilitate medically reviewed access to GLP-1 prescription treatments for eligible adults. The platform integrates digital intake tools, clinical evaluation workflows, and prescription coordination into a single online interface, allowing users to engage with licensed medical professionals remotely.

At its core, Clinic Secret functions as a healthcare services intermediary rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer. The platform does not produce medications directly; instead, it coordinates provider-led evaluations to determine whether GLP-1 treatments may be clinically appropriate based on individual health profiles. All medical decisions are made by licensed practitioners operating within their scope of practice and in accordance with applicable regulations.

The platform’s structure emphasizes standardized screening, data-driven assessment, and documentation consistency. Users complete an online health questionnaire that captures relevant medical history, biometric data, and eligibility factors. This information is reviewed by a licensed provider, who determines whether treatment may be prescribed or whether further evaluation is required.

Clinic Secret also manages prescription routing and fulfillment logistics once a provider authorizes treatment. This includes coordination with licensed pharmacies and shipment tracking systems designed to support continuity of care. The platform’s interface allows users to manage account information, track treatment status, and access educational materials related to GLP-1 therapy.

By consolidating clinical intake, provider review, and prescription fulfillment into a digital workflow, Clinic Secret reflects a broader shift toward telehealth efficiency and remote medical access. Its role is defined by facilitation and coordination rather than diagnosis or direct treatment delivery, aligning with prevailing telemedicine compliance frameworks.

Deeper Look at Clinic Secret’s Feature Philosophy and Platform Design

Clinic Secret’s platform design is structured around operational clarity, regulatory alignment, and clinical workflow efficiency. Rather than positioning itself as a lifestyle or wellness service, the platform emphasizes medical process standardization and provider-led decision-making. Its feature set reflects this philosophy by prioritizing data collection accuracy, review transparency, and prescription coordination reliability.

One of the platform’s central design elements is its digital intake system. This system captures detailed health information through structured questionnaires, enabling providers to assess eligibility based on established clinical parameters. The intake framework is designed to reduce ambiguity by ensuring consistent data formatting and completeness prior to provider review.

Another key feature is Clinic Secret’s provider interface, which allows licensed practitioners to review submissions, request clarifications when necessary, and document clinical determinations. This backend structure supports accountability and auditability, two critical components in telehealth service delivery. The platform does not automate medical decisions; instead, it supports provider judgment with organized data presentation.

Clinic Secret also incorporates prescription coordination tools that connect approved prescriptions with licensed pharmacy partners. This feature ensures that medications are dispensed through appropriate channels and that fulfillment processes align with regulatory standards. Shipment tracking and status updates are integrated to maintain transparency throughout the delivery phase.

Educational resources are embedded within the platform to provide general information

[TITLE]Rezubio Announces $20 Million Series A Financing to Advance the Membrane-Anchored Therapeutics Platform and Company Pipeline, with Lead Program in Obesity and Diabetes:
[TEXT]
ZHUHAI, China, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rezubio, a China-based biotechnology company founded by former Merck scientists, today announced the closing of a $20 million Series A financing. Proceeds will be used to advance the company’s lead program into Phase 2 clinical development for obesity and diabetes, as well as other programs in IND-enabling stage and early preclinical stage.

The financing was led by Lapam Capital, with participation from Frees Fund and Riverhead Capital.

“This Series A represents an important inflection point for Rezubio,” said Yusheng Xiong, PhD, co-founder and CEO of Rezubio. “Membrane anchoring has the potential to reshape how targeted medicines are designed. Our MADD platform enables highly localized pharmacology for cell-surface targets, including GPCRs, while minimizing systemic exposure. Our gut-targeted GPCR agonist has entered clinical trials in Australia and is expected to provide a critical proof-of-concept for the platform. In parallel, an antagonist targeting a different GPCR for immune and inflammatory diseases will enter Phase 1 clinical development in early 2026.”

A Novel Approach to Tissue-Selective Delivery: Membrane-Anchored Drug Design (MADD)

Rezubio’s MADD platform uses a rationally engineered kinetophore to anchor pharmacophores to the epithelium of target tissues, enabling localized drug activity at the site of action. This approach is designed to deliver:

Minimal systemic exposure, reducing the risk of off-target and dose-limiting adverse effects

Enhanced efficacy through enrichment of active compounds around cell-surface target proteins

Prolonged tissue residence time, supporting less frequent dosing

By addressing limitations of conventional small-molecule and peptide therapeutics—such as the adverse effects and frequent administration—Rezubio aims to improve both therapeutic index and patient compliance.

[TITLE]Genomic and transcriptomic analyses of aortic stenosis enhance therapeutic target discovery and disease prediction:
[TEXT]
All participants for all studies provided written or verbal consent and studies were approved by the local ethics committee or institutional review board (IRB).

For the BioME study, protocols were approved by the IRB at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (GCO 07–0529; STUDY-11–01139) and all participants provided informed consent. For the BioVU study, all DNA samples in BioVU are de-identified and have been designated with the IRB, thus allowing the use of blood samples collected for clinical care otherwise scheduled for discard. The program has received IRB approval and was reviewed in detail by the federal Office for Human Research Protections, which agreed with the regulatory designation of the nonhuman participants. For the CathGen study, all participants provided informed consent, and the study was approved by the Duke University IRB.

CARTaGENE obtained ethics approval from the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine (reference MP-21-2011-345, 3297). The Danish analyses for CHB/DBDS were conducted within the CHB–CVDC and DBDS cohorts, which were approved by the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics (approval NVK-1708829 and NVK-1700407) and the Capital Region Data Protection Agency (approval P-2019-93 and P-2019-99). Participants in FinnGen provided informed consent for biobank research under the Finnish Biobank Act. Alternatively, separate research cohorts, collected before the Finnish Biobank Act came into effect (September 2013) and the start of FinnGen (August 2017), were collected on the basis of study-specific consent and later transferred to the Finnish biobanks after approval by Fimea, the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health. Recruitment protocols followed the biobank protocols approved by Fimea. The Coordinating Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS) approved the FinnGen study protocol (HUS/990/2017).

The GERA study (Kaiser Permanente Research Program on Genes, Environment, and Health, RPGEH) was approved by the Grand Opportunity Project (IRB CN-09CScha-06-H).

Study populations and phenotyping

The IAVGC comprises 30 studies. Descriptive characteristics for contributing studies are presented in Supplementary Table 1. A consistent AS phenotype was applied across all IAVGC studies (except as otherwise described in Supplementary Methods) using a previously validated definition for AS comprised of ‘International Classification of Diseases’ (ICD) and ‘Current Procedural Terminology’ codes7 (Supplementary Table 2). Study-level quality control thresholds are described in detail in Supplementary Methods. Most studies performed genome-wide imputation with the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) imputation panel42. After quality control and imputation, participating studies performed a GWAS using either SAIGE43 or REGENIE44 for both autosomes stratified by genetic ancestry, as well as autosomes and the X chromosome, stratified by sex.

Meta-analysis

GWAS summary data were uploaded to central servers at the Broad Institute and the Digital Research Alliance of Canada and consortium-level quality control, including the removal of variants with imputation quality of ≤0.3 or minor allele count of <10, was performed independently by two authors (A.M.S. and L.D.) of this study. Summary statistics in hg19 were converted to hg38 using LiftOver (v1.04.00). LD score regression intercepts were calculated for each GWAS using LD score (v.1.0.1)45 and corrected standard errors (SEldsc) were calculated by multiplying the standard error by the square root of the LD score regression intercept in cases where the LD score regression intercept was more than 1. Fixed-effects, inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was performed using GWAMA (v2.2.2)46 with SEldsc to correct for inflation. GWAS meta-analysis was performed for the entire multi-ancestry population as well as for ancestry-stratified and sex-stratified populations. X chromosome analysis was performed by meta-analyzing all sex-stratified X chromosome data. Variants with an MAF of ≥0.001 and present in only one study or with an MAF of <0.001 and present in three or fewer studies were removed from the resulting meta-analysis summary files. Genome-wide significance was defined as P < 5 × 10−8. Independent lead variants in each GWAS were established by determining the top-most significant variant within a 500-kb region. Lead variants were additionally tested for independence by establishing that each lead variant was independent (r2 < 0.2) from all other lead variants in all available 1000 Genomes (1000G) populations. All variant pairs with an r2 between 0.1 and 0.2 were additionally evaluated for conditional independence using European genetic ancestry individual-level data in the MVP. Variant pairs were evaluated in association with AS independently, and, in a joint model, adjusting for age2, sex and principal components. For variant pairs that were not conditionally independent, the top-most significant variant of the pair was considered the lead variant. Random-effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was performed as a sensitivity analysis for lead variants with significant heterogeneity (q value < 0.05/261 (total number of independent lead variants) = 0.0002). Liability-scale heritability was calculated using LD score (v.1.0.1). Percent variance explained was calculated from independent lead variants using the method described in ref. 47.

Sex interaction

We tested for differences in AS effect sizes between males and females for lead variants identified in our multi-ancestry meta-GWAS using48:

$$Z=\frac{{B}_{m}-{B}_{f}}{\sqrt{{\rm{s}}.{\rm{e}}{.}_{m}^{2}-{\rm{s}}.{\rm{e}}{.}_{f}^{2}-2\times r\times {\rm{s}}.{\rm{e}}{.}_{m}\times {\rm{s}}.{\rm{e}}{.}_{f}}}$$

where \({B}_{m}\)/\({\rm{s}}.{\rm{e}}{.}_{m}\) refers to the β/s.e. in the AS male meta-GWAS, \({B}_{f}\)/\({\rm{s}}.{\rm{e}}{.}_{f}\) refers to the β/s.e. in the AS female meta-GWAS, and \(r\) refers to the correlation between β in the AS male and female meta-GWAS. We considered effect estimates to be significantly different by sex if the z score for the difference was greater than 3.7 (corresponding to a two-tailed P value of <0.05/252 (total number of independent lead variants in multi-ancestry or ancestry-stratified GWAS) = 2.0 × 10−4).

We also evaluated whether any lead variants identified in the male or female AS meta-GWASs were independent of those discovered in our combined meta-analysis. We considered sex-specific lead variants independent from combined GWAS lead variants if they were both greater than 500 kb from any full population lead variant and in linkage equilibrium (r2 < 0.2) with all full multi-ancestry population lead variants in all 1000G populations. We then evaluated for heterogeneity between the male and female sex-stratified GWAS using a fixed-effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis framework for lead variants identified in sex-stratified GWAS (n = 5). Significant heterogeneity was considered for P < 0.05/5 = 0.01.

Transcriptome-wide association analysis

Transcriptomic data were previously generated from human AV samples from 484 individuals who underwent AV replacement or heart transplant at the Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec-Université Laval (IUCPQ-UL) as part of the QUEBEC-CAVS study9. All participants provided informed consent and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the IUCPQ-UL. Briefly, RNA sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina), targeting >50 million paired reads per sample. Read counts were generated using GENCODE Release 41 on build GRCh38. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Global Screening Array. All transcriptomic data were from participants who self-reported as European and clustered with the 1000G Phase 3 European ancestry data. Genotypes were imputed using the TOPMed Imputation Server with the TOPMed Imputation Reference panel (version TOPMed-r2). Variants with an MAF of <0.01 or imputation quality score of <0.3 were excluded.

We used our human AV transcriptomic data to generate a gene-expression model estimating the regulatory effects of SNPs on protein-coding gene expression using the software PredictDB (v7)49. Elastic-net models were trained using nested cross-validation from genotype and normalized gene expression data adjusted for age, sex, smoking status (current or not), the first 60 probabilistic estimation of expression residuals50 factors, and the first five ancestry-based principal components. Variants were considered to have a regulatory effect on gene expression if they were located within 1 Mb of the transcription start site for any given gene of interest. A model testing the association between a given SNP and gene expression was considered significant when the average Pearson correlation between predicted and observed expression was greater than 0.1 and the estimated P value was less than 0.05.

A TWAS was then performed using the S-PrediXcan extension51 in MetaXcan (v0.7.4) with European genetic ancestry summary statistics from our autosomal meta-GWAS of AS (chosen to optimize population structure overlap between the AS GWAS and AV samples). The statistical significance threshold was set using Bonferroni correction for the number of genes tested (P < 0.05/10,574 = 4.73 × 10−6).

Colocalization between eQTLs in human AVs and AS risk was evaluated using COLOC (v3.2.1) for genes identified by TWAS52 and variants from the IAVGC AS GWAS located within 1 Mb of a gene’s transcription start or end sites. eQTLs were generated using QTLtools (v1.1)53. The two signals were considered colocalized if their posterior probability of shared signal (PP4) was >0.75. The LocusCompareR package (v1.0.0) was used to validate colocalization54.

We also compared relative gene expression between the AV and 43 GTEx55 tissues using previously calculated ESS9. Briefly, ESS were calculated by dividing the median log 2 (transcripts per million) value from AV tissue by the sum of the median log 2 (transcripts per million) values of all 43 GTEx v8 tissues. An ESS of greater than 0.1 in the AV (corresponding to AV-specific gene expression of greater than 10% total gene expression in all examined tissues) was considered the threshold for significant AV gene expression enrichment.

eQTL colocalization

We performed eQTL colocalization for all lead variants in autosomes using AS GWAS summary statistics and cis-QTL data from GTEx v8 for relevant extravalvular tissues (heart left atrial appendage, heart left ventricle, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, whole blood, cultured fibroblasts, Epstein–Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes, subcutaneous adipose, visceral omentum adipose, coronary artery, tibial artery and aorta). For each colocalization analysis, AS summary data were subset to a region within 1 Mb around each lead variant, and these were merged with variant–QTL associations from tissue-specific GTEx data. Colocalization was performed using the COLOC (v5.1.0) package in R. We considered a PP4 >0.75 as evidence of colocalization.

Combined SNP to gene

Combined SNP to gene (cS2G) leverages seven different SNP-to-gene prioritization strategies to generate an optimal SNP–gene pair per significant independent SNP56. We obtained cS2G annotations for all IAVGC lead variants, and restricted SNP–gene pairs with a cS2G score ≥0.5 to maximize precision/recall.

Causal gene prioritization

For each lead variant, we generated a list of prioritized genes based on the following methods: (1) nearest gene, (2) cS2G, (3) extravalvular eQTL colocalization, (4) protein-altering variation, (5) AV eQTL TWAS and eQTL colocalization and (6) AV gene expression or protein abundance data. We considered a lead variant to be prioritized by protein-altering variation if it was in significant LD (r2 > 0.8) with a protein-coding variant. Coding variants were further annotated as damaging if they were missense and predicted by PolyPhen-2 (ref. 57) to be probably damaging or by SIFT58 to be deleterious or were protein truncating. We considered genes to be prioritized based on human AV transcriptomic data if they were both significant in TWAS (P < 4.73 × 10−6) and in eQTL colocalization (PP4 > 0.75). AV protein abundance and gene expression data were obtained from published liquid chromatography–mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and transcriptomics datasets from human AV tissue and cultured VICs18,19. In the dataset discussed in ref. 19, nine human AV specimens from patients with severe AS were obtained and microdissected into nondiseased, fibrotic and calcific segments of the valve. Mass spectrometry proteomics (n = 9) and transcriptomics (n = 3) were performed comparing diseased and nondiseased segments. Genes were annotated based on whether the protein product was detected in bulk proteomics, whether the gene transcript was identified in bulk transcriptomics, or whether protein abundance/gene expression was differentially apparent across disease states (defined as adjusted P < 0.5 and absolute log 2 (fold change) > 0.5). VICs were cultured from these samples (separately from the fibrosa and ventricularis) and subjected to either osteogenic or normal media (NM) conditions. Mass spectrometry proteomics was then performed to compare protein abundances among VICs in osteogenic and NM conditions. In the dataset discussed in ref. 18, human AV specimens were obtained from patients with severe AS and microdissected into nondiseased, fibrotic and calcific segments. Mass spectrometry proteomics was then performed comparing diseased (calcific or fibrotic) and nondiseased segments. Genes were annotated based on whether their protein products were detected in bulk proteomics or were differentially expressed across disease states (defined as adjusted P < 0.5 and absolute log 2 (fold change) > 0.5).

A single causal gene was determined for all lead variants using the following criteria: (1) for lead variants with significant LD (r2 > 0.8) to a damaging protein-altering variant, the altered gene was prioritized as the most likely causal gene, (2) by consensus of the greatest number of indicators (including nearest gene, cS2G, extravalvular eQTL colocalization, nondamaging protein-altering variation, AV eQTL TWAS and eQTL colocalization, detection in AV proteomics, or differential gene expression in AV transcriptomics) or (3) for variants with only one indicator or with equal numbers of indicators for more than one gene, the nearest gene was prioritized.

Gene-set enrichment

We used DEPICT (v1) to prioritize causal gene sets from our multi-ancestry AS GWAS summary statistics59. We defined significant gene-set enrichment for results with an enrichment P value <0.05/10,968 = 4.6 × 10−6. We then created similarity matrices among gene sets using the Jaccard index and performed affinity propagation with the apcluster package (v1.4.11) in R, following the method described in ref. 60. Exemplar gene sets were then plotted as nodes with the density of edges representing the similarity of genes between sets. We additionally annotated causal gene sets using Enrichr, a web-based software that prioritizes gene-set ontologies from a provider-designated list of genes61.

Evaluation of pleiotropy

We evaluated pleiotropic associations among all 261 independent lead variants using publicly available summary statistics from the recent PheWAS across 44.3 million genotyped variants in the MVP20. We queried European genetic ancestry PheWAS summary data for our trans-ancestry meta-analysis lead variants and European genetic ancestry lead variants, and African genetic ancestry PheWAS summary data for our African genetic ancestry lead variants. We evaluated associations across all 1,854 binary and 214 quantitative traits in the MVP PheWAS and considered any association with a P value <9.3 × 10−8 to be statistically significant, which is a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold accounting for 261 lead variants evaluated across 214 quantitative and 1,854 binary traits.

Development of an AS PRS

We developed an AS PRS using summary data from autosomal AS GWAS meta-analysis performed in a sample excluding the MGBB and UKB populations, which were used to test and validate the PRSs, respectively. PRSs were developed using LDpred2 (ref. 62) and PRS-CS63, both of which use Bayesian approaches using GWAS summary-level data. Autosomal Hapmap3 SNPs were extracted from multi-ancestry and population-specific AS GWAS and used as the inputs of LDpred2 and PRS-CS. LD reference panels for both LDpred2 and PRS-CS were built using 1000G data of matched populations for each population-specific AS meta-GWAS (European, African, Hispanic, East Asian and South Asian). We used a European LD reference panel for our multi-ancestry AS meta-GWAS as the majority of samples in the multi-ancestry IAVGC AS meta-GWAS were European.

For LDpred2, we generated multiple PRSs using a grid of hyperparameters, including assumed heritability of 0.7, 1.0 and 1.4 times the estimated heritability, assumed proportion of causal SNPs as a sequence of 17 values from 1 × 10−4 to 1 on a log-scale, and sparsity (true or false, representing whether some of the posterior effect size can be shrunk to zero). For PRS-CS, we used the default hyper-parameter settings indicated by the authors—a = 1, b = 0.5, φ = 1 × 10−6, 1 × 10−4, 1 × 10−2, 1. The resulting PRSs were tested using European data from MGBB, a nonoverlapping dataset. For each set of posterior effect sizes generated using either LDpred2 or PRS-CS, we identified the PRS in the MGBB with the best predictive value (highest phenotypic variance explained by r2).

AS PRS evaluation

The best-performing PRS in the MGBB was validated using data from the UKB, UCLA ATLAS64, and aggregate data from six TIMI clinical trials (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (ref. 65), SOLID-TIMI 52 (ref. 66), SAVOR-TIMI 53 (ref. 67), PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (ref. 68), DECLARE-TIMI 58 (ref. 69) and FOURIER (TIMI 59) (ref. 70)), all of which are independent samples from those used for the AS GWAS. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate HRs in both the UKB and TIMI trials for AS against our continuous, normalized AS PRS in an analysis adjusting for age, sex, genetic ancestry principal components 1–5 and clinical risk factors including T2D, HTN, CAD, HLD, body mass index, current smoking and renal failure (eGFR < 30 ml min−1 1.73 m−2). Testing using TIMI trial data required that individual patient-level data were pooled from the six clinical trials. All analyses were compared to the performance of our previously published AS PRS generated using MVP data21. Results from the UKB and TIMI clinical trials were meta-analyzed using fixed-effects, inverse-variance weighting. Logistic regression was used to calculate ORs in UCLA ATLAS for AS against our continuous, normalized AS PRS with the same covariates included for the UKB and TIMI trial analyses. We also evaluated whether the AS PRS was associated with incident AV replacement in the UKB, using a composite outcome of surgical or transcatheter AV replacement codes, compared with a control population without any AS. We assessed AS risk prediction for genetic and clinical factors in the UKB using a Cox proportional hazards model including genetic risk categories (top 1%, 2%, 10% and 20% of genetic risk, compared to a referent of middle 40–60% genetic risk), adjusting for age (>65 years), male sex, ancestry-specific principal components, T2D, HTN, CAD, HLD, elevated body mass index (≥30 kg m−2), current smoking and renal failure (eGFR < 30 ml min−1 1.73 m−2).

Phenotyping for AS and clinical risk factors in TIMI trials have been previously described21. Phenotyping for AS in both the UKB and UCLA ATLAS also used our IAVGC definition as stated above. Individuals with prevalent AS in the UKB were excluded. To evaluate the relative contributions of the AS PRS and individual clinical risk factors, C-indices were calculated for the AS PRS and clinical risk factors either alone or in a full model including both. The C-index was compared across models using likelihood-ratio tests. We also calculated continuous NRIs comparing models with the AS PRS and clinical risk factors to a model with clinical risk factors alone in both the UKB and TIMI trials. Kaplan–Meier curves were drawn using UKB and TIMI clinical trial data, stratified by quintiles of genetic risk.

Isolation of human VICs

Human AV samples were collected from 11 donors undergoing AV replacement surgeries for severe AS at Brigham and Women’s Hospital after written informed consent was obtained (BWH IRB protocol 2011P001703). The AV samples were kept on ice in DMEM culture media (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11-965-118) and then washed thrice in PBS. Human primary VICs were isolated from the AV leaflets using collagenase digestion. After cutting into 1–2-mm pieces, sections were digested using 1 mg ml−1 collagenase (MilliporeSigma, C5894) in DMEM at 37 °C for 1 h with gentle mixing every 20 min. Valvular endothelial cells were washed away with DMEM and discarded. AV pieces were further digested using 1 mg ml−1 collagenase for 3 h with gentle mixing every 20 min and isolated VICs were collected by centrifugation at 523g (1,500 rpm) for 5 min and plated in 75 cm2 culture flasks. Isolated VICs were cultured in growth media (GM) containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin (PS; Lonza, 17-602E), and 1 mmol l−1 sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11-360-070) in a CO 2 incubator (37 °C, 5% CO 2 ) until the cells were >90% confluent. Then, cells were detached using 0.05% trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 25200056) and plated for subculture. VIC passages 4–7 were used for all experiments.

Gene silencing and calcification detection in human VICs

Human VICs were plated in 24-well or 48-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells per ml using GM. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 20 nmol l−1 siRNA of either LTBP4 (Horizon Discovery, L-019552-00-0005), CMKLR1 (Horizon Discovery, L-005467-00-0005), CLCA2 (Horizon Discovery, L-003813-00-0005), CERS2 (Horizon Discovery, L-010282-00-0005) or CEP120 (Horizon Discovery, L-016493-02-0005) and control (Horizon Discovery, P-001810-10-05) using DharmaFECT 1 Transfection Reagent (Horizon Discovery, T-2001-03). After 3 days, GM was replaced with NM or osteogenic media (OM), and this time point was considered as day 0. Furthermore, OM was composed of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PS, 1 mmol l−1 sodium pyruvate, 10 nmol l−1 dexamethasone, 10 mmol l−1 β-glycerophosphate (MilliporeSigma, 35675-100G) and 100 μmol l−1 L-ascorbic acid 2 phosphate (MilliporeSigma, A8960-5G). NM was composed of DMEM with the same concentration of FBS, PS and sodium pyruvate with GM. Media was changed every 3–4 days. siRNA transfection was performed when the media was replaced. Gene silencing by siRNA transfection was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR).

Human VICs were suspended in 0.4-ml RNAzol (MilliporeSigma, R4533) in each well of a 24-well plate, and total RNA was extracted by following the manufacturer’s instructions. In total, 160 µl RNase-free water was added and mixed for 15 s. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000g (10,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube, leaving a layer of the supernatant above the DNA/protein pellet. An equal volume of isopropanol was added to precipitate mRNA, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and centrifuged at 12,000g (10,000 rpm) for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and RNA pellet was washed twice with 160 μl of 75% ethanol (vol/vol). Samples were then centrifuged at 4,000–8,000g for 1 min at room temperature. Alcohol solution was removed with a micropipette. The RNA pellet was solubilized without drying in 20 μl of RNase-free water by pipetting up and down

[TITLE]Guidepoint Qsight, Skytale Issue Joint Report on Medical Aesthetic Non-Surgical Spend, Finds 5% Surge in 2024:
[TEXT]
New York, NY, USA, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. aesthetics industry’s measured growth driven by demand for neurotoxins and GLP-1s, signaling shifting patient demand and a maturing industry

Total non-surgical U.S. spend was $20.5 billion in 2024

Neurotoxins continue to grow moderately, especially among Gen X and Millennials

Dermal fillers down 3% y-o-y: legacy products lost share, new fillers growing respectably

Biostimulatory injectables and medical weight loss are emerging growth segments

Regionally, the Midwest performed best and saw growth while showing signs of saturation

Consolidating platforms and PE expected to drive integration and value creation

New operational challenges in clinical settings include skilled labor acquisition and retention

Guidepoint Qsight, a leading provider of data and analytics services for the medical aesthetics sector, and Skytale, a leading investment banking and management consulting firm serving healthcare and consumer businesses, have released a new edition of their seminal report on the state of the U.S. aesthetics industry, a guide through its transition from rapid post-pandemic expansion into a new phase of maturity.

The report cites that the U.S. aesthetics industry had a strong 2024, growing 5% year-over-year from 2023, bringing total U.S. non-surgical spending to $20.5 billion. This follows a pattern of strong growth since the market contraction in 2020. Certain segments saw more growth than others; however, neurotoxins continued on their upward trajectory, while legacy categories such as dermal fillers and energy-based devices saw more mixed performance.

“Aesthetics continues to grow, but the drivers look different than they did just a few years ago,” said Andrew Mantis, General Manager of Guidepoint Qsight. “Neurotoxins are still outperforming, while other categories recalibrate and patient preferences evolve. It reflects a sector moving from rapid expansion into true maturity.”

Various factors, including the 55% growth of GLP-1 weight loss drugs in 2024, have fueled a shift in the aesthetics market, with investors becoming increasingly attuned to revenue diversification and quality, patient loyalty and retention, and average spend per patient. The report includes an analysis of practices by region and by patient retention, spend, gender, and generational cohort.

“We’ve seen a significant uptick in deal volumes, signaling that private equity firms have a significant amount of capital available for strategically investing in emerging industries such as medical aesthetics,” said Ben Hernandez, CEO and Managing Director of Skytale. “As the medical aesthetics market continues to mature and more private equity sponsors build platforms, the focus on data collection and aggregation will be a primary focal point as larger groups look to grow strategically and implement change across their organizations. This continued data collection will be instrumental in enhancing the medical aesthetic industry.”

New York City, NY, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As demand for medically supervised weight management continues to rise across the United States, telehealth platforms focused on GLP-1–based treatment access are gaining heightened visibility in 2025-2026. Recent developments in digital healthcare delivery, combined with expanded clinical adoption of GLP-1 receptor agonists, have reshaped how eligible adults engage with prescription-based weight loss care. Against this backdrop, Clinic Secret has emerged as a structured telehealth platform designed to facilitate access to GLP-1 medications through licensed medical review and remote consultation protocols.

What Is Clinic Secret? An Overview of the GLP-1 Weight Loss Platform

Clinic Secret is a telehealth-based healthcare platform designed to facilitate medically reviewed access to GLP-1 prescription treatments for eligible adults. The platform integrates digital intake tools, clinical evaluation workflows, and prescription coordination into a single online interface, allowing users to engage with licensed medical professionals remotely.

At its core, Clinic Secret functions as a healthcare services intermediary rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer. The platform does not produce medications directly; instead, it coordinates provider-led evaluations to determine whether GLP-1 treatments may be clinically appropriate based on individual health profiles. All medical decisions are made by licensed practitioners operating within their scope of practice and in accordance with applicable regulations.

The platform’s structure emphasizes standardized screening, data-driven assessment, and documentation consistency. Users complete an online health questionnaire that captures relevant medical history, biometric data, and eligibility factors. This information is reviewed by a licensed provider, who determines whether treatment may be prescribed or whether further evaluation is required.

Clinic Secret also manages prescription routing and fulfillment logistics once a provider authorizes treatment. This includes coordination with licensed pharmacies and shipment tracking systems designed to support continuity of care. The platform’s interface allows users to manage account information, track treatment status, and access educational materials related to GLP-1 therapy.

By consolidating clinical intake, provider review, and prescription fulfillment into a digital workflow, Clinic Secret reflects a broader shift toward telehealth efficiency and remote medical access. Its role is defined by facilitation and coordination rather than diagnosis or direct treatment delivery, aligning with prevailing telemedicine compliance frameworks.

Deeper Look at Clinic Secret’s Feature Philosophy and Platform Design

Clinic Secret’s platform design is structured around operational clarity, regulatory alignment, and clinical workflow efficiency. Rather than positioning itself as a lifestyle or wellness service, the platform emphasizes medical process standardization and provider-led decision-making. Its feature set reflects this philosophy by prioritizing data collection accuracy, review transparency, and prescription coordination reliability.

One of the platform’s central design elements is its digital intake system. This system captures detailed health information through structured questionnaires, enabling providers to assess eligibility based on established clinical parameters. The intake framework is designed to reduce ambiguity by ensuring consistent data formatting and completeness prior to provider review.

Another key feature is Clinic Secret’s provider interface, which allows licensed practitioners to review submissions, request clarifications when necessary, and document clinical determinations. This backend structure supports accountability and auditability, two critical components in telehealth service delivery. The platform does not automate medical decisions; instead, it supports provider judgment with organized data presentation.

Clinic Secret also incorporates prescription coordination tools that connect approved prescriptions with licensed pharmacy partners. This feature ensures that medications are dispensed through appropriate channels and that fulfillment processes align with regulatory standards. Shipment tracking and status updates are integrated to maintain transparency throughout the delivery phase.
