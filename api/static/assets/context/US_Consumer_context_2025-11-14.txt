[TITLE]What Saks Global Has Riding on the Holiday Season: A Crucial Moment on Its Path Ahead:
[TEXT]
The holiday season is always make or break in retail — but that goes doubly so for Saks Global this year.

The retailer closed on its $2.7 billion deal to buy Neiman Marcus Group just two days before Christmas last year, launching both into a new era.

Chief executive officer Marc Metrick has been rushing to reset the company and luxury retail. He’s made rapid progress, cutting annual costs by $200 million already and integrating the backends of the two businesses.

But more so, it’s been a year of financial strain — from a bondholder freakout over the summer when investors realized their debt wasn’t directly secured by the famous Fifth Avenue flagship to continued strains with vendors who are being very careful in what goods they ship.

The result is a department store group that is still striving toward the future of shopping while dragging along a debt load of $4.9 billion.

In addition to all the consolidation to bring the two retailers together, there’s also been a management shakeup with the departure of Emily Essner, president and chief commercial officer; Bill Bine, chief transformation officer, and Rob Brooks, chief operating officer.

It remains to be seen what Santa brings for Saks Global this year, but there are still six weeks to go until Christmas. Here, three ways the holiday might play out and shape the retailer’s path into 2026 — from the grinchiest, most speculative scenario to where the retailer gets everything on its wish list.

Too Little, Too Late

Saks Global has been on a high wire for some time — slow on payments to vendors for years, squaring off with bondholders before a high-profile refinancing in August, contending with slowing sales and more.

The company is broadly the creation of executive chairman Richard Baker and has worked as well as it has because Baker is a very adept dealmaker. Many thought it was impossible that Saks Global could ever buy Neiman’s.

But even Baker can do the impossible only so many times.

If Christmas falls flat for Saks Global and there’s not enough from asset sales to make a difference, experts around the industry speculate that Saks could eventually face an existential change in ownership, either in or out of bankruptcy court.

Debt watchdog Standard & Poor’s gave Saks Global an ultralow CCC rating after its refinancing and projected the company would see a $500 million deficit in reported free cash flow this year.

[TITLE]Kim Kardashian’s Skims Scores $5B Valuation in Fundraising Round:
[TEXT]
Kim Kardashian has 354 million followers on Instagram and a $5 billion company to boot.

Skims said Wednesday that it completed a $225 million capital raise that valued the company at a cool $5 billion.

For a brand that launched in 2018, that’s a rapid move up the growth curve.

The new money came from Goldman Sachs Alternatives and BDT & MSD Partners.

Skims got its start in shapewear, but has been branching out in apparel and looking more into beauty, recently hiring Diarrha N’Diaye to be executive vice president of beauty and fragrance.

Now, as the company expects to top $1 billion in net sales this year, it has a little something extra to project its brand out into the world.

Of course, Kardashian already knows how to get attention. Already this year she kept the brand in the headlines with its provocative offerings, including the bush thong, as well as through the introduction of the NikeSkims collaboration, the second drop of which occurred this week.

In a statement to WWD, Jens Grede, cofounder and chief executive officer, said: “This financing marks a pivotal next step for Skims and is a testament to all we have accomplished over the last six years. We’re thankful to our partners for their support and look forward to using the additional capital to accelerate our physical retail strategy, international expansion and innovation in new categories.”

Skims currently has 18 owned stores in the U.S. and two franchise doors in Mexico.

While Kardashian made her splash online and on the small screen, the company is looking to become a “predominantly physical business over the next few years.”

Kardashian said: “Today’s announcement validates the hard work of our incredible team and partners who have helped us reach this exciting new chapter, becoming a global omnichannel retail brand. We can’t wait to take Skims to the next level as we continue to innovate and set the standard for our industry.”

Now Goldman Sachs and BDT & MSD are along for the ride.

“Skims stands as a solutions-driven apparel innovator, pioneering new categories and redefining everyday wear,” said Beat Cabiallavetta, global head of hybrid capital at Goldman Sachs Alternatives.

Greg Olafson, president and co-chief investment officer at BDT & MSD, said: “We are pleased to support Skims in its continued growth and success, and to partner with founders who combine creativity with strong business leadership.”

Skims was valued at $4 billion in a fundraising round in 2023 that was seen as a prelude to an initial public offering, setting a price that the broader market could then work off. But it was not to be and the stock market stars never aligned.

Now Skims has a new valuation that the next investors — whomever they might be and whenever they come along — can ponder.

[TITLE]Lucky Energy raises $25m to support further US expansion:
[TEXT]
Credit: Lucky Energy

US-based energy drink start-up Lucky Energy has raised $25m in its latest Series B funding round.

The round was led by private equity firm Paine Schwartz Partners, which owns the Californian juices brand Suja Life.

Existing investors alongside new backers such as venture capital firm Joyance Partners and family offices North Fifth Services and Sequel also participated in the round.

In a statement, Luck Energy said the capital injection will “fuel” its growth in the US.

The company will use the funds to support its retail expansion and bolster national and regional “partnerships”. It said the money will also go towards hiring and “increasing marketing efforts”.

Lucky Energy is currently available in more than 15,000 US retail locations and plans to expand into Walmart, Sheetz and Cumberland Farms stores throughout the country next month.

The group told Just Drinks it is expecting to be sold in around 35,000 retail locations next year.

Its portfolio features a range of flavoured sugar-free energy drinks. Its SKUs include Son of a Peach, Cherry Pop, Red Ryder Punch, and Bodacious Berry.

Though the US remains its primary focus, Lucky Energy told Just Drinks it is starting to test “select” global markets.

“We’re building the company with a dual-path strategy in mind. The global energy drink market is a $100bn opportunity, and because the brand already resonates strongly in territories like Puerto Rico and the US, we’re exploring where else that momentum can translate.”

The company said it also has plans to head to Jamaica.

Alongside the new investment, Lucky Energy has also added Paine Schwartz Partners operating directors, James Brennan and Bob DeBorde, to its board.

Brennan is the founder and CEO of venture firm Enlightened Brand Ventures, while DeBorde is the chairman of Suja Life and natural supplements maker Promix Nutrition. Lucky Energy’s board already features Dan Ginsberg, former CEO of Red Bull North America.

“By combining great taste with clean, functional ingredients, the brand is positioned to lead the next wave of growth in the category,” DeBorde said.

The latest fundraise brings Lucky Energy’s total amount raised to date to $63m.

In June, Lucky Energy Drinks secured a “six-figure” investment from private equity firm InvestBev, which the drinks firm said fits its plan to expand into “fast-growing” non-alcoholic categories.

This followed its $14.2m raise in March, led by venture capital firm Maveron and saw the participation of DMG Ventures, a VC fund backed by UK media group Daily Mail and General Trust.

Lucky Energy currently sells in the US, with Richard Laver remaining the majority shareholder. It partners with third-party manufacturers, including DrinkPak and Polar.

It has 50 full-time employees and said it plans to keep expanding as the business “scales”.

Formerly known as Lucky F*ck, the company received $4m in seed funding from Imaginary Ventures in December 2023.

[TITLE]On Holding Continues to Beat Projections in Third Quarter:
[TEXT]
Story was updated at 4:16 p.m. Wednesday.

Nike may be clawing its way back to popularity, but don’t count out On Holding.

Despite some analyst hesitation that the popular Swiss running brand may be losing some of its steam to a reviving Nike, the company once again posted record sales and profits in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.

“We continue to reiterate that we are on a different journey — to become the most premium brand in the industry,” Martin Hoffmann, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, told WWD.

It appears to be working.

Adjusted net income in the period nearly tripled to 142 million Swiss francs from 50 million Swiss francs in the prior year on a 24.9 percent sales gain, or 34.5 percent on a constant currency basis, to 794.4 million Swiss francs. Adjusted earnings per share were 0.36 Swiss francs, up from 0.09 Swiss francs in the prior year.

This beat Wall Street expectations of a quarterly sales increase of 20.1 percent and adjusted earnings per share of 0.27 Swiss francs.

The company’s direct-to-consumer sales increased 27.6 percent to 14.7 million Swiss francs, or 37.5 percent on a constant currency basis, while sales in the wholesale channel rose 23.3 percent, or 32.5 percent on a constant currency basis, to 479.6 million Swiss francs.

By region, net sales increased 33 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 21 percent in the Americas and 109.2 percent in Asia-Pacific on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific is the company’s fastest-growing region with four consecutive quarters of triple-digit sales growth, and analysts were expecting sales in the American market to slow.

“The U.S. continues to be strong,” Hoffmann said. This comes despite a price increase of around 7 percent on select lifestyle products starting in the second half of the year. He said the company has experienced no resistance to the price hikes. “We continue to power on full-price sales,” he said on an earnings call Wednesday morning, adding that “affluent consumers are not price-sensitive.”

By category, net sales from shoes rose 21.1 percent to 731.3 million Swiss francs; apparel sales increased 86.9 percent to 50.1 million Swiss francs, and accessories sales rose 145.3 percent to 13 million Swiss francs.

Although apparel still represents around 8 percent of overall sales, Hoffmann said it is growing more strongly than footwear. And in the quarter, the company sold more than 1 million pieces of apparel for the first time, and the short-term goal is to raise the total sales percentage of the category to double digits. Hoffmann said on the call that the training and tennis categories are most popular, and the plan for the future is to “attack in additional categories” that can be worn every day.

He added that apparel penetration in the company’s retail stores is much higher, hitting between 10 and 20 percent, and in many cases serves as an introduction to the brand. On the call, he said apparel has become “a key acquisition channel” since apparel shoppers “buy more frequently and with bigger baskets. We are also seeing a clear shift toward younger customers in apparel, highlighting the sizable and well-defined long-term opportunity. Importantly, we are not building apparel as an add-on to our footwear business, but as a company within the company serving the same communities but with a unique product offering and customer experience. As a result, apparel is driving incremental high value growth across all our channels.”

Turning to retail, On operates 60 stores globally with additions in the Ginza in Tokyo; a flagship in its hometown of Zurich; Palo Alto, Calif.; its first South Korean store in Seoul, and a unit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Hoffmann said only a small number of stores are slated to open this year but the company will continue to add between 20 and 25 units a year in the future. “That’s the cadence we had this year,” he said.

While its own stores are an important part of the business, Hoffmann stressed that wholesale continues to be a key cog in its wheel. He said with the big-box stores such as Dick’s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker, there are 60 percent of doors that do not carry the brand. And within the run specialty channel, he expects business to be strong next year as the company introduces new models of some of its key franchises, such as the Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner.

On the earnings call, Caspar Coppetti, cofounder and executive co-chairman of On, singled out New York City Marathon women’s winner Hellen Obiri, an On athlete, who wore the new Cloudboom Strike Lightspray, as proof that its “new technology is being trusted and adopted by the world’s best athletes in the most iconic races. Our strategy is clear. Technology is proven at the highest level of competition and then refined to deliver the best experience for every type of runner. This elite credibility flows directly to our core performance running franchises Cloudsurfer, Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner. These are the engines that have won millions of fans and driven our significant sustained growth in the run category.”

Next year, Coppetti said, the company will launch the Cloudsufer Max, a model featuring “engineering and foam innovations,” as well as the LightSpray Cloudmonster Hyper, a shoe for everyday runners that features the company’s “championship level technology.”

As a result of the strong third-quarter results, the company raised its outlook for the year and is expecting net sales to grow 34 percent on a constant currency basis, to 2.91 billion Swiss francs, up from 31 percent previously. Analysts were expecting sales for the year to increase 28.2 percent. And in 2026, Hoffmann said, the company is projecting growth of at least 23 percent.

Hoffmann said the optimism is driven by the momentum already experienced in the fourth quarter and the strong sales in China. Looking ahead, the company plans to release a holiday campaign and continue to lean into collaborations, such as ones that just released with Loewe, with which it codesigned a Cloudsolo sneaker, as well as a capsule of apparel and footwear with SkyHigh Farm Goods.

Hoffmann declined to say if its partnership with Zendaya will get a refresh later this year, but Coppetti pointed to the popularity of the Cloudzoon Moon shoe collaboration it introduced with her this August as evidence of the company’s ability to blend fashion and performance. The shoe — and the fall collection she wore in the campaign — are helping the brand gain “connection and traction with young, aspirational consumers, especially teens,” he said on the earnings call.

Despite the strong showing, analysts still had some reservations. Tom Nikic of Needham & Co. said although On “remains the strongest growth company in our coverage,” he lowered his price target to $52 from $62 “as we believe that multiples in the second have moved structurally lower.” But he retained his “buy” rating on the stock.

Peter McGoldrick of Stifel also maintained a buy rating on the stock, writing that while there may be a “deceleration in fourth-quarter reported revenue growth and higher operating expenses,” he remained encouraged by the results against a challenging environment.

John Kernan of TD Cowen also retained a buy rating on the stock and reiterated his $55 target, and Cristina Fernandez of Telsey Group said the strong results disproved “concerns of a slowdown due to intense competition and a discerning U.S. consumer.”

Shares on Wednesday of On Holding closed up 18 percent to $41.51.

[TITLE]Gen Z and millennials are telling India’s sneaker story, homegrown brands ride new wave:
[TEXT]
Looking to experiment with a new kind of footwear, 26-year-old Devyani R bought her first pair from a home-grown sports shoe brand with ghungroos woven into them. Devyani, who loves wearing anklets but often loses them, found the idea of attaching an anklet to the shoe practical and stylish.“Sneakers with skirts are such a fun fashion statement. These feel like they were designed for skirts. I didn’t see anything else like it in the market,” she said.Devyani’s choice mirrors a growing trend among Gen Z and millennials looking for sports shoes that have unique Indian designs, limited editions and comfort. Many direct-to-consumer (D2C) manufacturers are now tapping into this mass-premium market or bridge-to-luxury segment, positioning sports shoes as “aspirational yet accessible”.Priced at Rs 3,000-5,500, these shoes are attracting consumers in the 18-35 age bracket mostly through social media. Founders told ET that repeat purchases make up 20-30% of overall sales, promising growing brand loyalty.Home-grown brands such as Comet , Gully Labs, Thaely, Neeman’s, Banjaaran and Bacca Bucci are riding this wave with focus on design and quality. Some have also raised pre-seed and series A rounds, such as Comet ($6.57 million), Neeman’s ($2.7 million), Gully Labs ($1.17 million) and Thaely ($344,000).For Gurgaon-based Gully Labs, every launch or collection is backed by storytelling and nostalgia. “We took ordinary Indian items and reimagined them as well-thought-out designs like our Kulfi and Ghungroo shoes, which are among our bestsellers and also our most expensive. People appreciated that originality,” said founder Arjun Singh.Bengaluru-based Comet has also taken a storytelling-led approach. The brand makes limited edition, theme-based sports shoes inspired by nostalgia and collaborations with Indian artists. It recently opened stores in Bengaluru and Delhi, offering a hands-on experience of its products.“The space is very hot for investors. It’s fast-growing and has high barriers to entry because creating these products is hard. You have to solve for both supply and demand,” said Utkarsh Gupta, cofounder of Comet.The company raised a $5.08 million series A round led by Elevation Capital and Nexus Venture Partners Bacca Bucci, of Shark Tank fame, which makes sports shoes and boots for men and women, is also expanding offline with new stores planned for Delhi-National Capital Region. “The market today is a mix of organised and unorganised players; the shift toward organised brands is happening. There will eventually be consolidation,” said founder Natwar Agrawal. He highlighted that material availability and minimum order quantities still lag behind China, which needs to be addressed.Most brands in the segment are eyeing revenue of Rs 100 crore by next year as they ramp up manufacturing through contractual agreements and building their own factories. Analysts estimate that sports shoes now make up 20-25% of India’s footwear market, and sales volume is projected to reach 73 million pairs by 2030.However, founders also said manufacturing remains one of the biggest challenges. India has long been strong in leather shoe exports, but is still catching up in the casual shoes segment. “Factories here are improving but are years behind China and Vietnam,” said one founder, who did not wish to be identified.Naman Lahoty, who tracks consumer investments at Stellaris Venture Partners, said while there’s excitement around the segment, strong supply chains are needed for scaling up. “India excels in leather but lacks an established ecosystem for sneakers. Back-end integration and material innovation will be key for emerging brands,” he said, adding that the firm will continue to evaluate brands with the potential to scale up to revenue of Rs 500-1,000 crore.Venture capitalists are watching the segment closely but remain cautious

[TITLE]Heard, Chef. Air Fryers Have Earned Their Place in Our Kitchens:
[TEXT]
It's Wednesday, around 6 p.m. It's been a busy day, but I'm already carving a perfectly roasted chicken on my favorite ebony cutting board, the bird's juices spilling out from under crispy skin and filling up the board's reservoir like a moat.

For years, Ina Garten's roasted chicken — or some variation of it — has been something of a Sunday tradition for me. It's not particularly decadent or overly involved, but it's reserved for Sundays because of its 2-hour total cooking time. Now, the same recipe, but adapted for the air fryer, hits the table in well under an hour.

After months of owning an air fryer and experimenting mostly with versions of traditionally fried foods, such as wings, fries and chicken cutlets, I made my first air fryer roast chicken on a whim. Stunned by the speedy cooking time — 25% faster than traditional roasting — tender meat and impossibly crispy skin without the usual tablespoon of butter, I haven't put a bird in the oven since.

Of all the kitchen tools I've collected, and there are many, the air fryer has shifted my cooking paradigm the most, making cooking easier, faster and more foolproof. Few and far between are air fryer fails, and frequent are the discoveries of something I'd been "making wrong" all along until I roasted it quickly under spiraling superconvection heat.

Save for the rare batch of cookies or large cut of meat for a dinner party, the air fryer has all but replaced my oven. I plan meals around it: If a recipe calls for the use of my oven — meat loaf, roasted salmon, charred cauliflower — I consider how I might adapt it for the air fryer.

Celebrated chef and restaurateur Stephanie Izard shares my enthusiasm. "It's such a versatile tool," the James Beard Award winner tells me. "I use mine all the time for dinners," she adds, naming fried rice, marinated chicken and salmon as a few of her go-tos. "It's like making one-pot meals — but roasted!"

We're not alone.

According to a CNET survey, over 70% of US adults either own or plan to own an air fryer within the year. Additional studies estimate that

[TITLE]EAC countries in new push to raise regional food security:
[TEXT]
EAC Council of Ministers Chairperson Beatrice Askul, says that under the south-south trade concept, the region can record high food supplies and also deepen trade. [File, Standard]

East and Central African countries have assured implementation of a broad roadmap encompassing bold actions to boost food and nutrition security.

The East African Council (EAC) of ministers recently agreed to fast-track focused plans targeting to increase food production to feed the increasing population and deepen grain trade in the region.

EAC Council of Ministers Chairperson Beatrice Askul, speaking recently during the closing of the 11th African Grain Trade Summit (AGTS) in Zanzibar, argued that under the south-south trade concept, the region can record high food supplies and also deepen trade.

“We commit to building resilient grain markets by strengthening regional integration and removing barriers that hinder trade and prioritising harmonisation of standards and regulatory frameworks so that African grain is competitive both regionally and globally, “ said Askul, who is also Kenya’s EAC and Regional Development Cabinet Secretary.

The three-day meeting was convened at Tanzania’s Indian Ocean archipelago of Zanzibar and organised by the East African Grain Council (EAGC).

The countries, Askul said, will mobilise resources to support the importance of scaling digital innovations and climate-smart technologies to reduce post-harvest losses and improve market intelligence.

In most of the regional countries, annually, farmers incur between 30 per cent and 40 per cent post-harvest losses, leading to starvation, forcing governments to import more food to bridge the deficit.

This has made the region one of the food-deficient areas and thus requires spending a lot of resources to source more food from the external markets. Kenya, for example, has to spend over Sh200 billion annually on food imports.

According to the African Union (AU) secretariat, Africa’s food import bill currently stands at $48 billion (Sh6.216 trillion), a major concern among the agriculture value chains and governments as food production continues to decline over the years.

AU under the trade framework -African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is pushing for south–south grain trade with full implementation of the strategy, which it says, if effectively implemented, could increase intra-African maize trade by up to 40 per cent by 2030.

“Key concerns that need to be addressed include the increasing food contamination, post-harvest losses, lack of strategic food reserves, low efficiency systems and geo-politics and conflicts,” said Komla Bissi, a senior advisor to the AfCFTA secretary general.

High-speed internet connections' wider reach, the widespread use of smartphones, and the growing accessibility of digital payment methods are all making it much easier for people all over the world to shop from international e-commerce platforms, which is helping the market grow.

The globalization of supply chains, which makes it much simpler for any company to get goods and components from around the globe, is another factor driving the e-commerce market statistics. This gives customers access to a wider range of products, frequently at competitive prices. As more third-party logistics companies appear, the shipping and delivery procedure is shortened considerably, making it easier, faster, and less expensive to complete a cross-border order than it was previously.

Features Driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI-generated interpretations are utilized to improve client satisfaction during sales operations and offer a deeper comprehension of market trends. In addition, virtual fitting rooms are becoming more popular. These rooms use AI for a number of methods, including improving fit prediction accuracy and enhancing the overall shopping experience.

By enabling customers to see how apparel items will appear on them before making a purchase, virtual fitting rooms offer more participatory and captivating experiences. These rooms are offered by many e-commerce businesses since they lower return rates and the related expenses for merchants.

Zalando, a prominent European online fashion and leisure portal, for example, launched a virtual fitting room in 2023 where millions of clients may design a 3D avatar by entering their gender, height, and weight to see how different sizes from different brands might suit them.

The creation of safe online payment methods. The growth of mobile (m)-commerce modes, which enable customers to transact using a mobile application, digital wallet, and contactless technology, is supported by secure digital systems and high individual dependability. Furthermore, the market is still heavily influenced by developments in encryption technology, multi-factor authentication, and the implementation of strict security protocols.

A lot of people feel at ease disclosing their financial information online. High e-commerce platform sales fuel the payment method, which is backed by safe digital payment that facilitates transactions. Additionally, digital payment solutions make it easy for overseas customers to complete transactions with only a few clicks, which supports the expansion of the e-commerce market.

Challenges in the E-Commerce Market

Cybersecurity and Data Privacy. Online businesses have serious difficulties as the risk of identity theft, data breaches, and cyberattacks increases with the volume of e-commerce transactions. Retaining credibility and confidence requires protecting sensitive consumer data, including payment information and personal information.

Cybersecurity methods including encryption, secure payment gateways, and multi-factor authentication are critical to safeguard data and ensure secure transactions. A single breach may result in monetary damages, legal repercussions, and serious harm to one's image. Additionally, companies need to remain in compliance with legislation like the CCPA and GDPR as data protection standards get more stringent. In addition to being required by law, maintaining strong cybersecurity and data privacy procedures is essential for sustained success in the cutthroat e-commerce industry.

Return and Refund Management. Since handling returns and refunds may be expensive and time-consuming, it presents a big issue for e-commerce companies. Consumers demand a smooth and easy return process; therefore, companies must manage product returns, refunds, and item restocking effectively. High return rates can raise operating expenses for things like shipping, inspection, and restocking, particularly in industries like electronics and clothing.

Retaining client loyalty also depends on promptly processing returns while ensuring consumer satisfaction. A company's reputation might be harmed by bad return experiences. Businesses must employ technology to track returns, optimize reverse logistics, and establish clear return procedures in order to manage this. One of the biggest challenges is still managing returns effectively while cutting expenses and preserving a satisfying customer experience.

[TITLE]On Holding Continues to Beat Projections in Third Quarter:
[TEXT]
Story was updated at 4:16 p.m. Wednesday.

Nike may be clawing its way back to popularity, but don’t count out On Holding.

Despite some analyst hesitation that the popular Swiss running brand may be losing some of its steam to a reviving Nike, the company once again posted record sales and profits in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.

“We continue to reiterate that we are on a different journey — to become the most premium brand in the industry,” Martin Hoffmann, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, told WWD.

It appears to be working.

Adjusted net income in the period nearly tripled to 142 million Swiss francs from 50 million Swiss francs in the prior year on a 24.9 percent sales gain, or 34.5 percent on a constant currency basis, to 794.4 million Swiss francs. Adjusted earnings per share were 0.36 Swiss francs, up from 0.09 Swiss francs in the prior year.

This beat Wall Street expectations of a quarterly sales increase of 20.1 percent and adjusted earnings per share of 0.27 Swiss francs.

The company’s direct-to-consumer sales increased 27.6 percent to 14.7 million Swiss francs, or 37.5 percent on a constant currency basis, while sales in the wholesale channel rose 23.3 percent, or 32.5 percent on a constant currency basis, to 479.6 million Swiss francs.

By region, net sales increased 33 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 21 percent in the Americas and 109.2 percent in Asia-Pacific on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific is the company’s fastest-growing region with four consecutive quarters of triple-digit sales growth, and analysts were expecting sales in the American market to slow.

“The U.S. continues to be strong,” Hoffmann said. This comes despite a price increase of around 7 percent on select lifestyle products starting in the second half of the year. He said the company has experienced no resistance to the price hikes. “We continue to power on full-price sales,” he said on an earnings call Wednesday morning, adding that “affluent consumers are not price-sensitive.”

By category, net sales from shoes rose 21.1 percent to 731.3 million Swiss francs; apparel sales increased 86.9 percent to 50.1 million Swiss francs, and accessories sales rose 145.3 percent to 13 million Swiss francs.

Although apparel still represents around 8 percent of overall sales, Hoffmann said it is growing more strongly than footwear. And in the quarter, the company sold more than 1 million pieces of apparel for the first time, and the short-term goal is to raise the total sales percentage of the category to double digits. Hoffmann said on the call that the training and tennis categories are most popular, and the plan for the future is to “attack in additional categories” that can be worn every day.

He added that apparel penetration in the company’s retail stores is much higher, hitting between 10 and 20 percent, and in many cases serves as an introduction to the brand. On the call, he said apparel has become “a key acquisition channel” since apparel shoppers “buy more frequently and with bigger baskets. We are also seeing a clear shift toward younger customers in apparel, highlighting the sizable and well-defined long-term opportunity. Importantly, we are not building apparel as an add-on to our footwear business, but as a company within the company serving the same communities but with a unique product offering and customer experience. As a result, apparel is driving incremental high value growth across all our channels.”

Turning to retail, On operates 60 stores globally with additions in the Ginza in Tokyo; a flagship in its hometown of Zurich; Palo Alto, Calif.; its first South Korean store in Seoul, and a unit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Hoffmann said only a small number of stores are slated to open this year but the company will continue to add between 20 and 25 units a year in the future. “That’s the cadence we had this year,” he said.

While its own stores are an important part of the business, Hoffmann stressed that wholesale continues to be a key cog in its wheel. He said with the big-box stores such as Dick’s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker, there are 60 percent of doors that do not carry the brand. And within the run specialty channel, he expects business to be strong next year as the company introduces new models of some of its key franchises, such as the Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner.

On the earnings call, Caspar Coppetti, cofounder and executive co-chairman of On, singled out New York City Marathon women’s winner Hellen Obiri, an On athlete, who wore the new Cloudboom Strike Lightspray, as proof that its “new technology is being trusted and adopted by the world’s best athletes in the most iconic races. Our strategy is clear. Technology is proven at the highest level of competition and then refined to deliver the best experience for every type of runner. This elite credibility flows directly to our core performance running franchises Cloudsurfer, Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner. These are the engines that have won millions of fans and driven our significant sustained growth in the run category.”

Next year, Coppetti said, the company will launch the Cloudsufer Max, a model featuring “engineering and foam innovations,” as well as the LightSpray Cloudmonster Hyper, a shoe for everyday runners that features the company’s “championship level technology.”

As a result of the strong third-quarter results, the company raised its outlook for the year and is expecting net sales to grow 34 percent on a constant currency basis, to 2.91 billion Swiss francs, up from 31 percent previously. Analysts were expecting sales for the year to increase 28.2 percent. And in 2026, Hoffmann said, the company is projecting growth of at least 23 percent.

Hoffmann said the optimism is driven by the momentum already experienced in the fourth quarter and the strong sales in China. Looking ahead, the company plans to release a holiday campaign and continue to lean into collaborations, such as ones that just released with Loewe, with which it codesigned a Cloudsolo sneaker, as well as a capsule of apparel and footwear with SkyHigh Farm Goods.

Hoffmann declined to say if its partnership with Zendaya will get a refresh later this year, but Coppetti pointed to the popularity of the Cloudzoon Moon shoe collaboration it introduced with her this August as evidence of the company’s ability to blend fashion and performance. The shoe — and the fall collection she wore in the campaign — are helping the brand gain “connection and traction with young, aspirational consumers, especially teens,” he said on the earnings call.

Despite the strong showing, analysts still had some reservations. Tom Nikic of Needham & Co. said although On “remains the strongest growth company in our coverage,” he lowered his price target to $52 from $62 “as we believe that multiples in the second have moved structurally lower.” But he retained his “buy” rating on the stock.

Peter McGoldrick of Stifel also maintained a buy rating on the stock, writing that while there may be a “deceleration in fourth-quarter reported revenue growth and higher operating expenses,” he remained encouraged by the results against a challenging environment.

John Kernan of TD Cowen also retained a buy rating on the stock and reiterated his $55 target, and Cristina Fernandez of Telsey Group said the strong results disproved “concerns of a slowdown due to intense competition and a discerning U.S. consumer.”

Shares on Wednesday of On Holding closed up 18 percent to $41.51.

[TITLE]What Saks Global Has Riding on the Holiday Season: A Crucial Moment on Its Path Ahead:
[TEXT]
The holiday season is always make or break in retail — but that goes doubly so for Saks Global this year.

The retailer closed on its $2.7 billion deal to buy Neiman Marcus Group just two days before Christmas last year, launching both into a new era.

Chief executive officer Marc Metrick has been rushing to reset the company and luxury retail. He’s made rapid progress, cutting annual costs by $200 million already and integrating the backends of the two businesses.

But more so, it’s been a year of financial strain — from a bondholder freakout over the summer when investors realized their debt wasn’t directly secured by the famous Fifth Avenue flagship to continued strains with vendors who are being very careful in what goods they ship.

The result is a department store group that is still striving toward the future of shopping while dragging along a debt load of $4.9 billion.

In addition to all the consolidation to bring the two retailers together, there’s also been a management shakeup with the departure of Emily Essner, president and chief commercial officer; Bill Bine, chief transformation officer, and Rob Brooks, chief operating officer.

It remains to be seen what Santa brings for Saks Global this year, but there are still six weeks to go until Christmas. Here, three ways the holiday might play out and shape the retailer’s path into 2026 — from the grinchiest, most speculative scenario to where the retailer gets everything on its wish list.

Too Little, Too Late

Saks Global has been on a high wire for some time — slow on payments to vendors for years, squaring off with bondholders before a high-profile refinancing in August, contending with slowing sales and more.

The company is broadly the creation of executive chairman Richard Baker and has worked as well as it has because Baker is a very adept dealmaker. Many thought it was impossible that Saks Global could ever buy Neiman’s.

But even Baker can do the impossible only so many times.

If Christmas falls flat for Saks Global and there’s not enough from asset sales to make a difference, experts around the industry speculate that Saks could eventually face an existential change in ownership, either in or out of bankruptcy court.

Debt watchdog Standard & Poor’s gave Saks Global an ultralow CCC rating after its refinancing and projected the company would see a $500 million deficit in reported free cash flow this year.

[TITLE]Mobile Applications Industry Report 2025: Market Trends, Outlook & Strategy Forecast to 2033 - Rising Demand for In-App Purchases Boosts Market Growth Beyond Initial Downloads:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Mobile Application Market Trends, Outlook & Forecast 2025-2033" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Mobile Application Market is expected to reach US$ 740.25 billion by 2033 from US$ 259.55 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 12.35% from 2025 to 2033. Smartphone penetration, 5G penetration, increased internet usage, in-app purchase, mobile commerce expansion, gaming and entertainment app demand, digital shift, AI incorporation, and increasing workplace mobility solutions are some of the key drivers contributing to the mobile application industry.

Growth Drivers for the Mobile Application Market

Rising Smartphone Penetration

One of the primary drivers of the mobile application market is rising smartphone penetration. Mobile users are still growing rapidly as smartphones expand their reach and become cheaper, especially in developing nations. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates 5.4 billion internet users in the world as of 2023, from 5.3 billion in 2022. That's 67% of the population. Increasingly, more individuals are able to access and use mobile apps on a daily basis due to this ubiquitous connectivity. Also, based on industry observers, 21% of millennials use an app as many as 50 times a day, illustrating the rising reliance on apps for productivity, communication, entertainment, and buying. This again propels market growth.

Growing In-App Purchases

The growth of the mobile application market is largely fueled by growing in-app purchases. Through the ability to buy additional features, content, or services within an app, in-app purchases provide developers with a steady revenue stream outside of initial downloads. Especially typical applications of this revenue model are subscription-based, gaming, and lifestyle apps. The aspiration of individualized experiences and high-quality information on the part of users makes them willing to pay for applications. Reliable digital wallets and enhanced payment integrations play their roles in this development. Since more businesses are adopting freemium business models, in-app purchases play a significant role in the mobile app economy due to increased user engagement, retention, and profitability.

AI and Machine Learning Integration

Growth of the mobile app market is primarily fueled by growing in-app purchases. Through allowing users to buy additional features, content, or services inside an app, in-app purchases provide developers with a stable source of revenue aside from upfront downloads. Especially prevalent applications of this monetization strategy are in subscription-based, game, and lifestyle applications. Users' need for personalized experiences and quality information makes them more willing to pay for apps. Secure digital wallets and enhanced payment integrations also make them more likely to do so. Since more and more companies are employing freemium business models, in-app purchases are a significant aspect of the mobile app economy since they raise user engagement, retention, and profitability.

Challenges in the Mobile Application Market

Intense Competition

With millions of apps available on sites like Google Play and the Apple App Store, fierce competition is a major obstacle in the mobile application business. Strong branding, outstanding user experience, and constant innovation are necessary to stand out in such a crowded market. Because of the dominance of established players and short user attention spans, many new apps have difficulty being visible. Without efficient marketing techniques, even top-notch apps could have trouble getting downloaded. In order to keep customers and stay competitive in the market, developers must also provide distinctive features, frequent updates, and interesting content because user expectations are always rising.

Data Privacy and Security

Security and privacy of data are major issues in the market for mobile applications. Because applications gather sensitive user data, including contacts, location, financial information, and personal preferences, it is crucial to make sure that it is handled securely. User trust and brand reputation can be seriously harmed by data breaches or misuse. Developers must abide by stringent legislation such as the CCPA, GDPR, and other local statutes, which call for strong encryption, safe data storage, and open privacy practices. App development becomes more complex and expensive when these measures are put into place. Additionally, the increasing risk of malware and assaults necessitates regular security updates, thus mobile app developers are constantly concerned

Dublin, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "E-Commerce Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The E-Commerce Market is expected to reach US$ 12.63 trillion by 2033 from US$ 6.56 trillion in 2024, with a CAGR of 7.54% from 2025 to 2033. The market is expanding due to the growing demand for AI-powered features, the substantial expansion of cross-border commerce opportunities, and advancements in safe digital payment systems.
