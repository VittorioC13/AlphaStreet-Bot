[TITLE]Figure Technology targets $526M in IPO amid crypto listing wave:
[TEXT]
Figure aims to raise $526M in IPO, valuing the blockchain lender at $4.3B.

IPO momentum grows as Gemini, Kraken, and Bullish drive the crypto listing wave.

Figure shifts from lending roots to blockchain finance, boosting investor interest.

Blockchain-focused lender Figure Technology Solutions is preparing to raise $526 million through its upcoming initial public offering (IPO), according to regulatory filings submitted Tuesday and reported by Bloomberg Law.

The company intends to sell 21.5 million shares priced between $18 and $20 each, with 4.9 million shares expected to come from existing holders.

At the high end of the price range, the IPO would assign the company a valuation of roughly $4.3 billion.

Figure first signaled its public market ambitions last month when it filed confidentially with regulators, followed by a formal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on August 18.

The latest filings suggest the company is targeting September 10 for its IPO pricing date.

The firm’s valuation has steadily increased since its 2021 Series D funding round, when it raised $200 million in a deal led by 10T Holdings that valued the company at $3.2 billion.

More recently, Figure reported financial momentum, with revenues reaching $191 million in the first half of 2025.

From consumer lending to blockchain infrastructure

While Figure is now recognized for its blockchain-driven financial products built on the Provenance Blockchain, the company originally focused on consumer lending.

Its first offering was a digitized home equity line of credit for US homeowners, before expanding into blockchain infrastructure designed to streamline lending, securitization, and related processes.

By leveraging blockchain technology, Figure has positioned itself at the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized systems, aiming to deliver faster, more transparent, and cost-effective financial solutions.

This pivot has helped the company differentiate itself from fintech rivals while attracting investor interest in its long-term growth prospects.

Crypto IPO momentum builds

Figure’s listing effort comes as more crypto and blockchain firms move toward the public markets during the ongoing bull market cycle.

On Tuesday, the crypto exchange Gemini also filed for an IPO, seeking to raise $317 million.

Rival exchange Kraken is rumored to be pursuing a $500 million raise at a valuation of around $15 billion, though reports suggest it may delay its public debut until 2026.

Meanwhile, several high-profile listings have already set a precedent this year.

In August, digital asset exchange operator Bullish launched its IPO with shares priced at $37, soaring as much as 218% on its first trading day.

Despite a pullback, Bullish still maintains a market capitalisation of roughly $9.6 billion, up from its IPO valuation of $4.8 billion.

Similarly, stablecoin issuer Circle completed an IPO that raised about $1.1 billion, with shares more than doubling on the first day of trading. The company now commands a market capitalization of approximately $30 billion.

Gemini, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’ crypto exchange also readying for its public debut, with the firm aiming to raise $317 million at a valuation of $2.2 billion.

Beyond traditional IPOs, the industry is exploring alternative routes.

A group of crypto executives recently launched Bitcoin Infrastructure Acquisition Corp, a Cayman Islands-based special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) targeting a $200 million raise through an IPO.

[TITLE]Chips just got considerably higher:
[TEXT]
On Tuesday, India's first indigenously developed 32-bit processor chip 'Vikram' was unveiled at Semicon India 2025 in New Delhi. Designed by Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) and fabricated at Isro's Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL) in Mohali, the chip has been built primarily for satellites and rockets, but its rugged design makes it suitable for other applications like defence systems, advanced automotive solutions and high-reliability energy systems as well.Vikram-32 signals India's entry into a sector that could fundamentally transform its economic landscape and global strategic positioning despite being a late starter.India's semiconductor market is anticipated to expand from ₹4,50,164 cr ($52 bn) in 2024 to ₹8,95,134 cr ($103.4 bn) by 2030, representing a 13% CAGR.This growth trajectory positions India to gain significant value in a global industry that stimulates $7 tn in economic activity annually across the world. Economic impact extends beyond market size.Till date, the Union Cabinet has sanctioned 10 semiconductor projects, with cumulative investment commitments of ₹1.60 tn ($18.23 bn), while nine projects under the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) have secured around $900 mn in proposed investments, and are expected to create over 15,700 jobs nationwide. India plans to add 1 mn new semiconductor jobs by 2026 to its existing workforce of 2.2 lakh professionals.But these opportunities come at a premium. Each job created in the semicon sector costs around ₹4 cr to GoI, compared to ₹38k for housing and ₹12.5 lakh for general manufacturing. This investment intensity underscores the strategic nature of chip manufacturing as a high-value, capital-intensive industry.The economic logic behind India's semiconductor push is compelling. Integrated circuits (ICs) contributed 86.4% of its semiconductor market revenue in 2024, while internet penetration rate increased by nearly 50% over the previous decade, with the consumer electronics market expected to grow 6-8% annually from its $73 bn base in 2022.This domestic demand, combined with global supply chain diversification trends, creates a substantial market opportunity. Existing design ecosystem - hosting centres for the world's top 8 chip companies - provides a foundation that emerging manufacturing hubs cannot replicate quickly.Strategically, semicon manufacturing offers India several advantages:Reduces import dependency in a critical tech sector.Positions India as an alternative to China-centric supply chains, aligning with global risk-mitigation strategies.Creates high-value jobs and tech capabilities that can spill over into other industries.To maximise economic returns, talent development remains critical. The planned expansion from 2.2 lakh to 1.22 mn professionals by 2026 requires massive skills training initiatives. GoI's approach includes partnerships with industry leaders and specialised training programmes.Supply chain localisation presents another optimisation opportunity. India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA) suggests targeting 25% local value addition by 2025-26 and 40% by 2030. This would significantly enhance economic multipliers and reduce import dependencies.Policy consistency is crucial for sustaining investor confidence. GoI's 50% funding commitment for approved projects is demonstrative. But long-term success requires maintaining these incentives across time. Partnerships with the right companies have to be fostered so that the latest lithography and other manufacturing technology is made easily available to Indian companies under prudent business arrangements, despite rising geopolitical push and pull around chip technology. Presence of top CEOs of the global semiconductor ecosystem and partnerships built in short time provide an indication of interest in India.India's semicon journey reflects a maturing understanding that success requires global integration, rather than autarky. Many of the global partnership approaches being pursued acknowledge different tech strengths: US leadership in cutting-edge design, Japanese excellence in manufacturing precision, and EU expertise in automotive and industrial applications. Global leader Taiwan and largest chip consumer China are, of course, also in this Great Game.With expectations to capture 10% of the global semiconductor market by 2030, India's semiconductor story has just got gung-ho.

[TITLE]Global chip firms expect India to play key role in shaping semicon future; commit support:
[TEXT]
New Delhi, Sep 2 (PTI) Global semiconductor players expect India to play a key role in shaping the future of the industry, driven by policy support and talent pool.

During the inaugural session of Semicon India 2025, Dutch semiconductor equipment major ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet while lauding India's ambition for nurturing the chip ecosystem said that the countries around the world are racing to secure their technological future.

"It is not only an opportunity for economic growth and job creation, but also important for national resilience. By developing semiconductor manufacturing and design capability, India can secure its supply chains, foster innovation and entrepreneurship, and create new opportunities in research and education.

"At ASML, we see in India a partner with great potential and we are committed to helping you as we shape the future of technology. We are dedicated to supporting India's ambition, whether through collaboration, knowledge exchange, or talent," Fouquet said.

ASML is a global leader in semiconductor lithography technologies that are required for creating circuits on silicon to make them an active component in the form of a microchip.

"Our advanced lithography solution can help India's fabs to achieve cutting-edge performance," Fouquet said.

Semiconductor material technology major Merck's Member of the Executive Board and CEO for Electronics, Kai Beckmann, said that as geopolitical challenges have been rising in recent years, the semiconductor industry is navigating unprecedented challenges.

"On the way to a multipolar world, we are currently facing significant uncertainty, disrupted supply chains and a reshaped global technology landscape. India will not only contribute to strengthening the global semiconductor industry but will play a crucial role in shaping our digital future," Beckmann said.

He said that the semiconductor industry is a team sport and "we can only be successful together".

Applied Materials President of the Semiconductor Products Group (SPG), Prabu Raja, said that the world is racing towards artificial intelligence and India has an essential role to play in innovating in making powerful and more energy-efficient semiconductors.

"We believe inventing India can make this possible. With world-class talent and vibrant universities, India is well-positioned to shape the future of chip manufacturing.

He said Applied Materials' technology is used to produce every advanced chip in the world.

"All our equipment have engineering contents from India. And soon, we aim to deliver innovations from India that will change the way chips are made. This is a huge value that India can provide and secure its leadership in artificial intelligence," Raja said.

Semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker Lam Research CEO Tim Archer said that the industry grows towards USD 1 trillion mark and beyond, the company continues to invest in technology, talent, and supply chain around the world, including here in India, as the country escalates its role in the industry.

"We see India laying a foundation for a resilient semiconductor ecosystem. The future of the Indian semiconductor industry is bright. This is an emerging market with a deep talent pool and a government that's actively enabling progress through incentives and policy," he said.

Archer said that it has been present in India for 25 years, and its team in the country is a critical enabler of our technology innovation and global operations.

"Now, in the context of a $1 trillion semiconductor industry, a larger, more resilient supply chain becomes essential. And we are making good progress integrating India into our global supply chain ecosystem, which we believe will deliver shared value across the industry," Archer said.

AMD chief technology officer Mark Papermaster said India is an integral part of the company's global development.

"We have developed here engineering talent that is touching every one of our products across CPUs, GPUs, adaptive computing, and embedded devices. It's touching the industry across the world's data centres, cloud services, AI platforms, and embedded devices everywhere. This has come as a result of an over 20-year talent investment in India that has allowed us to develop such a wide range of skills in R&D and engineering," Papermaster said.

He said that last year AMD opened one its largest design centers in the world in Bengaluru.

[TITLE]India can be among top 5 semiconductor nations: Merck Electronics CEO:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: India is on track to become one of the world’s top five semiconductor nations, said Kai Beckmann, chief executive of German chip resources and components firm Merck’s electronics business. Driven by this projection, the company is stepping up its presence in India, including via a memorandum of understanding signed with Tata Electronics on Tuesday.

Beckmann, in an interview with Mint on the sidelines of the fourth edition of the Semicon India conference on Tuesday, said it is not necessary for India to emulate Taiwan in shaping its semiconductor ecosystem.

“Today,global trade and collaboration is not as free as what it used to be. In such a shifting world, there is no specification that ensures that a certain country remains at the top of a global industry," Beckmann said. “India, on this note, can continue to establish a significantly important semiconductor ecosystem and still be important for the global supply chain."

Beckmann added that Merck is bullish on India’s push to establish a semiconductor ecosystem that supplies actively to the world.

“What established nations offer is only one opportunity, and there are many other opportunities in semiconductors that I believe India will play," he said

[TITLE]Google Dodges Chrome Sale In Antitrust Ruling, Must Share Data:
[TEXT]
‘Better Than Feared’

“The ruling is far better than feared for Google,” said Nat Schindler, an analyst at Scotiabank.

The order is one of the most monumental court decisions affecting the tech sector in more than a quarter century, and could offer a blueprint for other judges who may end up weighing similar choices in cases against Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple.

In another win for Google, the judge didn’t bar the company from making payments to third parties including Apple for default browser placement in browsers or on mobile devices.

“Cutting off payments from Google almost certainly will impose substantial — in some cases, crippling — downstream harms to distribution partners, related markets, and consumers, which counsels against a broad payment ban,” the judge wrote.

Sharing Search Data

Under the ruling, Google will required to share some of its search data with competitors. Those competitors could include Microsoft Corp. and DuckDuckGo Inc., as well as many of the new AI companies like OpenAI and Perplexity. That data would aid in building out competing search engines or artificial intelligence models.

The judge also ruled that Google can no longer require device makers to take all of its apps in order to access the Google Play Store on Android — a second modest win for the Justice Department in addition to the data-sharing requirement.

“Google is being held accountable,” DOJ antitrust head Gail Slater said in a post on X. “The court didn’t order all of our requested relief, and we are weighing our options. But the court did agree with the need for remedies that will restore competition and reopen the digital playing field, driving investment and innovation that will ensure America leads the next era of technology.”

But multiple Google opponents criticized the decision as not going far enough.

“We do not believe the remedies ordered by the court will force the changes necessary to adequately address Google’s illegal behavior,” said DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg, who testified at the trial. “Google will still be allowed to continue to use its monopoly to hold back competitors, including in AI search.”

Allowing the payments for browser placement to continue is a win for Apple, which favors the Google search engine by giving it the best placement in Safari search bar on computer and mobile devices. Users can opt to switch to Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, DuckDuckGo and other options.

Allowing Google to keep making payments to Apple will give the iPhone maker a much needed reprieve for its services segment, which is already under fire globally from regulators trying to break up its $100 billion per year App Store business. The judge’s ruling indicates that the default arrangement can continue — with minor adjustments.

[TITLE]OpenAI targets India with datacentre push:
[TEXT]
OpenAI is preparing a one-gigawatt datacentre in India as part of its $500bn “Stargate” infrastructure push, in what would be its biggest bet yet on its second-largest user base.

The facility, to be built under the OpenAI for Countries programme launched in May 2025, aims to support local artificial intelligence (AI) computing while complying with India’s personal data protection regime.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, expected in New Delhi later this year to open the company’s first India office, said in a recent X post that OpenAI is “excited to invest much more” in the country. Details on the datacentre's location, partners and timelines remain unclear.

The upcoming datacentre is among the first ten projects under a US-backed effort to develop global AI infrastructure and offer an alternative to rivals like China.

It is expected to reduce latency for OpenAI’s India customers such as 10BedICU, which is using OpenAI’s application programming interfaces (APIs) and AI models to transcribe patient-doctor consultations, summarise patient records and capture data from hospital monitors. In May 2025, OpenAI enabled data residency in India for ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and its API platform, to comply with local data sovereignty rules.

“The OpenAI move clearly reflects the growing importance of Indian users for its AI offerings,” said Naresh Singh, senior director analyst at Gartner. He noted that without a datacentre in the country to operate its AI models and agents, “it would be difficult, if not impossible, to meet growing data residency and AI sovereignty requirements” likely to be imposed on service providers in India.

Singh sees potential for stronger ties with government and businesses, provided OpenAI partners smartly to meet India’s regulatory and market needs. The company is reportedly exploring a partnership with Reliance Industries and is working with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) under the IndiaAI Mission.

Deepika Giri, associate vice-president for big data analytics and AI at IDC Asia-Pacific, noted that India’s growing digital backbone of cloud and data infrastructure is key to scaling AI across different sectors. And with inference demand soaring since 2023, OpenAI’s India datacentre could accelerate AI adoption across both large enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses, she added.

According to IDC, AI spending in India is set to outpace overall tech investment by more than twofold, adding $115bn to the economy by 2027. Giri noted that OpenAI’s focus on data residency could give it an edge over hyperscalers like Google, Meta and Microsoft.

In addition, Giri said a successful OpenAI datacentre in India could inspire global players to prioritise localised AI compute investments in the country with a focus on sustainability. “India’s power constraints mean renewable integration will be vital if AI-ready infrastructure is to scale sustainably,” she added.

Beyond infrastructure, OpenAI is partnering with the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras to conduct long-term studies on how AI can improve learning outcomes and foster innovative teaching methods. It is also offering training, API credits for IndiaAI fellows, and distributing free ChatGPT licences to students and educators.

In August 2025, MeitY restarted consultations on its national datacentre policy to speed up datacentre builds in India with a single-window clearance system. It is also planning new datacentre economic zones to drive datacentre expansion into smaller cities.

“We will strengthen our recruitment of engineers and further accelerate our AI agent business,” the company said in a Monday (Sept. 1) post on social platform X, translated by Grok.

TechCrunch reported Monday that LayerX offers a platform called Bakuraku that automates expense management, invoice processing and corporate card operations; a retail digital securities investment platform called Alterna; and a generative AI solution called Ai Workforce that streamlines workflows and harnesses enterprise data.

LayerX’s offerings provide solutions for companies in Japan that need to automate finance, tax, procurement and human resources (HR) but have run into barriers when trying to do so, according to the report.

CEO Yoshinori Fukushima told TechCrunch, per the report: “We passed 10,000 customers in February 2024 and reached 15,000 by April 2025, with more enterprise clients coming on board.”

In another, separate development in Japan, OpenAI and the SoftBank Group said in February that they agreed to establish a joint venture company to market enterprise AI solutions to major companies in Japan.

The companies said the joint venture, SB OpenAI Japan, would market enterprise AI called “Cristal intelligence,” which they would jointly develop and market. In addition, they said SoftBank would spend $3 billion annually to integrate Cristal intelligence and existing tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise across its group companies.

“This initiative will not only transform the way SoftBank Group operates but also revolutionize the way companies work in Japan and around the globe,” SoftBank Group Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son said at the time in a
