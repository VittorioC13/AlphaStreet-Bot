Asian markets fluctuated Tuesday as investors assessed the latest tech rally on Wall Street amid worries a bubble is forming in the sector, while mixed signals from Federal Reserve officials fed uncertainty over its next interest rate move.

A flood of multi-billion-dollar investment into artificial intelligence has been a key driver of the surge in mostly technology equities across the globe this year, sending valuations to record highs.

The rally has been helped by easing trade tensions since US President Donald Trump’s April tariff bombshell and expectations that the Fed will continue lowering borrowing costs

There is also a fear of missing out, in turn pushing prices up further, but there is increasing talk that the gains may have gone too far — with most of the gains coming from the tech sector — and a painful correction could be on the way.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI signed a $38 billion deal with Amazon’s AWS cloud computing arm, marking its latest huge tie-up following agreements with Oracle, Broadcom, AMD and chip titan Nvidia.

“Even after the tariff-induced swoon in April, global equities have tacked on $17 trillion in market value, with the rally increasingly bottlenecked into the same handful of tech titans,” wrote SPI Asset Management’s Stephen Innes.

“It’s as if the entire market has narrowed to a single crowded corridor, the walls lined with AI logos and venture dreams.

“Amazon’s move simply adds another rocket to the booster stack — and traders are cheering the ignition, not asking how much fuel remains.”

Wall Street ended on a mixed note, with the tech-rich Nasdaq rising along with the S&P 500 but the Dow in the red.

Asia struggled to extend Monday’s advances.

Hong Kong rose with Wellington, Manila and Jakarta but Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Seoul and Taipei edged down with Shanghai flat.

Remarks from Fed officials did little to provide support for further buying after boss Jerome Powell indicated last week that a third rate cut this year — after one in each of the past two meetings — was not definite.

Governor Lisa Cook said she saw inflation remaining elevated in the coming year as tariffs bite, pointing out that some businesses had indicated they were running down inventories before passing on costs to consumers.

“Looking ahead, policy is not on a predetermined path,” Cook said. “We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated,” she added, referring to the bank’s target to support jobs while keeping rates at a level to put a cap on inflation.

“Every meeting, including December’s, is a live meeting.”

Meanwhile, Chicago Fed chief Austan Goolsbee said his main worry was inflation, while San Francisco boss Mary Daly was open to any options with regards to a cut in December.

Governor Stephen Miran, a Trump nominee, wanted to see more cuts.

“The divergence in opinions reinforces Fed Powell’s assessment that another fed funds rate in December is not a foregone conclusion, with the lack of data adding to the need to wait before making a decision (when driving in a fog, best to slow down),” wrote National Australia Bank’s Rodrigo Catril.

Data on Monday indicated some further weakness in the US economy, with a key gauge of activity in the manufacturing sector contracting more than expected and for an eighth straight month in October as demand and output weakened.

Futures for the S & P 500 gained 0.3% before the bell, while Nasdaq futures advanced 0.6%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced back-and-forth between tiny gains and losses.

[TEXT]
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), the operator of Asia's third-largest stock market, on Wednesday reported its best quarterly and nine-month earnings on record on the back of rising turnover and initial public offerings (IPOs).

Net profit for the three months to September rose 56 per cent from a year earlier to HK$4.9 billion (US$628 million), or HK$3.88 per share, beating analysts' estimate of HK$4.7 billion, according to an exchange filing.

It was HKEX's best quarterly profit, exceeding the HK$4.46 billion profit in the second quarter. In the process, the bourse operator topped its previous record for the third consecutive quarter.

Japan's Nikkei 225 plunged below the 50,000 mark on Wednesday before paring losses amid a wider decline in Asia markets as investors fled AI-related stocks.

The Nikkei lost 2.5% to close at 50,212.27 after falling over 4%, while the Topix was down 1.26% to close at 3,268.29. Shares in Japan's SoftBank Group plunged more than 10% Wednesday amid a broader drop in Asian AI-linked companies, tracking declines in U.S. peers.

South Korea's Kospi fell over 2% to end the trading day at 4,004.42, with chip heavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix posting losses of over 4% and 1% respectively. The small-cap Kosdaq shed 2.66% to end the trading day at 901.89.

The South Korean won weakened as much as 0.6% to 1,449.50 against the greenback, the lowest since April, data from LSEG showed.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was flat at 25,935.41 while mainland China's CSI 300 was up 0.19% at 4,627.26.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.13% to 8,802, posting a comparatively modest loss.

[TITLE]Mainland China, Hong Kong to lead Asia in attracting overseas capital: Wall Street bankers:
[TEXT]
Mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan and India are poised to attract capital inflows from international investors seeking to diversify their portfolios with non-US-dollar assets while pursuing growth opportunities in the coming years, according to top Wall Street bankers.

"China is one of the largest [and] most important economies in the world," said David Solomon, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, during a panel discussion at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong on Tuesday. "Global capital allocators will continue to be interested in China in almost any environment."

Solomon is among 300 leading financiers attending the three-day summit, which began on Monday. The event is the fourth edition of the annual flagship gathering organised by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
