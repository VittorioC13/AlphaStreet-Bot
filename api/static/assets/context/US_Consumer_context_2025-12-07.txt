Nations Trust Bank (NTB) has received the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) approval for its previously announced acquisition of the Retail Banking operations of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Sri Lanka (HSBC Sri Lanka).

In September this year, HSBC Sri Lanka signed a binding agreement to transfer its Retail Banking operations to NTB.

The acquisition would provide NTB with around 200,000 HSBC Sri Lanka customer accounts, including premium banking clients, retail loans and credit cards.

It is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026.

Upon closing, HSBC’s corporate and institutional banking operations in Sri Lanka will remain unchanged, continuing to serve international corporate clients and offering cross-border trade and investment services.

NTB said that the acquisition would strengthen its position in the premium retail banking segment and support its long-term growth objectives.

Nations Trust Bank director and CEO Hemantha Gunetilleke said “The approval from CBSL gives us the go-ahead to move forward with the acquisition process, which is currently progressing very well. We are now able to move into the next phase of the project with confidence.”

The sale of its retail banking business is part of HSBC Group’s simplification plan announced in October last year.

The decision follows a strategic review that determined divestment of the retail unit was the preferred course for the group and its stakeholders.

HSBC, at that time, said the reorganisation allows it to concentrate on areas where it has a competitive focus and growth prospects.

HSBC Sri Lanka CEO Mark Surgenor said: “Our priority during this period is to uphold the highest service levels for our customers and ensure that our colleagues are well supported during the transition into NTB.

“We are working closely with NTB towards a seamless transfer of banking services upon completion of the transaction.”

[TITLE]JP Morgan Chase Buys Miami Beach Retail Branch:
[TEXT]
J.P. Morgan Chase bought back its retail banking branch in Miami Beach, paying a threefold premium since its sale 11 years ago.

The finance giant paid $23.5 million for the 25,030-square-foot building at 1801 Alton Road in the Sunset Harbour neighborhood, property records show. The two-story property sits on a 1-acre site, facing Dade Boulevard.

J.P. Morgan Chase purchased the property for $4 million in 2010. Four years later, the current sellers, a Coral Gables-based entity managed by Dominic Cavagnuolo, acquired the building for $8 million.

A representative for the sellers could not be reached, while a spokesperson for J.P. Morgan Chase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, J.P. Morgan Chase’s competitor, Wells Fargo, sold its 6,654-square-foot retail branch next door at 1901 Alton Road for $15 million to the family office of developer Russell Galbut. The developer obtained a $54 million construction loan for a Whole Foods-anchored development, where Wells Fargo will operate a 4,000-square-foot retail location.

J.P. Morgan Chase’s acquisition is also another example of retailers buying the properties they lease. Last year, nearby on Lincoln Road, Alo Yoga paid $17 million for a retail condo, where it plans to open a store and private gym. The activewear brand also bought its boutique in the Miami Design District for $22 million the year prior.

Since 2024, grocer Publix has spent about $345 million buying seven retail centers it anchors in South Florida.

[TITLE]Rate cut signals RBI’s pivot to growth amid sharp inflation slowdown:
[TEXT]
It does not happen very often that a central bank goes into its monetary policy meeting having overachieved on both its targets. With gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 8% (above the 7% potential level) and inflation based on consumer price index (CPI) averaging 2.2% (below the target of 4%) in 1HFY26, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had ample policy room to meet its dual mandate in 1HFY26. But given the primacy of inflation in its mandate, the RBI did well to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 5.25%. The central bank also took steps to support monetary policy transmission by announcing open market operations of ₹1 trillion, dollar buy-sell swaps ($5 billion) and promised to provide adequate liquidity going forward.

The repo rate reduction will likely boost growth, just when it's feared to soften in 2HFY26 due to US tariff-related headwinds and an expected slowdown in government spending. The monetary policy support via rate cuts and easy liquidity complements the measures already taken by the government in the form of goods and services tax (GST) cuts. The depreciation of the rupee also adds to this reflationary impetus and all policy levers are now fully geared towards supporting growth.

The pressure to cut rates also stemmed from CPI inflation slipping below the lower bound of 2% in Q2FY26, even though the RBI’s mandate is to keep inflation within the 2–6% band. The RBI has lowered its inflation estimate not only for this year to 2% (from 2.6% earlier), but also for H1FY27 to 4%. What is driving such a sharp undershoot of inflation? First, food inflation is very benign. This year, food prices have fallen by 1.1% during April-October, led by an 18.5% contraction in vegetable prices. Given two back-to-back good monsoons, the outlook is also favourable for the upcoming rabi crop. Secondly, core inflation too is around the target of 4%, and if precious metals are excluded, it too is below the target. Given benign outlook for food and core excluding precious metals, inflation trajectory for next year seems to be closer to target as of now.

While inflation estimates have been pruned, growth estimates have been revised higher. Growth in H1FY26 has surprised positively at 8% and the RBI has revised its growth forecast for H2FY26 higher as well to 6.7% from 6.3% earlier. This upward revision is led by fiscal and monetary stimuli, driving demand higher. Growth estimate for H1FY27 too has been revised higher to 6.8% from 6.5% earlier. For FY26, the RBI now expects growth at 7.3%, which is a tad lower than our estimate of 7.5%. The slowdown in coming quarters is possibly because of weaker exports and the waning of front-loaded government spending.

Shares of Hindustan Unilever Ltd HUL ) declined 7% to their day’s low of Rs 2,289 on the BSE on Friday, December 5, 2025, as the company approached its record date for the demerger of its ice-cream business into a newly formed entity — Kwality Wall’s (India) Limited (KWIL).However, after a few minutes of trading, the stock recovered from its day’s lows and was trading lower by only 1.9% at Rs 2,378.55, around 10:40 am.The demerger scheme is scheduled to become effective on December 1, 2025. HUL first announced the plan in January 2025 and subsequently secured regulatory approvals from both BSE and NSE in May 2025.The separation is part of HUL’s strategic initiative to unlock additional value by carving out the high-growth ice-cream segment from its core fast-moving consumer goods ( FMCG ) operations.Under the approved structure, The Magnum Ice Cream Company will acquire a 61.9% stake in Kwality Wall’s from the Unilever Group after the spin-off.The ice-cream business includes several well-known brands—Cornetto, Magnum, Feast and Creamy Delight—and is supported by one of India’s largest cold-chain infrastructures.Brokerage firm Nuvama Equities expects Kwality Wall’s to list in February 2026, potentially becoming India’s first pure-play listed ice-cream company . It estimates the stock could be valued at Rs 50–55 per share, implying around 5x EV/sales. While this is at a discount to HUL’s 9x multiple, Nuvama notes it aligns with the seasonal nature of the ice-cream category.The segment has also benefited from a sharp reduction in GST, from 18% to 5%, a move that is likely to boost affordability and drive impulse consumption.For HUL investors, the demerger marks both a value-unlocking exercise and a shift in the company’s portfolio structure. Post-demerger, HUL will operate without its ice-cream vertical, which had increasingly diverged in terms of business model and capital needs.

[TITLE]Zumiez Inc. Announces Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Results:
[TEXT]
Third Quarter Earnings Per Share Increased to $0.55 from $0.06 last year

Third Quarter Comparable Sales Increased 7.6%

North American Third Quarter Comparable Sales Increased 10.0%

Fourth Quarter To-Date Comparable Sales Up 6.6%

LYNNWOOD, Wash., Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zumiez Inc. (NASDAQ: ZUMZ) a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, equipment and accessories for young men and women, today reported results for the third quarter ended November 1, 2025.

Net sales for the third quarter ended November 1, 2025 (13 weeks) increased 7.5% to $239.1 million from $222.5 million in the third quarter ended November 2, 2024 (13 weeks). Comparable sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2025, increased 7.6% on top of a 7.5% increase in the year ago period. Net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $9.2 million, or $0.55 per share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.06 per share, in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025 we benefitted from one-time discrete tax items which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.09.

Total net sales for the nine months (39 weeks) ending November 1, 2025 increased 4.5% to $637.7 million from $610.0 million reported for the nine months (39 weeks) ending November 2, 2024. Comparable sales increased 5.3% for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2025. Net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was $6.2 million, or $0.36 per share, compared to a net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 of $16.5 million, or $0.86 per share. The first nine months of 2025 was negatively impacted by $3.6 million, or approximately $0.15 per share related to the settlement of a wage and hours lawsuit in California.

On November 1, 2025, the Company had cash and current marketable securities of $104.5 million compared to cash and current marketable securities of $99.3 million on November 2, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by $50.5 million of cash flow from operations and the release of $3.0 million in restricted cash, partially offset by $38.3 million related to share repurchases and $12.5 million of capital expenditures. The Company repurchased 0.3 million shares during the third quarter of 2025 at an average cost including commission of $18.61 per share and a total cost of $5.4 million. Fiscal year-to-date through November 1, 2025, the Company has repurchased 2.7 million shares at an average cost including commission of $14.18 per share and a total cost of $38.3 million. $1.7 million remains on the current open repurchase authorization.

“We achieved our best third quarter in several years,” said Rick Brooks, Chief Executive Officer of Zumiez Inc. “High-single digit comparable sales growth and strong full price selling drove meaningful gross margin expansion, which combined with good expense management, resulted in a significant improvement in profitability. The work we have done enhancing our brand and merchandise assortments continues to resonate with our consumers, especially in North America, evidenced by the sharp sequential increase in the region’s comparable sales trends to double digits. Importantly, the holiday season is off to a strong start with overall comps up 6.6% fourth quarter-to-date and up 8.7% over the Black Friday to Cyber Monday timeframe. While the overall consumer environment remains choppy, we are encouraged by the pace of our business and are increasingly confident in delivering a solid finish to fiscal 2025 and building on our progress next year.”

Fourth Quarter To-Date

Fourth quarter-to-date total sales for the 31 days ending December 2, 2025 increased 7.5%, compared with the same 31-day period in the prior year ended December 3, 2024. Total comparable sales for the 31-day period ending December 2, 2025, increased 6.6% from the comparable period in the prior year.

Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter Outlook

The Company is introducing guidance for the three months ending January 31, 2026. Net sales are projected to be in the range of $291 to $296 million representing sales growth of 4.0% to 6.0%. Consolidated operating margins are expected to be between 8.0% and 8.5% resulting in earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.97 to $1.07.

The Company opened 6 new stores in fiscal 2025, including 5 stores in North America and 1 store in Australia.

[TEXT]
Everyone knows that alcohol can cause weight gain, particularly beer, sugary cocktails and creamy liqueurs. But while the most likely action for anyone trying to lose a few pounds would be to cut down on the amount of alcoholic drinks they consume, some people are doing the opposite and are cutting down their food intake in order to increase their “alcohol allowance”. This practice appears to be particularly prevalent among students and young adults.

Two students, Sarah and Aisling, are no strangers to food restricted alcohol consumption (FRAC), and say most of their friends do it as a means of staying slim and “not having to worry

[TITLE]Mom Buys Special Snacks For Her Kid With Food Allergies, But Dad Keeps Eating Them Even Though He Knows The Kid Can’t Have Anything Else:
[TEXT]
Many kids have food allergies and it can mean that restrictions on what suitable snacks you can buy them.

Without alternatives, kids miss out. See why this mom doesn’t think her husband gets this.

AITAH for being mad at my husband for eating allergy-friendly food I bought for my kids I have two sons: DS1 is a teenager, and DS2 is a pre-teen. DS1 has had multiple food allergies since he was a baby. There aren’t a lot of prepackaged foods DS1 can eat due to his list of allergies. DS2 doesn’t have any serious allergies like his older brother, but he’s been having stomach issues for a few months and he feels better eating a healthier diet with less dairy.

So there aren’t a lot of options.

I find it stressful to keep them fed and full, especially on busy days when I’ve been gone most of the day. I can’t just get takeout or do pizza or pbj sandwiches. So, I like to stock up on “healthy” allergy-friendly prepackaged foods at Whole Foods whenever I’m in the large city that is an hour and a half from our home. We have had conflicts in the past over DH eating dairy-free popsicles or allergy-friendly muffins that were purchased at Whole Foods for our son. DH doesn’t think it’s a big deal because we can buy more, but it makes me mad when the items are only available at Whole Foods because I only go there

[TITLE]Howard’s Appliance abruptly closes all Southern California stores:
[TEXT]
Contact us If you are an employee who lost their job or a customer waiting on an order from Howard’s Appliance, please contact staff writer Pat Maio at pmaio@scng.com.

A week after Black Friday sales, the nearly 80-year-old Howard’s Appliance chain is shuttering all of its Southern California stores, offering only two day’s notice to employees and nothing to customers with orders in limbo.

The notice, signed by Isaiah Padilla, the logistics general manager for Howard’s, said the company was closing its business operations, effective Dec. 6, due to “circumstances beyond our control.”

Padilla could not be reached for comment on Friday.

The company began in 1946 as a radio repair shop in San Gabriel and later evolved into one of Southern California’s leading independent appliance retailers, expanding into televisions and mattresses.

Howard’s was based in La Habra for years before consolidating operations in 2024 to a new headquarters in City of Industry. It was acquired in April by S5 Equity, a private equity firm based in Newport Beach, to help with the cash-starved company’s turnaround.

S5 Equity Managing Director Baudelio Bueno did not return a phone call Friday seeking comment.

Social media reports indicated employees were notified on Thursday, Dec. 4 that they had been laid off.

Representatives at stores in Alhambra, Covina, La Habra and Tustin could not be reached, and the Howard’s website also was down. Howard’s operated at least 17 stores before it was acquired.

Customers were left with no answers regarding their appliance orders.

“My parent just ordered a new range from Howard’s and then saw this morning they are all closing? They haven’t received the range yet, and apparently all the stores are closing as of tomorrow. My mom called 4 different stores and no one is picking up,” wrote one Reddit member, with 41 people commenting on the post by late Friday afternoon.

In September, Paul and Donna Brewer of Laguna Niguel paid $6,152.07 for a Speed Queen washer and dryer, including pedestals and accessories, from their local Howard’s.

Delivery was promised by the end of October, but the appliances never came. They threatened to cancel the order if they didn’t arrive by Dec. 12, as promised.

“We have, as of two days ago, made payments of $1,500,” said Paul Brewer, who provided the Southern California News Group with a copy of his sales receipt. “We either want to receive our refund of $1,500 or the appliance, per our agreement.”

Brea couple Lily and Alan Marcum, both in their 70s, bought a Frigidaire refrigerator for $3,500 at the La Habra store but decided that they wanted to trade it back in for a GE model.

Lily Marcum said that she has a bad back and didn’t want to stoop over when pulling out the two bottom freezer drawers.

They paid $411.98 to trade out the Frigidaire model for a GE model, and have been promised delivery of the new one since September. “We charged the full amount,” said Lily Marcum of the purchase.

“It’s a real piece of work,” she said of the Frigidaire. “It’s not very good. We want a refund.”

At the time of the S5 acquisition earlier this year, Peter Boutros, the chief executive officer of Howard’s Appliance, said it was “poised for the future.”

“It’s not just about sustaining our legacy — this acquisition is about building upon it,” he said in a statement in April. Related Articles Macy’s posts surprise profit with overhaul under new CEO resonating with shoppers

S5 Equity, an investment firm led by the Steinhafel family, made its first acquisition in 2022, when it partnered with Prelude Wine Holdings to buy Wiens Cellars in Temecula. In March 2025, it bought Minnesota-based Heartland America, a discount catalog and online retailer for consumers seeking to buy electronics, houseware and apparel.

The Steinhafel family has connections with Steinhafels Furniture in Wisconsin, as well as Gregg Steinhafel, who resigned as president and chief executive officer of Minnesota-based Target Corp. in 2014 following a data breach that exposed 40 million credit and debit card accounts.

S5 Equity is led by managing partner and founder David Steinhafel.

[TITLE]BasicNet Plans to Relocate Woolrich Corporate Employees to Turin, Trade Unions Push Back:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Less than a month after BasicNet acquired Woolrich from Luxembourg-based fund L-Gam in a deal that valued the storied outerwear player at 90 million euros, the new owner is facing a dispute with trade unions.

The latter are claiming that the company has decided to shut corporate operations in Bologna and Milan, where Woolrich employs 109 and 30 workers, respectively, leaving them with no other option than accept a relocation to the BasicNet headquarters in Turin to avoid being laid off.

The move would not affect retail employees in those cities, where Woolrich operates two of its 25 flagships in Europe.

BasicNet’s portfolio of brands also comprises Kappa, Robe di Kappa, K-Way, Superga, Sebago and Briko, in addition to Woolrich and beachwear specialist Sundek. The latter’s acquisition was revealed Thursday.

On Friday, BasicNet issued a statement clarifying its position, saying that “this is not a closure, but rather a strategic move aimed at revitalizing the brand and ensuring job continuity. The decision to move the headquarters and its employees to Turin is designed to strengthen Woolrich’s brand value by investing in a central hub that can support future growth and create beneficial synergies.”

The company said it is committed to safeguarding jobs and will resort to any available welfare measure to ensure a smooth transition for employees unable to relocate to Turin.

“People are the heart of the company, and we are excited to welcome all employees into the big BasicNet family,” said Alessandro Boglione, co-chief executive officer of BasicNet, in the statement. “We are committed to following all the right procedures, which is why we are working closely with trade unions to provide clear and timely answers to employees who have sought clarity.”

“We hope to find shared solutions quickly so we can provide certainty and ensure the transition respects everyone involved,” added Lorenzo Boglione, co-CEO of the company.

The BasicNet transaction, revealed in November, involved the acquisition through a wholly owned subsidiary of the rights to the Woolrich brand for Europe and 100 percent of Woolrich Europe SpA, the company managing its distribution and retail activities. Its revenues for fiscal year 2025 are expected to be around 90 million euros.

Through the deal L-Gam exited Woolrich seven years after acquiring the brand in 2018 from its former owner, WP Lavori in Corso. Last December L-Gam forged a deal with Chinese apparel group Baoxiniao Holding Co. Ltd., which acquired Woolrich’s intellectual property rights for all territories outside Europe.

Woolrich was founded in 1830 by John Rich in Pennsylvania, and is one of the oldest American producers of wool fabrics and outdoor clothing. The company was created to provide durable and functional garments for hunters, lumberjacks and railway workers.

In 1850, Woolrich introduced its signature Buffalo red and black check pattern. In 1940, responding to the needs of workers building oil pipelines in Alaska, the Arctic Parka was born — designed to withstand extreme temperatures and another signature garment for the brand.

BasicNet was founded by Lorenzo and Alessandro Boglione’s father, Marco Boglione, who created the group in 1994 as a marketplace and publicly listed it on the Milan Stock Exchange in 1999.

Stemming from the storied traditional clothing company Maglificio Calzificio Torinese, which was founded in 1916, BasicNet doesn’t produce or distribute the collections of its brands. Billing itself as a “fully web-integrated company” through a digitally advanced platform, it acts as a marketplace where manufacturers and distributors meet to do business.

In particular, BasicNet designs and develops its labels’ collections, signs licensing agreements with international producers and distributors, which receive from BasicNet all they need to manufacture and sell the products, from research and development to global marketing.

: Wall Street is increasingly sounding alarms over what economists are calling a K-shaped economy in the US, where higher-income households continue to drive spending while lower-income consumers struggle to keep up. The pattern mirrors trends in the stock market, where Big Tech continues to lift major indexes even as other sectors lag behind, as per a report.Bank of America senior US economist Aditya Bhave acknowledged the divide but suggested it might not destabilize the economy immediately. Speaking during BofA’s 2026 outlook call, Bhave said that, “I don't think they're going to coexist forever,” adding, “Our view is that the bottom of the K will stabilize before the top of the K collapses. That's underpinning our more optimistic view of the economy,” as quoted by Yahoo Finance.BofA is forecasting 2.4% real GDP growth in 2026, above consensus estimates, and sees the economy avoiding a recession.The timing may feel counterintuitive given softer labor market data. Planned layoffs hit their highest November level since 2022, and private payrolls unexpectedly shed 32,000 jobs, with small businesses particularly affected. Yet jobless claims recently fell to a three-year low, suggesting pockets of resilience in the labor market.ALSO READ: US Treasury snaps up another $2 billion in debt — weekly buybacks surge to a massive $14.5 billion Bhave explained that higher-income households’ spending plays a key role. He said, “One reason to be less pessimistic is the following: Who spends more on services — higher- or lower-income folks? It's actually higher-income folks,” and added that, “So if you take $1 of spending and you tell me that it was actually spent by a higher-income household … I’ll say that’s more likely to have been spent on services," as quoted by Yahoo Finance.He pointed out that it matters because “5 out of 6 jobs in the US are in services,” and more spending on discretionary services “could actually be more supportive for the labor market” and “increase the chances that the labor market will stabilize," as quoted in the report.ALSO READ: Warner Bros stock (WBD) today rises after Netflix (NFLX) unveils $72 billion buyout deal – what investors need to know Companies are seeing this K-shaped trend in real time. Macy’s CEO Tony Spring noted that the retailer is benefiting, particularly at Bloomingdale’s, which recorded 9% year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter. Higher-income shoppers continue to splurge when prices feel justified, even as lower-income consumers pull back.Still, Bhave cautioned

[TITLE]India’s e-commerce growth continues to outpace global market: Elara Capital:
[TEXT]
India’s e-commerce continued to outperform global markets in the September quarter, according to analysis by Elara Capital. It noted that while US online sales grew by about 5-6 per cent year-on-year while Indian online sales continued to grow double-digit.

Karan Taurani, Executive Vice-President, Elara Capital noted in a sector update report, “India’s digital commerce flywheel continues to outperform global markets, with e-commerce and quick commerce growing faster than in the US. While US online sales rose ~5-6 per cent YoY, India continues in double digits with robust trajectory fuelled by quick commerce channel driving user expansion and regional penetration.

He added that advertising is also shifting in India to digital mediums as brands chase high-ROI performance channels, directly benefiting ad-tech players such as Affle, with direct customer relations.

“Despite solid momentum, India’s category penetration is far below US levels, offering one of the largest multi-year growth runways globally across apparel, electronics, GM and beauty,” he added.

Taurani added that India’s e-commerce maturity curve trails the US and China by 10–12 years. “ This offers a compelling long-term growth as these mature markets growth plateaus. In the near term, India’s e-commerce expansion will be driven by the rise of quick commerce and mass-commerce,” he added.

Global e-commerce was steady in the third quarter of CY25, with US online sales being 5 per cent year-on-year with penetration at about 16-17 per cent, the report noted.
