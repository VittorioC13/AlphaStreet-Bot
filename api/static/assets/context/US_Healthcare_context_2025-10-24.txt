[TITLE]Healthcare Personal Protective Equipment Research Report 2025: A $13.1 Billion Market by 2030 Dominated by 3M, Ansell, Top Glove, Molnlycke, O&M Halyard, Cardinal Health, Hartalega and Winner Medical:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Healthcare Personal Protective Equipment: Global Markets" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for healthcare PPE equipment is expected to grow from $10.3 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach $13.1 billion by the end of 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% during the forecast period of 2025 to 2030.

PPE, including gloves, gowns, aprons and masks, is vital in mitigating HAI-related risks. PPE functions as a frontline defense by protecting healthcare workers and patients from infectious agents during care delivery. Employers at healthcare organizations or institutions, such as hospitals, clinics, care homes, or other medical facilities, are legally obligated under health and safety laws to conduct risk assessments and implement control measures, including the provision and correct use of PPE, to reduce patient harm from exposure to infectious agents. As essential medical devices, PPE also falls under broader regulatory frameworks designed to ensure safety and efficacy. The routine use of PPE is reducing the incidence of HAIs and preventing the spread of infectious diseases in healthcare settings.

Gloves and protective clothing such as surgical gowns and isolation gowns are the most widely used PPE equipment in healthcare settings. The leading companies in the healthcare PPE market are 3M, Ansell Ltd., Top Glove Corp. Bhd, Molnlycke Health Care, O&M Halyard Inc., Cardinal Health, Hartalega and Winner Medical.

[TITLE]MOH SECURITIES NEWS: Molina Healthcare, Inc. Faces Securities Fraud Allegations after Stock Drops 16% -- Contact BFA Law by December 2 Class Action Deadline:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.

If you invested in Molina, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/molina-healthcare-inc-class-action.

Investors have until December 2, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Molina securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California and is captioned: Hindlemann v. Molina Healthcare, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-9461.

Why Was Molina Sued Under the Federal Securities Laws?

Molina is a health insurance company that provides managed healthcare services to low-income individuals under Medicaid and Medicare programs. During the relevant period, Molina stated that the Company’s “earnings growth profile” was “solid heading into 2025.” The Company also told investors that it “continuously monitor[ed] utilization patterns” and that it was able to “mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation.” In truth, as alleged, Molina faced increased medical costs pressures that it could not mitigate due to increased utilization in all three of its business lines.

The Stock Declines as the Truth Is Revealed

On July 7, 2025, Molina revealed that its Q2 2025 adjusted earnings were approximately $5.50 per share, which was “below its prior expectations” due to “medical cost pressures in all three lines of business.” The Company announced it “expects these medical cost pressures to continue into the second half of the year” and cut guidance for expected adjusted earnings per share by 10.2% at the midpoint to a “range of $21.50 to $22.50 per share.”

Then, on July 23, 2025, Molina revealed that it “now expects its full year 2025 adjusted earnings to be no less than $19.00 per diluted share.” Molina stated this was due to a “challenging medical cost trend environment,” including increased “utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services.” On this news, the price of Molina stock fell $32.03 per share, or 16.8%, from $190.25 per share on July 23, 2025, to $158.22 per share on July 24, 2025.

[TITLE]I-Mab To Present Positive Updated Givastomig Monotherapy Data at 2025 AACR-NCI-EORTC Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Conference on October 23, 2025:
[TEXT]
Updated Phase 1 givastomig monotherapy data show an impressive 18% ORR in metastatic gastric cancer patients who had received at least two prior lines of therapy. Responses were observed over a dose range from 5 mg/kg Q2W up to 18 mg/kg Q3W

No differences in efficacy were observed across different CLDN18.2 expression levels, with favorable overall safety

Data anchor combination clinical strategy in first line (1L) gastric cancer, a $2B potential market 1

Confirming Q1 2026 plans to report topline Phase 1b dose expansion combination data and initiate a global randomized Phase 2 study

Data slated for “Short Talk” presentation at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (the Triple Meeting) underway October 22-26 in Boston, Massachusetts

ROCKVILLE, Md., Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- I-Mab (NASDAQ: IMAB) (I-Mab or the Company), is a global biotechnology platform company committed to accelerating access to innovative medicines for patients worldwide, today announced that updated data from the Phase 1 study (NCT04900818) of givastomig as a monotherapy in heavily pre-treated patients (n=45) with gastroesophageal carcinoma (GEC) will be presented as a “short-talk” at the Triple Meeting on October 23, 2025 in Boston, Massachusetts (Presentation #B016). Givastomig is a bispecific antibody targeting CLDN18.2 (Claudin 18.2) and 4-1BB.

“The Phase 1 givastomig monotherapy data that will be shared at the Triple Meeting continue to demonstrate impressive safety and efficacy, with an 18% ORR in heavily pre-treated gastric cancer patients, with favorable overall safety. These data, showing responses over a dose range from 5 mg/kg Q2W to 18 mg/kg Q3W, further enrich givastomig’s emerging product profile and bolster our confidence that givastomig has the potential to be a best-in-class Claudin18.2-directed therapy across a broad range of CLDN18.2 expression. In Q1 2026, we expect to report topline results from the fully-enrolled Phase 1b dose expansion immune-chemotherapy combination study and initiate a global, randomized Phase 2 combination study. We believe the data from these studies will clearly demonstrate givastomig’s potential to significantly improve the standard of care in the treatment of first line GEC patients with a broad range of Claudin 18.2 expression levels,” said Phillip Dennis, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer of I-Mab.

“In our experience, givastomig integrates well into the workflow at our center. Based on the monotherapy efficacy across a range of doses and Claudin 18.2 expression levels, and excellent overall safety, givastomig has the potential to be the best-in-class Claudin-directed therapy and combination partner for the treatment of frontline gastric cancer. These follow-up data, plus encouraging initial results from the Phase 1b immune-chemotherapy frontline combination studies, presented earlier this year, give us hope that givastomig treatment can lead to improved treatment outcomes for patients with gastric cancers. We are eager to move forward with the planned Phase 2 study and continue to advance this program,” said Samuel J Klempner, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

AACR-NCI-EORTC “the Triple Meeting” Conference Information:

Title: Updated Safety, Efficacy and Biomarker Analysis from the Phase I Study of Givastomig, a Novel Claudin 18.2/4-1BB Bispecific Antibody, in Claudin 18.2 Positive Advanced Gastroesophageal Carcinoma (GEC)

[TITLE]Turn Therapeutics Provides Shareholder Update Highlighting Continued Execution Across Clinical and Strategic Milestones:
[TEXT]
WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif., Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Turn Therapeutics (Nasdaq: TTRX) (“Turn” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation dermatology, wound, and anti-infective therapies, provides a shareholder update outlining continued progress in the advancement of its clinical programs while highlighting the flexibility of its financing strategy following its dilution-sparing direct listing.

Capital Strategy and Alignment

Turn chose a direct listing structure to prioritize flexibility and long-term shareholder alignment. By bypassing traditional crossover rounds and IPO share issuance, early shareholders maintained their ownership positions.

Through its $85 million GEM Global Yield agreement, the Company entered the market with a flexible, on-demand financing vehicle in place. This structure allows Turn to access capital opportunistically, at times and amounts determined by the Company, and eliminated the need for a traditional offering at the time of listing. It also provides the potential to reduce reliance on future equity offerings.

Pipeline and Development Update

Turn continues to advance its phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of GX-03 as a potential treatment for moderate to severe eczema. As of now, approximately 25% of the targeted sample size has completed the trial with ongoing enrollment continuing.

This study of GX-03, the first topical IL-36/IL-31 inhibitor, is progressing as planned, with topline results anticipated in 2026. A blinded, aggregate safety summary provided by the contract research organization indicated no safety or tolerability concerns across the 25% of participants who have completed the trial, representing over 1,000 total confirmed applications of study product or placebo.

In parallel, the Company continues to advance development of its thermostable intranasal vaccine initiative, with in-vivo studies scheduled to commence in Q4 2025. This global health initiative reflects the Company’s broader mission to make advanced medicine accessible worldwide.

Shareholder Webinar – October 22, 2025, 2:00 PM ET

As previously announced, Turn will host a live shareholder webinar today at 2:00 PM ET to review its development roadmap, capital strategy, and near-term milestones. Participants may join via the following link: Join Live Webinar.

A copy of the recording and any materials used will be available after the presentation on the public relations section of the Company’s website, www.turntherapeutics.com.

[TITLE]Healthcare Personal Protective Equipment Research Report 2025: A $13.1 Billion Market by 2030 Dominated by 3M, Ansell, Top Glove, Molnlycke, O&M Halyard, Cardinal Health, Hartalega and Winner Medical:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Healthcare Personal Protective Equipment: Global Markets" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for healthcare PPE equipment is expected to grow from $10.3 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach $13.1 billion by the end of 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% during the forecast period of 2025 to 2030.

PPE, including gloves, gowns, aprons and masks, is vital in mitigating HAI-related risks. PPE functions as a frontline defense by protecting healthcare workers and patients from infectious agents during care delivery. Employers at healthcare organizations or institutions, such as hospitals, clinics, care homes, or other medical facilities, are legally obligated under health and safety laws to conduct risk assessments and implement control measures, including the provision and correct use of PPE, to reduce patient harm from exposure to infectious agents. As essential medical devices, PPE also falls under broader regulatory frameworks designed to ensure safety and efficacy. The routine use of PPE is reducing the incidence of HAIs and preventing the spread of infectious diseases in healthcare settings.

Gloves and protective clothing such as surgical gowns and isolation gowns are the most widely used PPE equipment in healthcare settings. The leading companies in the healthcare PPE market are 3M, Ansell Ltd., Top Glove Corp. Bhd, Molnlycke Health Care, O&M Halyard Inc., Cardinal Health, Hartalega and Winner Medical.
