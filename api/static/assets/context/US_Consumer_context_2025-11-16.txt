[TITLE]Peachtree Supplies $35M Acquisition Loan for Chicago-Area Retail Center – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Core Acquisitions has nabbed a $35 million loan to acquire a grocery-anchored shopping center in suburban Chicago, Commercial Observer has learned.

Peachtree Group originated the acquisition loan for Core’s $44 million purchase of the Deerbrook Shopping Center in Deerfield, Ill., from global investment firm DWS.

Taylor Pike, senior vice president at Peachtree, said the property has strong retail fundamentals with a lease through 2035 with anchor tenant Jewel-Osco, the largest grocer in the Chicago metropolitan area. It has been at the site since 1968. The 428,000-square-foot property also includes Marshalls, Floor & Décor, Panera Bread, Starbucks and Sky Zone.

Pike said the northern area of the property has strong foot traffic from a number of national chains, while the southern portion has vacancy with potential for “value-add” redevelopment. He noted that another draw for the deal was Chicago-based Core Acquisitions’ strong institutional knowledge of the market.

“They all live here and drive past the center every single day, and we really like the fact that they’re going to be super hands-on,” said Pike of Core. “They’re going to know a bunch of people that go there, and we like that story and that kind of commitment because they’re going to be in there every single day, working it, trying to make it the best that it can be.”

Deerbook Shopping Center is located at 16 South Waukegan Road, 40 miles north of Downtown Chicago. Pike said the shopping center draws plenty of traffic, with access to Interstate 94 and Metra commuter rail. He also noted new multifamily projects are being developed near the shopping center that will potentially add more foot traffic.

Core Acquisitions did not immediately return a request for comment.

Indian investors are showing growing faith in Reliance Industries (RIL), the country’s most valuable company — even as foreign funds take a step back.In the September 2025 quarter, retail investors slightly increased their stake in Reliance to 7.08%, up from 6.92% in the June quarter, according to shareholding data. That means over 42 lakh small investors now collectively own around 94 crore shares of Reliance Industries.At the same time, mutual funds also boosted their exposure, raising their stake from 9.32% to 9.66%. The move indicates growing domestic conviction in Reliance’s prospects — even though the stock’s performance has been far from stellar lately.In sharp contrast, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) trimmed their holdings in the company, cutting their stake from 19.21% to 18.65%. The number of foreign investors fell as well — from 2,280 to 2,146 — suggesting that global funds may be taking a more cautious stance toward Indian equities or booking profits after a long rally.This shifting ownership pattern comes at an intriguing time.

[TITLE]Edible Garden Posts 9% Revenue Growth as Non-Perishable CPG Units Surge 49.3% Year-Over-Year:
[TEXT]
Hydroponic Basil, Potted Herbs, and Wheatgrass Accelerate; International Nutraceutical Sales Nearly Double Year-Over-Year

Company's Portfolio Optimization and Expansion into CEA-Informed, Better-For-You Shelf Stable Categories Pushes Market Penetration and Growth

Conference Call to Be Held Today at 8:00 am ET.

BELVIDERE, N.J., Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edible Garden AG Incorporated (“Edible Garden” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: EDBL, EDBLW), a leading provider of controlled environment agriculture (CEA) solutions and sustainable, locally grown organic produce, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. The third quarter is traditionally the slowest of the year for Edible Garden, however the results reflect the early benefits of the Company’s strategic evolution toward a CEA informed consumer packaged goods (CPG) model. The Company demonstrated revenue growth, with sales up 9% compared to the third quarter of 2024. Edible Garden also broadened its distribution network and gained momentum in the shelf-stable product segment. The fourth quarter, historically the Company’s strongest period, is expected to further demonstrate the positive impact of this transformation.

Financial & Operating Highlights for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025

Non-perishable unit sales increased approximately 49.3% year-over-year, driven by strong performance across the Company’s shelf-stable product lines including Kick. Sports Nutrition, Pickle Party™, Pulp®, and Vitamin Whey®.

Private Label products sold through major big box retailers outperformed in the second quarter, climbing 15.1% year-over-year

Same store Hydroponic Basil up 28.6%, Potted Herbs up 22.6%, and Wheatgrass up 59.2%

International vitamin and supplements revenue rose 90.2% versus year-over-year

“Over the past several quarters, we’ve been executing a strategic transformation of Edible Garden into a diversified, innovation-driven consumer packaged goods company, and we’re now seeing clear results,” said Jim Kras, Chief Executive Officer of Edible Garden. “The third quarter marked a key milestone as we experienced revenue growth, expanded our product distribution to Kroger to include fresh potted and cut herbs, added major retail customers including The Fresh Market, and expanded internationally through partners such as PriceSmart and Amazon.”

“Our CPG- focused strategy enables us to expand beyond fresh produce into shelf-stable, branded offerings that align with growing demand for clean-label, functional, and better-for-you foods. Our expanding portfolio - featuring Kick. Sports Nutrition, Pickle Party™, Pulp®, and Vitamin Whey® - is driving continued momentum and is expected to contribute to margin improvement, while supporting broader geographic reach and more consistent, year-round sales across both fresh and shelf-stable categories.”

“We further expanded our retail footprint during the quarter, launching our USDA Organic fresh herb line at Kroger, introducing Edible Garden-branded herbs at The Fresh Market, and strengthening our Midwest presence through Pete’s Fresh Market and Angelo Caputo’s Fresh Markets. We believe these relationships, along with robust private-label programs, underscore the growing strength of the Edible Garden brand and our commitment to freshness, innovation, and sustainability.”

“The acquisition of NaturalShrimp’s assets is expected to enhance our vertical integration and add sustainable aquaculture capabilities that align with our mission and brand values. Together with ongoing innovation under our Zero-Waste Inspired® mission, we are investing in health-focused product development and building a stronger platform for scale. We believe these initiatives will position Edible Garden as a next-generation sustainable food company with multiple high-growth revenue streams.”

“Looking ahead, we believe the most challenging phase of this transformation is behind us. We’ve built a more resilient organization—one that is better-positioned to capture growth across both fresh and non-perishable categories—and we are on our way toward achieving our goal of long-term, sustainable profitability. We’re excited

[TITLE]What Saks Global Has Riding on the Holiday Season: A Crucial Moment on Its Path Ahead:
[TEXT]
The holiday season is always make or break in retail — but that goes doubly so for Saks Global this year.

The retailer closed on its $2.7 billion deal to buy Neiman Marcus Group just two days before Christmas last year, launching both into a new era.

Chief executive officer Marc Metrick has been rushing to reset the company and luxury retail. He’s made rapid progress, cutting annual costs by $200 million already and integrating the backends of the two businesses.

But more so, it’s been a year of financial strain — from a bondholder freakout over the summer when investors realized their debt wasn’t directly secured by the famous Fifth Avenue flagship to continued strains with vendors who are being very careful in what goods they ship.

The result is a department store group that is still striving toward the future of shopping while dragging along a debt load of $4.9 billion.

In addition to all the consolidation to bring the two retailers together, there’s also been a management shakeup with the departure of Emily Essner, president and chief commercial officer; Bill Bine, chief transformation officer, and Rob Brooks, chief operating officer.

It remains to be seen what Santa brings for Saks Global this year, but there are still six weeks to go until Christmas. Here, three ways the holiday might play out and shape the retailer’s path into 2026 — from the grinchiest, most speculative scenario to where the retailer gets everything on its wish list.

Too Little, Too Late

Saks Global has been on a high wire for some time — slow on payments to vendors for years, squaring off with bondholders before a high-profile refinancing in August, contending with slowing sales and more.

The company is broadly the creation of executive chairman Richard Baker and has worked as well as it has because Baker is a very adept dealmaker. Many thought it was impossible that Saks Global could ever buy Neiman’s.

But even Baker can do the impossible only so many times.

If Christmas falls flat for Saks Global and there’s not enough from asset sales to make a difference, experts around the industry speculate that Saks could eventually face an existential change in ownership, either in or out of bankruptcy court.

Debt watchdog Standard & Poor’s gave Saks Global an ultralow CCC rating after its refinancing and projected the company would see a $500 million deficit in reported free cash flow this year.

[TITLE]Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. Reports Financial Results for Third Quarter of 2025:
[TEXT]
Key third quarter reported data points:

Revenue of $16.4 million, +3.5% vs. Q3 2024

GAAP net income from continuing operations of $651 thousand vs. $861 thousand in Q3 2024

GAAP net income from continuing operations per fully diluted share of $0.012 vs. $0.017 in Q3 2024

Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $321 thousand vs. $1 million in Q3 2024

Subsequent Event: Announced new leadership in CEO Gary Schubert

BROADVIEW, Ill., Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: IVFH) (“we,” “our,” “us,” “IVFH” or the “Company”), a national seller of gourmet specialty foods to professional chefs, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Gary Schubert, Chief Executive Officer of IVFH, remarked, “In Q3 2025, revenue from continuing operations increased by 3.5% year-over-year, primarily driven by contributions from the Golden Organics and LoCo Foods acquisitions. While overall results reflected modest growth, certain areas of the business remain challenged as we execute on a strategic realignment. Revenue from our Digital Channels segment declined by 4.5% for the quarter and 5.4% year-to-date, largely driven by continued softness with our largest digital partner. However, the Digital Channels decline has continued to moderate, and we are seeing encouraging momentum from newer partnerships. Our newest digital partner generated over $500,000 in sales during the quarter, and both that partner and Amazon, delivered triple-digit year-over-year growth. This momentum is helping diversify our revenue base and stabilize overall results within the digital segment, but we recognize that much work remains to be done. National Distribution, which includes our airline catering business was stable in Q3 and increased by 8.1% year-to-date. While Local Distribution increased by 33% in Q3 and 54.7% year-to-date, with acquisitions in this space driving the increase from prior periods. Excluding the acquisitions, Local Distribution declined by 21.5% for the quarter and 10.4% year-to-date.

“GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 23.5%, consistent with last year. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) declined by approximately $698 thousand compared to Q3 2024, primarily due to sales declines in certain categories, underperformance in recently acquired businesses, and a reversal of previously accrued share-based compensation.”

“In the third quarter, we took swift and decisive action to correct operational inefficiencies that became increasingly apparent in mid-summer. We are beginning to see early signs of stabilization from these recent actions. These actions included the exit of the cheese-conversion business, the relocation of airline catering operations to our Chicago facility, and leadership changes at Golden Organics to strengthen operational oversight. In addition, we entered a Letter of Intent (LOI) for the sale of our former Pennsylvania facility. Both parties continue to work in good faith toward final documentation and closing following the completion of the due diligence period.”

“The third quarter marks an important step forward in IVFH’s transformation, and subsequent to quarter end we have made continued progress to simplify our operating model, strengthen leadership alignment, and build a culture based upon clear accountability. In the past month since assuming the CEO position, we have clarified ownership across every function and consolidated leadership under experienced operators, including bringing back Argie Liarakos who previously led Artisan at the Company for over a decade. We have also continued to align our technology and operational teams under a single leader, creating a cohesive operating rhythm designed to enhance collaboration, improve speed of execution, and ensure every function is accountable for measurable outcomes.”

“To remain competitive in digital foodservice distribution, reliability and price are essential prerequisites. Foodservice customers will not accept anything less than on-time, in-full delivery at a competitive prices. Our teams understand this clearly, and we are committed to improving reliability, accuracy, and speed at every level of the organization. We will continue onboarding new suppliers, expanding our item catalog, and signing new platforms, but our top priority is building the operational foundation that enables sustainable growth. Every initiative we undertake will be measured against these fundamentals—stabilization, modernization, and execution discipline—to position IVFH for long-term success.”

“Our focused exit from non-core activities has simplified the business and will allow us to grow responsibly, modernize our technology foundation, and strengthen partnerships that align with our specialty foodservice focus. IVFH remains fundamentally strong, and our focus is sharper than ever. As we continue to streamline operations, modernize systems, and align our teams across people, process, and technology, we are positioning the Company to deliver sustainable profitability and long-term shareholder value. The path forward is clear, disciplined, and built for durable growth,” Mr. Schubert concluded.

[TITLE]Planet 13 Announces Q3 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
Q3 2025 Revenue of $23.3 million

Q3 2025 Net loss of $44.0 million, which includes a $29.8 million non-cash impairment loss

Q3 2025 Adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.1 million

All figures are reported in United States dollars ($) unless otherwise indicated

LAS VEGAS, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Planet 13 Holdings Inc. (CSE: PLTH) (OTCQX: PLNH) (“Planet 13” or the “Company”), a leading vertically-integrated multi-state cannabis company, today announced its financial results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2025. Planet 13’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).

“Q3 marked the low point for Planet 13. We took decisive action to address our cost structure and operational challenges, reducing SG&A significantly and taking impairment and inventory reserve charges to clean up our balance sheet. Excluding these one-time items, our underlying gross margin would have been approximately 45% reflecting the strength of our cultivation platform and our ability to compete on price while maintaining healthy economics. October's sequential improvements in both Nevada and Florida validate that we've turned the corner,” said Larry Scheffler, Co-CEO of Planet 13.

“We've made the difficult but necessary decisions to position Planet 13 for sustainable operations. Exiting California eliminates a persistent cash drain and allows us to focus our resources on Nevada and Florida, markets where we have clear competitive advantages and paths to strong returns. With our BHO lab coming online by year-end and early momentum building in Q4, we're executing against a clear roadmap: disciplined operations, improved margins, and durable cash flow generation,” said Bob Groesbeck, Co-CEO of Planet 13.

Financial Highlights – Q3 – 2025

Operating Results

All comparisons below are to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, unless otherwise noted

Revenue was $23.3 million as compared to $32.2 million, a decrease of 27.6%. The decrease in sales was driven by price compression and a weaker consumer environment in Nevada and increased competition in Florida.

Gross profit was $5.0 million or 21.3% as compared to $16.7 million or 51.9%. The lower gross margin was driven by significant one-time costs primarily related to Florida and California. Gross Margin excluding one-time costs would have been approximately 45%.

Total expenses were $46.2 million as compared to $20.0 million, an increase of 130.8%. Total expenses include $29.8 million of impairment loss. Operating Expenses were $13.9 down 21.3% from $17.6 million in Q3 2024.

Net loss of $44.0 million as compared to a net loss of $7.4 million. Net Loss included $29.8 million of non-cash impairment loss.

Adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.1 million as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA loss was driven by lower gross profit and operating leverage.

Balance Sheet

(NASDAQ: BOF), a leading food technology company pioneering the next generation of natural fruit and vegetable snacks through its proprietary GentleDry™ process, today announced the pricing of a $2.5 million institutional investment consisting of 1,034,600 shares of common stock to be purchased by Bard Associates, Inc. The financing will strengthen BranchOut’s working capital reserves and marks an important milestone in the company’s growth.

“This financing is a powerful validation of our momentum and mission,” said Eric Healy, CEO of BranchOut Food. “October was the best month in our company’s history, with record revenue of $1.7 million, equivalent to a $20 million annualized run rate. With this capital, we will be well positioned to scale production and execution across our rapidly growing retail and ingredient channels.”

[TITLE]Redesdale invests in Talio Technologies to forecast emerging food trends through AI:
[TEXT]
Redesdale invests in early-stage companies in the food, drink and nutrition sector.

John Conroy’s Redesdale Fund has invested in a company that uses artificial intelligence to help food businesses identify emerging consumer trends.

Talio Technologies uses AI agents to gather and analyse data on menus, retail trends and social habits to help food companies make faster and better-informed decisions on new products and marketing.

Founded in Dublin by Oran O’Flynn and Ciaran O’Connor, Talio says it works with food and beverage groups to support trend forecasting, concept development and long-term innovation planning. It numbers Kerry Group and Valeo among its clients.

Talio says its AI allows customers to differentiate between short-term fads and more sustained shifts in taste.

“This is a very exciting opportunity for Redesdale as it brings us into the AI technology space in food and we are partnering with first-class entrepreneurs in Oran and Ciaran, who have shown tremendous drive and skill to bring this product to market,” said Redesdale partner Michael Cantwell.

It is the venture capital group’s first AI-related investment.

“Innovation in the food and beverage industry has never moved faster,” Talio said. “For enterprise teams, predicting what’s truly next – beyond the hype – can mean the difference between a blockbuster launch and a costly misfire.”

The Redesdale Fund focuses on investment in early-stage businesses in the food, drink and nutrition sectors. Talio is the fifth investment by the €27 million fund which is backed by Enterprise Ireland, US-based Lord Abbett, Musgrave, Coca-Cola, Monaghan Mushrooms and Tate & Lyle.

The fund is expected to ramp up its investment portfolio over the coming months.

The group’s investments to date include: Dundalk-based Soothing Solutions, which says its dissolvable honey-based jelly pop harnesses natural ingredients to provide relief for children with sore throats; Thanks Plants, which produces a range of plant-based products such as frankfurters, sausages and roasts for health-conscious consumers; Fiid, a maker of plant-based microwaveable meals for the convenience meal market; and Kwayga, a company that has developed technology to help supermarket buyers cut their sourcing times dramatically.

[TITLE]Trump Secures New Trade Deal Frameworks in Europe and Latin America:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump this week secured five new trade deal frameworks to reduce U.S. costs of living, foster greater foreign investment, and address Washington’s trade deficits with other nations. Whether these deals will be enough to reduce high U.S. grocery prices and counter Chinese competition on critical minerals, though, is still to be seen.

Steph Curry and Under Armour part ways for bold new chapter

The basketball icon’s brand will now chart its own course after more than a decade of partnership

In a move that signals a seismic shift in the sneaker industry, Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry and athletic apparel titan Under Armour announced Thursday they are ending their exclusive 13-year partnership, effective immediately. The decision, reached by mutual agreement, will allow Curry Brand — previously operating under the Under Armour umbrella — to pursue independent growth and potentially forge a new retail alliance.

The announcement marks the conclusion of one of basketball’s most significant athlete-brand relationships. Under Armour will still release the Curry 13 sneaker in February 2026 as originally scheduled, serving as a final collaboration between the two parties. But beyond that, the four-time N.B.A. champion will control his brand’s destiny without the constraints of his former exclusive arrangement.

[TITLE]Beyond Discounts: iGaming's New Deal:
[TEXT]
The frantic, coffee-fueled-refresh-hitting of Cyber Monday is starting to lose its magic. That “50% Off!” email, which once felt like a secret key to massive savings, now just feels… predictable. We’ve all felt the “deal fatigue.” We buy a discounted toaster or a pair of headphones, and the excitement is fleeting. But as the thrill of traditional e-commerce sales wanes, a new contender for the “best deal” crown has emerged: the iGaming industry. This sector isn’t just offering discounts; it’s fundamentally redefining what “value” means to a consumer.

The core difference lies in the value proposition. A Cyber Monday deal, at its heart, is a discount on an expense. You have to spend $200 to “save” $50. The iGaming industry completely flips this script. Its deals are built around multipliers. A typical offer isn’t “spend less”; it’s “get more.” An offer to “deposit $50 and play with $100” feels psychologically different. It’s not a rebate; it’s a value-add that doubles your entertainment potential from the very start.

This shift is evident across the digital entertainment landscape. Consumers who are savvy about value now compare a 20% discount on electronics to the kinds of welcome offers available on various platforms. For instance, in the iGaming space, promotions are a core part of the user experience, not just a seasonal event. Enthusiasts visiting a site like VulkanBet casino often find that the value lies in the added playtime and enhanced experience, which a simple e-commerce discount struggles to match. This model is built on engagement, not just transactions.

The Psychology: A Bonus vs. A Discount

The power of the iGaming model lies in its deep understanding of behavioral psychology. A discount is passive; a bonus is active. It taps into our desire for gamification and a sense of “beating the system.”

The Gamification of Loyalty

E-commerce loyalty programs are often slow and uninspired, offering tiny points that eventually lead to a minor discount. The iGaming industry, by contrast, has mastered gamification. Loyalty is rewarded instantly and in tiers. Players unlock new levels, “free spins,” or exclusive bonuses simply by participating. This creates a compelling loop that makes the user feel valued and rewarded for their time, not just their money. The “deal” is an ongoing, interactive experience rather than a single, boring transaction.

Personalization at Scale

Cyber Monday deals are a broadcast, a one-size-fits-all digital flyer. They might be based on your browsing history, but they often feel impersonal. iGaming platforms excel at personalization. The deals you are offered are often tied directly to your play style, your favorite games, or your loyalty status. A “VIP” player gets a different, more substantial bonus than a casual new user. This targeted approach makes the user feel recognized and understood, making the “deal” feel far more exclusive and valuable than a generic 20% off coupon code.

More Than Just a Transaction

When you break it down, the e-commerce model and the iGaming model are selling two completely different things. One is selling a product; the other is selling an experience.

The Entertainment Factor

When you buy a discounted laptop on Cyber Monday, the “fun” part (the deal) is over in a click. The real product (the laptop) is the goal. In iGaming, the “deal” is the product. A 100% deposit bonus or a set of free spins directly translates to more entertainment. The value isn’t a physical item; it’s extended playtime, more chances for a thrilling win, and a longer, more engaging experience. You are, in effect, buying “fun,” and the bonus is just “more fun” for your money.

Immediacy is King

Let’s not forget the most powerful psychological driver of all: instant gratification. You find a Cyber Monday deal, you click “buy,” and then… You wait. You track the shipping for three to five business days. The iGaming bonus is immediate. The moment you make your deposit, the bonus funds are credited to your account, ready for use. This instant, tangible reward provides a dopamine hit that the “your item has shipped” email simply cannot compete with.

What E-Commerce Can Learn

This doesn’t mean Cyber Monday is dead, but it does mean e-commerce platforms are no longer the undisputed kings of value. To compete, they need to think less like digital department stores and more like entertainment platforms.

They can start by shifting their focus from simple discounts to more engaging reward structures.

Focus on Gaining, Not Saving: Instead of just “50% off,” offer “Buy one, get one” or “Spend $50, get a $25 credit” on a future purchase. This reframes the value from losing less to gaining more.

Gamify the Shopping Experience: Implement meaningful loyalty tiers that offer tangible, instant rewards, not just points that expire. Create “missions” or “challenges” for shoppers to unlock exclusive deals.

Personalize Rewards: Use data to offer rewards that truly matter to the individual, making them feel like a valued VIP, not just another name on an email list.

A Shift in Value Perception

The battle for the consumer’s dollar is no longer just about the lowest price. It’s about the best experience and the greatest perceived value. While Cyber Monday will continue to be a day for stocking up on goods, the iGaming industry has proven that a well-designed, bonus-driven ecosystem can create far more excitement and loyalty. It has shifted the goalposts from “saving money” to “getting more,” and in a digital world, that’s a much more compelling game to play.

Which do you find more appealing: a 50% discount on a product, or a 100% bonus to enhance an experience? Share your thoughts below.
