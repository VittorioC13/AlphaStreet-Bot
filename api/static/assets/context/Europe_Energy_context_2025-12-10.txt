[TITLE]Nigeria cuts oil block entry costs to boost investment:
[TEXT]
As the 2025 licensing round gets underway, the Federal Government has reduced the signature bonus from $10m to $3m and $7m. The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission disclosed this in an update on its website.

According to the commission, this was part of the government’s efforts to reduce entry barriers. “Interested in one of the oil blocks listed for the 2025 Licensing Round? The Nigerian government has graciously reduced the signature bonus to between $3m and $7m.

“All bidders shall be required to submit a bid within a range of $3m and $7m as approved by the minister of petroleum for the reduction of entry barriers,” the commission said.

The PUNCH recalls that in 2024, the government slashed the signature bonus payable by successful bidders from around $200m to $10m. The Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission, Gbenga Komolafe, stated that the NUPRC surveyed what other countries like Brazil demand as signature bonuses from would-be investors and discovered the need to slash that of Nigeria.

A signature bonus is a non-refundable payment made by a contractor to the government upon the signing of an agreement. Firms who are awarded oil or gas sassets are expected to pay signature bonuses to the government.

The NUPRC disclosed last year that an investment in deepwater would attract $10m as a signature bonus, while shallow water and onshore attract $7m. It appears the figures have been reduced further to $7m and $3m, respectively.

It was added that the signature bonus cannot be paid in naira. “The designated signature bonus account is United States dollar-denominated,” the NUPRC mentioned.

The regulator stated that the winners of this licensing round will be awarded a Petroleum Prospecting Licence, which confers to the holder the exclusive right to drill exploration and appraisal wells; the non-exclusive right to carry out petroleum exploration operations within the area provided for in the licence; and the right to carry away and dispose of crude oil or natural gas won or extracted during the drilling of exploration or appraisal wells as a result of production tests.

It clarified that the licence is for “an initial duration of three years, with a possible extension of another three years for onshore and shallow waters, while it is five years for deep water and frontier.”

The commission disclosed that it has adopted a two-stage bidding process for the award of the blocks, saying the bidding process shall comprise a qualification stage and a bid stage.

“The qualification stage involves the submission and evaluation of applications by interested parties or consortia in accordance with the Regulation and the Guidelines.

“Applicants shall provide all information required for this stage. Only applicants who are adjudged qualified and subsequently shortlisted by the commission shall proceed to the bid stage and will be required to execute a Confidentiality Agreement prior to participation.

“At the bid stage, shortlisted applicants or bidders shall submit their technical and commercial bids in accordance with the regulation, the guidelines, and any other bidding documents issued by the commission.”

The regulator warned that no bidder, whether participating individually or as a member of any consortium, shall submit applications for more than two assets in total across all applications.

“Participation in more than one consortium shall count towards this limit. For the avoidance of doubt, where a company has equity, direct or indirect ownership, or management involvement in multiple consortium vehicles, all such applications shall be aggregated and treated as a single bidder’s application,” it was stated.

NUPRC informed that there are 50 blocks covering the onshore, shallow water, and deep offshore areas.

“The blocks on offer are: PPL 2A29; PPL 2A30; PPL 2A31; PPL 2A32; PPL 2A33; PPL 2A34; PPL 2A35; PPL 2A36; PPL 2A37; PPL 2A38; PPL 2A39; PPL 2A40; PPL 2A41; PPL 2A42; PPL 2A43; PPL 2A44; PPL 2A45; PPL 2A46; PPL 2A47; PPL 2A48; PPL 2A49; PPL 2A50; PPL 2A51; PPL 2A52; PPL 2A53; PPL 2A54; PPL 2A55; PPL 2A56; PPL 2A57; PPL 2A58; PPL 2A59; PPL 2A60; PPL 2A61; PPL 2A62; PPL 2010; and PPL 307.”

Others are “PPL 308; PPL 309; PPL 900; PPL 901; PPL 902; PPL 903; PPL 700; PPL 701; PPL 702; PPL 703; PPL 800; PPL 801; PPL 802; and PPL 803.”

[TITLE]Iraq Invites U.S. Firms to Seize Russia’s Oilfield Prize:
[TEXT]
Iraq’s Oil Ministry has revealed that it has sent out exclusive invitations to several major U.S. energy firms to develop the country’s huge West Qurna 2 oilfield following the withdrawal of Russian oil number two Lukoil after Washington ratcheted up sanctions on Moscow. “It’s a huge turnaround in the trajectory it [Iraq] had been headed with Russia and China, marking a massive win for us [the U.S.] and Europe,” a senior legal source who works closely with the U.S. Treasury Department exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “Stay tuned – there’ll be more of this to come,” he added.

The significance of this sea-change in Iraq’s geopolitical leanings can barely be overstated. Following the increasing perception among the Iraqi people that the U.S. had overstayed its welcome after it removed Saddam Hussein as leader in 2003, Russia and China – in that order – looked to boost their influence across the country for three key reasons. First, it offers a huge repository of oil at the world’s joint lowest average lifting cost of $2-4 per barrel, together with large quantities of associated and non-associated gas. Second, it occupies the geographical heart of the region, lying west of Iran, north of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, east of Jordan and Syria (with its long Mediterranean coastline offering access to further critical sea routes), and south of Turkey (affording an entry into the European continent). And third, it is a key member of the ‘Shia Crescent of Power’ geopolitical arc that stretches from Iran through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, where Shia communities and Iran-backed groups exert significant influence over regional politics, economics, and security. In short, if you are a global superpower or wannabe, Iraq is where you need to be.

The pace of Moscow and Beijing’s involvement across the country picked up the more it looked like the U.S. might withdraw from the ‘Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action’ (JCPOA, or colloquially ‘the nuclear deal’), which it eventually did in May 2018. Just before then, Russia had stepped into the chaos caused by Iraqi Kurdistan’s vote for independence in September 2017 to enable Rosneft effectively to take control of the northern region’s oil sector through means analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. This more broadly allowed Russia to create further chaos in the political and financial dealings between the semi-autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan government in the north and the Federal Government of Iraq in the south. This in turn, provided Moscow with an opportunity to expand its presence in the south, and also did the same for its ally China. Because Beijing was in various stages of a Trade War with the U.S. at the time, it had to tread carefully in a country in which the U.S. was still active, which it did by using dozens of smaller ‘contract-only’ awards on oil and gas fields rather than headline-grabbing exploration and development awards.

Once the U.S. formally ended its combat mission in Iraq in December 2021, then all brakes were off, with China dramatically pushing its new field acquisitions in the south, while Russia consolidated its agitator position in the north through Rosneft mainly and in the south, including the West Qurna 2 contract of its number two oil producer Lukoil. At the same time, continued U.S. and allied military presences in Iraq became the focus of heightened pressure from Iran-backed militias (with direct and/or indirect support from Russia and China), including through rocket fire, drone strikes, and roadside bombs. U.S. and other Western oil firms were under further pressure on their ongoing exploration and development work due to the legacy of endemic corruption running through Iraq’s oil and gas business, and several began to downscale or withdraw in Iraq, including ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, and ENI.

The aim of Russia and China at that point was to push out all Western firms from Iraq, so allowing Iran greater scope to extend its power across the region, as a proxy for Moscow and Beijing, at the expense of Washington, London, and Brussels and their former regional allies in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Bahrain, among others. As exclusively revealed to OilPrice.com some years ago by a very high-ranking official from the Kremlin: “By keeping the West out of energy deals in Iraq, the end of Western hegemony in the Middle East will become the decisive chapter in the West’s final demise.” On the other side of the superpower equation, the U.S. and its allies believe breaking the multi-layered links between Iraq and Iran will not only significantly weaken Baghdad’s neighbour but its key sponsors, China and Russia, too. The U.S. and Israel also have a further strategic interest in utilising the Iraqi Kurdistan region as a base for ongoing monitoring operations against Iran, as analysed extensively in my latest book. The West additionally sees this northern territory as a critical security bridge from NATO member Turkey into the Middle East and beyond.

It is in this context that the downscaling of Rosneft’s operations in Iraq’s northern Kurdistan region and Lukoil’s withdrawal from West Qurna 2 in the south should be seen. By losing its majority stake in in the Kurdistan Pipeline Company, Rosneft also loses control over the feeder pipeline network within the Iraqi Kurdistan region which connects oil fields (such as Taq Taq and Tawke) to the border metering station at Fishkhabur. And at Fishkhabur, the pipeline links up with the main Iraq-Turkey Pipeline system that moves Iraqi oil west. Lukoil’s withdrawal from West Qurna 2 is no less impactful to Russia, as the field holds an estimated 13 billion barrels of recoverable reserves and produces 460,000-480,000 barrels per day (bpd) – around 10% of Iraq’s total output. Together, the two firms export approximately 3.1 million bpd of crude oil, which the West sees as vital to Russia’s ability to keep funding its war in Ukraine.

For the West, Iraq’s special invitation to U.S. firms to bid now for West Qurna 2 at the expense of forced-out Russian giant Lukoil further builds on the extraordinary gains its firms have made across the country in just the past year or two. France’s TotalEnergies holds the key to Iraq’s ability to dramatically increase its oil output via the crucial Common Seawater Supply Project, as detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. And there are three other major projects included in its US$27 billion-dollar deal with Baghdad. The UK’s BP is now in a strategically key position to act as a conduit for change in Iraq’s north through its US$25 billion five-field deal recently formally activated. And there have been similar announcements from the U.S.’s Chevron and ExxonMobil, among others.

Both these firms are likely to feature in the ongoing process for West Qurna 2, according to a senior source who works closely with Iraq’s Oil Ministry exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. It may also be that at least one of them is set to reap extraordinary financial rewards too, as Ministry documents show that Lukoil had long been able to maintain sustainable production of 635,000 bpd on a sustained basis. Indeed, the source highlights that in test runs over extended periods in August and September 2017, Lukoil hit 650,000 bpd of production, although it kept it secret from the Ministry at the time. The Russian firm planned to negotiate a new per barrel remuneration rate (it was US$1.15 per barrel at the time) for the higher production rate before switching up operations to ‘hit’ the output it already knew it could generate. Moscow made it clear that the firm might exit the site if a higher rate was not paid. “They [the Oil Ministry] found out about the 650,000 production and told the Russians that it was fine if Lukoil wanted to leave but that before it did so it would pay compensation in lieu of the upfront investment that it promised in 2017 and promised again in 2019 as it was not meeting the time-sensitive oil production targets that it had agreed to,” said the Iraq source. “So they stayed, but now they’re out, never mind.”

[TITLE]Europe strikes a deal to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027:
[TEXT]
Brussels Reuters —

The European Union agreed Wednesday to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decade-long dependency on Russian energy.

Representatives for EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement in the early hours of Wednesday on proposals set out by the European Commission in June to end shipments from the EU’s former top gas supplier following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move toward a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.

“Today, we are stopping these imports permanently,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement. “By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

For short-term contracts concluded before June 17 this year, the prohibition will apply from April 25, 2026, for LNG and from June 17, 2026, for pipeline gas.

For long-term contracts concluded before June 17, the cut-off dates will be the start of 2027 and the start of October 2026, with a possible one-month extension for EU members facing difficulties reaching required storage levels.

As of October, Russia accounted for 12% of EU gas imports, down from 45% before its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Hungary, France and Belgium among the countries still receiving supplies.

The European Commission is also committed to phasing out remaining oil imports from Russia by the end of 2027, with a legislative proposal to be presented early next year.

Under Wednesday’s agreement, EU members will submit “national diversification plans” regarding oil and gas supplies to the commission by March 1, and will be required to notify the EU executive whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national bans in place.

The commission will issue recommendations based on this feedback.

[TITLE]Europe Fast-Tracks Industrial Electrification With €1B Auction:
[TEXT]
The European Commission’s announcement of the first-ever EU-wide industrial electrification auction marks more than a new funding mechanism; it represents a philosophical shift in how Europe intends to decarbonize its industries, and a signal that, at least for now, electrons are pulling ahead of molecules in the energy transition race.

With a budget of €1 billion under the Innovation Fund, the pilot auction will subsidize the direct electrification of industrial process heat, one of the most stubborn and carbon-intensive parts of the industrial value chain. This is the world’s first auction of its kind, and its implications stretch far beyond factory walls.

Electrifying the hardest heat

Process heat is the silent giant of industrial emissions. It powers furnaces, reactors, dryers, and kilns in sectors ranging from steel and cement to chemicals, glass, and food production. It accounts for roughly one quarter of Europe’s industrial CO2 footprint, yet remains largely fossil-fueled.

The new auction directly targets that problem. Eligible technologies include industrial heat pumps, electric boilers, resistance and induction systems, plasma torches, as well as solar thermal and geothermal systems. In essence, it opens the door for any system that replaces fossil heat with clean electricity or direct renewable heat.

Projects will compete for a fixed premium subsidy per tonne of CO2 abated, paid for up to five years. This results-based model rewards measurable carbon reduction rather than theoretical potential, an important distinction. By tying payments to verified performance, the EU hopes to attract bankable projects and bridge the economic gap between conventional and electrified heat.

The auction is expected to open in December 2025, giving the industry a year to configure systems, partnerships, and monitoring plans. That may sound distant, but in industrial planning terms, it is the blink of an eye.

A test of scale and speed

The significance of this auction goes beyond the €1 billion headline. It signals that electrification has matured from an efficiency measure to a pillar of industrial decarbonization policy.

While Europe has spent years debating hydrogen backbones, carbon capture networks, and cross-border CO2 storage, electrification is quietly emerging as the fastest-moving front. The technologies exist, the supply chains are mostly domestic, and the emissions benefits are immediate.

Industrial heat pumps and electric boilers can be installed within existing plants, often with minimal permitting. They integrate naturally with renewables and with the grid, especially when paired with flexibility measures that shift demand away from peak hours. In a system increasingly constrained by intermittency, these grid-friendly industrial assets are valuable not only for emissions reduction but for balancing electricity supply and demand.

By contrast, molecule-based pathways such as hydrogen, synthetic fuels, or CCS remain hampered by high costs, infrastructure bottlenecks, and fragmented policy support. Hydrogen production still depends on expensive electrolysers and clean power availability. CCS requires transport and storage capacity that remains scarce and politically sensitive.

In short, electrons can move faster than molecules.

The economics of momentum

The economics reinforce this trend. Electrified heat is capital-intensive but relatively simple to finance once policy provides a predictable premium. The auction’s pay-per-ton model mimics the logic of the U.S. 45Q tax credit for carbon capture, reward verified abatement, de-risks investment, and lets the market find the most efficient projects.

Hydrogen and CCS, meanwhile, remain hostage to system-level costs. Producing, transporting, and storing molecules, whether hydrogen or CO2, demands massive, integrated infrastructure that no single project can justify alone. Without a guaranteed offtake market or a predictable price for avoided carbon, private investors stay cautious.

That difference in scalability may define the next decade of European decarbonization. Electrification can move incrementally, one boiler, one line, one plant at a time. Molecule-based systems need a whole ecosystem to move together.

Europe’s strategic rebalancing

The timing of this policy pivot is not accidental. High gas prices, volatile ETS costs, and tightening climate targets have forced policymakers to confront industrial exposure to fossil fuel volatility. By electrifying heat with locally sourced renewables, Europe strengthens both energy security and industrial competitiveness.

There is also a deeper strategic message. The electrification auction is a prototype for what the Commission calls the Industrial Decarbonisation Bank, a permanent facility to finance low-carbon industrial investment. If the pilot succeeds, it could expand into a much larger platform, channeling billions into technologies that reduce industrial CO2 at source.

In that sense, this is more than a funding call, it is a stress test for Europe’s ability to move from rhetoric to replication.

The coming divergence, electrons vs. molecules

This growing divergence between electron-based and molecule-based approaches reflects a broader philosophical split in Europe’s transition planning.

Hydrogen and CCS have long dominated headlines, political speeches, and national strategies. They are indispensable for deep decarbonization, no one doubts that, but their deployment remains slow, costly, and infrastructure-heavy. Electrification, on the other hand, advances quietly because it relies on existing systems.

In practice, a factory can replace a fossil boiler with an electric one far faster than it can install a CCS unit or switch to hydrogen combustion. The capital costs may be comparable, but the regulatory and infrastructure complexity is not. That simplicity could make electrification Europe’s bridge technology for the 2030s, cutting emissions now, while hydrogen and CCS catch up.

The danger, of course, is overcorrection. A Europe that bets everything on electrification could still hit limits, grid capacity, renewable intermittency, and high industrial electricity prices. The challenge will be to use auctions like this not as an endpoint, but as a learning mechanism to optimize system integration, combining the immediacy of electrification with the longer-term flexibility of low-carbon molecules.

A quiet revolution in industrial policy

For decades, industrial decarbonization was seen as a future problem. The Innovation Fund’s electrification auction brings it into the present tense. It rewards results, not roadmaps, and signals that Brussels is finally willing to spend serious money on proven solutions.

It also marks a new chapter in industrial policy, Europe is starting to back winners based on technological readiness, not political symmetry. Where hydrogen and CCS still depend on frameworks under construction, electrification now has a launchpad.

Whether this becomes a model for future auctions covering cooling, storage, or low-carbon feedstocks will depend on its success in attracting viable bids and delivering measurable CO2 reductions. But the direction of travel is clear, Europe wants to move from blueprints to building sites.

The transition’s next inflection point

In the end, the auction’s real importance lies in its symbolism. For years, Europe has talked about industrial decarbonization as a long-term challenge. This initiative says something different, the technologies are ready, the money is available, and the political case is undeniable.

Electrons may not solve everything, but they are solving something now. Molecules will follow, eventually. The race is no longer between technologies, but between time and temperature.

Europe’s first industrial electrification auction may not make headlines like hydrogen valleys or CCS hubs, but in terms of tangible progress, it might just prove the most consequential.

[TITLE]Working towards energy affordability in rural America:
[TEXT]
If you live in the United States, there is a one-in-eight chance that you own your electric utility. That is to say that there’s a one-in-eight chance that your electric utility has a similar structure to a credit union or food cooperative. And if you are one of the many millions of residents who pay a gas and electric bill to a co-op utility, then you have a lot of potential power that can be leveraged to save yourself—and others in your community—money through proven affordability programs that shift local infrastructure toward efficient, modernized, renewable energy.

But it’s not just a random roll of an eight-sided die that determines whether or not you belong to a cooperative utility. If you live in a rural area, it’s quite likely you are a member-owner of an electric co-op. If you live in a bigger city, it’s almost guaranteed that you aren’t.

[TITLE]Surge in Natural Gas Prices Sets The Stage for Coal Comeback:
[TEXT]
As U.S. natural gas prices jumped to a three-year high, coal has become a cheaper power-generating fuel for utilities, which are set to run coal-fired generators harder this winter.

U.S. benchmark natural gas prices at Henry Hub have jumped from $4.23 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at the start of November to above $5 per MMBtu by early December. Early on Friday, the front-month futures price was $5.084 per MMBtu.

That’s the highest price in three years, as a polar vortex with freezing temperatures and snowstorms gripped most of the U.S. and as U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports continue to set record highs as new plants ramp up liquefaction and shipments.

Near-month futures prices are at their highest since December 2022, while the price of the 12-month futures contract strip January 2026 through December 2026 climbed in one week by 26 cents to $4.302 per MMBtu, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its latest Natural Gas Weekly report.

The report also showed that working natural gas stocks totaled 3,923 Bcf for the week ending December 3, which is 5% more than the five-year average and less than 1% lower than last year at this time.

Although natural gas stocks are at levels higher than the five-year average, prices are rallying as heating and power demand jumps with the colder weather and LNG exports out of America are setting new highs.

The U.S. is set to export 14.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG this year, up by 25% from 2024, the EIA said in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) for November. Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana has ramped up exports more quickly than the EIA expected, leading the administration to raise its forecast of LNG exports in the current quarter by 3% compared with last month’s outlook. The EIA expects U.S. LNG exports to increase by an additional 10% in 2026.

As a result, soaring U.S. natural gas prices make gas-fired power generation more expensive for electric utilities and some of these are set to boost generation from cheaper coal.

The EIA expects in its latest STEO that the 2025 annual average price of natural gas paid by electric power plants will jump by 37% and the price paid by industrial sector customers will increase by 21% compared with the 2024 averages.

The Henry Hub natural gas spot price is set to average $4.00 per MMBtu in 2026, the EIA forecasts. The expected average price would be 16% higher than in 2025, primarily due to surging LNG exports amid flat gas production.

Coal, for its part, saw increased production this year, supported by the Trump Administration and the rising price of natural gas.

The coal production increase in 2025 is the result of rising demand, the EIA notes. Demand has increased due to higher natural gas prices, delayed coal plant retirements, and strong demand for heating in the earlier winter months this year. In response to higher demand, the EIA expects electric power coal inventories to end the year at 107 million short tons (MMst), which would be 17% lower than at the end of 2024.

Higher natural gas prices are setting the stage for increased coal use, at least in the coming months. But soaring power demand from AI could also support a quiet comeback for coal in the coming years.

Most coal-fired power plants could delay retirement because of the AI-driven power demand surge, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Reuters in September.

“Energy sobriety has returned to Washington, D.C. Our focus is on Americans and the price of utility and avoiding blackouts,” Wright said.

“We've got to stop existing firm capacity from retirement,” the Energy Secretary added.

The surge in U.S. electricity demand “is reviving hopes of at least a slightly brighter future for coal,” Ed Crooks, Vice Chair Americas at Wood Mackenzie, said in October.

“There is no doubt that the boom in data centre investment is helping to slow the decline of coal in the US, by prolonging the operational lives of some coal-fired power plants,” WoodMac reckons.

Two years ago, Wood Mackenzie’s base-case expectation was that U.S. coal-fired power generation would plunge by about 60% between 2025 and 2032. Now WoodMac expects the drop to be about 39%.
