[TITLE]Trump urges NATO countries stop buying Russian oil before US sanctions:
[TEXT]
The US president said it was ‘shocking’ that members of the alliance continue to buy Russian oil, and also urged the group to place 50-100% tariffs on China to weaken its economic grip over Russia.

United States President Donald Trump has said he is ready to sanction Russia, but only if all NATO allies agree to completely halt buying oil from Moscow and impose their own sanctions on Russia to pressure it to end its more than three-year war in Ukraine.

“I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday, which he described as a letter to all NATO nations and the world.

Trump proposed that NATO, as a group, place 50-100 percent tariffs on China to weaken its economic grip over Russia.

Trump also wrote that NATO’s commitment “to WIN” the war “has been far less than 100%” and that it was “shocking” that some members of the alliance continued to buy Russian oil. As if speaking to them, he said, “It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia.”

NATO member Turkiye has been the third-largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India. Other members of the 32-state alliance involved in buying Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

If NATO “does as I say, the WAR will end quickly”, Trump wrote. “If not, you are just wasting my time.”

As he struggles to deliver on promises to end the war quickly, Trump has repeatedly threatened to increase pressure on Russia. Last month, he slapped a 50 percent tariff on India over its continued buying of Russian oil, though he has not yet taken similar actions against China.

Trump’s social media post comes days after Polish and NATO forces shot down drones violating Polish airspace during Russia’s biggest-ever aerial barrage against Ukraine.

Poland and Romania scramble aircraft

Polish airspace has been violated many times since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but never on this scale anywhere in NATO territory.

Wednesday’s incident was the first time a NATO member is known to have fired shots during Russia’s war in Ukraine.

On Saturday, Poland said it and its NATO allies had deployed helicopters and aircraft as Russian drones struck Ukraine, not far from its border.

Poland’s military command said on X that “ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have reached their highest level of alert”, adding that the actions were “preventative”.

Also on Saturday, Romania’s Ministry of National Defence said that the country’s airspace had been breached by a drone during a Russian attack on infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine.

The country scrambled two F-16 fighter jets to monitor the situation, tracking the drone until it disappeared from the radar” near the Romanian village of Chilia Veche, said the ministry in a statement.

Little sign of peace

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed the prospect of penalties on states still doing business with Moscow.

In an interview with the US media outlet ABC News last week, Zelenskyy said, “I’m very thankful to all the partners, but some of them, I mean, they continue [to] buy oil and Russian gas, and this is not fair… I think the idea to put tariffs on the countries that continue to make deals with Russia, I think this is the right idea.”

Last month, the US president hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss an end to the war, in their first face-to-face meeting since Trump’s return to the White House.

Shortly afterwards, he hosted Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington, DC, for discussions on a settlement.

Despite the diplomatic blitz, there has been little progress towards a peace deal, with Moscow and Kyiv remaining far apart on key issues and Russia persisting in its bombardment of Ukrainian cities.

Russia claims advances

Russia on Saturday said it had captured a new village in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, which Moscow’s forces say they reached at the beginning of July.

The Russian Ministry of Defence said its troops had seized the village of Novomykolaivka near the border with the Donetsk region – the epicentre of fighting on the front. The AFP news agency was unable to confirm this claim.

DeepState, an online battlefield map run by Ukrainian military analysts, said the village was still under Kyiv’s control.

At the end of August, Ukraine had for the first time acknowledged that Russian soldiers had entered the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Moscow had claimed advances at the start of the month.

The Russian army currently controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory.

The Kremlin is demanding that Ukraine withdraw from its eastern Donbas region, comprised of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as a condition for halting hostilities, something that Kyiv has rejected.

The Dnipropetrovsk region is not one of the five Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Crimea – that Moscow has publicly claimed as Russian territory.

On Friday, Zelenskyy said that Putin wanted to “occupy all of Ukraine” and would not stop until his goal was achieved, even if Kyiv agreed to cede territory.

President Trump told fellow NATO countries on Saturday that he will only impose new sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine if they stop purchasing Russian oil.

"I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA," he wrote in a lengthy social media post in what he described as the text of a letter to all NATO countries and the rest of the world.

Trump has been under pressure from some in his own party to increase sanctions on Russia after his efforts at diplomacy stalled . Meanwhile, Russia has stepped up aggression – including this week when multiple Russian drones entered the airspace of NATO member Poland.

NATO fighter jets shot down the drones. Trump's reaction has been relatively muted. He suggested that the incursion could have been an accident, but he has said his patience with Russia is running thin.

Trump last month doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent due to India's continued purchases of Russian energy.

[TITLE]Trump issues an ultimatum for NATO countries on Russia sanctions:
[TEXT]
Russia NATO Donald Trump Oil & gas See all topics Follow

President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to NATO allies in a letter Saturday, saying the US will issue “major” sanctions on Russia only when they agree to do the same and stop buying oil from Russia.

Meeting Trump’s demands would mark a major shift among the alliance, and there are major questions as to whether there would be collective interest in taking these steps.

“I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,” he said in a post to social media, quoting what he said was a letter sent to his NATO counterparts.

He continued, “As you know, NATO’S commitment to WIN has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am ready to ‘go’ when you are. Just say when?”

The president also called on NATO countries to significantly ramp up tariffs on China in a show of force.

“I believe that this, plus NATO, as a group, placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR,” he said.

Trump added that Russia’s war in Ukraine would end “quickly” if those steps were taken.

CNN has reported that the European Union imposed a ban on maritime Russian oil imports and refined oil products like diesel, but many countries continue to import Russian fossil fuels and liquefied natural gas.

The president has repeatedly previewed the possibility of additional sanctions on Russia, telling Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” on Friday he’s considering “hitting very hard with sanctions to banks and having to do with oil and tariffs also.”

He has already doubled tariffs to 50% on India, which purchases oil from Russia, and acknowledged Friday the move “caused a rift” with the country. India has argued that it’s being unfairly targeted with the tariff increase, calling it “unjustified” given that other nations also do business with Moscow.

It remains unclear whether NATO countries will take these steps, which would mark a dramatic departure from their existing tariff policies.

Earlier this week when the president spoke with a European delegation from the EU, he pushed them to put 50-100% tariffs on both China and India, according to people familiar with the conversation. But notably, Trump’s missive to his NATO counterparts on Saturday did not mention India. The EU is in final stages of negotiating a trade deal with India, so it was unlikely they would go along with that.

Russia was the largest supplier of petroleum to the EU prior to Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The EU has since imposed a ban on maritime Russian oil imports, as well as refined oil products, like diesel. As a result, oil imports to Europe fell to $1.72 billion (1.48 billion euros) for the first quarter of 2025, down from $16.4 billion (14.06 billion euros) in the same quarter of 2021, according to the most recent data from Eurostat.

The EU has slightly reduced Russia’s market share of liquefied natural gas imports since 2021 – from 22% down to 19% in 2025 – while also greatly increasing the US market share.

And the bloc – which has been the Americans’ partner in sanctions against Russia – imported $41.9 billion (36 billion euros) of goods from Russia in 2024, data from the EU’s statistics agency shows.

European officials said last week after the Trump meeting that new tariffs on China or India were unlikely, since that’s not how they approach the use of tariffs and the Europeans have generally been more cautious in trade wars, in particular with China.

By issuing his Russian oil ultimatum to NATO instead of the EU, Trump is including Turkey, which is the third largest purchaser of Russian oil after China and India, in those demands. The EU has largely cut off oil purchases, with exceptions for Hungary and Slovakia, but Turkey is still a customer, underscoring the steep demands.

Momentum to end the war around Trump’s August 15 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska has largely stalled and Trump’s latest demands risk prolonging the conflict even further. Time is a valuable commodity for Putin, giving Russia the ability to make more gains on the battlefield and shore up control over occupied areas.

Russia shows no signs of de-escalation

Russia, meanwhile, is showing few signs it is interested in deescalation.

Romania’s defense ministry said it intercepted a drone that entered its airspace while Russia attacked Ukraine on Saturday.

Two F-16 fighter jets detected the drone while monitoring the air situation at the border with Ukraine, where Russia was carrying out aerial attacks.

The Romanian pilots tracked the drone until it dropped off the radar approximately 20 kilometers southwest of Chilia Veche, a community along the Danube River and on the Romania-Ukraine border.

The drone did not fly over populated areas or pose an imminent threat to the population, the ministry said, adding that teams are ready to search for possible debris from the device.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the drone had operated in NATO airspace “for around 50 minutes.”

“The Russian military knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air. Their routes are always calculated. This cannot be a coincidence, a mistake, or the initiative of some lower-level commanders. It is an obvious expansion of the war by Russia,” Zelensky wrote on X.

The interception in Romania follows a significant incursion of Russian drones in Polish airspace earlier this week. After that incident, NATO announced the beginning of an operation to bolster the security of its eastern flank. Trump told reporters at the White House Thursday the move “could have been a mistake, but regardless, I’m not happy

[TITLE]Fearful of Russian aggression, Poles flock to military training:
[TEXT]
BRANIEWO, Poland (Reuters) -Six kilometres from the Russian border in northern Poland, office administrator Agnieszka Jedruszak is digging a trench. Driven by fear of war with Russia, she wants to be able to defend her family, including her 13-year-old son.

Thousands of Poles like Jedruszak are signing up for voluntary military training as Poland's army seeks to fill its ranks with professional and voluntary personnel amid escalating concerns over Russia's military aggression.

"I'd do anything to keep my child safe. And I would definitely want to fight to protect him," said Jedruszak, dressed in military fatigues, her face painted in camouflage colours.

For many in Poland - which endured decades of Moscow's domination under the Soviet Union - the fear of Russian hostility looms large. Those concerns have only grown this week after Poland downed Russian drones in its airspace on Wednesday - the first time a member of the NATO military alliance is known to have fired shots during Russia's war in Ukraine.

The Kremlin this week accused Western countries of an 'emotional overload' and hostility towards Russia, which it said posed no threat to them. It has declined to comment on the drone incident.

Jedruszak's military instruction took place in Braniewo, at a training ground for South Korean K-2 tanks, after Poland ordered 180 of them in 2022 under a major military cooperation deal. Nestled among forests and sandy terrain, the site echoed with the roar of tank engines and barked orders.

While she tries to stay focused during her everyday life, Jedruszak says she wanted to prepare for "a new reality".

"It's always somewhere in the back of my mind: the thought that something could happen," said the 36-year-old, who spoke to Reuters before this week's drone incursion.

More than 20,000 Poles signed up for voluntary military training in the first seven months of 2025 - in line with record levels last year, according to Colonel Grzegorz Wawrzynkiewicz, the head of Poland's Central Military Recruitment Centre.

He expects around 40,000 volunteers to complete military training by the end of this year, more than double the 16,000 in 2022, reflecting a surge in public engagement since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Since the start of the war in 2022, Poland has more than doubled its defence spending from 2.2% of economic output to 4.7% this year - the highest ratio of military spending in the 32-nation NATO alliance, well ahead of more established European powers like Germany, France and Britain.

The return to the White House of Donald Trump - who has cast doubt on his willingness to defend NATO allies - has reignited European fears over the reliability of U.S. security commitments. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who grew up under Communist rule, has been at the forefront of urging Europe's leaders to take more responsibility for its defence.

"Countries that have no memory of a Russian occupation or Soviet occupation, for them it's harder to imagine ...what the thing is you're fighting for," said Gustav Gressel, an expert on Russia and defense policy, and researcher at the National Defence Academy in Vienna.

CHANGES AFOOT

Fearful of the threat from the east, Poland launched in May last year a 400-mile-long "East Shield" fortification along its borders with Belarus and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad - combining long stretches of anti-tank barriers known as "hedgehogs" with advanced surveillance and electronic warfare systems.

Tusk's government is also relocating military units to the east to tap into stronger recruitment pools.

"People will be working and serving in places where they'll be defending their own homes," said Pawel Zalewski, a deputy defence minister.

The focus of Poland's military restructuring is on mobility, armoured capabilities, air defence and logistics operations, officials say.

Wawrzynkiewicz, the head of recruitment, said the efforts aim to boost military readiness and presence near Poland's border, while also creating local employment opportunities in a region with a high jobless rate, historically.

Undergoing military training does not automatically commit people to serve in a war; the programme is designed to be flexible, officials said.

Volunteers can choose to continue into professional military service, to join the Territorial Defence Forces (WOT), or remain part of the active or passive reserve.

Those who join WOT typically serve part-time in their home regions and may be called upon in emergencies or during heightened threats, including natural disasters or border crises, such as when Belarus channelled tens of thousands of migrants toward Poland in 2021 during tensions with the European Union.

Volunteers train alongside professional soldiers but are not embedded in regular units unless they formally enlist. The structure allows for building a scalable force that can support Poland's defense strategy in times of need - similar to systems used in Lithuania and Germany.

Deputy defence minister Cezary Tomczyk told Reuters that - even as battlefield technology advances - training sufficient personnel remains vital for Poland's ability to defend itself.

"When there's a war or some kind of near-war threat, it's the most basic things that count: that's fuel, ammunition and people," he told Reuters.

MILITARY GAP

Poland has the third-largest military in NATO, after the United States and Turkey, with 216,000 personnel, according to the alliance's estimates.

That's dwarfed by the size of Russia's army, which President Vladimir Putin ordered in September to be increased by 180,000 troops to 1.5 million active servicemen.

Still, Poland has rapidly increased its armed forces in recent years - from NATO'S ninth largest army in 2014 - and it plans to further augment its numbers by nearly a third over the next decade.

Poland's shrinking and aging population presents a challenge, but officials hope that the fresh initiatives will help overcome them.

While some other European members of NATO, including Finland and the Baltic states, have also grown their military ranks, traditional European powers like Germany and Britain have struggled.

Despite increased defence spending and modernization, Germany faces persistent recruitment shortfalls, with some 20,000 positions unfilled and high dropout rates among recruits.

The Bundeswehr currently numbers around 180,000 active personnel, below the 203,000 target set in 2018 and well short of the 260,000 goal recently proposed by Defence Minister Boris Pistorius.

Britain has launched retention initiatives but continues to grapple with low enlistment and morale. The British Army has around 71,000 full-time trained soldiers, its smallest size in over 300 years, and down from around 102,000 in 2010.

Gressel, the researcher at the National Academy in Vienna, said that the readiness to enlist tends to be greater among Eastern Europeans than elsewhere on the continent.

"They are more willing to fight because they can't just run away," he said.

EUROPEAN AUTONOMY

Trump's scepticism toward NATO and opposition to Ukraine's membership have prompted allies to reassess their defence strategies. European nations have acknowledged the growing threat and have increased their military spending, including through regional defence initiatives like SAFE.

But an analysis in June by Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank, concluded that NATO's ability to respond to Russian aggression remains heavily reliant on U.S. capabilities - especially for fighter jets, missiles and air defence systems.

The Ukraine war has underscored this dependence, with American tech also leading in emerging areas like AI, drones, and satellite networks, Reuters reported.

Moreover, unlike Russia, most European armies lack robust reserve components, making it difficult to sustain heavy losses over extended periods.

"Every conflict shows one thing: the reserves always win, especially long-term ones," Colonel Pawel Wronka, military assistant to the first deputy chief of the General Staff of the Polish Army Poland, told Reuters.

In February, Tusk announced a new programme to offer voluntary military and civil defence training from next year, with a target to train a total of 100,000 volunteers in 2027.

According to NATO's public estimates, Russia needs a few years to be ready to fight a war with the West.

"That timeframe is also a horizon for us," said Zalewski, the deputy defence minister. "We're ready to face the kind of threat that is real today. And we're preparing for the threat that will be real tomorrow."

[TITLE]What next for troubled Orsted?:
[TEXT]
The head of the Danish Shareholders’ Association posed several questions to Orsted’s management as investors gathered in Copenhagen last Friday to vote on the troubled offshore wind company’s plans to tap them for $9 billion (€7.7 billion).

Would the company – whose bet on the US has turned sour – need further cash injections in the future? Was Orsted’s top team up to the job? “Thousands of Danish shareholders deserve ... clarity,” said Mikael Bak, the association’s chief executive.

Shareholders gave management the benefit of any doubt this time and approved the plan to raise three-quarters of the company’s market value in new capital, the terms of which will be set out in an upcoming prospectus.

It should give the Copenhagen-listed company the funds to finish its 924-megawatt Sunrise Wind development off the New York coast, despite being unable to sell a stake in the project amid US government hostility to the industry, and the rest of the 8.1 gigawatts of offshore wind it is building in the US, UK, Poland and Taiwan.

But with US President Donald Trump continuing to rail against the sector, and the era of rock-bottom interest rates that fuelled the industry’s growth at an end, Orsted executives indicated the company was unlikely to keep to the global ambitions that made it the world’s largest offshore wind developer.

Instead of the aggressive expansion that transformed Orsted from an oil and gas driller into a green industry champion – while pushing the rest of the industry forward – it is narrowing its focus to finish the development under way and looking to Europe for any future mega projects.

[ Danish energy firm Orsted begins construction of Cork solar farmOpens in new window ]

It is also pulling back from areas such as onshore wind and hydrogen and seeking to hold a larger slice of its projects than previously, while boosting its power trading division.

This marks an evolution from the “build, sell down, build” model that propelled Orsted’s expansion, and raises questions about the growth of the offshore wind and renewables industry despite global decarbonisation goals.

“The future Orsted will primarily allocate capital to offshore wind in Europe,” its chair Lene Skole told shareholders.

Industry costs have grown sharply in recent years as interest rates rose and suppliers rebelled after a long period of squeezed margins, causing problems for several offshore wind farms being built and harming political support.

Orsted abandoned two US projects in 2023, before Trump was re-elected, triggering multibillion-dollar writedowns and accelerating a share price slide, which has reached almost 80 per cent over the past five years.

Completing the projects under way should help Orsted restore its finances, bringing in roughly DKr11bn ($1.7bn) to DKr12bn of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation annually from 2028, and adding to the 18.5GW of renewables it has developed around the world, of which it now owns a 12GW share.

That portfolio is one factor persuading investors to stick with the company, regardless of prospects for growth beyond the current buildout. Orsted has said it planned to resume dividends next year, having suspended them in 2024.

Charles Lemonides, chief investment officer at hedge fund ValueWorks, an Orsted investor, said: “They’ve put up windmills around the world and they’re generating electricity and cash flows, and those assets are worth money regardless of what Donald Trump says.”

But completing the current build is no small order. The US government in August ordered Orsted to stop work on its $1.5 billion Revolution Wind development off Rhode Island, which is about 80 per cent complete. Orsted is challenging the ban in the courts.

The Danish government, which owns 50.1 per cent of Orsted, was also lobbying the Trump administration to soften its approach to the industry, said people familiar with the matter, mindful of the damage it may do to Danish companies across the supply chain.

Yet Copenhagen’s efforts may have to be redoubled. “There isn’t a future for offshore wind because it’s too expensive and not reliable enough,” Trump’s interior secretary Doug Burgum told the Gastech conference in Milan this week, saying the administration was taking a “deep look” at each of the current projects under construction.

[ Danish group Ørsted to spend €90m on latest Irish wind farmOpens in new window ]

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind account for about 20 per cent of the offshore wind capacity Orsted is building. As well as fending off Trump, the company also needs to raise further cash to fund its programmes by selling off its European onshore wind business as well as stakes in two major projects in Taiwan and off the east coast of the UK, testing the appetite of offshore wind investors.

Orsted, which announced 800 job cuts in 2024, is also weighing further spending reductions, with announcements planned for later this year. “We’re in the process of right-sizing our organisation to the reality we’re in,” said Rasmus Errboe, chief executive.

He pledged a “value over volume” approach to new projects, highlighting the potential for the technology in Europe, where politicians want to expand capacity from about 37GW to at least 300GW by 2050 to meet decarbonisation goals. About 1GW of offshore wind can supply electricity for 1mn homes.

The decision by Norway’s state-controlled energy company Equinor to take a 10 per cent stake in Orsted last October raises the prospect of closer industrial tie-up between the Scandinavian nations. Equinor will subscribe to the rights issue and nominate a director to Orsted’s board.

But the rising costs and supply chain strains has tempered some of the optimism in Europe. Developers have shunned recent auctions for new projects in Denmark and Germany, while the opposition Reform UK party, which leads British opinion polls several years away from a general election, has threatened to withdraw state support.

One of Orsted’s wind farms in Germany stands idle as its grid connection is not ready, while demand for the electricity produced is subdued partly because of high costs and technical challenges.

“Electricity demand is not as big as we expected it to be at this stage,” said Giles Dickson, outgoing chief executive of the WindEurope trade group.

“A few years ago, heavy industry in the Netherlands was saying to us, ‘please build offshore wind farms now, we want to electrify’. Then heavy industry realised it was actually very difficult to electrify [and] the business case wasn’t there.”

Despite the uncertain future, some shareholders take a forgiving view.

“Orsted has had missteps for sure,” said Lemonides of ValueWorks. “But they’ve also done more to advance this industry than anybody else. Part of being a leader is sometimes you hit roadblocks.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025

[TITLE]Industry reps meet with EU to press for realistic green strategy:
[TEXT]
Representatives of Europe’s auto industry have met with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in the framework of the ‘third Strategic Dialogue’, launched eight months ago to address the mounting crisis in a sector vital to the European economy.

The latest meeting comes as European automakers have called for a re-evaluation of the European Union’s stringent climate regulations, asserting that the current trajectory towards banning combustion engines on new vehicles for sale (including a 100% reduction for cars by 2035) is ‘unfeasible’.

Europe’s auto industry is also grappling with the dual challenges posed by rising competition from China in the electric vehicle (EV) market and higher tariffs on shipments to the US.

ACEA said last month in a letter to the EU Commission: ‘Europe’s transformation plan for the auto industry must move beyond idealism to acknowledge current industrial and geopolitical realities. Meeting the rigid car and van CO2 targets for 2030 and 2035 is, in today’s world, simply no longer feasible.’

In the latest meeting, there was limited sign of any concessions to the industry from Brussels.

[TITLE]Amundi’s green funds and the billion euro invested in fossil fuel companies:
[TEXT]
Amundi Investment Solutions, a French asset management company, is Europe’s leading asset manager and ranks among the global top ten, with a portfolio exceeding two trillion dollars. Between 2024 and early 2025, Amundi allocated 1.1 billion dollars to investments in the fossil fuel sector through so-called green funds that comply with Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) criteria, and which are therefore expected to promote sustainable and ethical activity. Extending our analysis back to 2023, the total amount of funds defined as green and allocated to the fossil fuel sector amounts to 1.7 billion dollars, according to analysis of data from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) platform.

In order to reach the carbon neutrality envisaged by the 2015 Paris Agreement, the European Union is committed to “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development”, in line with ESG criteria. The latter are used to evaluate companies’ environmental, social and governance practices to determine their accountability and sustainability.

With this in mind, the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), in force since 2021, divides financial funds into three categories: Article 6 funds, which do not take environmental parameters into account; Article 8 funds, also known as “light green” funds, which do not have specific ESG objectives but promote ESG characteristics; and Article 9 funds, or “dark green” funds, which promote clearly defined sustainability objectives.

However, Article 8 funds can still include investments in companies linked to fossil fuels. In recent years, with stricter rules introduced by the European Union for Article 9 funds, many asset managers, instead of reviewing their investments, have chosen to switch dark green funds to light green in order to avoid incurring penalties. According to Amundi's website, 11 funds have undergone name changes, based on the European guidelines of May 2024. In six of these cases, Amundi has removed the designation Net Zero or ESG.

After the EU guidelines were issued, Amundi changed the names of finds by removing terms associated with sustainability. The investments themselves were not modified, and continued to finance leading companies in the fossil fuel sector.

Amundi, however, continues to promote its investments as “responsible.” Accessing its Italian webpage as a potential investor, the section dedicated to “investing responsibly” appears at the top of the page, alongside investment goals and themes.

The French company claims that it is interested in “making a positive contribution to a better future”, because “climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time.” As a way to take “urgent action”, the site proposes that investors make a difference by investing in the ESG solutions offered by Amundi.

The companies

We tracked the 38 Amundi funds that were still designated as “sustainable” in March 2025, but which, in reality, invest in fossil fuels. The company that receives the most investment from Amundi’s green funds is TotalEnergies, a French multinational that is among the world’s top four petroleum companies. TotalEnergies has received a total of 438 million dollars from Amundi’s green funds. This is more than triple what Amundi has invested in Shell, which has received around 145 million dollars. Next is Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, with 108 million, Repsol with 98 million, and Exxon Mobil with 92 million. The rest is divided between companies such as EQT AB and Equinor ASA that receive around 40 million dollars, and others such as Inpex Corp and BP PLC which receive between 3 and 8 million.

It should be noted that according to Carbon Tracker’s Paris Maligned III report none of these companies have decarbonisation targets aligned with the Paris Agreement.

TotalEnergies

TotalEnergies is the energy company in which Amundi has invested the most. Sustainalytics, an organisation that evaluates corporate sustainability gives TotalEnergies a “high” ESG Risk Rating, indicating that in the coming years TotalEnergies is likely to encounter significant problems concerning its environmental, social and governance performance.

In its latest sustainability report, TotalEnergies intends to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 by sourcing 25% of its energy production from low-carbon molecules (biogas, hydrogen and synthetic fuels), 50% from renewable sources and the remaining 25% from fossil fuels and liquefied natural gas (LNG). In 2024, the percentage of its energy production from fossil fuels and LNG was 87%.

To achieve 50% of electricity production from renewable sources, Amundi will rely on investments in Brazil, a country that is described in the company's sustainability report as a “key country for the company's Multi-Energy Strategy”. Brazil is indeed a key player in energy supply. According to a 2024 study by Rystad Energy, it will produce 7 million barrels of crude oil per day by 2030. This represents a 56% increase compared to 2023, and almost three times more than in 2010.

According to the Rystad Energy report, TotalEnergies is the leading energy company in Brazil, with a decade-long partnership with Petrobras and Casa dos Ventos. Petrobras is Brazil’s state-owned fossil fuel extraction and production company, while Casa dos Ventos is one of the leading renewable energy project developers in Brazil, specialising primarily in wind and solar power generation. With Petrobras, TotalEnergies is investing in the Mero Field, an oil extraction project in several pre-salt deposits (situated in the ocean depths beneath a thick layer of salt) off the Santos Basin, approximately 180 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro. In collaboration with TotalEnergies, Shell and other oil companies, Petrobras is responsible for the construction of four offshore extraction platforms in the pre-salt deposits, renowned for the quality and quantity of raw material extracted.

The project, divided into four phases – Mero 1, Mero 2, Mero 3, Mero 4 – is TotalEnergies' primary focus. Mero 3 Field, an offshore platform off the Santos Basin, has a production capacity of 180,000 barrels of oil per day, compared to 40,000 for Mero 1, which was inaugurated in 2021. The Mero 4 Field began production on 26 May this year, with a production level equal to that of Mero 3.

TotalEnergies has also signed an agreement with Petrobras to deploy AUSEA technology (Airborne Ultralight Spectrometer for Environmental Applications) to monitor greenhouse gas emissions – methane and carbon dioxide in particular. Concerns have been raised

[TITLE]Bord Gáis, Pinergy to increase electricity prices:
[TEXT]
Bord Gáis Energy and Pinergy have announced price increases for residential electricity customers from next month.

The increase announced by Bord Gáis will see a 13.5% hike on standard unit rates while their standing charges will increase by 12% from 12 October.

This will increase a typical bill for Bord Gáis Energy electricity customers by an average of €18.16 per month, or €218 per year.

Pinergy, meanwhile, confirmed that its price change will result in a 9.83% increase to typical household costs from 13 October, equivalent to €199 annually based on a domestic customer using typical consumption.

There is no change to Pinergy's standing charge.

Bord Gáis Energy said the rise in electricity charges was in response to continued increases in network costs, the impact of wholesale energy markets and the higher cost of doing business. It added that it was its first price hike in three years.

Bord Gáis Energy has 369,000 domestic electricity customers.

Prices for its 270,000 gas customers remain unchanged, the company added.

Director of Customer and Commercial at Bord Gáis Energy Catherine Lonergan said this was the company's first price increase in three years, adding that in that time it had two price reductions across gas and electricity.

"We also absorbed network charges in 2024 saving households an average of €100 in electricity and €75 in gas," she said.

"Due to continued increases in network charges, the higher cost of doing business and the impact of wholesale energy market pricing, we're regrettably announcing a price increase for electricity customers," she said.

Watch: Energy prices 'being pushed close to peak of energy crisis', says Daragh Cassidy of Bonkers.ie

"However, I can confirm that there is no change to gas prices for our 270,000 gas customers and that our gas standing charge remains the lowest in the market."

She said that Bord Gáis Energy will continue to compete strongly in the Irish energy market and pass on savings whenever possible.

Pinergy's CEO Enda Gunnell, said it is their "first increase after three price decreases that we made over 2023 and into 2024".

Mr Gunnell said Pinergy absorbed increased network charges approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities last year.

"The planned investment in the electricity grid and infrastructure is urgently required but we would call on the exchequer to also play its role in ensuring much needed price stability and minimising the financial burden on consumers," he said.

Earlier this week, Electric Ireland said it would decrease gas prices for 140,000 customers by 4% from the beginning of November, while there will be no increase for the company's 1.1 million electricity customers ahead of the winter.

Energia recently said it would increase its electricity prices by up to 12.1% from 9 October, which will add more than €200 onto the annual bills of many customers.

Last month Flogas hiked its prices by an average of 7%.

Reacting to the latest energy price hikes, the Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said: "Here we go again!"

"Another big energy bill hike on the way while Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael prepare to withdraw energy credits from households in the Budget," she said.

"It's a terrible decision. This rip-off must be brought to an end. Workers and families must be supported in the Budget."

European shares ended a strong week a little lower as investors turned cautious in advance of Fitch’s credit rating decision on France later in the day.

Dublin

The Dublin market ended the week slightly off, just shy of 11,431, 0.12 per cent weaker on the day but 1.1 per cent stronger over the week.

Banks were higher over the day, with AIB gaining 0.6 per cent and Bank of Ireland gaining 0.2 per cent. Insurer FBD was flat. The European Central Bank left rates unchanged on Thursday as expected, but its upbeat view on growth and inflation dampened expectations for further easing.

Food groups Kerry and Glanbia were lower, with the latter down 1,2 per cent by the close, and Kerry losing almost 0.9 per cent in the session.

Among travel and leisure stocks, Ryanair was flat, while ferries group Irish Continental down 1.4 per cent.

London

The blue-chip FTSE 100 closed down 0.2 per cent but registered its second straight weekly gain. The domestically focused mid-cap index fell 0.3 per cent but also finished ahead on the week.

Healthcare stocks fell 1.2 per cent with heavyweight AstraZeneca losing 1.4 per cent. A top industry lobby group warned a challenging business environment was hurting the sector.

Some consumer staples stocks also declined, including Diageo which was down 1.9 per cent.

Retail stocks lost 0.7 per cent, with JD Sports Fashion falling 2.2 per cent to the bottom of the benchmark index.

Conversely, the aerospace and defence sector rose by about 1 per cent, hitting a fresh record and recording its largest weekly rise in over six months. BAE Systems rose 1.7 per cent.

Utility stocks such as United Utilities and SSE advanced 1.6 per cent each.

Industrial miners also rose, tracking higher copper prices. Glencore gained 1.6 per cent.

In other moves, online supermarket and tech firm Ocado fell 19.9 per cent to the bottom of the mid-cap index, after its US partner Kroger signalled a potential retreat from investment in automated warehouses.

Europe

The pan-European Stoxx 600 ended 0.11 per cent lower at 554.74 points, as healthcare led sector losses, slipping back by over 1 per cent.

Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis lost 2.8 per cent after a Goldman Sachs’ downgrade which cited rising competition from generics. Its peer, Zealand Pharma, retreated 4.1 per cent in sympathy.

European aerospace and defence stocks extended their record-setting run, up 0.7 per cent on Friday to a new high.

Banks were also ahead on the week – by about 4 per cent, staging a rebound after weakness in late August.

For the week as a whole, the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was poised for its first gain in three weeks, up 1 per cent. The move was inspired by global equities, which firmed this week on expectations of multiple US interest rate cuts.

Among other stocks, French voucher providers Pluxee and Edenred dropped 6.3 per cent and 6.4 per cent, respectively, following a report on a potential 8 per cent tax on lunch vouchers.

New York

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hit record highs on Friday in mixed trading, while Wall Street’s main indices remained on track to log gains in a week of economic reports that solidified expectations for interest rate cuts.

Microsoft gained 2.1 per cent after the technology giant avoided a possible hefty EU antitrust fine by offering customers reduced prices for Office products, excluding Teams.

That boosted the information technology sector on the S&P 500, and helped lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Microsoft was among the only bright spots on the blue-chip Dow, which was held back by declines in Goldman Sachs and paint-maker Sherwin-Williams.

At 12.09pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 187.60 points, or 0.41 per cent, weaker on 45,918.17, the S&P 500 had lost 1.79 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 6,585.68 and the Nasdaq Composite was 80.83 points, or 0.37 per cent, stronger on 22,123.90. – Additional reporting: Reuters
