[TITLE]EIL inks MoU with NMDC Energy to explore onshore oil & gas projects in Saudi Arabia:
[TEXT]
State-run Engineers India (EIL) said on Monday that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NMDC Energy to strengthen cooperation in the execution of onshore projects in Saudi Arabia, covering Oil and Gas Processing, Refineries, Petrochemicals, Pipelines, Storage Terminals, and Energy Transition.

The MoU was signed on the sidelines of ADIPEC 2025, world’s largest oil and gas event, which was held in Abu Dhabi last week.

“The partnership with NMDC reflects EIL’s commitment to engineering excellence, innovation, and building strategic collaborations that support sustainable growth across the region. The partnership aims to combine EIL’s extensive engineering expertise with NMDC Energy’s strong execution capabilities with focus on innovation, sustainability and operational excellence,” EIL said.

NMDC Energy, part of the NMDC Group of the UAE, offers engineering, procurement and construction solutions to clients in the integrated oil and gas, petrochemical, and energy transition sectors.

Sources said that both companies want to collaborate for joint tendering and executing onshore projects. The collaboration is related to delivery of onshore engineering procurement and construction (EPC) projects in the Arab nation across the full spectrum of oil & gas segments, leveraging the fabrication facilities owned by NMDC in Ras Al Khair and the design center established by EIL in Al Khobar.

In its FY25 annual report, EIL said that it is expanding footprints in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, tapping into refinery upgrades, fertiliser plant projects and oil and gas infrastructure development.

“EIL in its endeavour to seek projects in the Middle East, has managed to secure assignments from the ADNOC Group companies for Technical Support Services (TSS) contracts, General Service Agreement with BAPCO, Bahrain,” it added.

The PSU bagged the Engineering Services for Jetty-less Green Ammonia Transfer System for a Green Ammonia Project (Offshore portion) in Oman, from M/s ACME, Oman. EIL is envisaging projects in the Green Hydrogen/ Ammonia segment from clients overseas, it said in the annual report.

[TITLE]Canaccord Genuity Boosts Iris Energy Price Target to $70 After Microsoft GPU Deal:
[TEXT]
This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Canaccord Genuity has raised its price target on Iris Energy (IREN, Financials) to $70 from $42 while keeping a Buy rating, following the company's new GPU services agreement with Microsoft.

The analysts said the deal significantly boosts Iris Energy's long-term value, adding about $22 per share based on a discounted cash flow model with an 8% cost of capital. An additional $6 per share came from higher valuations of its Sweetwater 1 site, reflecting stronger market demand for AI data centers.

The Microsoft partnership marks a turning point for Iris Energy as it expands beyond Bitcoin mining into AI cloud computing. In its fiscal first quarter of 2026, the company reported $240.3 million in revenue, up from $187.3 million the prior quarter, driven by $232.9 million from Bitcoin operations and $7.3 million from AI services.

Despite recent share volatility tied to higher expenses, analysts remain upbeat. Compass Point also lifted its target to $105, citing growing AI exposure and rising institutional demand for GPU infrastructure.

[TITLE]Oil Prices Climb as Senate Passes Deal to Reopen Government:
[TEXT]
In early Asian trade on Monday, crude oil prices were climbing after the United States Senate passed a funding agreement that could end the federal government shutdown. At the time of writing, WTI had climbed to $60.20 while Brent was trading at $64.05, both up by roughly 0.7%.

Senate negotiators had struck a deal ahead of a Sunday evening session to begin advancing a House-passed continuing resolution. After nearly two hours, the funding measure passed with the support of eight Democrats.

The package combines the continuing resolution with a “minibus” appropriations bundle (three long-term spending bills) and guarantees the Democrats a vote on extending health-insurance tax credits.

From a market perspective, the expectation that roughly 800,000 unpaid federal workers will soon see their salaries returned, benefit programs will restart, and key government services will resume is boosting sentiment. Speaking to Reuters, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore argued that the reopening prospect “should also help improve risk sentiment across markets”.

The optimism surrounding a deal can be seen on platforms such as Polymarket, which now has the odds of the shutdown ending before the 16th of November at 95%. Despite the rising confidence, a deal still faces some hurdles. After the Senate vote, approval by the United States House of Representatives needs to be secured, and the President will have to sign off before the longest government shutdown in history is brought to an end.

For oil markets, a government reopening should lead to improved domestic U.S. demand for goods and services (including energy) and the return of halted government spending, which can bolster crude demand. Additionally, improved risk appetite tends to reduce safe-haven premiums and can shift funds into commodities like oil.

[TITLE]HSBC Slashes Oil and Gas Financing:
[TEXT]
Financing and deals with oil and gas companies will have a materially lower share in the energy portfolio of HSBC as new energy opportunities arise, the banking giant’s chief sustainability officer, Julian Wentzel, told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday.

The UK-based banking group unveiled today its updated Net Zero Transition Plan, in which it eased the interim emissions targets for its oil and gas portfolio. The 2030 emission reduction target is now to reduce emissions in its business with the oil and gas sector by 14% to 30% from a 2019 baseline. The previous target was cutting absolute financed emissions by 34% by 2030.

HSBC reaffirmed its 2050 net-zero target for its financed portfolio, but noted that it is updating the interim targets as “Our customers are navigating complex and dynamic market conditions with the transition playing out at different speeds and from different starting points across sectors and geographies.”

“In some sectors and regions there has been significant progress; in others, the transition is proving harder and slower than anticipated,” HSBC said.

Wentzel told Bloomberg that financing for fossil fuels will likely increase in HSBC’s portfolio, but the finance will “decline materially” relative to HSBC’s total capital allocation to the energy sector.

HSBC is not considering further restrictions, according to Wentzel, who became the bank’s chief sustainability officer in February.

“We have to acknowledge that the removal of capital from the oil and gas sector doesn’t support the transition, because if they’re seeking to transition, we want to be party to and support that transition,” Wentzel told Bloomberg.

The world’s biggest banks raised their combined financing for fossil fuels by more than one-fifth last year, bucking a falling trend since 2021 amid a backlash against net-zero policies, especially in the United States.

After years of scrutiny and blacklisting from Republican states in the U.S. and lawsuits from Republican attorney generals, North American banks and asset managers began quitting net-zero alliances en masse following President Donald Trump’s election victory.

Some 20 kilometers out from the port of Tianjin, in the jade waters of the Bohai Sea, a vast metal structure rises above the surface. This hulking offshore platform, 11-1 CEPJ, is the beating heart of the Caofeidian oil and gas field — and a monument to China’s multibillion-dollar efforts to insulate itself from the whims of its rivals.China has long sought to reduce the risk that comes with being both the world’s top consumer and its largest importer of energy. But the urgency and scale of that ambition have increased dramatically in recent years and months, along with geopolitical tension and the ascent of a mercurial Donald Trump to helm a US administration unafraid to use trade as a weapon. Last month, Washington also blacklisted Russia’s top two oil producers, prompting Chinese refiners to cancel some cargoes.Since 2019, when the latest output expansion drive began in earnest, China’s majors have spent $468 billion on drilling and exploration — that’s up by almost a quarter from the previous six years, and enough to make PetroChina Co. the world’s biggest spender during that period, outpacing even heavyweights like Saudi Aramco. Production is already rebounding, and with Beijing likely to double down on self-reliance, there is no indication that pace of investment will slow in the coming years.“In the last few years, we have seen an energy crunch all around the world,” Huang Yingchao, vice president of natural gas at PetroChina International (Singapore) Pte, the energy giant’s trading arm, said at a conference last week. “Gas and LNG are like tap water and bottled water. Tap water is cheaper and is more reliable, and the logistics are easier. So we push for domestic production.”All of this is becoming a huge, unspoken headache for the world’s largest oil and gas producers. From Exxon Mobil Corp. to BP Plc, sprawling corporations have grown used to having China as the engine for the world’s fossil-fuel demand. Indeed, for much of the last decade, it accounted for more than 60% of global oil demand growth.Take Shell Plc, one of the world's largest liquefied natural gas suppliers. It is investing billions into new LNG supply on the expectation that global demand will expand 60% by 2040, driven largely by China. Its boss, Wael Sawan, told a conference in June that gas could make up 20% of China's energy mix, compared with single digits today."We believe China is a huge market,” Hassan Alyami, vice president of Aramco’s Ras Tanura refinery said at an industry gathering last month. “Demand is increasing. Maybe now it is stable, but in 2027 and beyond, demand is going to increase.”But the past may no longer be a good way of predicting the future. Domestic output is increasing just as demand growth slows, with the economy sputtering and cleaner cars beginning to rule the roads. This year has already seen competition from other fuels, and Sanford C. Bernstein analysts expect domestic gas production to begin outpacing demand growth by the end of this decade, a moment when China may also be taking more pipeline gas from Russia, further cooling appetite for imported LNG.Nevertheless, from January to October global companies have greenlit nearly 100 billion cubic meters of new LNG export capacity, already the second-most for any year on record. In the US alone, $100 billion could be invested in new LNG export infrastructure this decade, according to Wood Mackenzie Ltd.Trump has said China will buy more US energy and even potentially invest in Alaska as part of a wider trade truce. But, as with other key areas, like agriculture, it will not be for lack of alternative options.“China is coming in with increased production. With oil demand falling or plateauing, that serves to neutralize — or to provide China with a buffer against — the Trump administration’s push for energy dominance,” said Erica Downs, senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “They’re in a completely different world and an even better position than during Trump 1.0.”China still consumes far more than it produces, and that is unlikely to change any time soon. But today it ranks No. 7 in crude production, ahead of many members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and in natural gas it is No. 4.That clout speaks to the evolution of China’s oil majors, all of which have expanded dramatically in size and sophistication this millennium. PetroChina, Cnooc Ltd and Sinopec , have become giants in terms of output, refining and oil trading, alongside rivals Chevron Corp and Shell Plc. PetroChina’s annual production has risen by nearly a quarter in the past decade to 1.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent.“The Chinese oil majors have surprised not just the market, but they’ve surprised themselves by exceeding production targets,” said Michal Meidan, director of China research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “It gives China a sense of control, especially as oil demand is declining.”Under the first Trump administration and during the first trade war, President Xi Jinping called for a renewed effort to boost domestic output. Since, oil production has risen 13% and gas has climbed by more than half. Both are on track to set all-time records this year — the equivalent of adding nearly an Indonesia worth of oil and an Algeria worth of gas to the balance of global supplies.Government officials haven’t made specific future targets public — at best, an indication could come early next year, when the 15th Five-Year Plan is approved by China’s annual parliament. But they’ve made it clear they want the drilling boom to continue. That new economic blueprint is expected to make upstream expansion a priority, according to a person familiar with the government’s thinking. The person asked not to be named as the goals have not been published.Beijing’s focus on hydrocarbon security arguably dates back to the late 1950s, to a period around China’s split with the Soviet Union — and with its engineers — that ingrained in officials the need to avoid leaning too heavily on others. The country’s very first oilfield, Daqing, was already a model of self-reliance, expanding rapidly as technology, engineers and construction equipment were funneled toward it.Those concerns resurfaced in earnest a decade ago, when OPEC launched a price war to halt the growth of US shale oil and combat a plunge in value. China was caught in the crossfire, saddled with costly, aging fields that the head of PetroChina in 2016 said had “no hope” of making a profit, even as prices recovered. Output tumbled 12% over the following three years.Under Xi, Beijing has set out to change that. In the midst of a trade war with the US, he underlined in 2018 the need to boost domestic oil and gas exploration and production — at any cost. He reinforced the message during a 2021 visit to the Lai 113 block at the Shengli oil field in the eastern province of Shandong.“Oil development is of great significance to our country,” Xi told a crowd of workers clad in bright red, flame-retardant jumpsuits. “As a major manufacturing nation, China must develop its real economy. The rice bowl of energy must be firmly held in our own hands.”Four years later, on a cool and wet September afternoon in Shengli, Zhang Chuanbao, a senior geologist for operator Sinopec, shows visitors everything the company has done to revive production at a field that was first discovered in 1961.He stops alongside two giant metal tanks filled with liquefied carbon dioxide captured from a nearby refinery. Pumps housed in sheds next to them are injecting that CO2 deep underground into the reservoirs. Sinopec is keen to underline the environmental benefits of storing 1 million tons of CO2 a year underground, but it’s also helping to squeeze out extra oil and gas, boosting the recovery rate by 15%.The carbon capture project is expected to lift oil output by 3 million tons total over the next 15 years, and Sinopec is seeking other ways to maintain the 24 million tons of annual production at the aging field, including tapping shale rock beneath it.All of these advances are possible thanks to vast sums spent in recent years. After Xi called for a renewed emphasis on domestic drilling, the following year China’s three oil majors adopted an action plan for oil and gas development through 2025.PetroChina, the top spender, boosted its capital expenditure by 16% in 2019 to $42 billion, while Cnooc and Sinopec both increased spending by more than a fifth that same year. By comparison, that year Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP taken together increased spending by just over 5%.Success was not a foregone conclusion. Six or seven years ago, China’s giants were announcing plans to boost production at a time of abundant global supplies. Analysts questioned whether they were prioritizing shareholder returns or national service.But the move proved prescient. Companies began to actually produce more barrels just as oil and gas prices surged, especially from 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Cnooc hit record profits that year; PetroChina did the same in 2024.“The companies got kind of lucky,” said Lin Chen, vice president of oil and gas research at Rystad Energy. “The oil price rose higher than their break-even costs, so the more they produced, the more money they earned.”Today, China is going beyond supporting aging fields to sustain fuel output. It’s putting funds into shale, and firms including Ningxia Baofeng Energy Group Co. have built massive refineries that convert coal into oil products, chemicals and natural gas — a process that is even more polluting than the traditional petroleum industry.The biggest success has been at sea. Cnooc has lifted its domestic output — all of it offshore — by 60% between the end of 2018 and 2024.And the emblem of this victory is the Bohai Sea in northeast China, which has supplanted onshore fields to become the largest oil-producing region in the country. Protected by peninsulas jutting out from Shandong on the west and Liaoning to the north, it is home to 60 fields and more than 200 platforms pumping up oil and gas from under the sea floor.One of those is the Caofeidian 11-1 CEPJ. Named after a nearby coastal town, the Caofeidian field is part of a network in Bohai that together produces more than 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day —

[TITLE]Google and Mombak collaborate on CO2 removal:
[TEXT]
We signed a new carbon dioxide (CO2) removal deal with Mombak, a Brazil-based company that is restoring degraded land in the Amazon by planting native, biodiverse forests. We’re purchasing 200,000 tons of CO2 removal from Mombak — 4x the size of our first deal with them last year.

Mombak’s approach balances scientific rigor with industrial-scale operations to maximize climate benefit and ecosystem restoration. Our expanded support will help Mombak grow their impact, and we’ll also use Google DeepMind’s Perch AI to quantify the biodiversity benefits of reforestation.

Mombak is the first project selected by the Symbiosis Coalition, and it has been endorsed by independent experts for its credible approach to measuring CO2 removal. As with our other purchases, we’ll report transparently on the impact of this project — and where needed, plan to replace credits as their impact expires.

Forget summer Fridays.

The notion of "summer lull" has been gone from Wall Street since the pandemic, said Anu Aiyengar, global head of advisory and M&A at JPMorgan Chase. And it's never been more true than now: M&A activity has been rebounding even amid fears that Trump's trade wars could slow the economy.

"The last week of May and June and early July have all been pretty active with a good cadence of deal announcements," Aiyengar told Business Insider. "And more importantly, our pipeline and conversations continue to be active as well."

The bank on Wednesday released a report showing that M&A in the first half of the year hit its highest levels since 2022, driven largely by large deals. Here are four of the top trends keeping bankers busy as we head into a not-so-sleepy August:

Bigger is better

JPMorgan said total deal volume soared 27% to $2.2 trillion in the first half of 2025, including a 57% increase in deals over $10 billion.

Deals over $1 billion rose 72% — a 20-year high, the bank said.

Sector by sector

The bank said 7 out of 9 sectors saw double-digit volume growth, including:

Financial institutions (+56%)

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

Media & communications (+51%)

Diversified Industries (+41%)

M&A volumes seemed to favor technology (23%) and diversified industries (22%), the bank said.

Pie chart JPMorgan

Private equity dealmaking

Private equity firms, known in M&A parlance as financial sponsors, have ramped up dealmaking, leading to $168 billion in take-private deals in the first half of 2025, the highest levels since 2022, the bank said.

Four mega-deals accounted for more than 50% of that volume—indicating a highly concentrated but aggressive deployment of capital.

Minority stakes

Sponsors increased their minority stake transactions, especially in high-growth sectors. Sponsor-led minority deals rose 34% year-over-year and were 9% above the 10-year average of $81 billion.

A substantial share—35% of these deals—were in technology, driven by investments in AI, compute infrastructure, and data center capabilities.

Intelligent Energy Management Systems

The renewable transition integrates intelligent energy management systems that use AI-driven analytics to regulate power distribution, predict demand, and optimize cooling efficiency. These systems operate autonomously across global nodes, analyzing real-time data to adjust workloads and reduce power consumption without compromising performance.

Scatil Investment Alliance reported measurable improvements in energy performance, including up to 35 percent reductions in cooling power use and improved data processing efficiency across regions. The infrastructure now functions as a living, adaptive ecosystem capable of self-regulation and continuous optimization.

“Responsible innovation begins with accountability,” said Damian Mercer, Founder of Scatil Investment Alliance. “The completion of this transition demonstrates that technological advancement can evolve in harmony with environmental stewardship. Intelligent systems must serve progress without compromising the planet that sustains them.”

Mercer emphasized that sustainability is a fundamental aspect of the company’s operating philosophy, describing the initiative as a model for integrating renewable energy principles into the global digital economy.

Strategic Expansion and Future Outlook

Scatil Investment Alliance plans to expand renewable infrastructure integration across all secondary facilities, including AI research laboratories and analytical clusters, by 2026. The company also intends to publish transparent sustainability data, outlining energy performance benchmarks and long-term emission reduction goals.

The broader Green Execution Initiative encompasses several environmental strategies, including the reduction of electronic waste, sustainable hardware sourcing, and AI lifecycle optimization. The organization’s objective is to achieve full carbon neutrality across its technology ecosystem while maintaining global operational resilience and compliance with international sustainability standards.

[TITLE]Alectra Utilities submits 2027-2031 investment plan to Ontario Energy Board:
[TEXT]
MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alectra Utilities has submitted its 2027-2031 rate application to the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), proposing a detailed five-year plan to reinforce the electricity distribution system across its service territory. This application marks a significant step in advancing the renewal and resiliency of the grid and ensuring the delivery of safe and reliable electricity to over 1.3 million homes and businesses across the Greater Toronto, Hamilton, and Niagara regions.

“Our investment plan is designed with our customers at the forefront, prioritizing reliable service and sustainable growth,” said Brian Bentz, President and Chief Executive Officer, Alectra Inc. “By investing in our infrastructure and harmonizing rates, we aim to support the evolving needs of our communities while meeting organic population and economic growth.”

The proposed $3.1 billion plan was developed following extensive outreach to Alectra’s customers. Approximately 50,000 respondents provided input to the plan, and more than 80 per cent of them expressed support for Alectra’s capital investment priorities.

Subject to the approval of the OEB, customers can expect to see changes in their electricity distribution rates effective January 1, 2027. The application proposes harmonizing the rate structures from Alectra’s five legacy utilities to ensure consistency across all rate classes.

The Ontario Energy Board will review Alectra’s application through a public hearing process. Customers may participate by submitting comments or applying to become intervenors.
