[TITLE]Deal or Delay? Oil Diplomacy Tests Market Patience - US-China Trade Talks Progress, But Energy Dispute Remains:
[TEXT]
Experts believe China feels it holds leverage in negotiations. With Trump eager for a deal and China unwilling to cut vital oil imports, Beijing sees energy as non-negotiable—even if it causes friction and delays in the talks.

‘Modi Is a Friend But…’:US President Donald Trump after imposing 25% Tariff on India

NEW DELHI : President Donald Trump's announcement of a deal to develop Pakistan's "massive oil reserves" sounds more like a strategic manoeuvre on the South Asian chessboard to counter Islamabad's growing dependence on Beijing and pressure India over the trade deal, rather than a realistic assessment of the country's immediate hydrocarbons potential.Various estimates peg Pakistan’s 'proven' reserves of conventional oil at 0.2 billion barrels and natural gas at 529.5 billion cubic meters. These appear modest even when compared to India, which, at last count, was estimated to have oil reserves of

Santos has entered a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Engie, signalling a potential supply of natural gas from the Narrabri Gas Project to the Australian east coast domestic gas market.

This agreement could see up to 20 petajoules (PJ) per year being supplied for at least ten years following the project’s commencement.

The proposed deal is contingent upon Santos’ final investment decision (FID) on the Narrabri Gas Project, the negotiation and execution of a definitive gas supply agreement, and approvals from both parties.

Santos managing director and CEO Kevin Gallagher said: “Santos voluntarily committed 100% of Narrabri gas to the domestic market back in 2020. Santos already produces Narrabri gas from appraisal wells for the Wilga Park power station that generates electricity for the north-west NSW [New South Wales] grid.

“This experience, combined with our project development and production experience in Queensland’s Surat Basin, gives us confidence that Narrabri gas will be a very competitive source of domestic gas supply for the east coast market that is further advantaged by proximity to customers in NSW.”

Santos has been dedicated to developing the Narrabri asset since its acquisition in 2011, with more than A$1.5bn ($969.6m) invested thus far.

In addition to the supply agreement, Santos and Engie are exploring decarbonisation initiatives, particularly through Santos’ carbon management business and the proposed Moomba phase two carbon capture and storage project.

“Narrabri will be subject to some of the strictest environment and groundwater protections in the world, and we will comply with them,” Gallagher added.

In related news, Santos has reached a significant milestone in its Pikka phase one project in Alaska, US, with the safe arrival of critical processing modules at Oliktok Point.

This development is a key step towards enhancing the company’s growth and presence in the region.

[TITLE]Sixth Street takes 38% of Italian renewable energy firm Sorgenia in $4.6 billion deal:
[TEXT]
MILAN (Reuters) -U.S. investment firm Sixth Street said on Monday it had agreed to buy 38% of Sorgenia, in a deal that values the Italian renewable energy company at 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion).

The transaction allows Spanish infrastructure fund Asterion Industrial Partners to exit Sorgenia's capital, while F2i, Italy's main infrastructure fund, retains its position as the leading shareholder in Sorgenia, with a 62% stake.

Under the agreement, F2i will transfer to Sorgenia its wind and solar power generation assets in Italy and Spain: EF Solare, Renovalia and Renovalia Tramontana.

Asterion, which held 27.6% of Sorgenia, first invested in the company in 2020 supporting its efforts to build a position as a significant player in Europe's green energy transition.

"This agreement establishes Sorgenia as one of the leading energy infrastructure platforms in Europe," Sixth Street partner Richard Sberlati said.

Sorgenia's renewable portfolio spans solar, wind, biomass, and hydroelectric plants.

The company currently operates approximately 1,700 megawatt (MW) of installed renewable capacity and is pursuing development projects totalling an additional 5,000 MW.

Rothschild & Co advised Sixth Street, together with law firm Cleary Gottlieb.

Lazard, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mediobanca acted as financial advisers to F2i and Pedersoli Gattai as legal adviser. BofA Securities, Nomura and Societe Generale each advised one of the F2i funds involved in the transaction. ($1 = 0.8636 euros)

[TITLE]Electronics and renewable energy investments set to dominate state’s investment announcements in Thoothukudi:
[TEXT]
As the Tamil Nadu government kicks off its regional investment summits ‘TN Rising’ from Thoothukudi on Monday, electronics manufacturing and renewable energy sectors are set to take centrestage.

Sources told businessline that South Tamil Nadu’s existing strengths in precision manufacturing and green energy, electronics and renewable energy investments are set to be the highlight of the TN Rising conclave at Thoothukudi. The Tuticorin port is also a huge draw for these manufacturing entities to set up export-oriented units, sources said.

Businessline has learnt that high precision electronics manufacturing firm Yeemak, along with its group company Jeanuvs proposes to invest around ₹3,500 crores in Thootukudi for manufacturing Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and consumer electronics. This is set to be a large manufacturing set up with potential to employ over 7,000 people, sources in the know said.

Interestingly, the facility, once operational, will cater to both domestic and export market and is also set to dabble in defence manufacturing. “The company is also exploring ways to leverage the facility as an advanced integrated artillery ammunition and missile manufacturing factory,” an electronics industry insider said.

With the likes of Tata Power and Vikram Solar present in South Tamil Nadu, the region is also attracting renewable energy projects. This has also attracted Delhi-based Mobius Energy to set up a new ₹1,000 crore solar cell and module manufacturing facility in the district of Theni, with an MoU likely to be signed for it on Monday.

Beyond Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli, South Tamil Nadu is also seeing the mushrooming of more investment clusters. Dindigul and Theni’s agriculture strengths offer potential for companies in the value-added food exports space, and the temple town of Madurai too is fast emerging as an IT hardware and software hub.

Following Thoothukudi, the state also plans to conduct editions of the Regional Investment Conclaves in western, central, and northern Tamil Nadu.
