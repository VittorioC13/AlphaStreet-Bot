In today’s industry news roundup: Europe’s cloud and digital service providers get welcome news from Gartner; Amdocs is still the telecom software sector’s big hitter; low-earth orbit satellite hopeful AST SpaceMobile boasts deals worth more than $1bn; and much more!

This should get the juices flowing at European cloud, datacentre and telco business development teams… Research house Gartner is reporting that, according to the results of a recent survey (with 241 respondents), some 61% of CIOs and IT leaders in western Europe plan to “increase their reliance on local or regional cloud providers” because of geopolitical factors. “Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, organisations in western Europe are increasingly worried

[TITLE]Nebius reveals major share sale plan with Wall Street:
[TEXT]
Nebius Group NV has announced an equity distribution agreement with some of Wall Street’s most influential financial institutions, setting the stage for a significant share offering that could reshape the company’s capital structure. The arrangement involves Goldman Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co., BofA Securities and Citigroup Global Markets, allowing for the periodic offering and sale of up to 25 million Class A ordinary shares.

The strategic agreement enables the company to manage share distribution over time rather than flooding the market with a single large offering. This approach provides flexibility to respond to market conditions and investor demand while potentially minimizing price disruption that can accompany major equity sales.

Building infrastructure for artificial intelligence

Nebius Group operates as a European technology company providing comprehensive infrastructure and services to artificial intelligence developers worldwide. The firm specializes in constructing full-stack infrastructure designed to support the expanding AI industry, including GPU clusters, cloud platforms and developer tools that enable companies to build and deploy AI applications.

With research and development hubs strategically positioned across Europe, North America and Israel, the company has established a global footprint in the communication services sector. Operating specifically within the interactive media industry, Nebius Group commands a market capitalization of $24.08 billion, reflecting substantial investor confidence despite some financial challenges.

Financial performance presents contrasts

The company’s financial picture reveals a complex situation that potential investors should carefully evaluate. Trailing twelve-month sales reached $237.2 million, but this figure masks a troubling trend. Revenue growth has declined 68.3% over the past three years, raising questions

[TITLE]Duos Technologies Reports 112% Increase in Quarterly Revenue:
[TEXT]
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Duos Technologies Group, Inc. (“Duos” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: DUOT), a provider of adaptive, versatile and streamlined Edge Data Center (“EDC”) solutions and operational services for the deployment of "behind the meter” electrical power, reported financial results for the third quarter (“Q3 2025”) ended September 30, 2025. In addition to the equivalent quarter revenue growth, consecutive quarterly revenue growth was more than 20% for a total of $17.6 million for the first nine months, the highest revenue for that period in the Company’s history.

Recorded $6.88 million in revenue, including $6.59 million for services of which $5.15 million is related to the Asset Management Agreement (“AMA”) with New APR Energy.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results

It should be noted that the following Financial Results represent the consolidation of the Company with its subsidiaries Duos Technologies, Duos Edge AI, Inc., and Duos Energy Corporation (“Duos Energy”).

Total revenues for Q3 2025 increased 112% to $6.9 million compared to $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 (“Q3 2024”). Total revenue for Q3 2025 represents an aggregate of approximately $263,000 of technology systems revenue and approximately $6,600,000 in recurring services and consulting and hosting revenue. The significant revenue increase in the third quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, was primarily driven by Duos Energy executing against the Asset Management Agreement ("AMA") with New APR that was signed on December 31, 2024. Under the AMA, Duos Energy oversees the deployment and operations of a fleet of mobile gas turbines and related balance-of-plant inventory, providing management, sales, and operational support services to New APR. Other revenue sources included the start of hosting revenues for its edge data centers and limited progress of two Railcar Inspection Portals (“RIP®”) currently being developed for Amtrak.

Cost of revenues for Q3 2025 increased 88% to $4.36 million compared to $2.32 million for Q3 2024. The significant increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to supporting the AMA with New APR, where Duos Energy oversees the deployment and operations of a fleet of mobile gas turbines and related balance-of-plant inventory, providing management, sales, and operational support services to New APR. The cost of revenues on technology systems decreased compared to the equivalent period in 2024. This reduction is primarily driven by our ability in Q3 2025 to reallocate certain fixed operating and servicing costs for technology systems to support the AMA, an allocation we could not make in the comparative period because the agreement was not yet in effect. It also reflects the limited manufacturing progress ahead of field installation of our two high-speed RIP®s while we await customer readiness for site deployment.

Gross margin for Q3 2025 increased 174% to $2.5 million compared to $0.9 million for Q3 2024. Gross margin improved primarily due to Duos Energy’s performance of the AMA with New APR. This also includes $904,125 in revenue recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2025, related to the Company's 5% non-voting equity interest in the ultimate parent of New APR, which carries no associated costs and therefore contributes at a 100% margin. These revenues and the associated margin contribution were not present in the prior year period.

Operating expenses for Q3 2025 increased 28% to $3.6 million compared to $2.8 million for Q3 2024. The increase in expenses is largely attributed to non-cash stock-based compensation charged for restricted stock granted to the executive team on January 1, 2025, under new employment agreements with a three-year cliff vesting schedule. Overall, sales and marketing costs declined as resources were allocated to costs of service and consulting revenues in support of the AMA with New APR. Additionally, research and development expenses fell by 71% owing to scaled-back testing of prospective technologies. The Company continues to focus on stabilizing operating expenses, including evaluating reductions in some areas, while continuing to meet the increased requirements of our new businesses.

Net operating loss for Q3 2025 totaled $1.1 million compared to net operating loss of $1.9 million for Q3 2024. The decrease in loss from operations was primarily the result of increased revenues during the quarter, driven by revenue generated by Duos Energy through the AMA with New APR, offset slightly by non-cash stock-based compensation charged for restricted stock that was not in the comparative period.

Net loss for Q3 2025 totaled $1.04 million compared to net loss of $1.4 million for Q3 2024. The 26% decrease in net loss was mostly attributed to the non-cash stock-based compensation charged for restricted stock and one-time compensation expenses that were not in the comparative period, offset by an increase in revenues generated by Duos Energy through the AMA with New APR as described above. Net loss per common share was $0.06 and $0.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2025 totaled $33.20 million compared to $6.27 million at December 31, 2024. In addition, the Company had over $3.00 million in receivables and contract assets for a total of approximately $36.20 million in cash and expected short-term liquidity.

Nine Month 2025 Financial Results

Total revenue increased 202% to $17.6 million from $5.8 million in the same period last year. Total revenue for the first nine months of 2025 represents an aggregate of approximately $370,000 of technology systems revenue and approximately $17.2 million in recurring services and consulting revenue. The significant revenue increase in the period, compared to the same period last year, was primarily driven by Duos Energy executing against the AMA with New APR originally signed on December 31, 2024. The decrease in technology systems’ revenues was primarily attributed to delays outside of the Company’s control with deployment of our two high-speed Railcar Inspection Portals. Although these systems remain largely ready for deployment, customer delays at the deployment site continue to prevent the Company from entering the installation phase although this is now expected to be mitigated in the last quarter of 2025. In spite of the timing delays that continue to impact the quarterly results, management remains confident in the long-term potential of the RIP® product.

Cost of revenues increased 143% to $12.2 million from $5.0 million in the same period last year. The significant increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to supporting the AMA with New APR, where Duos Energy oversees the deployment and operations of a fleet of mobile gas turbines and related balance-of-plant inventory, providing management, sales, and operational support services to New APR. The cost of revenues on technology systems decreased compared to the equivalent period in 2024. This reduction is primarily driven by our ability in the period to reallocate certain fixed operating and servicing costs for technology systems to support the AMA, an allocation we could not make in the comparative period because the agreement was not yet in effect. It also reflects the ramp-down of manufacturing ahead of field installation of our two high-speed RIP®s, which have continued to temporarily slow project activity and further reduce cost of revenues while we await customer readiness for site deployment.

Gross margin increased 569% to $5.4 million from $800,00 in the same period last year. Gross margin improved primarily due to Duos Energy’s performance of the AMA with New APR. This includes $2,712,375 in revenue recognized during the period, related to the Company's 5% non-voting equity interest in the ultimate parent of New APR, which carried no associated costs and therefore contributed at a 100% margin. These revenues and the associated margin contribution were not present in the prior year period.

Operating expenses increased 34% to $11.7 million from $8.7 million in the same period last year. The Company experienced a significant increase in overall operating expenses compared to the same period in 2024. Sales and marketing costs declined as resources were allocated to costs of service and consulting revenues in support of the AMA with New APR. Additionally, research and development expenses fell by 28% owing to scaled-back testing of prospective technologies. General and administration costs increased 71%, largely due to non-cash stock-based compensation charged for restricted stock granted to the executive team on January 1, 2025, under new employment agreements with a three-year cliff vesting schedule as well as one time compensation costs related to the closing of the AMA and 5% ownership agreements as previously described. Additionally, there were general and administration costs that were allocated to cost of service and consulting revenues in support of the AMA with New APR. Overall, the Company continues to focus on stabilizing operating expenses while meeting the increased needs of our customers.

Net operating loss totaled $6.35 million compared to net operating loss of $7.90 million in the same period last year. The decrease in loss from operations was primarily the result of increased revenues during the period, driven by revenue generated by Duos Energy through the AMA with New APR.

Net loss totaled $6.64 million compared to a net loss of $7.36 million in the same period last year. The 10% decrease in net loss was mostly attributed to the increase in revenues generated by Duos Energy through the AMA with New APR as described above. Net loss per common share was $0.49 and $0.98 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively.

Financial Outlook

At the end of the third quarter, the Company’s contracts in backlog represented approximately $25.8 million in revenue, of which approximately $12.4 million is expected to be recognized in the remainder of calendar 2025 including an estimated $9.5 million of contracted backlog and $3 million in expected near-term awards, renewals and anticipated additional business. The remaining contract backlog consists of multi-year service and software agreements, along with project revenues extending beyond 2025, related to Duos Technologies, Duos Edge AI, and Duos Energy.

Based on these committed contracts and near-term pending orders that are already performing or scheduled to be executed throughout the course of 2025, the Company is reiterating its previously stated revenue expectations for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. The Company expects total revenue for 2025 to range between $28 million and $30 million, representing an increase of 285% to 312% from 2024. Duos expects this improvement in operating results to be reflected over the course of the full year in 2025.

Management Commentary

“I am very pleased with the continuous improvement in Duos’ results this year,” said Chuck Ferry, Duos CEO. “Having embarked on the strategic shift to becoming a data center provider for the rapidly growing market for edge computing, we are well positioned to capture market share for products and services related to this important industry. I also welcome our new senior management and latest addition to our Board to assist in realizing the potential in 2026 and beyond.”

Overview

Solid Group Q3 performance with AMPs +9% and revenue +17% year-over-year reflecting the benefit of Snai and Betnacional acquisitions ("M&A"), combined with excellent organic iGaming growth which offset the impact of customer-friendly sports results

US: Revenue +9% year-over-year led by strong, product-driven iGaming revenue growth of 44% Sportsbook AMP growth accelerated to 5% (Q2: -4%). Sportsbook revenue was -5% year-over-year due to the temporary impacts of sports results, and very high levels of uneconomic generosity from sportsbook competitors at NFL season start, leading to Q3 Adjusted EBITDA of $51m, -12% year-over-year In response, increased FanDuel investment during Q4 has been effective, with year-over-year handle growth +10% Q4 to date, and the NBA season off to a strong start FanDuel Predicts, a new prediction market product which will include sports in states without access to regulated sports betting, to launch in December. Capitalizing on FanDuel's strong brand presence and CME Group's exchange capabilities, with strategic investment to expand the FanDuel customer ecosystem

International: Revenue +21% and adjusted EBITDA of $505m, +10% year-over-year including the benefit of M&A Organic iGaming revenue +10%, with strong SEA iGaming growth offsetting the impact of previously announced regulatory changes in India 3 Organic Sportsbook revenue -6% due to the impacts of a strong European Football Championships ("Euros") and bookmaker friendly results in the prior year

Group Q3 adjusted EBITDA grew 6% and adjusted EBITDA margin declined 130bps, driven by the factors detailed above. This, combined with the benefit of non-controlling interest credits, contributed to adjusted earnings per share +29% to $1.64

Group Q3 net loss of $789m was $675m higher year-over-year due to the non-cash impairment charge of $556m triggered by Indian regulation changes 3 , and the previously communicated $205m payment to Boyd to revise US market access terms 4 ("Boyd payment").

As a result, net loss margin and loss per share were 20.8% and $3.91 respectively Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in Q3 declined by 28% and 78% respectively, due to the Boyd payment

Updated full year 2025 guidance

Q4 has started well on an underlying basis. In the US, FanDuel's increased customer acquisition and retention investment in Q4 is proving effective with continued player momentum and year-over-year handle growth stepping up to 10% quarter to date with the NBA season off to a strong start. Sports results, however, have been customer friendly across the Group with an adjusted EBITDA impact of approximately $170m from October 1, through November 9, 20256.

2025 outlook5 is therefore primarily updated to include the impact of: (i) Q3 performance, (ii) Q4 sports results6, (iii) Q4 sportsbook investment, (iv) FanDuel Predicts investment7, (v) tax costs associated with the Illinois wager fee which we are now treating as taxable, and (vi) Indian regulatory change

Group revenue is now expected to be $16.69bn with adjusted EBITDA of $2.915bn at the midpoint. This reflects a reduction from previous guidance of $570m and $380m in revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations respectively, with updated guidance now representing 19% and 24% year-over-year growth.

Peter Jackson, CEO, commented:

"Flutter delivered a solid third quarter, with continued momentum in both our US and International businesses. We are the clear number one operator in the US, and we will continue to build on that position to drive future profitability. Our strategic investments, including the launch of FanDuel Predicts and recent International acquisitions, position us exceptionally well to capture new opportunities and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Our diversified portfolio and disciplined approach give me great confidence in our ability to lead the industry and increase long-term value for shareholders.”

To our shareholders

Flutter delivered a solid Q3 performance with AMP growth of 9%, revenue increasing 17% and adjusted EBITDA 6% ahead year-over-year. These results reflect the positive impact of our recent Snai and Betnacional acquisitions, as well as excellent organic iGaming growth which helped offset customer-friendly sports results. The Group reported a net loss of $789m for the quarter compared to $114m in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of a non-cash impairment charge relating to regulatory changes in India and the previously communicated $205m payment to Boyd for improved US market access terms.

I am really pleased with the strong positioning of Flutter's core business as we continue to execute in the final quarter of the year. Before sharing more detail on our Q3 performance and outlook, I first want to present how we are strategically positioning FanDuel to capture the emerging prediction markets opportunity. This area has been a source of significant industry discussion over recent months and I am very excited to announce our expansion into the market with the launch of “FanDuel Predicts”, a new FanDuel branded app which we expect to launch in December, through our joint venture with the CME Group.

FanDuel Predicts unlocks an immediate growth opportunity by allowing us to offer a compelling sports product to the vast majority of the US adult population in states that do not currently have access to sports betting. This represents a significant incremental addressable market for FanDuel in addition to our existing sportsbook and iGaming business. We believe this new sports opportunity lies solely in these states, as prediction markets are having a negligible impact in the states where FanDuel sportsbook is already available to customers. FanDuel Predicts will also accelerate acquisition of customers into the FanDuel ecosystem ahead of the state regulation of sports betting. Furthermore, the strength of our world-class pricing and risk management capabilities present potential market-making opportunities which we continue to assess.

We are exceptionally well positioned to harness this growth opportunity. We have a powerful combination of assets enabled through our strategic partnership with CME Group, who have a long track record of operating the world's leading derivatives marketplace, together with FanDuel's nationwide brand presence and sports betting expertise, which has already successfully delivered a position as the clear leader in sports betting. Our extensive experience operating the Betfair Exchange within the Flutter Group also equips us with a deep understanding of this space.

Our launch strategy has been developed in close consultation with state regulators and tribal authorities, resulting in a tailored, state-specific approach that enables us to launch in those states where no local regulation exists. At launch, FanDuel Predicts will offer sports markets in states without a current sports betting regulatory framework. Sports markets will also be restricted to non-tribal lands. This means that a significant proportion of the US population will soon have access to a brand new FanDuel sports product, operating with the same high standards regarding customer protection, know your customer, and anti-money laundering as all our FanDuel products. A range of financial and cultural markets will also be offered across virtually all states. In our existing sportsbook and iGaming states our primary focus will continue to be the state-regulated market and strengthening our leadership position in our core sports betting and iGaming businesses.

The opportunity to extend the FanDuel footprint into new states is significant and our aspiration is to be the clear market leader. Our investment will therefore be meaningful, while maintaining a disciplined approach, a strategy which has served us so well since the inception of sports betting in the US. At this early stage, we anticipate incremental EBITDA cost of $40-$50m in Q4 2025 and $200m-$300m in 2026 with the majority arising in H27. In line with our proven investment strategy on sportsbook to date, we will closely monitor returns with a priority on building value for the future, while also maintaining the flexibility to accelerate investment where performance warrants. We believe this will position FanDuel to deliver future growth and harness the long-term opportunities for our business.

In conclusion, we believe prediction markets present a very significant incremental growth opportunity for FanDuel, and that their evolution will also accelerate the path to state-regulated sports betting and iGaming. In the long-term, we firmly believe that state-regulated sports betting and iGaming remains the most valuable long-term opportunity in the US. The importance of having the best quality sports betting product, combined with the ability to price increasingly complex sports products accurately, cannot be overstated. These are both areas where Flutter and FanDuel excel. As demonstrated by international precedent, long-term success in the US gaming sector will be achieved by those operators with scale positions and the highest quality sports betting product.

US update

Q3 AMP growth in the US was encouraging at 8% year-over-year, with continued strong iGaming AMP growth of 30%, and sportsbook AMP growth of 5% representing an acceleration in year-over-year growth compared to Q2.

FanDuel's revenue performance was underpinned by another very strong iGaming quarter with revenue growth of 44% delivering a GGR market share of 27% in Q3. Player frequency continued to grow with over 500 new slots titles added during the quarter, as access to the proprietary Flutter gaming platform unlocked a faster pace of content delivery. Exclusive content also continued to resonate strongly and drive increased customer engagement, with new Wonka and Samurai titles added in Q3 as well as the latest installment of our Huff and Puff series. Huff 'N Lots of Puff was our most successful game launch to date, setting all-time highs in actives and GGR on launch. Our consistent delivery of innovative and engaging iGaming product features ensures we are well positioned to capitalize on the long-term opportunity. With population penetration still well below our long-term expectations, we believe a very long runway for future growth remains in existing states, before factoring in any future state legalization.

Turning to sportsbook, and while September and October have been impacted by customer-friendly NFL sports results, it is still early in the season. We have complete conviction in our pricing and we remain confident that this short-term variability of outcomes will revert to expected levels over time. Higher levels of parlay and SGP penetration ultimately drive higher structural revenue margin, and we continue to make good progress toward our longer-term 16% structural hold expectation.

The start of the NFL season consistently sees heightened levels of competition in the market and Q3 this year was even more pronounced than in previous years. September was characterized by very high levels of competitor customer generosity, including a range of unsustainable, uneconomic customer offers. These competitive dynamics resulted in lower than anticipated FanDuel NFL handle growth and Same Game Parlay (SGP) penetration in the opening weeks of the season. This impact was transitory in nature, with trends significantly improved by the start of the fourth quarter as FanDuel's disciplined investment approach proved effective. Despite this impact in September, FanDuel's structural advantages ensured we maintained a strong sportsbook market share, with a 47% net gaming revenue (NGR) share of the online sports betting market in September8.

While market competitive intensity has moderated from the NFL season start, it still remains at elevated levels. FanDuel's scale as the #1 operator in the US (Q3 GGR share: 38%, Q3 NGR share: 41%), has subsequently enabled us to take action to strengthen our market leadership. We responded in a strong but disciplined way at the start of Q4, with increased investment in customer acquisition and retention, and we have been very pleased with the momentum that this has driven.

During the quarter we believe the impact from prediction market activity on our business was negligible, as in regulated states customers continue to prefer the richer experience provided by regulated sportsbooks. Based on our analysis, we believe the vast majority of this activity is taking place in states without sportsbook regulation. We therefore do not see sports prediction markets as a meaningful challenge in states where regulated sportsbooks like FanDuel are available.

From a product perspective, the NFL season launch in September was an important milestone for innovation. FanDuel Futures Day showcased a new, first-to-market NFL feature enabling customers to create season long SGPs, driving high levels of parlay engagement. Live betting represents over half of handle, with further enhancements to our live SGP proposition including expanded NFL drive offerings. This helped deliver an NFL parlay penetration increase of 300 bps in the season to date. Our Your Way feature benefited from the addition of SGP+ capabilities and while this currently remains a separate sportsbook experience, the underlying next-generation pricing technology now powers our entire NFL sportsbook pricing and is driving a number of product improvements. This included an increased range of cashout markets helping drive a 20% increase in cashout activity.

We have been really pleased with our NBA performance since the season start in late October. Customer engagement, handle and SGP penetration are all tracking strongly in the early weeks of the season, giving us confidence that growth this season is shaping up to be stronger than last year. We are excited to see what our new strategic NBA partnership with Amazon Prime can unlock including merchandising integrations, product integrations and in-game virtual signage.

Finally, I wanted to share my thoughts on recent concerns around sports integrity. This is hugely important to us and something we take very seriously across the Group. At FanDuel, we use advanced technology and real-time monitoring to identify suspicious activity and work closely with leagues, data monitoring groups, and law enforcement to alert them to any suspicious activity. This highlights the important role the regulated industry plays in assuring the integrity of these great sports. We will continue to work closely with all key stakeholders to ensure that effective frameworks are in place to protect sports integrity, the players and our customers.

International update

The International division delivered 21% year-over-year revenue growth, with the Snai and Betnacional acquisitions contributing 18 percentage points of the increase. Organic growth was impacted by the cessation of real-money gaming in India and a strong prior-year sportsbook performance, which benefited from the Euros and more favorable sports results. iGaming continued to drive organic growth in Q3, with exceptional growth in Turkey and positive momentum in SisaI's Italian online business.

Our focus on the Flutter Edge is delivering innovation across our International business. In Southern Europe and Africa (SEA), we launched MyCombo on Sisal, the only full SGP product available in the Italian market, in time for the start of the Italian soccer season. Customer engagement has been strong with half of customers placing a MyCombo bet during the first seven rounds of the season.

The September integration of Flutter Studios into the SEA Italian online platform has enabled in-house content to be offered to our Italian customers, with a strong pipeline of future content. In July, we migrated PokerStars Italian customers to our SEA platform, a key milestone in the PokerStars transformation which will deliver material savings in 2027 after completion of the final migration from the existing PokerStars technology stack.

The Snai integration has been progressing well; we have enhanced the iGaming proposition, optimized retail gaming machines and commission structures, and increased customer acquisition volumes by deploying Sisal's proven retail signup program. The migration of Snai customers to the SEA online platform remains on track for H1 2026, providing increased confidence in our Snai synergy targets.

In the UK and Ireland (UKI), the successful migration of Sky Bet onto our shared Flutter UKI platform has enabled delivery of new product and improvements for our Sky Bet customers. This included the launch of our highly popular SuperSub offering and the new Squad Bet proposition, powered by our next-generation pricing capability. Continued roll out of premium content has also helped drive positive iGaming momentum.

There has been much speculation around potential gaming tax increases in the upcoming UK budget. We remain engaged with policymakers and expect decisions will be based on economic merit, taking into account the industry's substantial contribution to UK tax revenues and employment. Significant increases to the tax rates would threaten jobs and investment across the UK market, as well as driving more customers to unregulated operators on the black market - where there are no player protections and regulatory oversight. We continue to engage with policymakers and await the outcome in the Budget later this month, however, should taxes increase, Flutter's growing scale and market leading position will help to mitigate the impact, and we would likely benefit from the consolidation of share among sub-scale operators over time.

Brazil is an exciting growth opportunity for Flutter and we retain a strong conviction that scale operators with the best products will win the largest share of the market. This quarter, our expanding portfolio of games and more sophisticated generosity delivered record iGaming revenues. On sportsbook we will continue to integrate Flutter's in-house pricing capabilities and generosity functionality to materially elevate the overall customer proposition ahead of the World Cup next year.

The good progress we are making across the numerous transformation projects both detailed above and in previous quarters, is helping us deliver further scale benefits and positions us to deliver enhanced experiences for our customers. Our cost efficiency drivers go beyond the $300m target we set out our Investor Day last year, with the redesign of our UKI organizational structure a good example of an incremental initiative.

Outside of performance during the quarter, the enactment of the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025 forced Junglee and all other operators to immediately cease real-money operations. We are extremely disappointed with the sudden and unexpected change to the regulatory landscape in India. Flutter has invested significantly in India over the last number of years, responsibly delivering innovative skill-based games to Indian customers. Junglee will now only offer free-to-play gaming content as we assess our medium-term options in that market.

Final thoughts and outlook

As I think

[TITLE]Autonomous EV trucking company Einride going public in SPAC deal valuing it at $1.8 billion:
[TEXT]
The Einride EV freight truck charging station in Lynwood, California, built by Voltera and located close to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

Autonomous EV freight trucking company Einride is planning to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a SPAC deal with Legato Merger Corp. III , a blank check company, valuing it at $1.8 billion.

The deal is expected to raise $219 million in gross proceeds, with up to an additional $100 million in PIPE capital from institutional investors, with Einride to begin trading during the first half of 2026.

In announcing its plans, the Stockholm, Sweden-based company reported a contracted annual recurring revenue base of $65 million and over $800 million in potential long-term ARR.

Founded in 2016, Einride has over 25 customers across seven countries, and regulatory permits in the United States and Europe. Its current fleet of approximately 200 electric vehicles is used by customers including GE Appliances and Swedish online pharmacy company Apotea.

"Today marks a defining moment for Einride and for the future of freight technology," said

Roozbeh Charli, CEO of Einride, in a release. "We've proven the technology, built trust with global customers, and shown that autonomous and electric operations are not just possible, but better. This transaction positions us to accelerate our global expansion and continue to deliver with speed and precision for our customers," said Charli, who took over the CEO post from co-founder and previous CEO Robert Falck last May.

Einride has made the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for three consecutive years, ranking No. 24 in 2025.

Freight trucking in the U.S. and elsewhere, estimated by Einride at a $4.6 trillion market, is both carbon-intensive and inefficient. Einride's technology is designed to reduce emissions at scale and prove electric freight is viable both technologically and economically.

PepsiCo is among the companies that has piloted use of Einride freight solutions, in markets including Germany, and in the U.S., Memphis, Tennessee. Heineken added EV freight routes between the Netherlands and Germany in 2024, and to Austria. Einride also has plans to deploy 300 electric trucks across Europe by 2030 with Mars.

[TITLE]Trump’s tariffs threaten the future of innovation – and UK tech could be collateral damage:
[TEXT]
US president Donald Trump’s 15% baseline tariffs on EU imports may read like a throwback to old-school protectionism, designed to safeguard American jobs and manufacturing. But in today’s globalised and digitally driven economy, the risk isn’t just to steel or car factories, it’s to innovation itself.

The world’s most advanced technologies rely on complex, deeply integrated supply chains. Evidence from 2023 shows that even temporary US tariff shocks disrupted relationships between firms. And these tariffs won’t just hit the EU. They will disrupt the high-value tech ecosystems of partners like the UK – especially firms contributing to artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductor design and cybersecurity.

These industries underpin national resilience, data security and the competitiveness of advanced economies. For the UK, which often positions itself as a global innovation hub post-Brexit, the fallout could be significant.

Take ARM Holdings, the Cambridge-based semiconductor giant whose chip designs power 99% of the world’s smartphones and an increasing share of AI infrastructure.

ARM doesn’t manufacture chips itself. Instead, it licenses its architecture to firms like Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm. That makes it a prime example of the UK’s value in the global innovation chain: high intellectual property (IP), low carbon footprint, huge reach.

ARM’s position as a vital link in the supply chain underlines another point. Trade policy aimed at traditional manufacturing sectors can inadvertently destabilise tech-intensive, IP-led sectors like semiconductors and software. This is echoed in research examining global tariff spillovers on tech competitiveness.

If tariffs are applied to components or design work linked to traded goods that cross EU or UK borders en route to US manufacturers, it introduces a layer of risk and cost to innovative firms and their global partners.

Even if a company’s work isn’t directly taxed, the uncertainty and red tape may make US firms think twice

Adjourns 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders

Urges Shareholders Who Have Not Voted To Get Their Votes In

CINCINNATI, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Workhorse Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: WKHS) (“Workhorse” or “the Company”), an American technology company focused on pioneering the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles, today announced that it has adjourned its 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) until November 25, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to be held virtually at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WKHS2025.

The Company issued the following statement:

In order to give Workhorse shareholders ample time to vote on the 2025 Annual Meeting proposals, we are adjourning the Meeting until November 25, 2025. Although votes received thus far are strongly in favor of each of the nine proposals, quorum has not been reached.

It is crucial that shareholders submit their votes, no matter how many shares they own. By voting FOR the Workhorse – Motiv transaction, as well as the other eight proposals up for a vote, Workhorse shareholders will have the opportunity to participate in the potential upside of a leader in the medium-duty EV commercial vehicle market, with a significant ownership stake in the combined company.

By not voting, shareholders are putting their investment at risk. If shareholders do not vote for all proposals, the transaction with Motiv will not close, and Workhorse will have to continue as an independent company. Help us capture long-term growth opportunities for the combined company and deliver shareholder value creation by voting FOR all of the proposals.

As previously announced, leading independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co. have both recognized the compelling value of our transaction with Motiv and have each recommended that shareholders vote FOR the merger. We urge shareholders to submit their votes as soon as possible in order to realize the benefits of the transaction and protect their long-term investment.

Shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 18, 2025, will be entitled to vote at the meeting. If you have previously voted, there is nothing further you need to do.

Vote today by proxy card, online or by phone.

[TITLE]Workhorse Group Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
CINCINNATI, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Workhorse Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: WKHS) (“Workhorse” or “the Company”), an American technology company focused on pioneering the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Management Commentary

“We continue to make important progress on our product roadmap at Workhorse,” said Company CEO Rick Dauch. “We recently announced the availability of the Utilimaster Aeromaster body for our W56 Class 5/6 step van, designed to enhance the flexibility, durability, efficiency, and safety of the W56 platform. This exciting new offering will enable us to deliver the performance and reliability of our step van in the traditional form factor that fleet operators already know and trust. During the third quarter we completed the sale of 15 trucks, in a combination of both Class 4 and 5 versions.”

Mr. Dauch added: “We are focused on completing our proposed transaction with Motiv to create a leading North American medium-duty electric truck OEM. By building on our complementary strengths, Workhorse and Motiv are positioned to win the medium-duty EV market as the long-term industry trend towards electrification continues. We are confident that this transaction will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to participate in the potential upside of the combined company, with a significant ownership stake.”

Executing Strategic and Financial Actions

Strategic Transaction with Motiv : On August 15, 2025, Workhorse entered into a definitive merger agreement to combine with Motiv Electric Trucks (“Motiv”) in a proposed transaction that will create a leading North American medium-duty electric truck OEM. Workhorse urges shareholders to vote for the merger, as well as the other proposals, before or at the Company’s Annual Meeting on November 12, 2025.

Demonstrating Real-World Performance and Enhancing Flexibility of the W56: Workhorse continues to demonstrate the reliability and performance of its W56 platform with more than 42 vehicles operating in customer and partner fleets across diverse real-world routes. These vehicles delivered 97% uptime in daily last-mile operations.

During the third quarter, Workhorse advanced its product roadmap to broaden W56 application options. This work included the completion of integration, testing and validation efforts for the industry-standard aluminum Aeromaster walk-in body from Utilimaster. The new configuration expands the proven capabilities of the W56 product line.

Conserving Cash and Improving Liquidity: The Company took additional actions to reduce costs and conserve cash during the third quarter, decreasing operating expenses by $1.2 million year-over-year. Comparing year to date nine-month periods, operating expenses decreased $17.5 million in 2025 compared to 2024.

In connection with its proposed transaction with Motiv, Workhorse has benefitted from funding totaling approximately $25 million from Motiv’s controlling investor, including a $20 million sale leaseback transaction and $5 million secured convertible note financing. At closing of the merger, which is expected in the fourth quarter of this year, all remaining indebtedness and other obligations to Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender, including all warrants currently held by the lender, will be repaid and/or cancelled, with the only remaining secured indebtedness of the combined companies being the $5 million secured convertible note held by an affiliate of Motiv’s controlling investor, which may convert to equity in connection with post-closing financing. The transaction with Motiv also includes a condition to closing that entities affiliated with Motiv’s largest investor provide Workhorse with up to $20 million in debt financing at the closing.

Third Quarter Financial Results

Sales, net of returns and allowances, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The decrease in sales of $0.1 million was primarily due to lower sales of approximately $2.3 million related to the sale of fewer trucks in 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, offset by an increase of $2.2 million related to the recognition of seven vehicles from deferred revenue.

Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $10.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively. The increase in cost of sales of $3.5 million was primarily a result of an increase in inventory excess and obsolescence reserve of $3.3 million.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $7.8 and $7.7 million, respectively. The increase in SG&A of $0.1 million was primarily driven by a $3.6 million increase in consulting and legal expenses due to the proposed Motiv merger, offset by a $2.9 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses, a decrease of $0.2 million in marketing and trade show related expenses, and a decrease of $0.3 million in IT-related expenses.

Research and development (“R&D”) expenses for three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $1.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The decrease in R&D expenses of $1.2 million was primarily driven by a $0.3 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses due to lower headcount, a $0.5 million decrease in prototype part expenses and a $0.3 million decrease in consulting and professional services expenses.

Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $0.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The difference was primarily driven by higher financing fees related to the 2024 Notes recognized in the prior year period compared to current period.

As of September 30, 2025, the estimated fair value of the notes held by Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender (the “2024 Notes”) totaled $27.1 million and the estimated fair value of the Convertible Note from Motiv’s controlling investor was $5.1 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender converted $19.0 million in principal into Common Stock, and the Company recorded a $1.4 million fair value net loss on conversion.

As of September 30, 2025, the estimated fair value of the warrants held by Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender (the “2024 Warrants”) totaled $10.0 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company recorded a net fair value loss of $6.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, related to the 2024 Warrants.

During the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized a gain on sale of assets of $13.8 million primarily related to the Sale Leaseback of its Union City, IN Facility.

During the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized a gain of $4.8 million related to deferred revenue upon termination of the Tropos Assembly Services Agreement.

As of September 30, 2025, the Company had $12.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $25.5 million in restricted cash, net accounts receivable of $1.2 million, other receivables of $1.5 million, net inventory of $30.0 million and accounts payable of $11.2 million.

The proposed transaction with Motiv includes a condition to closing that entities affiliated with Motiv’s largest investor provide Workhorse with up to $20 million in debt financing at closing. Approximately $10 million is to be made available after the closing for general corporate purposes pursuant to a revolving credit facility, and $10 million is to be made available after the closing to fund vehicle manufacturing upon the receipt of confirmed purchase orders pursuant to an ABL facility. The terms of this financing have not been finalized.

Third Quarter Financial Overview

“Our proposed transaction with Motiv will provide Workhorse with a simplified capital structure and the near-term liquidity to support our operations through the proposed transaction close,” said Workhorse CFO Bob Ginnan. “We continue to take additional steps to extend our financial runway and efficiently manage our cash flow by reducing operating costs and improving working capital needs. We are confident in our ability to generate additional purchase orders and revenue from our customers while strengthening our financial position, and we look forward to completing the proposed transaction with Motiv.”

[TITLE]Tata Sons' electronics bet crosses $1.3 billion:
[TEXT]
Tata Sons Ltd has ploughed over a billion dollars into its iPhone assembly business since inception, helping it cross watch-and-jewellery brand Titan Ltd in revenue in just four years.

The Tata Group holding company last month invested ₹1,499 crore in Tata Electronics Ltd, its phone assembly and semiconductor venture, bringing its total investment in the business to $1.3 billion. This also makes Tata Electronics the third Tata Sons subsidiary—the others are Air India Ltd and Tata Digital—to receive over $1 billion from its parent in the last four years. Tata Sons' investments in the three businesses now total $11.1 billion, a Mint review of the filings of the three subsidiaries showed.

Tata Sons’ latest annual report said it has invested ₹45,347 crore ($5.1 billion) in Air India, since acquiring the state-owned airline in January 2022. Tata Digital, its e-commerce business comprising BigBasket, Tata 1mg, Croma and Cliq, received nearly $4.7 billion ( ₹42,121 crore) since its inception in March 2019.

New investments in emerging businesses are a key focus for the Tata Group, which channels its investments through the group's holding company.

Tata Sons wants to pursue "manufacturing excellence at scale", chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran wrote to shareholders in the Tata Sons FY25 annual report. Major Tata Sons shareholders include Tata Trusts, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, and various Tata Group companies.

"At Tata Electronics, we are building a vertically integrated ecosystem for technology hardware and semiconductor manufacturing. It is hard, but that is why it matters so deeply to us," Chandrasekaran wrote. “In the capital-intensive world of technology hardware, I am told this is a good start."

Queries emailed to Tata Sons and Tata Electronics went unanswered.

Since beginning in September 2020, Tata Electronics has invested ₹6,961 crore in its iPhone assembly operations. It also spent ₹1,363.52 crore to acquire Wistron Corp’s plant in March last year, and ₹1,650 crore to buy a 60% stake in Pegatron’s India facility. Additionally, ₹50 crore was invested in the semiconductor subsidiary. These amounts total approximately $1.3 billion in investments by Tata Sons in Tata Electronics. The company is India’s single-largest assembler of Apple’s iPhones.

Tata Electronics last year entered chip manufacturing, announcing it will invest over ₹1,18,000 crore ($13 billion) to set up two semiconductor fabrication plants in Gujarat and Assam. The Gujarat plant, at an investment of $11 billion, is in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.

Tata Electronics reported revenue of ₹66,601 crore in FY25, behind Air India, which ended with ₹78,636 crore, and more than twice Tata Digital's ₹32,188 crore, according to Tata Sons’ latest annual report. The electronics business ended with a ₹70 crore loss, much less than the ₹10,859 crore loss from aviation and the ₹4,610 crore loss from e-commerce.

This is no small feat, as Tata Electronics’ ₹66,601 crore revenue surpassed Titan’s ₹60,942 crore, and close to Tata Power Ltd’s ₹66,992 crore. To be sure, Tata Electronics remains a loss-making business, unlike the profitable businesses of Titan and Tata Power. Despite Tata Electronics cutting losses by 92% to ₹69.7 crore ($7.8 million), down from ₹825 crore ($93 million) a year ago, the iPhone assembly margins remain wafer-thin for vendors like Foxconn.

To be sure, production-linked incentives (PLIs) for smartphone assembly expire in March next, and Tata Electronics is yet to spell out its plan to attain profitability. Tata Sons chairman Chandrasekaran also serves on the board of Tata Electronics.

Industry stakeholders, however, are not concerned.

"The smartphone PLI has seen Dixon become a large company in India, while Kaynes and Syrma are now on the path of growth," said Ashok Chandak, president, India Electronics and Semiconductor Association, an industry body. “These success stories have prompted Indian conglomerates to join the field too. Tata has been an early mover, while Larsen & Toubro has set up a dedicated subsidiary for fabless semiconductor engineering. The Murugappa group, too, has ventured into semiconductor testing and assembly—showing the importance of electronics in India's growth over the next decade."

“The primary purpose of the smartphone PLI was to cover for the cost disadvantage that early companies would have had when starting out in India, given that the PLI came when the industry was in its nascent stages. India now has a well-established last-stage assembly ecosystem, and both India and the likes of Apple have gained significantly from it. Now, with component incentives, we're seeing the next tier of value creation that will start to happen, and this will further strengthen the electronics ecosystem," added Ankush Wadhera, managing director and partner, and India leader - semiconductors at Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Tata Electronics employed 65,647 people. This exceeds the 31,749 in aviation and the 39,088 in Tata Digital.

India produced ₹11.3 trillion ($127 billion) worth of electronics goods in FY25, a 19% rise from ₹9.5 trillion ($107 billion) produced in FY24, making the electronics industry one of the fastest-growing sectors, finance ministry data shiwed. Mobile phone exports accounted for

The government has initiated the process of preparing a relief package for Vodafone Idea (Vi) following the Supreme Court’s recent verdict in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) case, reported Times of India. The move aims to address the telecom operator’s massive dues of over ₹83,000 crore, which have long strained its finances.According to top government sources to TOI, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has begun seeking legal advice on possible next steps. Once that is secured, the department plans to direct all field units across the country’s telecom circles to review the original AGR demand notices for potential calculation errors or duplications in billing.Alongside this reassessment, officials are also working on a proposal that could offer direct relief on the company’s interest and penalty liabilities — a measure that had come up during discussions in the apex court as part of efforts to prevent the company from collapsing.A comprehensive package, which may include revised AGR dues and relief on interest and penalties, is expected to be presented to the Union Cabinet in the coming months.Sources said the government wants to fast-track the process, given the urgent need for Vodafone Idea to raise funds and strengthen its operations to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel "We are ambitious and are looking to close the exercise over the next few months. The Department of Legal Affairs is being approached to study the Supreme Court order so that the way forward can be qualified. This is being done on an urgent basis as the company's expansion and competitive needs need to be factored in," one of the officials said.Reassessing the original AGR demand is seen as a crucial step, as any downward revision in the principal amount would automatically reduce the interest, penalty on interest, and interest on penalties. "When completed, this exercise itself may see a reduction in the total AGR demand raised on the company. A reduction in the principal means that the resultant interest and penalties also come down," the official added.Meanwhile, Vodafone Idea reported a narrower consolidated net loss of ₹5,524 crore for the quarter ended September, compared to ₹7,176 crore in the same period last year. The improvement was attributed to lower finance costs on bank debt and a higher average revenue per user (ARPU) driven by tariff hikes, according to the company’s regulatory filing.

[TITLE]Europe Faces Satellite Espionage Threat from Russia and China:

Europe Faces Satellite Espionage Threat from Russia and China

by Sophie Jenkins

London, UK (SPX) Nov 10, 2025

Germany and the United Kingdom have raised alarms regarding the escalating danger posed by Russian and Chinese activity in space, with recent incidents putting focus on the growing threat to Western satellites. Both countries have publicly accused Russia of stalking, jamming, and interfering with their orbital systems, while experts have warned that China's rapid technological advances could wield an equal, if not greater, challenge to European space security.

At a major space industry conference in Berlin in September 2025, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius made headlines when he declared, "Russia's actions, especially in space, pose a fundamental threat to us all - a threat we can no longer ignore." This warning comes against the backdrop of repeated instances where Russian reconnaissance satellites were observed closely shadowing those operated by IntelSat, a prominent provider of satellite services for governments and commercial entities across Europe and the United States.

The targeting of communication satellites carries severe risks for military, government, and civilian infrastructure. Satellite imagery, telecommunications networks, and broadband internet access for essential services rely on secure, uninterrupted satellite links. Disruption of navigation and positioning systems can have downstream consequences, from impeding military operations to affecting civil aviation reliability, as highlighted by global defense think tanks such as RAND.

This wave of warnings arrives amid Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now into its third year. Ukrainian intelligence has further alleged an intensification of Russian-Chinese collaboration, with Beijing reportedly conducting satellite reconnaissance over Ukrainian territory at Moscow's request. In the new era of hybrid warfare, space assets have become prime targets, not only for interception of communications but also for disruption and physical sabotage.

According to Clayton Swope, director of Aerospace Security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the basic detection of foreign satellites in orbit is relatively straightforward for modern space forces. Ground-based radar and space surveillance networks can determine positions and orbital paths. Determining intentions and capabilities, however, remains far more elusive.

Authorities and analysts infer the objectives of Russian satellites based on their proximity to Western satellites, their orbital behaviors, and patterns established by previous similar assets. "If a Russian satellite lingers near a European communications satellite for an extended period, authorities may deduce espionage is underway," Swope explains. Analysts suspect that recent close approaches to IntelSat satellites used by Germany were likely efforts to intercept signals or gather technical intelligence.

Technical methods of interference have evolved. Jamming can be conducted via ground-based infrastructure that transmits high-intensity electromagnetic noise, overwhelming or scrambling satellite signals. Russia has developed and refined its electronic warfare capabilities notably during the conflict in Ukraine, a context that sharpens the stakes for European security planners.

Beyond intelligence collection, there is concern

[TITLE]Your software should be space-grade — take it from an aerospace operations engineer:
[TEXT]
The internet started as a Department of Defense-funded military project in 1969. Today, it’s in the pockets of 100% of smartphone owners and accessed by 68% of the world’s population. Space travel started as a postwar race between the governments of America and the Soviet Union to put people on the Moon in the 1950s-’60s. Today, celebrities and wealthy citizens can purchase tickets to go on space flights.

When it comes to technology that powers high-stakes industries, why not shortcut the arc of innovation and start with space-grade software from takeoff?

I’m speaking as both a mission operations engineer and a founder when I say that the business world and our everyday lives increasingly rely on software platforms to bring order to complexity. As engineers, our job is to figure out the best ways to apply technology and tools to fix complex problems. We’re focused on critical issues playing out in the digital and physical worlds.

It doesn’t get more physical than aerospace, and it doesn’t get more high-stakes than SpaceX. I know. I spent over 10 years as a member of SpaceX’s mission operations team in charge of pioneering innovation in the aerospace industry.

In the early days, we got a directive to push for mission success, then keep pushing towards the next mission, and the next. And building aircraft, satellites, rockets, and other hardware needs software to support getting from idea to launchpad. The problem? The very software that makes missions possible can make an operations engineer’s tasks harder.

As one of the first members of the Dragon spacecraft’s operations team, I saw SpaceX’s leadership grow within the commercial space industry firsthand. The obstacles we had to meet in the control room never got easier, from our first mission in 2010 to the delivery of the first commercial astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2020.

Despite the scale of the problems we solved, we still were challenged by fragmented processes and disconnected workflows — some of which included the very same tools you might find in an everyday office, like multiple PDFs, disparate spreadsheets, and physical checklists. We were able to patch some of these siloed processes and workflows over time, but the difficulty lay at the core: our systems weren’t altogether connected, meaning our solutions would always be limited stopgaps if the larger, structural issue went unaddressed.

This wasn’t a SpaceX-only problem, either. It was an industry-wide, dangerous divide between what the software provides and what the team actually needs.

We can close that gap today. We need more tools made for space by talented software engineers and fewer mechanical engineers building mission-critical software tools. That way, mechanical engineers have the ability to turn their attention to the tasks in front of them: ensuring the world’s most time-critical and high-stakes activities, like managing nuclear energy or launching an aircraft filled with humans into space, can run safely.

I’ve seen firsthand how much professionals in industries like space, aviation, mining, and defense depend on software to keep projects running smoothly. Whether we’re designing a vehicle destined for a faraway planet or coordinating thousands of airline patterns, each step is tracked, tested, and managed through software. And for tasks like these, the margin for error isn’t just thin—it’s nonexistent.

All companies from Fortune 500s to stealth startups remain confined to a life of patching together workflows using spreadsheets, shared folders, and fragmented tools. But in mission-critical industries, “good enough” just isn’t good enough. And in 2025, that’s just

[TITLE]Applied Digital Advances AI Factory Buildout with Second $787.5 Million Draw from Macquarie Asset Management:
[TEXT]
DALLAS, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Digital (the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APLD) a designer, builder, and operator of high-performance, sustainably engineered data centers and colocation services for artificial intelligence, cloud, networking and blockchain workloads announced today it expects to receive additional funding as part of its previously disclosed perpetual preferred equity financing facility of up to $5.0 billion with Macquarie Asset Management.

The anticipated additional draws of an aggregate amount equal to $787.5 million are expected to be completed by the end of the month and will support the continued build-out of Applied Digital’s Polaris Forge 1 and Polaris Forge 2 AI Factory campuses in North Dakota.

Of the anticipated funding, $450 million will be allocated toward completing the build-out of Polaris Forge 2, Applied Digital’s AI Factory campus in Harwood, North Dakota. The Polaris Forge 2 campus has leased 200 MW of critical IT capacity, currently under construction, to a U.S.-Based Investment Grade Hyperscaler, which also holds the first right of refusal for an additional 800 MW of critical IT load at that campus – representing the full 1-gigawatt expansion potential of the site.

Macquarie Asset Management will fund the remaining $337.5 million into Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, North Dakota, subject to the closing of the Company’s previously announced $2.35 billion senior secured notes offering and other customary conditions. The investment will provide additional non-dilutive capital for the 400-MW campus, support platform-level general and administrative expenses, and cover transaction costs.

“This funding underscores the continued execution of our AI infrastructure strategy and the confidence in Applied Digital’s ability to deliver at scale,” said Wes Cummins, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Applied Digital. “With Macquarie Asset Management’s ongoing support and the anticipated completion of our senior secured notes offering, we believe we’re positioned to strengthen our balance sheet, accelerate development, and expand our AI Factory platform. We recently achieved our first Ready-for-Service milestone for our first data hall at Polaris Forge 1, and both Polaris Forge 1 and 2 remain on schedule, reflecting our disciplined execution and commitment to on-time delivery.”

“Applied Digital continues to distinguish itself as a trusted partner to hyperscale customers, with a differentiated portfolio of near-term power availability built by a pioneering leadership team,” said Anton Moldan, Senior Managing Director of Macquarie Asset Management. “We are pleased to deepen our partnership with Applied Digital as it scales its high-performance compute data center platform. Our global experience as an owner and manager of some of the largest private data center portfolios positions us to help Applied Digital become an industry-leading data center platform.”

“With Macquarie Asset Management’s continued support, we believe we are well-positioned to drive meaningful progress across our platform of large-scale AI Factories,” said Saidal Mohmand, Chief Financial Officer of Applied Digital. “These additional investments provide the capital needed to deliver on Polaris Forge 1 and continue advancing Polaris Forge 2, reinforcing the strength of our financing model and execution strategy.”

Up to one-half of the $337.5 million Macquarie Asset Management funding that is allocated to Polaris Forge 1 may be, but need not be, used for the second building on our Polaris Forge 1 campus. Any portion of the Macquarie Asset Management funding not used for that building is expected to be used for our other data center projects and general corporate purposes, and will not be credit support for the proposed senior secured notes. These Macquarie Asset Management fundings are subject to customary conditions, including in the case of the Polaris Forge 1 funding, the closing of the senior secured notes offering on terms reasonably acceptable to Macquarie Asset Management, all of which we expect to be satisfied reasonably promptly.

In addition, on November 10, 2025, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with First National Bank of Omaha, pursuant to which the lender agreed to make one or more revolving loans, and issue letters of credit, from time to time to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $65 million. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance at a rate of SOFR plus 2.75% per annum. The loan is secured by all of the Company’s (but none of its subsidiaries’) assets.
