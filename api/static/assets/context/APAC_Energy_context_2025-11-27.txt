NEW YORK (AP) — Jarring swings keep rocking Wall Street, and U.S. stocks erased a big morning gain to drop on Thursday as the market remains skittish following weeks of doubts and erratic moves.

After initially soaring toward what seemed like its best day since May, with an early surge of 1.9%, the S&P 500 erased all of it and fell 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 386 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite sank 2.2%.

The sharpest losses again hit what used to be the market’s biggest winners. Nvidia, cryptocurrencies and other areas that had soared with nearly relentless momentum, as traders feared missing out on more gains, forced the market lower. Bitcoin dropped below $87,000, down from nearly $125,000 last month.

The market had been shaky coming into Thursday, largely because of twin worries: Nvidia and other superstar stocks caught up in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology may have simply shot too high, and the Federal Reserve may be done delivering the invigorating cuts to interest rates that Wall Street loves.

Nvidia initially appeared to tamp down the worries

Indian stocks opened firmer on Thursday, with the Sensex and Nifty buoyed by a renewed wave of foreign inflows and a broad risk-on mood across Asia after Nvidia’s blowout earnings turbocharged global tech shares.The S&P BSE Sensex advanced 152 points, or 0.18%, at the open to 85,338.29, while the NSE Nifty 50 edged up 28 points, or 0.11%, to 26,081.10.On the 30-stock Sensex, Adani Ports Axis Bank and Tata Motors were among the early leaders, each climbing between 1% and 1.5%.Broader sentiment was firmer as well, with the mid-cap and small-cap gauges adding roughly 0.3% apiece.Across Asia, equities rose more than 1% after Wall Street’s tech-heavy rally overnight, as investors continued to price in Nvidia’s stronger-than-expected earnings.The bullish trend in the market is likely to sustain, aided by positive triggers, said Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, adding that "at the fundamental level, the picture of ‘strong macros but weak micros’ at the beginning of the year is changing to ‘strong macros and improving micros’. This fundamental support is aided by the change in perception towards India by leading global banks, who now consider India fairly valued and buyable in the context of a resilient economy and improving corporate earnings."The weakening AI trade is another positive for India, which can be regarded as an anti-AI trade, Vijayakumar said, adding that "FIIs turning buyers in the cash market yesterday is a reflection of this changing perception towards India. In the market, this is likely to manifest in preference for and outperformance of large caps, particularly over small caps whose valuations are hard to justify even after the correction. Bank Nifty, despite the recent run-up, has more room to rally since fundamentals and valuations are supportive."On the institutional front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) purchased equities worth roughly Rs 1,581 crore on November 19, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) were net buyers to the tune of Rs 1,360 crore.Asian equities staged a relief rally on Thursday after Nvidia’s blockbuster results reignited enthusiasm for the AI trade, even as the dollar firmed ahead of delayed U.S. jobs data.Tech-heavy markets led the charge. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped as much as 4.2%, South Korea’s benchmark gained 3.3% and Taiwan rose 3.4%, driven by strong demand signals from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who highlighted surging orders from major cloud providers.Chipmakers were among the biggest movers: TSMC climbed 4.3%, Samsung Electronics rose 5.1%, SK Hynix advanced 4.5%, and Tokyo Electron gained 5.4%. MSCI’s Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index added 1.2%, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were up 1.3%.Not all regional markets joined the rally. Chinese stocks lagged, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipping 0.1% and mainland benchmarks giving up early gains to trade flat.Cryptocurrencies steadied, with bitcoin and ether up
