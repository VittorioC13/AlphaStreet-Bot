WEST CHESTER, Pa., Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Verrica”) (Nasdaq: VRCA), a dermatology therapeutics company developing and selling medications for skin diseases requiring medical interventions, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

“In the third quarter, Verrica achieved multiple commercial, corporate, scientific and regulatory milestones providing a strong foundation for future growth in YCANTH as well as significant upside potential from our late-stage clinical pipeline,” said Jayson Rieger, PhD, MBA, President and Chief Executive Officer of Verrica. “Throughout the past year, while growing adoption of YCANTH for molluscum, we have also significantly advanced our late-stage clinical programs in two of the highest unmet needs in dermatology.”

Dr. Rieger continued, “For the nine months ending September 30, 2025, we dispensed 37,642 applicator units compared to 17,119 units in the prior year, representing a 120% increase. I commend our team for more than doubling dispensed units of YCANTH over this period while reducing operating expenses by nearly half. We also made three significant advances in our development pipeline over this same period. First, we have begun our global Phase 3 clinical program of YCANTH (VP-102) in common warts with our Japanese development partner, Torii Pharmaceutical, with targeted first patient enrolled in the United States this year. Verrica also helped support Torii in obtaining the approval of YCANTH for molluscum in Japan in September.
