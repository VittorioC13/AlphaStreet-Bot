[TITLE]New NUPRC Chief Executive vows oil production growth:
[TEXT]
The newly appointed Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Mrs Oritsemeyiwa Eyesan, has assumed office, pledging to reposition Nigeria’s upstream oil and gas sector, boost investments, and raise oil and gas production in line with the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.

Eyesan formally assumed office on Tuesday, December 23, 2025, following a handover from the immediate past Chief Executive, Gbenga Komolafe, who resigned last week. Her appointment followed President Bola Tinubu’s nomination and the approval of the National Assembly.

According to a statement on Wednesday by the Head, Media and Strategic Communications of the NUPRC, Eniola Akinkuotu, the new chief executive outlined her vision during her first town hall meeting with management and staff of the Commission.

At the meeting, Eyesan said her priority was to make the NUPRC a business enabler and reignite investments in the upstream sector, stressing that effective regulation must support growth, investment and value creation.

“The goal is that we must enable the industry; we are regulators. We must enable the industry from our interactions with the stakeholders, from our interactions with everybody. My main objective is to ensure that we make a difference. I believe the NUPRC is at the centre of the industry,” she said.

She also set a firm ambition to grow Nigeria’s crude oil output and significantly increase gas production, aligning with government policy objectives in the upstream sector.

With over three decades of experience in the oil and gas industry, Eyesan promised to entrench digitisation, transparency and operational efficiency at the Commission, describing them as critical to restoring investor confidence.

She assured staff that, with their support and cooperation, the NUPRC would become a gold-standard regulator in Africa. She further pledged to prioritise capacity development, deepen technical competence and sustain engagement with stakeholders, labour unions and professional teams.

On her leadership style, Eyesan promised an open-door policy and frequent engagement with staff as the industry enters a new phase of transformation.

“If we work together, we can unleash opportunities; I don’t see impediments, only opportunities,” she added.

[TITLE]New NUPRC boss pledges to boost oil and gas investments:
[TEXT]
The newly appointed Commission Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Oritsemeyiwa Eyesan, has assumed office with a pledge to reposition Nigeria’s upstream oil and gas sector, boost investments and drive higher oil and gas production in line with the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.

Eyesan made this known during her first town hall meeting with the management and staff of the Commission, according to a statement signed by the Head, Media and Strategic Communications, Eniola Akinkuotu, on Wednesday.

She formally assumed office on Tuesday, December 23, 2025, following a handover ceremony from the immediate past Commission Chief Executive, Gbenga Komolafe.

Recall that last week, President Bola Tinubu sought and secured the approval of the National Assembly for the nomination of the former NNPCL staff as the new chief executives of the NUPRC after the sudden resignation of the former CCE.

At the meeting, the NUPRC boss outlined her vision to make the Commission a business enabler, stressing that effective regulation must support growth, investment and value creation across the upstream industry.

She further disclosed plans to make the Commission a business enabler and reignite investments in the upstream sector.

Eyesan also set a firm ambition to grow Nigeria’s crude oil output while significantly increasing gas production, in line with the Federal Government’s drive to monetise gas as a transition fuel and strengthen energy security.

With over three decades of experience in the oil and gas industry, the new Commission Chief Executive promised to entrench digitisation, transparency and operational efficiency at the NUPRC, describing these as critical to restoring investor confidence and improving regulatory outcomes.

She assured staff that, with collective effort, the Commission would emerge as a gold-standard regulator not only in Nigeria but across Africa.

Eyesan further pledged to prioritise capacity development, deepen technical competence within the Commission and sustain robust engagement with industry stakeholders, labour unions and professional bodies.

The CCE said, “The goal is that we must enable the industry, we are regulators. We must enable the industry through our interactions with the stakeholders, from our interactions with everybody.

“My main objective is to ensure that we make a difference. I believe the NUPRC is at the Center of the industry.”

On her leadership approach, she promised an open-door policy and regular engagement with staff, while calling for cooperation and shared commitment as the industry enters what she described as a new phase of transformation.

“If we work together, we can unleash opportunities. I don’t see impediments, only opportunities,” she said.

The NUPRC, established under the PIA 2021, is responsible for regulating Nigeria’s upstream petroleum operations, a role seen as pivotal to reversing years of declining investment, addressing production challenges and unlocking the country’s vast oil and gas potential.

Eyesan, a graduate of Economics from the University of Benin, spent nearly 33 years with the NNPC and its subsidiaries. She retired as Executive Vice President, Upstream (2023–2024), and previously served as Group General Manager, Corporate Planning and Strategy at NNPC from 2019 to 2023.

[TITLE]Russia Bombards Kyiv as Zelenskyy Warns of Christmas Strikes:
[TEXT]
Russia carried out a series of overnight air attacks on Kyiv and key energy infrastructure targets as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned Ukrainians to prepare for the possibility of Christmas Day strikes.

Ukrainian air defense officials said Russian troops were carrying out a combined attack using cruise missiles and strike drones on December 23, with a large-scale air raid alert declared across the country.

Zelenskyy stated that Russia launched over 650 drones and more than 30 missiles in the overnight attack on Ukraine.

"An attack carried out essentially in the midst of negotiations aimed at ending this war. Putin still cannot accept that he must stop killing. And that means that the world is not putting enough pressure on Russia," he added.

Zelenskyy warned that Russia was likely to intensify attacks over the holiday period. Ukraine now officially marks Christmas on December 25, aligning with Western traditions, though many Orthodox Christians continue to observe it on January 7, as in Russia.

"We understand that precisely on these days they may – this is in their nature – carry out massive strikes on Christmas," Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X.

As a result of the attack on Kyiv, a five-story building was damaged, with four people were injured, including a teenage girl who was hospitalized, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko.

One person was killed and three others, including a child, were injured as a result of Russian attacks on the Kyiv region, the Ukraine Emergency Service reported on December 23.

According to local authorities, a person was killed in the western Ukrainian region of Khmelnytsky, while a child was killed and five others were injured in the northwestern Zhytomyr region as a result of Russian attacks.

"Air defense units are countering the aerial threat over the capital," Kyiv's military administration said. It urged residents to remain in shelters until the all-clear was issued.

Russia's Defense Ministry issued a statement on December 23, confirming the launch of a "massive strike" on Ukraine using the Kinzhal hypersonic missiles and long-range strike drones "against enterprises of Ukraine's military-industrial complex and energy facilities that support their operations."

Overnight, Russian forces conducted another drone attack on Ukraine's northern Sumy region, hitting civilian infrastructure and causing power outages, according to regional authorities.

Separately, authorities in the Black Sea port of Odesa reported a second drone attack in less than 24 hours late on December 22, damaging port infrastructure and a civilian vessel.

"Russia is attacking our energy infrastructure again," the Ukrainian Energy Ministry said.

"As a result, emergency power cuts have been introduced in several regions of Ukraine."

Romania's Defense Ministry reported that Russian drones attacked Ukrainian ports near the Romanian border overnight, triggering alerts in the municipalities of Tulcea and Galati.

However, the ministry stated that there were no airspace violations.

No Breakthrough In Talks, Says Russia

In his December 23 statement, Zelenskyy said his negotiating team had delivered a detailed report on their meetings with the American team.

"They worked productively with envoys of President Trump, and several draft documents have now been prepared," he said.

"In particular, these include documents on security guarantees for Ukraine, on recovery, and on a basic framework for ending this war," Zelenskyy added.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that the Russia–US talks in Miami were not a breakthrough but part of a working process.

He noted that the goal was to hear the American position after talks with Europeans and Ukrainians, and to see how it aligns with the spirit of the Anchorage meeting, referring to the August summit between US and Russian leaders in Alaska.

Zelenskyy On Ukraine's Security Guarantees

In a post on X, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine's security guarantees should include several pillars: "The Armed Forces of Ukraine – an army of 800,000 – which requires funding," "membership in the European Union" for economic and military security, and a Coalition of the Willing of 30 countries to ensure security "in the air, on land, and at sea."

Additionally, legally binding US security guarantees approved by Congress would include long-term commitments and a deterrence package defining how Ukraine's army is equipped and supported.

Meanwhile, the European Commission announced it had disbursed an additional €2.3 billion ($2.7 billion) in financial assistance to Ukraine "to support the country's finances and public administration."

The commission said this is the sixth regular payment under the Ukraine Facility, the bloc's key instrument for supporting Ukraine's recovery, reforms and path towards EU membership.

"Ukraine is delivering real reforms at remarkable speed despite Russia's aggression. Through the Ukraine Facility, the EU is driving reforms that bring Ukraine closer to the EU while supporting critical needs, including winter energy security," European Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos said, according to a statement released by the commission.

Meanwhile, in Russia, an overnight Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an industrial facility in the southern Stavropol region, local authorities said on December 23.

In Russia's Krasnodar region, the fire resulting from the drone attacks on the fuel oil supply pipeline at the Black Sea port of Taman has been completely extinguished, the regional authorities reported.

Ukraine has regularly hit the Krasnodar region, targeting energy assets that Kyiv says fund and fuel the Kremlin's war effort.

[TITLE]New England unions push back against Trump admin’s move to freeze offshore wind projects:
[TEXT]
Worker unions and politicians in New England are pushing back against the Trump administration’s move to implement a 90-day freeze on five industrial-sized offshore wind projects off the East Coast, including the Vineyard Wind 1 windfarm off of Nantucket.

Ironworkers Local 7, which represents over 3,600 workers across New England, including a total of 50 who were contracted to work on the affected offshore wind projects, has called on the administration to reverse its decision.

“We are thoroughly disgusted and furious that this administration has chosen to put hard-working tradespeople out of work just before the holidays and put the prosperity of middle class union members in peril. The Trump administration’s cancellation of several New England offshore wind projects is destroying American jobs. Fifty union ironworkers have been laid off and their families are now facing an uncertain future,” the union said in a written statement.

“Whatever your political ideology, it is undeniable that Vineyard Wind is already providing much needed power to 400,000 homes and businesses across Massachusetts. We need energy diversification to lower bills for working Americans and Vineyard Wind is a shining example of a project that is working,” the union added.

But according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, just one natural gas pipeline would produce substantially more power than the five offshore wind projects combined.

“This is the most expensive form of energy we’re producing is offshore wind. It’s not reliable, it only works when the wind is blowing, it is expensive, and of course, it depends on foreign suppliers almost completely for this industry,” Burgum explained Monday during an interview on Fox News. “And we have a solution in New England, right there, which is natural gas from Pennsylvania, which would generate power five-to-ten times more than all these five wind projects together.”

Burgum’s comments come just a week after Gov. Maura Healey again changed her stance on if she’s responsible for stopping two natural gas pipelines from coming to Massachusetts when she was attorney general. It’s a topic that has turned into a game of political football between Healey and her three Republican challengers in 2026, with the governor now acknowledging she stopped the pipeline projects.

“They were a lousy deal for ratepayers and I’ve got to stand up for people in Massachusetts. I thought it was wrong for ratepayers, people, residents, taxpayers in Massachusetts to foot the bill for those pipelines, instead of the pipeline companies,” Healey said.

Healey is now joining other Northeast governors reacting to the decision to pause the wind farm projects.

On Tuesday, Healey, Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issued a joint-statement against the Trump admin’s move, saying it will result in higher costs for American ratepayers.

“The Trump administration’s announcement yesterday pausing offshore wind leases is its latest egregious attack on clean energy and it lands like a lump of dirty coal for the holiday season for American workers, consumers, and investors. Pausing active leases, especially for completed and nearly completed projects, defies logic, will hurt our bid for energy independence, will drive up costs for America ratepayers, and will make us lose thousands of good-paying jobs. It also threatens grid reliability that is needed to keep the lights on,” the group of governors said.

“This baseless, reckless and erratic action from the Department of Interior will also inject further uncertainty into the markets, making it harder for states and private companies to secure financing for public works projects if investors know they can be stopped at any time despite having gone through all the necessary local and federal approval processes,” they said.

The Trump admin says the temporary pause on the projects are due to national security concerns and will allow the Interior Department, which oversees the projects, the necessary time it needs to work with the Defense Department on mitigating security risks.

No specific national security risks have been mentioned by the administration. However, the Interior Department has said unclassified documents show the spinning of the massive turbine blades paired with the reflection from the towers causes issues with radar systems, according to the Associated Press.

“Modern warfare is drone warfare and the radar interference caused by these massive, gargantuan projects, understanding that a single one of these towers can be one-and-a-half times taller than the Washington Monument. The blades themselves, the diameter of the blades is bigger than the Statue of Liberty, two-and-a-half football fields,” Secretary Burgum also said during his Monday interview on Fox News.

“These things are moving at 150 miles-per-hour and our ground-based radar is designed to pick up movement. If you wanted to attack a population center on the East Coast of our country, you would send a swarm of drones right through one of these wind farms,” he said.

U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey are demanding access to the classified documents and reports cited by the Trump admin. In a letter Tuesday to Burgum and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, the senators demanded they respond by the end of the week to set up a date and time when “we can view these documents.”

“These purported lease pauses will have the effect of putting Americans out of work, destabilizing our energy grid, and causing electricity prices to soar during the expensive home heating season. According to our regional grid operator, Independent System Operator-New England (ISO-NE), ‘canceling or delaying these projects will increase costs and risks to reliability in our region,’ ” Warren and Markey said.

The Vineyard Wind project had been using the Port of New Bedford as a wind turbine manufacturing hub, offering a close and direct route to the Vineyard Sound for installation, employing hundreds of workers in the area. Mayor Jon Mitchell sounded off Tuesday on the impact the decision will have on his city.

“People can debate whether offshore wind is a cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change. But my concerns are primarily parochial. There is literally hundreds of millions of dollars of new port investment here that wouldn’t have happened if offshore wind hadn’t been in the offing,” Mitchell said on local radio outlet WBSM.

“And so when the president, in a swipe of a pen, says, stop the project, it kicks people off the job three days before Christmas, and says it’s about national security, even though the national security implications of that development have been vetted decisively over the last 15 years, to me it’s a shame,” he said.

The Vineyard Wind project is located 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket and claims it could power 400,000 homes and businesses while reducing carbon emissions by over 1.6 million tons per year.

[TITLE]RIA Referral Marketing Strategies For Wealth Management Growth:
[TEXT]
RIA referral marketing strategies encompass systematic approaches that registered investment advisors use to build sustainable client acquisition channels through strategic partnerships, client advocacy programs, and professional networks. These strategies differ significantly from traditional financial marketing because they rely on trust-based relationships and compliance-heavy referral arrangements rather than broad advertising campaigns.

Key Summary: RIA referral marketing leverages professional networks, client relationships, and strategic partnerships to generate qualified leads while maintaining compliance with SEC and state regulatory requirements governing referral arrangements.

Key Takeaways:

RIA referral programs must comply with SEC Marketing Rule requirements and state regulations governing referral arrangements

Client referral programs typically generate the highest-quality leads with conversion rates 3-5x higher than cold outreach

Professional referral networks with CPAs, attorneys, and other advisors require formal agreements and disclosure protocols

Digital referral tracking systems help RIAs measure ROI while maintaining compliance documentation

Successful referral strategies focus on relationship building rather than transactional exchanges

Center of influence (COI) programs create sustainable referral pipelines through strategic professional partnerships

Geographic and demographic targeting improves referral quality and reduces client acquisition costs

What Are RIA Referral Marketing Strategies?

RIA referral marketing strategies are structured approaches that registered investment advisors use to generate new client relationships through existing connections, professional networks, and satisfied clients. These strategies operate within the broader context of wealth management digital marketing, providing a relationship-based alternative to traditional advertising methods.

Unlike general marketing approaches, RIA referral strategies must navigate complex regulatory requirements while building authentic relationships that generate sustainable business growth. The most effective programs combine systematic processes with genuine relationship building to create predictable referral pipelines.

Registered Investment Advisor (RIA): A financial advisor or firm registered with the SEC or state securities regulators, subject to fiduciary duties and specific marketing regulations under the Investment Advisers Act. Learn more from the SEC

The foundation of successful RIA referral marketing lies in understanding that affluent investors typically prefer advisor recommendations from trusted sources rather than responding to advertising. Research indicates that over 70% of high-net-worth individuals select financial advisors through referrals from existing clients or professional connections.

Why Do RIAs Need Specialized Referral Strategies?

RIAs require specialized referral approaches because their target market of affluent investors exhibits distinct decision-making patterns compared to mass market consumers. High-net-worth individuals prioritize trust, credentials, and peer validation when selecting financial advisors, making referral-based marketing significantly more effective than traditional advertising.

The regulatory environment also shapes referral strategy requirements. SEC Marketing Rule amendments effective since 2021 impose specific documentation and disclosure requirements for referral arrangements, making informal referral programs potentially problematic without proper compliance frameworks.

Additionally, RIAs typically operate with limited marketing budgets compared to wirehouses or large broker-dealers, requiring more efficient client acquisition methods. Referral programs offer superior return on investment because they target pre-qualified prospects who already demonstrate intent to work with financial advisors.

Regulatory compliance requirements for referral arrangements

Higher client lifetime value justifying relationship-based acquisition

Limited marketing budgets requiring efficient acquisition channels

Target market preference for peer recommendations over advertising

Need for sustainable, scalable growth without large advertising spends

How Do Client Referral Programs Work?

Client referral programs systematically encourage existing clients to introduce qualified prospects to their RIA through structured processes that reward referral activity while maintaining regulatory compliance. These programs typically generate the highest-quality leads because referred prospects already understand the advisor's value through trusted intermediaries.

Successful client referral programs operate through clear processes rather than informal requests. RIAs establish specific criteria for ideal referral prospects, create simple referral mechanisms for clients, and implement follow-up systems that keep referrers informed

[TITLE]CATL Battery Factory in Spain, Lithium Mine in Yichun:
[TEXT]
CATL is the largest EV battery producer in the world. It continues to progress, with the latest news being a factory under construction in Spain and restarting of a lithium mine in China.

CATL + Stellantis Battery Factory in Spain

The US and Japan led on electric vehicles for a little while, and then Europe did, but in recent years, it’s 100% clear China is the king of the EV world. Europe and the US have even put up big barriers to Chinese electric vehicles and EV suppliers in order to try to protect their aging, legacy, fossil-fueled industries. Europe is at least letting Chinese company build factories within its borders, though. And that brings us to Spain.

CATL is now building an EV battery factory along with European OEM Stellantis in Zaragoza, Spain. A groundbreaking ceremony took place one month ago. “This event marks the start of construction of one of Europe’s most advanced facilities, designed to operate as a carbon-neutral plant with a capacity of up to 50 GWh,” CATL announced at the time.

“During the ceremony, a time capsule was sealed to remain closed until 2045, containing objects and testimonies that reflect the vision and spirit of collaboration driving this project.” Interesting, and fun. But will Stellantis and CATL both survive into 2045? One of them probably will. As for the other… we’ll see. (The time capsule ceremony is pictured above.)

“The gigafactory will play a key role in the transition toward affordable and sustainable electric mobility, supporting Stellantis’ strategic plan and CATL’s global vision. The project incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as Cell-to-Body design, enabling cells to be integrated directly into the vehicle structure, improving efficiency and safety.”

The factory is also being 80% powered by renewable energy, and uses Industry 4.0 standards for sustainable, intelligent processes.

The project will create 4,000 direct jobs as well as thousands of indirect jobs according to the companies, and requires €4.1 billion of investment.

“This project will strengthen the European battery value chain, foster collaboration with local universities and training centers, and attract strategic suppliers, consolidating the region as a hub of innovation and competitiveness in electric mobility,” CATL adds.

CATL To Restart Lithium Mine

CATL’s Jianxiawo lithium mine was made to pause operations in August due to mining permit issues. The company is now expected to restart the mine in February after the Chinese New Year.

This is a key lithium mine for the EV battery giant, so shutting it down led to a surge in lithium carbonate prices.

“Late last month, Bloomberg reported that CATL had developed preliminary plans to restart the Jianxiawo mine by early December,” CnEVPost reports. “On December 19, Yichun released the first environmental impact assessment information disclosure for the project, the Jiemian report noted. […] Lithium carbonate and iron phosphate are the primary raw materials for lithium iron phosphate (LFP). Yichun, located in Jiangxi province, is a lithium production hub often referred to as the ‘Lithium Capital of Asia.’ Over recent months, lithium prices have rebounded, gradually impacting battery costs.”

So, we will see what happens, but hopefully this is a positive sign for lithium prices and battery prices in 2026.

[TITLE]Two-way electric vehicle charging at scale could stop renewable energy being wasted – here’s how it works:
[TEXT]
The amount of renewable energy produced around the world is increasingly exceeding demand – particularly from wind and solar sources. This presents a significant challenge when limited grid capacity and insufficient energy storage mean this clean power has to be curtailed, wasting the excess generation. The scale of this problem is substantial.

In the UK, for example, wind farms were forced to curtail 4.3 terawatt (trillion watt) hours of surplus energy –

[TITLE]Tesla signs massive 1 GWh Megapack project in the UK with Matrix Renewables:
[TEXT]
Tesla Energy has secured another massive Megapack project in the UK. Matrix Renewables announced today that it has signed a full EPC agreement with Tesla for a 500 MW / 1 GWh battery energy storage system in Scotland.

The UK has been one of Tesla’s strongest markets for energy storage. We have frequently reported on the company deploying large-scale Megapack projects in the region, including the Pillswood project, which was previously one of Europe’s largest.

Now, a new project is set to dwarf many existing installations.

Matrix Renewables, a global renewable energy platform, confirmed the deal in a

[TITLE]Sweden's Vattenfall Seeks State Funding for New Nuclear Reactors:
[TEXT]
Sweden’s power giant Vattenfall announced on Tuesday it is applying for state aid for an investment in small modular reactors (SMRs) as part of a plan by industrial giants to bet on new nuclear power in the country.

Last month Sweden’s biggest industrial firms signed an agreement with Vattenfall to become shareholders in the power giant’s new company, Videberg Kraft AB, which plans to build SMRs in the country.

One of Europe’s top electric utilities, Vattenfall, created Videberg Kraft AB in April this year as a separate entity to be able to apply for government support.

Now the company and the industry organization, Industrikraft, plan joint investment and collaboration enabling the development of new nuclear power in Sweden.

Industrikraft, whose members include Volvo Group, Saab, Alfa Laval, and Hitachi Energy, will become a shareholder in Videberg Kraft with a 20-percent stake.

The government has previously announced that the state also intends to become a shareholder in the new company.

The Swedish government moved to phase out nuclear power completely in 1980, but that decision was reversed by Parliament in 2010. Five years later, four aging reactors were shut down. Six of 12 reactors remain in operation in Sweden today.

The country is now betting on SMRs to expand its nuclear fleet as Stockholm seeks to further reduce emissions with low-carbon 24/7 energy.

Sweden has tweaked its renewable energy policy, which had called for 100% renewable electricity by 2040, changing the terminology to “100% fossil-free” electricity, paving the way for the construction of more nuclear power plants.

Now Videberg Kraft’s CEO Desirée Comstedt has submitted an application for financing and risk-sharing to the Swedish Government.

When an agreement between the state and Videberg Kraft has been reached, the government may initiate a formal state aid process with the European Commission, Vattenfall said.

Videberg Kraft is planning a project with either five BWRX-300 reactors from GE Vernova Hitachi or three reactors from Rolls-Royce SMR, which will provide a total nuclear power output of about 1,500 MW. There is currently an intensive evaluation process of the two remaining suppliers, and a decision on the final supplier is planned for 2026.

[TITLE]Abia enacts new electricity law, unveils regulatory agency:
[TEXT]
The Abia State Government has enacted the Abia State Electricity Law, 2025, and established the Abia State Electricity Regulatory Authority to oversee electricity market activities within the state.

The new law, enacted pursuant to powers granted to states under the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and the Electricity Act, 2023, empowers Abia to independently regulate electricity generation, transmission, distribution and trading within its territory.

Addressing journalists on Wednesday, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ASERA, Mr Emeka Onyegbule, said the authority had formally taken over regulatory oversight of the state’s electricity market following the issuance of a final transfer order by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission.

Onyegbule said the ASERA board was inaugurated on April 30, 2025, in line with the provisions of the new law.

Onyegbule said, “The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, NERC, in the exercise of the powers conferred under the Electricity Act 2023, issued an interim Transfer Order no: NERC/2025/058 dated the 24th day of June 2025; formally transferring regulatory oversight of the Electricity Market in Abia State from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to the ASERA.

“The Interim Order elapsed after a six-month transition period, paving the way for the Final Transfer Order from the Commission that completely put the regulatory oversight of the state market under ASERA.”

He said the transition culminated in the issuance of a final transfer of regulatory authority order by NERC on December 24, 2025.

“With this transfer, all activities within the electricity value-chain, including generation, transmission, distribution and trading, fall under the direct oversight and regulation of the Authority effective from the date of the Transfer Order,” he said.

He assured licensees and stakeholders that ASERA would operate a fair, objective and transparent regulatory regime, guided strictly by the provisions of the law and its regulatory instruments.

Onyegbule said the authority would ensure compliance with licence terms and contractual obligations, while protecting consumer interests and promoting quality service delivery.

“We will ensure that stakeholders discharge contractual obligations to one another while upholding the terms of their licenses, and customers’ voices will be heard and respected, while we will focus on quality service delivery,” he stated.

Also speaking, the Commissioner for Information, Prince Okey Kanu, said the enactment of the electricity law paved the way for the establishment of ASERA as an independent regulator of the Abia electricity market.

Kanu noted that the transfer of regulatory powers from NERC to ASERA was in line with the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2023, which allows states to regulate their electricity markets.

The Commissioner for Public Utilities, Mr Ikechukwu Uwanna, said the process began on March 17, following the enactment of the electricity law, describing it as a step towards building a world-class electricity market in the state.

Uwanna said the new regulatory framework would encourage investment, protect consumers and improve efficiency in electricity service delivery across Abia State.

[TITLE]Trump Just Sent This Lesser-Known Stock Plunging. Should You Buy the Dip?:
[TEXT]
Orsted ADR (DNNGY) stands as a global leader in renewable energy, specializing in offshore and onshore wind farms, solar power, energy storage, green hydrogen, and bioenergy solutions. The company drives the energy transition by developing large-scale projects that deliver clean power to millions, with a focus on cost-competitive offshore wind and innovative storage technologies to stabilize grids and support electrification.

Founded in 1973, it is headquartered in Fredericia, Denmark, with operations across Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific.

Orsted’s Stock Performance

Orsted ADR trades just above its 52‑week low of about $5.75 and far below the $33 high, reflecting a deep de-rating after capital raises and guidance cuts. Over the past five days, the stock has declined by roughly 12.8%, approximately 4.63% lower over the last month, and is down nearly 51.38% over the last three months, resulting in a year-to-date (YTD) loss of close to 59% and a decline of over 12 months.

By contrast, European utilities benchmarks have been roughly flat to modestly positive over the same 1‑year period, meaning Orsted has sharply underperformed its sector peers amid project delays, dilutive equity issuance, and weaker EBITDA guidance.

Orsted Results

Orsted ADR reported Q3 2025 EBITDA of DKK 3.1 billion, down DKK 6.5 billion from Q3 2024 as exceptional partnership and trading gains did not repeat. The quarter swung to a net loss of DKK 1.7 billion (around USD $260 million), versus a net profit of DKK 5.2 billion a year earlier, coming in weaker than analyst expectations that had anticipated a small profit or near‑breakeven result.

Underlying operating trends were mixed. Offshore EBITDA fell on lower wind speeds, step‑downs in subsidies at older projects, and the absence of last year’s unusually strong power trading, partly offset by ramp‑up at Gode Wind 3 and grid‑delay compensation at Borkum Riffgrund 3. Onshore EBITDA declined modestly to about DKK 0.8 billion, while Bioenergy & Other turned negative.

For the first nine months, EBITDA (ex-partnerships and cancellation fees) was DKK 17.0 billion, roughly in line with the prior year, but impairments and higher capital employed pushed reported ROCE down to 2.0% (10.2% on an adjusted basis). Operating cash flow for Q3 was negative DKK 1.2 billion, with 9M operating cash flow of DKK 6.7 billion versus DKK 8.1 billion in 2024.

Despite the weak quarter, Orsted reaffirmed full‑year 2025 EBITDA guidance of DKK 24–27 billion, excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees, citing solid nine‑month performance and typically stronger wind conditions in Q4. The company also maintained its 2025 gross investment guidance of DKK 50–54 billion and highlighted progress on its 8.1 GW offshore construction pipeline and capital-structure strengthening via a large rights issue and the planned 50% farm-down of Hornsea 3.

Orsted Stock Slides

Orsted shares plunged 13% in late trading after the U.S. Department of the Interior suspended leases for five offshore wind projects already under construction. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum cited national security concerns as the reason for the pause, impacting key U.S. developments in the Danish renewable giant's portfolio. Ørsted shares closed down 12.7% amid the news.

Should You Buy DNNGY?

Orsted offers compelling long-term value for renewable believers, trading near 52-week lows despite reaffirmed 2025 EBITDA guidance. Recent U.S. project pauses add near-term risk, but Europe's offshore wind pipeline remains robust, reflecting upside and providing investors an opportunity to buy the dip.

[TITLE]Michigan Regulators Approve State’s First Hyperscale Data Center:
[TEXT]
Despite criticism that they were acting too fast, state utility regulators last week approved DTE Energy’s proposal to supply power for Michigan’s first hyperscale data center — while tacking on a host of conditions that aim to protect ratepayers from subsidizing the facility.

The approval, made over shouts of disapproval from onlookers gathered in a Lansing conference room, drew cheers from business interests and ire from skeptics who had called for a deeper public review of the 19-year deal.

Defending the decision, Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps told the gathered crowd that after reviewing them in detail, “I would put the contracts that are in front of us today on par or better with any that have been approved in the country.”

He and other commissioners said they had concluded the deal would save ratepayers money and would not sacrifice energy reliability.

But a wave of public speakers lined up to condemn the vote, raising concerns
