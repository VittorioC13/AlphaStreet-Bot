[TITLE]O5 Group Buys Retail Building Across From Penn Station for $30M:
[TEXT]
O5 Group, a real estate investor and manager, has acquired a retail building across the street from Midtown’s Penn Station.

New York-based O5 Group, which rebranded from Oved Group in 2022 and specializes in apparel, real estate and finance, purchased the three-story building at 425 Seventh Avenue from United Pacific Development for $30 million, according to city records made public Wednesday.

Ralph Dweck, an attorney at Wachtel Missry, signed the deal for the buyer, which used the entity FO 425 Seventh Avenue, while Sze Chan signed for the seller, records show.

It’s unclear who brokered the deal. A spokesperson for O5 Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Chan could not be reached for comment.

United Pacific bought the property between West 33rd and West 34th streets — and across Seventh Avenue from Penn Station — in 2006 for $4.1 million, property records show. The low-rise building’s ground-floor retail space is currently home to Rose’s Pizza.

It’s unclear what O5 Group plans to do with its new property, but the company owns nearly 10 other retail properties throughout New York City in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, according to its website.

News of the deal also comes after a slew of big leasing news near Penn Station, an underground train and subway hub in New York City that is said to be the busiest transportation facility in the Western Hemisphere.

Earlier this month, fintech firm Robinhood signed a sublease for 125,392 square feet at Vornado Realty Trust’s Penn 2, which sits above the train hall, as Commercial Observer previously reported. At the same time, Dick’s Sporting Goods signed a lease for 125,284 square feet of office space at Penn 2, while fintech firm Current took more than 62,000 square feet at the property.

[TITLE]Inside Crocs marketing: What they do differently on social media (and why it works):
[TEXT]
If there’s any brand that understands the power of the comeback, it’s Crocs. Its most recognizable product—lightweight, perforated clogs—were a fashion staple in the early to mid-2000s. However, the fallout from the 2008 global recession paired with overproduction left the American footwear business in a precarious state.

But nearly 20 years later, Crocs has emerged stronger than ever.

With the help of a new executive team and a refreshed marketing strategy (including social media marketing), Crocs increased its annual global revenue from $1.2 billion in 2014 to $4.1 billion in 2024.

The number of Crocs stores worldwide also hit its highest point in seven years as of 2024, with a total of 390 stores. Although the United States has the highest proportion of Crocs storefronts, the brand has expanded globally, with most of its international retail shops in South Korea (95), China (51) and Japan (21).

Crocs’ revival is undeniably impressive, and its social strategy has been a driving force in its overall marketing success.

In this guide, we’ll break down Crocs’ approach to social media and what you can learn from it.

Crocs’ marketing strategy is embedded in their brand ethos

Although its style can be polarizing, Crocs is unapologetic

[TITLE]Hot, Fast and Everywhere: The Rise of the Air Fryer in the American Kitchen:
[TEXT]
It's Wednesday, around 6 p.m. It's been a busy day, but I'm already carving a perfectly roasted chicken on my favorite ebony cutting board, the bird's juices spilling out from under crispy skin and filling up the board's reservoir like a moat.

For years, Ina Garten's roasted chicken — or some variation of it — has been something of a Sunday tradition for me. It's not particularly decadent or overly involved, but it's reserved for Sundays because of its 2-hour total cooking time. Now, the same recipe, but adapted for the air fryer, hits the table in well under an hour.

After months of owning an air fryer and experimenting mostly with versions of traditionally fried foods, such as wings, fries and chicken cutlets, I made my first air fryer roast chicken on a whim. Stunned by the speedy cooking time — 25% faster than traditional roasting — tender meat and impossibly crispy skin without the usual tablespoon of butter, I haven't put a bird in the oven since.

Of all the kitchen tools I've collected, and there are many, the air fryer has shifted my cooking paradigm the most, making cooking easier, faster and more foolproof. Few and far between are air fryer fails, and frequent are the discoveries of something I'd been "making wrong" all along until I roasted it quickly under spiraling superconvection heat.

Save for the rare batch of cookies or large cut of meat for a dinner party, the air fryer has all but replaced my oven. I plan meals around it: If a recipe calls for the use of my oven — meat loaf, roasted salmon, charred cauliflower — I consider how I might adapt it for the air fryer.

Celebrated chef and restaurateur Stephanie Izard shares my enthusiasm. "It's such a versatile tool," the James Beard Award winner tells me. "I use mine all the time for dinners," she adds, naming fried rice, marinated chicken and salmon as a few of her go-tos. "It's like making one-pot meals — but roasted!"

We're not alone.

According to a CNET survey, over 70% of US adults either own or plan to own an air fryer within the year. Additional studies estimate that

[TITLE]Trump-supporting grocer says he may shut down 43-year-old store due to tariffs: ‘Is that [the] American dream? I don’t think so’:
[TEXT]
A grocery store that has served a Florida community for more than four decades is on the brink of closure because of tariffs, according to the owner, who voted for President Trump in 2024.

John Wong, who co-founded Wong Kai Imports with his two brothers after the family immigrated to the US from Hong Kong, told NPR that Trump’s tariffs have forced him to raise prices on goods by as much as 35%.

He said his immigrant family, which managed to make a living and thrive in its adopted country by starting a successful business in the coastal town of Bradenton, Fla., near Tampa is facing an uncertain future.

“Is that [the] American dream? I don’t think so,” Wong lamented.

Wong, who voted for Trump because he thought that lead to lower prices, said he has had customers begging him not to close his supermarket, which imports authentic Asian cooking essentials.

“I talked to a lot of customers. They told me, ‘Mr. Wong, don’t close,'” the businessman told NPR.

“I said, ‘I’ll try, but it’s hard.'”

The Post could not immediately reach Wong for comment.

A White House spokesperson defended Trump’s tariff policies.

“The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world’s biggest and best consumer market,” a White House spokesperson told The Post on Monday.

“As tariffs secure new trade deals and trillions in investments to make and hire in America, the Administration is simultaneously implementing a pro-growth agenda of tax cuts, deregulation, and energy abundance for big and small businesses alike to thrive again as they did during President Trump’s first term.”

Last week, the Trump administration announced it would eliminate tariffs on coffee, bananas, other food imports and select textile products from four Latin American countries in a bid to lower prices for American consumers.

But Wong’s products come from other parts of the world — like China, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam — and the grocer says he has had trouble keeping prices down in the face of levies on those countries.

“All the suppliers, they’re going up 35% across the board. And what are you going to do? I mean, nothing we can do,” he told NPR.

The cost of a popular brand of sauce for spicy mapo-style tofu doubled over the past year, Wong said.

“It came in at $2.75 last year … then it went up to $3.95 … yesterday it came in at $5,” he was quoted as saying. “I mean, it doesn’t make any sense.”

Some of Wong’s frequent customers lamented the prospect of the grocery store’s closure.

Marilyn McKibben told NPR that she shops at the store for everything from sampalok, rice and vegetables — ingredients that she uses to cook Filipino soup sinigang.

“It’s very convenient on me, you know? That’s why I’m so sad,” she told NPR.

This year has seen the Trump administration dramatically expanded its tariff regime, impacting key Asian trading partners and adding new layers of duties that pushed up import costs for retailers like Wong.

After months of fluctuations, US tariffs on certain Chinese products stand around 45%. That’s after Trump recently lowered a specific levy tied to the US fight against Chinese fentanyl.

Vietnamese goods are currently subject to a 20% reciprocal levy, though certain products would qualify for a zero-tariff rate under a new framework agreement the two countries are finalizing.

As part of that deal, Vietnam has agreed to eliminate tariffs on more than 99% of US exports.

Thailand faces a similar structure, with a 19% reciprocal tariff in place and limited exemptions for select imports.

Bangkok has committed to phasing out tariffs on 99% of American goods as the Trump administration has moved to reduce or cut its current 19% levy on Thai goods.

Imports from the Philippines are subject to a 19% reciprocal tariff, too.

[TITLE]Trump’s Tariffs Don’t Help Workers. Labor Solidarity Across Borders Does.:
[TEXT]
Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The Trump administration’s sprawling new tariffs took effect in August, and U.S. consumers are starting to feel the heat. The president and his cabinet have said the tariffs will bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and put American workers first. But are these tariff policies a real solution to the “race to the bottom” that has undercut so many U.S. jobs? Nike, the world’s single largest athletic apparel and footwear brand and an iconic American company, is a prime example of how Trump’s tariffs will actually hurt workers in the U.S. and abroad.

Even with higher tariffs than those implemented, American workers cannot compete with the current wages in Nike’s global supply chain. Many garment workers make Nike products for below $1 per hour in South and Southeast Asia, where the brand’s production is concentrated. In the lead up to August, Nike and other U.S.-based garment giants showed little interest in onshoring jobs. Instead, Nike has already begun to pass the cost of tariffs onto working people in the U.S. by increasing prices for consumers, who already face an affordability crisis. Meanwhile, garment workers reported Nike supplier factories enforcing mandatory overtime and anticipating mass layoffs ahead of the tariffs coming into effect.

By targeting countries, rather than corporations, Trump deliberately misidentifies the culprits of the global “race to the bottom.” Global corporations like Nike have pursued profit at any cost, which has undercut American jobs and pushed countries around the world to compete for industry by offering their citizens’ labor to companies like Nike for the lowest possible price. These tariffs don’t change that. Instead, Trump’s tariffs follow the consistent model of his administration: use the authority of the United States government to empower corporations and billionaires. Trump’s tariffs will do nothing to prevent corporations like Nike from pursuing higher profits at the expense of workers at home and abroad.

Nike showed us its playbook on how to profit from crises during the COVID pandemic in 2020. When COVID began, clothing and footwear corporations canceled and paused orders to factories in their supply chains with no plan for the impact on the millions of workers, the vast majority women, who make their products. Garment workers in South and Southeast Asia saw their already low wages slashed, many facing months of layoff with no income and no safety net. Women workers reported eating one meal a day and taking on crippling debt. Meanwhile, Nike bounced right back and made record profits by 2021. From 2020 to 2021, Nike’s billionaire founder Phil Knight’s family grew its wealth by $20 billion. In 2022, Nike authorized a new $18 billion share buyback program, benefitting investors.

Garment workers never saw any of Nike’s pandemic-era profits returned to them, despite repeated demands by their unions. If Nike had returned the $18 billion it is spending on buybacks to workers instead, it could offer a $125 per month raise to every garment worker who makes Nike products for 10 years — doubling the wages of many and transforming the lives of a million families.

Nike’s greed is not limited to its supply chain workers in the Global South. The company has announced two rounds of U.S. staff layoffs since February to reduce labor costs. And just this month, it ended a pandemic-era “wellness week” for its workers in order to increase productivity.

The company is also hoarding profits at the cost of public benefits to working people in Oregon, where Nike is headquartered. The company struck a favorable state income tax deal in 2012 that locked in a low tax rate and has paid no federal income tax in the U.S. for years. In the aftermath of Nike’s success in lobbying for continued low state taxes — which are paid into Oregon’s General Fund, which provides two-thirds of education funding for Oregon public schools — Oregon public education faces a budget crisis that has worsened in recent years, putting at risk critical resources for students and leading to cuts in teachers’ jobs. The taxes that Nike should have paid could go a long way toward funding Oregon public school budgets and avoiding further cuts.

The COVID pandemic previewed how Nike is again poised to profit at the expense of working people from Oregon to Cambodia, as Trump’s tariffs bring a new industry disruption. But another way forward is brewing, and it’s not coming from the White House.

Workers Are Coming Together Across Borders

In the aftermath of Nike’s grotesque show of greed, thousands of unionized garment workers from across South and Southeast Asia have come together to demand wage increases and labor rights protections from Nike, organized by Asia Floor Wage Alliance and supported by Global Labor Justice. These workers have been educating each other and finding common cause with unions across the U.S., especially in Nike’s home state of Oregon, in an example of what’s possible when working people unite across borders to challenge corporate power.

A recent action in Beaverton, Oregon, might be a blueprint for the labor movement’s broader fight for a truly fair global economy. On May 28, three Indonesian union garment worker activists walked into Nike’s corporate headquarters. The brave worker activists, who represent tens of thousands of Asian garment workers, wanted to be seen and heard directly by the company’s top executives. They were joined by leaders from the Portland Association of Teachers and other allied unions angry over Nike’s contribution to the underfunding of public schools. Together they were kicked out but vowed to continue their fights together until Asian garment workers and Oregon teachers and students take back their share of the money Nike has hoarded.

The next day, the same garment worker activists held a protest with the Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation (GTFF) outside of Hayward Field track and field stadium at the University of Oregon. The $270 million renovation of Hayward Field in 2020 is one of many vanity projects funded by Nike founder Phil Knight at the University of Oregon, but one with particularly offensive timing — it was undertaken at the same moment hundreds of thousands of Nike supply chain workers lost their livelihoods without any support from the company.

GTFF pointed out how Knight’s massive donations, made possible through years of profiting from the work of underpaid garment workers, have reshaped the priorities of the public University of Oregon, where the union is fighting for decent conditions and a democratic voice. New buildings named for the Knight family have popped up throughout the University of Oregon campus in recent years even as the administration cuts jobs to address deficits. Moving forward, Nike supply chain workers and their allies in the labor movement in Oregon and across the United States are evaluating how they can take united action to hold Nike accountable for its role in both local and global inequality.

Beyond Oregon, the women garment workers leading the Fight the Heist campaign have found strong allies with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), a constituency organization within the AFL-CIO devoted to building women’s leadership in unions. CLUW and CWA’s Women’s Committee led nationally-coordinated protests outside of Nike stores and events last year. More recently, the CLUW chapter in New York City has been publicly calling on Nike board member Michelle Peluso, the Revlon CEO, to meet directly with women garment workers and their unions in Asia.

[TITLE]Skechers investors say they were forced to take a bad deal when the company went private:

Skechers investors are suing company executives and Skechers owner 3G Capital over what they say was an unfair sale price in an acquisition earlier this year.

3G Capital took the Manhattan Beach-based sneaker company private in a $9.4-billion deal that closed in September and reflected a share price of $63 per share.

In a class action complaint filed this month in Delaware Chancery Court, hedge funds and other large Skechers investors accused the company and 3G Capital of arranging a non-independent deal that shortchanged minority shareholders.

The deal undervalued the company as its shares were taking a beating because of a volatile federal tariff policy, the complaint said. The deal also benefited Skechers President Michael Greenberg and other controlling shareholders, according to the plaintiffs.

Plaintiffs seeking a higher share price were unable to reach an early settlement with Skechers after the company made an offer that was slightly higher than the original price, Bloomberg reported this week.

According to court documents, 3G Capital had offered a price of $73 per share in March this year, but lowered its offer after Trump's tariff "liberation day" on April 2.

Investors are now pressing ahead with the case, according to Bloomberg.

Skechers said it would not comment on pending legal matters.

Skechers was one of many footwear and apparel companies that sounded the alarm when Trump passed steep import taxes on countries including China and Vietnam, where many Skechers products are made.

The company's stock price fell 23% in early April after the tariffs were announced. Shares bounced back up 30% after the 3G Capital deal was announced.

Around the time of the acquisition, 3G Capital and Skechers said the purchase price represented a 30% premium to the company’s 15-day volume-weighted average stock price.

After the deal closed, about 60 investment pools managed by various firms filed to challenge the price of $1.3 billion worth of shares.

Plaintiffs in the case say Chief Executive Robert Greenberg, along with his son Michael, the company's president, worked closely with 3G Capital to tailor an acquisition deal that worked for them amid tariff chaos.

"The merger was carefully structured to allow the Greenberg stockholders to monetize a substantial amount of their personal Skechers’ holdings," the court complaint said.

Some retail brands started the year already engaged in the bankruptcy process, while others filed for protection as the months went by.

Among them, several have found themselves in bankruptcy for the second time in just a few years, and a few have managed to find buyers interested in keeping their brands alive through an acquisition.

Here is a roundup of 14 of the more notable retail bankruptcy cases that unfolded in 2025.

[TITLE]Grisso Launches Clinically-Validated, Precision Probiotic Line Amid Growing Consumer Demand for Science-Backed Wellness Solutions:
[TEXT]
ONTARIO, CA, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ONTARIO, CA - October 20, 2025 - -

Grisso, a microbial science company, today announced the launch of its clinically-validated, precision probiotic product line, entering a market increasingly defined by consumer skepticism and demand for clinical validation. The launch comes as the global probiotic supplement market faces mounting criticism over efficacy claims, with consumers expressing frustration over generic formulations that fail to deliver measurable results.

Recent industry research indicates that consumer trust in the supplement industry has reached a critical juncture. A growing segment of health-conscious consumers is actively seeking products backed by rigorous clinical evidence rather than marketing claims. This shift in consumer behavior has created an opening for brands that can demonstrate both scientific rigor and manufacturing transparency. Grisso's entry into this landscape represents a response to what founder Pamela Garcia describes as "the probiotic industry's trust problem."

"Consumers are overwhelmed by vague claims and products that don't deliver," Garcia said. "We're focused on transparency—showing the research, controlling the manufacturing process, and targeting specific health outcomes rather than making broad wellness promises." This philosophy underpins the company's product development strategy, which centers on addressing specific health concerns rather than offering general wellness support.

The company's initial product portfolio includes G-Serein, formulated to support sleep quality and stress management, G-Sylph, designed specifically for women's gut health, and G-Serene 4-In-1 Women's Health Prebiotic + Probiotic, a clinically studied formulation for vaginal health, urinary tract wellness, and yeast balance. Each formulation delivers 100 billion CFU per serving and is built around Weizmannia coagulans BC99, a patented probiotic strain and an international award winner at the 2025 NutraIngredients Awards. The strain has been the subject of multiple clinical studies examining its effects on digestive health, metabolic function, and athletic performance. By centering its product line around a single, extensively researched core ingredient rather than combining multiple strains with limited individual evidence, Grisso aims to offer what it terms "precision probiotic solutions" with clear, targeted biological objectives.

What distinguishes Grisso's approach from many competitors is its operational structure. Unlike most supplement brands that rely on contract manufacturers and third-party suppliers, Grisso operates its own integrated research and manufacturing facility. This vertical integration model, more commonly associated with pharmaceutical production than dietary supplements, allows the company to maintain direct oversight of every stage of development and production. From initial strain cultivation through final product testing and packaging, all processes occur under the company's direct supervision. This end-to-end control structure addresses one of the most significant pain points in consumer trust: the lack of transparency in supplement supply chains.

Industry observers note that this manufacturing approach, while capital-intensive, may resonate with an increasingly sophisticated consumer base. As wellness consumers become more educated
