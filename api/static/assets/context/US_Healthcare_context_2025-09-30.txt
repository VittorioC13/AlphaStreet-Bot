Our study found that VRE was not rare (7.4%). We found only vancomycin resistance in E. faecium, indicating that the vancomycin resistance rate in E. faecium was 20.6% (7/34). Therefore, vancomycin may be inefficient in treating E. faecium-related HCAVM. This result was consistent with that of previous studies, which reported a high vancomycin resistance rate in E. faecium [15, 16, 19,20,21].According to antimicrobial susceptibility tests, linezolid may be effective against all vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, whereas other antimicrobial agents have limited effects. Similarly, Pintado et al. performed a multicenter cohort study assessing linezolid’s efficacy and safety in Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, their findings suggest that linezolid is a viable alternative for Staphylococcal meningitis treatment, demonstrating comparable safety and effectiveness to standard therapies [22].

Considering that E. faecium has a higher vancomycin resistance rate than E. faecalis, we compared the antimicrobial resistance between E. faecium and E. faecalis. Among the tested antimicrobial agents, the antimicrobial resistance in E. faecium was higher than that in the other strains. The resistance mechanisms could explain some differences [23,24,25]. While ampicillin remains first-line for susceptible E. faecalis bacteremia [26], its role in HCAVM requires nuanced evaluation. We observed 62.5% ampicillin resistance in E. faecium and clinicians’ preferential use of linezolid/vancomycin (93.8% of adjustments) suggest that de-escalation opportunities may be limited to E. faecalis-dominant cohorts with confirmed susceptibility. Even then, pharmacokinetic concerns and device-associated biofilm infections might justify maintaining broader-spectrum therapy until hardware removal. Our study found that there were differences in craniotomy and transsphenoidal surgery between the two groups of patients (P < 0.05). Among them, the proportion of patients infected with E. faecalis who underwent transsphenoidal surgery was higher, while the proportion of patients infected with E. faecium who underwent craniotomy was higher. The specific reasons for this phenomenon remain to be further explored. And also, E. faecium has inherent resistance to ampicillin owing to the presence of a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein [23]. Hence, antimicrobial resistance should be carefully distinguished between E. faecium and E. faecalis, and our results were similar to those of previous studies.

Vancomycin is the main agent for empirical and targeted treatment, which is consistent with the guideline recommendations [7]. Linezolid is occasionally used for empirical treatment. Active antimicrobial agents are frequently used during targeted treatment, especially in patients with VRE. However, other antimicrobial agents, such as rifampicin, ampicillin, and gentamycin, are rarely used. Ineffective treatments were observed in 4.3% of patients and poor outcomes in 8.5%. The treatment course was 15.3 ± 10.9 days. The holistic outcomes of patients with Enterococci-related HCAVM were acceptable and better than those reported in previous studies [8,9,10,11,12]. Even in patients with VRE, a timely switch to linezolid was helpful. Therefore, active antimicrobial agents, such as vancomycin and linezolid, based on antimicrobial susceptibility tests are valuable for empirical and adjusted treatments. Our study’s retrospective design precluded standardized analysis of antimicrobial dosing schemes or CSF penetration metrics. However, institutional protocols during the study period aligned with IDSA guidelines for bacterial meningitis [7], recommending high-dose regimens, future prospective studies should incorporate therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and CSF concentration measurements to validate these empiric dosing strategies in Enterococci-related HCAVM.

The unique infection environment of ventriculitis and meningitis, characterized by the blood-brain barrier, significantly influences antibiotic cerebrospinal fluid concentrations and therapeutic efficacy. While IDSA meningitis dosing (ampicillin 3 g q4h) was empirically applied [7], the optimal dosing of β-lactam antibiotics for enterococcal infections requires further investigation [27, 28]. The pharmacokinetic properties of β-lactams - including hydrophilicity, low plasma protein binding, low molecular weight, small volume of distribution, and moderate ventricular penetration [29] - present challenges. Furthermore, susceptibility testing concentrations for β-lactamase inhibitors typically exceed achievable cerebrospinal fluid concentrations [30], introducing systematic errors. Regarding vancomycin, while the target AUC/MIC ratio serves as the validated efficacy metric for MRSA infections, trough concentrations commonly serve as practical surrogates in clinical settings. For MIC values of 0.5–1 µg/mL, trough concentrations of 10–20 µg/mL are recommended to achieve AUC/MIC ≥ 400 [31], though the precise therapeutic window requires further validation [32]. Clinically, two-thirds of treatment failures in our cohort occurred in patients receiving guideline doses without therapeutic drug monitoring, underscoring the need for individualized pharmacokinetic approaches.

Although it is useful in clinical practice, this study has several limitations. First, it was a retrospective case series that only included data from three hospitals, which may lead to selection bias. Secondly, not all antibacterial agents, such as linezolid, have been tested for every bacterial strain, and the drug resistance spectrum of the bacteria may not be detailed enough. Thirdly, although this study is the one with the largest sample size among all Enterococci-related HCAVM studies, the subsequent adjustment analysis is rather difficult. Finally, the absence of granular dosing data and therapeutic drug monitoring prevents direct correlation between antimicrobial exposure and clinical outcomes. This underscores the need for protocolized PK/PD studies in ventricular infections.

[TITLE]Harrow to Acquire Melt Pharmaceuticals:
[TEXT]
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Harrow (Nasdaq: HROW), a leading provider of ophthalmic disease management solutions in North America, today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Melt Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company pioneering non-opioid, non-IV therapies for sedation for medical procedures in the hospital, outpatient, and in-office settings. The closing of this acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by Melt stockholders, excluding Harrow and Harrow-affiliated parties.

Melt’s lead investigational therapy, MELT-300, is a patented, sublingually delivered formulation of a fixed dose of midazolam (3mg) and ketamine (50mg) designed to provide rapid, predictable sedation and analgesia without the need for intravenous administration. This innovative approach has the potential to transform patient experiences across a wide range of office-based and outpatient procedures and address the healthcare system’s growing demand to reduce exposure to opioids.

In November 2024, Melt announced positive topline results from its pivotal LOUISE ( L ower O pioid U se and I mprove the S edation E xperience) Phase 3 Study, which demonstrated that MELT-300 was statistically superior to both sublingual midazolam alone (P=0.009) and placebo (P=<0.0001) in providing successful procedural sedation. In addition, the proportion of patients requiring rescue sedation was nearly twice as high for sublingual midazolam compared with MELT-300 (P=0.003).

The LOUISE Phase 3 Study was conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), which confirmed the study design would adequately support a future regulatory submission. Further, results from a recently completed cardiac safety study indicated that MELT-300 did not alter normal heart rhythm, supporting the therapy’s safety profile.

Harrow plans to submit a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA in 2027, with a potential U.S. commercial launch in 2028.

Strategic Rationale

Immediately Accretive Launch : Harrow, through its ImprimisRx subsidiary, has successfully marketed the MKO Melt ® , a compounded sublingual sedation product widely used by ophthalmologists for more than a decade, with the product used in over 500,000 cataract surgeries. This long-standing, positive experience, by over 700 U.S. ophthalmologists, provides a strong foundation of physician trust and market familiarity with this mode of sedation delivery. Upon FDA approval of MELT-300, Harrow intends to ensure customer access to an FDA-approved product and discontinue the MKO Melt.

[TITLE]Sparrow Pharmaceuticals Announces $95 Million Series B Financing to Advance Targeted Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes:
[TEXT]
PORTLAND, Ore., Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sparrow Pharmaceuticals, a targeted cardiometabolic therapeutics company, today announced the close of a $95 million Series B financing. The round was co-led by RA Capital Management and Forbion with participation from existing investors including OrbiMed, RiverVest, and US Venture Partners. In conjunction with the financing, Zach Scheiner from RA and Nanna Lüneborg from Forbion have joined Sparrow’s Board of Directors.

The proceeds will support development of the company’s lead candidate clofutriben for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with elevated cortisol (EC). Based on strong biological rationale and rising clinical recognition, Sparrow is deploying a new mechanism to target a distinct population whose poor response to current T2D treatments is linked to excess cortisol. The company has advanced clofutriben into a Phase 2b trial in T2D with EC (CAPTAIN-T2D) with results expected in 2027.

“Nearly half of patients with difficult-to-control diabetes display increased cardiometabolic risk associated with elevated cortisol, yet there are no therapies approved for the vast majority of patients with T2D that address this underlying etiology,” said Frank Czerwiec, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer. “Prospective studies confirm what endocrinologists have long believed: excess cortisol can drive hyperglycemia by increasing gluconeogenesis, decreasing glucose uptake and disposal, and decreasing insulin synthesis and sensitivity, and thereby also impair the effectiveness of standard-of-care treatments. By directly targeting this causal and multifaceted biology, clofutriben may offer new hope for patients underserved by current therapies.”

“We are grateful to our investors whose support reflects strong conviction in Sparrow’s strategy and the clinical promise of clofutriben,” said Robert Jacks, President & Chief Executive Officer. “Elevated cortisol is now recognized as a key driver of disease progression and treatment resistance in millions of patients with type 2 diabetes worldwide. Our decision to focus on this patient population reflects a convergence of emerging biological insights, immense clinical opportunity, and payer and clinician receptivity. This significant financial commitment could enable the next big breakthrough in the management of metabolic syndrome.”

Clofutriben is a once-daily, oral HSD-1 inhibitor that modulates intracellular cortisol production in key metabolic tissues, a novel mechanism of action that has the potential to complement existing anti-diabetic therapies. In clinical trials, the candidate has shown improved glycemic control, including in individuals with elevated cortisol, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile and no evidence of adrenal insufficiency or requirement for dose titration. As an added possible benefit, HSD-1 inhibitors, including clofutriben, have also shown potential in clinical trials for improvement in weight and body composition, lipids, blood pressure, and markers of bone metabolism, as well as sleep and quality of life, as elevated cortisol contributes to a spectrum of metabolic dysfunction beyond poor glycemic control.
