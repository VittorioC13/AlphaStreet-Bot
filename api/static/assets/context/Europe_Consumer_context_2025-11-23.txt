[TITLE]Finovate Global South Africa: Acquisitions and Licensing Innovation in Banking:
[TEXT]
This week’s edition of Finovate Global looks at recent fintech headlines from South Africa.

Lesaka Technologies to Acquire Bank Zero

Lesaka Technologies, a fintech that provides low-cost financial services to underbanked South Africans, has secured approval from the Competition Commission to acquire Bank Zero. An app-only bank co-founded by Michael Jordaan in 2018 and publicly launched three years later, Bank Zero today has more than 40,000 funded accounts and deposits of more than $22 million. The financial institution offers personal and business banking solutions to both underbanked and tech-first customers.

Initially announced in July, the acquisition is valued at $60 million. The transaction consists of a combination of newly issued shares in Lesaka and up to $5 million in cash. Post-transaction, Jordaan will remain as Bank Zero’s chairman, and co-founder Yatin Narsai will continue to serve as CEO. Bank Zero’s entire management team will also remain in place.

Lesaka anticipates that the acquisition will fortify its balance sheet, enhance lending performance, and reduce the firm’s dependence on bank debt. The fintech suggested that the move could lower its gross debt by $57 million.

“The acquisition of Bank Zero is a transformative event in Lesaka’s journey, enabling us to better serve our consumers, merchants, and enterprise clients, by embedding a trusted, well-engineered neobank capability into our fintech platform,” Lesaka Chairman Ali Mazanderani said. “I am delighted to welcome the Bank Zero team to Lesaka as partners.”

Lesaka Technologies offers banking, lending, and insurance products to consumers and cash management, billpay, business funding, and card acquiring solutions to retail merchants in both the formal and informal sectors. Founded in 1997, the company is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa.

South African Retailer Explores New Banking Venture

One of South Africa’s largest discount retail groups may be getting into the banking business.

Pepkor Holdings operates more than 5,800 stores across a wide number of brands including PEP, Ackermans, and Tekkie Town. A subsidiary of Steinhoff International, Pepkor is reportedly looking to launch a new banking venture—informally referred to as “Pep Bank”—that will leverage the company’s market reach to offer zero-fee banking to millions of consumers with lower incomes. The company is said to be in conversation with Investec, seeking a partner to support the new bank’s regulatory, operational, and financial infrastructure.

There has been no public commentary from Pepkor on the initiative, and press reports assert that the talks are in “early stages.” Further, the launch of a new bank would require approvals from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and the National Credit Regulator, and no such engagement has been reported to date.

That said, the move could be a major expansion for Pepkor, which would benefit significantly from its relationship to its sizable—and largely underbanked—low-income customers. And leveraging the businesses’ nearly 6,000 retail outlets to offer those customers banking services geared toward their specific needs could give Pepkor’s new bank a strong start and make it an instant competitor to current providers.

Revolut applies for South African banking license

Speaking of launching banking operations in South Africa, Revolut announced that it has officially begun the process of securing a banking license in the country. The company has confirmed that it submitted a Section 12 application under the country’s Banks Act, the first step in becoming a licensed bank in South Africa. Revolut first signaled its intention to launch a bank in South Africa in September, highlighting the country as a “key growth market” with increasing rates of digital adoption and an openness to innovative financial products and services.

“Becoming a licensed bank will allow us to bring a full suite of products to the market and ensure we become the go-to financial app for millions of South Africans,” Revolut South Africa CEO Jacques Meyer said.

As a sign of the company’s growing engagement with the South African market, Revolut has appointed Dr. Gaby Magomola as Chairman of Revolut South Africa. A pioneer in the history of banking in South Africa, Dr. Magomola has served in senior executive roles at Citibank, Barclays Bank, First National Bank, and African Bank. He most recently served as Deputy Chairman of the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA).

“Dr. Magomola’s experience is invaluable as we deepen our commitment to the South African market,” Meyer said. “His strategic counsel will be critical in navigating the local regulatory environment, ensuring we build a locally relevant service that addresses the financial needs of all customers in South Africa.”

Revolut’s presence in South Africa would bring significant additional competition to the country’s digital bank industry, which consists of TymeBank, Discovery Bank, and Bank Zero, which has been acquired by Lesaka Technologies, as we noted in this week’s column. Already one of the largest digital banks in the world, Revolut has said its expansion in South Africa is part of the company’s goal to grow its customer base from 65 million to 100 million by 2027. Revolut also seeks to be active in 30 markets by 2030.

[TITLE]Private Equity’s New Venture: Youth Sports:
[TEXT]
Jacobin ‘s fall issue, “Borders,” is out now. Follow this link to get a discounted subscription to our beautiful print quarterly.

There’s an ironclad truism in youth sports: every parent turns into an ESPN 30 for 30 documentarian as soon as they have a video recording device in hand and their kid is in the game. Some record the games and post them online so family members and friends who can’t attend in person can watch their kids play. Sometimes they do so to attract the attention of college scouts or help players hone their craft. Some people just want to preserve the memories. But in the world of corporatized youth sports, even this simple pleasure is being banned and monetized by Wall Street to extract as much profit as possible from players and parents, no matter how many kids get sidelined because they can’t afford the sport’s rising costs. As the $40 billion youth sports industry comes under private equity control, corporate-owned facilities and leagues — from hockey rinks to cheerleading arenas — have begun prohibiting parents from recording their own kids’ sports games. Instead, parents are forced to subscribe to these companies’ exclusive recording and streaming service, which can cost many times more than the streaming costs for professional sporting events. Meanwhile, the firms’ exclusive contracts have prohibited alternative video services from being made available. In some instances, parents have been threatened that if they choose to defy the rules and record the game, they may end up on a blacklist that punishes their kids’ teams. Those threats were even reportedly made to a sitting US senator. “I was told this past weekend that if I livestreamed my child’s hockey game, my kid’s team will be penalized and lose a place in the standings,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) at a public event earlier this year. “Why is that? Because a private equity company has bought up the rinks.” Murphy did not name the company in question, though the restrictive streaming practices he described have become widespread across youth hockey. Black Bear Sports Group, an emerging youth hockey empire and the largest owner-operator of hockey rinks in the country, is among the private equity–backed companies that are amassing a chokehold on recording and streaming youth sports. At Black Bear–owned ice rinks, parents cannot record, post, or livestream their kids’ hockey games online “per official company policy,” according to staff at those venues. Some rink attendants said they will confiscate attendees’ recording devices if they find them. Some specialized sports training consultants have agreements with Black Bear that allow them to record games and practices, but only for internal use. According to a spokesperson, Black Bear claims the policy is to mitigate “significant safety risks to players,” such as players being filmed without their consent. The spokesperson failed to answer a follow-up question

[TITLE]Full-Funnel ROI Is Becoming the New Battleground for DTC Growth:
[TEXT]
For years, DTC brands have been told to “invest in brand.” But when acquisition costs climb and CFOs demand clearer accountability, even the most sophisticated teams face the same challenge: how do you measure what has traditionally been “unmeasurable”?

Large-scale brands: from Ulta Beauty and Shein to leading marketplace retailers, have all run into the same problem. When CACs fluctuate and budgets tighten, the ability to quantify the influence of top-of-funnel activity becomes a board-level conversation. Leaders don’t just want to know if awareness campaigns “worked”; they want to know how those impressions lowered CAC, increased revenue, and ultimately delivered incremental growth.

That’s why full-funnel measurement is rapidly becoming the strategic battleground for performance teams and ad platforms alike. As TikTok continues to evolve beyond a discovery engine into a full-commerce environment, platforms must show that they don’t only drive TOF engagement, but also meaningfully shape downstream revenue outcomes.

In NYC, and free @08:30 AM ET, Wed December 3rd? Request a seat at ClickZ’s private breakfast roundtable, hosted in partnership with TikTok and Fospha. The event will bring together senior eCommerce and retail brand leaders to unpack what the next generation of performance measurement looks like, specifically through the lens of TikTok’s Smart+ and GMV Max ecosystem. The conversation centers on a shared objective: connecting brand-led activity to provable, blended performance.

For advertisers, the stakes are high. Full-funnel ROI isn’t just a reporting improvement; it’s a competitive advantage. When teams can quantify how brand impressions influence mid- and lower-funnel performance, they can allocate budgets with far greater confidence -often uncovering profitable scaling opportunities that traditional attribution models overlook.

This is where independent measurement partners enter the picture. Solutions like Fospha help brands unify first-party, platform, and conversion data into a coherent, privacy-safe model. Rather than replacing platform analytics, Fospha provides the missing context: how upper-funnel exposure contributes to incremental conversions, improved efficiency, and reductions in blended CAC.

That neutrality is key. It enables brands to validate the full-funnel impact of platforms like TikTok with greater confidence, and it also helps platforms demonstrate their influence beyond last-click performance – unlocking not only direct-response budgets, but brand budgets as well.

As 2026 approaches, one thing is increasingly clear: the brands that win will be the ones that can measure the “unmeasurable”. Full-funnel performance isn’t a buzzword; it’s a financial framework. And for leaders gathering at ClickZ’s roundtable, the mission is the same – turn brand investment into a measurable, defensible growth engine.

[TITLE]Inside Crocs marketing: What they do differently on social media (and why it works):
[TEXT]
If there’s any brand that understands the power of the comeback, it’s Crocs. Its most recognizable product—lightweight, perforated clogs—were a fashion staple in the early to mid-2000s. However, the fallout from the 2008 global recession paired with overproduction left the American footwear business in a precarious state.

But nearly 20 years later, Crocs has emerged stronger than ever.

With the help of a new executive team and a refreshed marketing strategy (including social media marketing), Crocs increased its annual global revenue from $1.2 billion in 2014 to $4.1 billion in 2024.

The number of Crocs stores worldwide also hit its highest point in seven years as of 2024, with a total of 390 stores. Although the United States has the highest proportion of Crocs storefronts, the brand has expanded globally, with most of its international retail shops in South Korea (95), China (51) and Japan (21).

Crocs’ revival is undeniably impressive, and its social strategy has been a driving force in its overall marketing success.

In this guide, we’ll break down Crocs’ approach to social media and what you can learn from it.

Crocs’ marketing strategy is embedded in their brand ethos

Although its style can be polarizing, Crocs is unapologetic

What is the Potential Growth Rate of the Gift Wrapping Paper Industry?

Rising Demand for Premium Personalized Packaging & Expansion of E-commerce

The expansion of e-commerce and the rising demand for premium personalized packaging have significantly accelerated the growth of the gift wrapping paper industry. Online shopping has increased the volume of gifts shipped directly to recipients, prompting brands and sellers to use attractive wrapping solutions to improve customer experience and enhance unboxing appeal.

At the same time, consumers increasingly seek customized prints, names, messages, and luxury textures, turning wrapping paper into a form of self-expression rather than just protective packaging. This shift encourages manufacturers to offer more design variations, sustainable premium materials, and themed collections, boosting overall market demand across retail and corporate gifting segments.

[TITLE]California Clears Path for Gig Unions:
[TEXT]
In October, California lawmakers passed a bill allowing rideshare drivers to unionize. Under the law, a unionization election can be triggered when just 10 percent of the state's rideshare drivers submit forms expressing preference for a union—and a union can be certified with support from as little as 30 percent of active drivers.

This is a new tactic from union-friendly lawmakers, but the end result is likely to be the same: less flexibility for the very workers who say flexibility is what keeps them in these jobs.

This saga began in 2018, when the California Supreme Court adopted the so-called ABC test for delivery couriers, a far stricter standard for classifying workers as independent contractors. Lawmakers expanded the test to all sectors through the now-infamous Assembly Bill (A.B.) 5 law, making it dramatically harder for Californians to continue working as contractors.

The fallout to A.B. 5 was swift and overwhelming, and backlash followed. In 2020, California's electorate overturned the law's application to gig work by voting to approve Proposition 22.

The defeat of A.B. 5 should have settled the question, but lawmakers have simply changed tactics.

Under the new law, any certified union would get a one-year challenge-free window within which all ridesharing companies in the state must bargain with it in good faith—effectively creating a form of sectoral bargaining, which is rare in U.S. labor law. Gig companies accepted this approach as less bad than reclassification, but the result will likely still be the same for companies and workers.

While theoretically better than forcible reclassification, unionizing gig workers would still reduce worker flexibility and autonomy and raise costs for the platforms. Sectoral bargaining by necessity requires uniform standards across an entire industry, which is most doable with traditional employment models, such as in the fast-food arena, where California has already introduced aspects of sectoral bargaining in recent years.

Sector-wide negotiations would force a one-size-fits-all approach, pushing platforms toward standardized schedules and undermining the log-in-anytime flexibility gig workers typically enjoy.

Elements of this shift are already visible in places that have enacted other one-size-fits-all rules for gig work, such as minimum wage mandates. After New York City passed a minimum-wage mandate for rideshare drivers in 2019, Uber and Lyft began locking drivers out of their accounts to manage the fallout. A 2023 law extending the minimum wage to app-based delivery workers produced similar results: driver deactivations and a waitlist, as platforms tried to manage sharply increased labor costs.

This impacts real people. Consider a single mom who wants to log a few rides on a weeknight when she unexpectedly gets a window of free time. If platforms adopt regimented schedules, she may be blocked from logging in when both she—and potential riders—could benefit.

A major concern following California's adoption is that this model will almost certainly spread to other states. California has a track record of exporting its labor-policy experiments: After A.B. 5's passage, several states pursued their own restrictive ABC tests.

This could even become a bipartisan push. Given Republicans like Vice President J.D. Vance and Sen. Josh Hawley (R–Mo.) embracing organized labor, others on the right could be moved to support gig worker unionization.

It's also clear that the political left will not be content to merely stop at unionization. Progressives like former California assemblymember (and sponsor of A.B. 5) Lorena Gonzalez (D–San Diego) have described unionization as "a step forward" but not "the limit of what's possible." Teamster President Sean O'Brien—whose GOP-convention speech highlighted Republicans' shift toward unions—has dismissed a similar Massachusetts unionization effort for gig workers, saying it supports "greedy corporations that want to deny full employment rights to workers."

Gig-worker unionization isn't full reclassification—but it pushes the system toward the same endgame.

[TITLE]Private Equity’s New Venture: Youth Sports:
[TEXT]
Jacobin ‘s fall issue, “Borders,” is out now. Follow this link to get a discounted subscription to our beautiful print quarterly.

There’s an ironclad truism in youth sports: every parent turns into an ESPN 30 for 30 documentarian as soon as they have a video recording device in hand and their kid is in the game. Some record the games and post them online so family members and friends who can’t attend in person can watch their kids play. Sometimes they do so to attract the attention of college scouts or help players hone their craft. Some people just want to preserve the memories. But in the world of corporatized youth sports, even this simple pleasure is being banned and monetized by Wall Street to extract as much profit as possible from players and parents, no matter how many kids get sidelined because they can’t afford the sport’s rising costs. As the $40 billion youth sports industry comes under private equity control, corporate-owned facilities and leagues — from hockey rinks to cheerleading arenas — have begun prohibiting parents from recording their own kids’ sports games. Instead, parents are forced to subscribe to these companies’ exclusive recording and streaming service, which can cost many times more than the streaming costs for professional sporting events. Meanwhile, the firms’ exclusive contracts have prohibited alternative video services from being made available. In some instances, parents have been threatened that if they choose to defy the rules and record the game, they may end up on a blacklist that punishes their kids’ teams. Those threats were even reportedly made to a sitting US senator. “I was told this past weekend that if I livestreamed my child’s hockey game, my kid’s team will be penalized and lose a place in the standings,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) at a public event earlier this year. “Why is that? Because a private equity company has bought up the rinks.” Murphy did not name the company in question, though the restrictive streaming practices he described have become widespread across youth hockey. Black Bear Sports Group, an emerging youth hockey empire and the largest owner-operator of hockey rinks in the country, is among the private equity–backed companies that are amassing a chokehold on recording and streaming youth sports. At Black Bear–owned ice rinks, parents cannot record, post, or livestream their kids’ hockey games online “per official company policy,” according to staff at those venues. Some rink attendants said they will confiscate attendees’ recording devices if they find them. Some specialized sports training consultants have agreements with Black Bear that allow them to record games and practices, but only for internal use. According to a spokesperson, Black Bear claims the policy is to mitigate “significant safety risks to players,” such as players being filmed without their consent. The spokesperson failed to answer a follow-up question

[TITLE]Luxury Market Faces Challenges Amid Economic Uncertainty, Shifts Toward Experiences:
[TEXT]
MILAN — The luxury market is still resilient but not immune to the headwinds from economic and geopolitical uncertainties, according to Bain & Company and Altagamma.

Global luxury spending is expected to remain stable in 2025 at 1.44 trillion euros at constant exchange rates. At current exchange, it is forecast to decrease between 1 and 3 percent.

The most recent Bain-Altagamma Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study presented in Milan finds that a sequentially improving trajectory is expected to extend into 2026.

In an interview, Federica Levato, senior partner at Bain & Company and leader of the firm’s EMEA [Europe, Middle East and Africa] Fashion & Luxury practice, who co-authored the report, said the “overview is a mildly positive” one. The third quarter this year was better than expected and the fourth quarter is seen as critical.

“Experiences and emotions become the primary driver of market growth after the shopping-spree era,” she said. The study reports a “tectonic shift” toward luxury experiences such as hospitality cruises and fine dining, reshaping the industry.

“The study is called ‘The Longevity Issue,’ so brands need to take action, to proactively make this a timeless industry and market, to [protect] their own longevity and that of customers, because now we are six generations buying into this market, and complexities are arising from serving so many different customers, such different product offer, and value propositions,” Levato said.

Sales of the personal luxury goods are expected to decrease 2 percent to 358 million euros in 2025 compared with 364 million euros in 2024, and are seen to be flat at constant exchange. While ultra-wealthy buyers are continuing to sustain demand for high-end luxury goods, aspirational consumers have pulled back, adding to the pressure on traditional luxury, according to the report.

In June, as reported, Bain and Altagamma saw three potential scenarios unfolding in 2025: an in-year rebound with a market growth compared with 2024 of between a 2 percent decrease and a 2 percent increase, with a 20 percent probability of occurrence; a continued slip with a decrease of between 2 and 5 percent, with a 60 percent probability of occurrence, and a demand dip of between and 5 and 9 percent, with a 20 percent probability of occurrence.

Bain and Altagamma project a 4 to 6 percent annual growth of personal luxury goods in the next decade, fueled by and expanding consumer base and enduring demand and reaching between 525 billion euros and 625 billion euros, while overall luxury spending could range between 2.2 trillion and 2.7 trillion euros.

“Luxury stands at a crossroads: uneven regional growth paths, pricing pressure, and fragmented consumer personas are testing its core,” stated Claudia D’Arpizio, Bain & Company senior partner, leader of the firm’s global Fashion & Luxury practice, and lead author of the study. “Creativity is progressively coming back, but a broken price-value equation calls for integrity and renewed trust. This is luxury’s moment of truth: to rise through ethics, inclusivity, and authenticity, or retreat into elitism. The new formula is clear: entertainment, emotion, and ethics are the real sources of value. The winners will balance profit with purpose, creativity and conscience, turning recalibration into reinvention.”

D’Arpizio said the market is “navigating a fragile global balance. Ahead lies a phase of quality-driven growth, fueled by discipline, ethics and innovation. Expansion will favor fewer, higher-impact locations — a shift toward a more discerning, experience-led model.”

Overview by Category

Jewelry is seen as a winner, with an expected expansion this year of 4 to 6 percent, perceived as an investment and a gift item, and as having a real intrinsic value. The value of gold and of the gems is increasing, said Levato, adding that jewelers have also been “very good in connecting in an authentic way with the customers, stretching their value proposition remaining credible, both at haute joaillerie price points, but also catering to the aspirational customer base with a product with content. At the biggest jewelry brands, you can find very good gifts for an 18-year-old girl at 1,000 euros; you can hardly find a bag or even a sneaker at that price point or below. This explains also why leather and shoes are suffering, because these players have increased prices so much in the last three years and it is super difficult to go back.”

Eyewear is also continuing to perform strongly, with expected growth of 2 to 4 percent, boosted by design innovation, versatility, and digital integration. Beauty remains stable, but fragrances remain the most dynamic subcategory, with AI-driven personalization gaining ground, while premium skin care and makeup suffer from performance polarization among players.

The market for watches is marked by increased polarization, with high-end pieces thriving while tariffs and pricing pressures fuel the resale market.

Apparel holds steady, driven by strong performance of accessible players.

Overall, accessible luxury fashion is rebounding, driven by brands’ success in engaging downtrading consumers, reactivating heritage clients, and attracting value-conscious Gen Z shoppers.

Outlet stores are outperforming but online channels are holding steady. Monobrand stores have reduced a total store surface of 25,000 square meters in the past six months, while U.S. department stores have cut around 10 percent of space since 2024.

Levato said brands must reimagine physical retail with “fewer, larger flagships that deliver emotion, immersion and personalized connection.”

Geographic Markets

Spending in China is set to contract by between 3 and 5 percent this year at constant exchange rates, “but brands are seeing a soft restart in the last month, so let’s hope we have hit the bottom to restart growing,” said Levato. “In all categories there is a rising pride from Chinese customers in buying local brands. For the moment, it is true only on some categories in personal luxury, and some local brands are already big and competing in the mindset of the customer with the global brands, but not that much in fashion, although they might be building up.”

Japan’s market is decelerating after a strong 2024, due to cooling tourism.

Europe is seeing a softening trend, with its luxury market set to dip in 2025 by between 1 and 3 percent as tourism slows, impacted by a strong euro and geopolitical tensions.

The Americas are seen to remain stable or grow 2 percent, buoyed by renewed domestic demand in the U.S. and expanding luxury footprints in Mexico and Brazil. “Americans are coming to Europe, but buying less, factoring the fact that the dollar is not so strong now on the euro and also probably in the European stores, they don’t find a differentiated experience anymore,” Levato contended.

The Middle East stands out as luxury’s brightest performer, with expected growth of between 4 and 6 percent, buoyed by strong tourism in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and sustained demand in Saudi Arabia.

The Middle East, Latin America, Southeast Asia, India and Africa combined represent a market value of around 45 billion euros in 2025, matching mainland China in scale, showing future growth potential, the study asserts.

Luxury’s consumer base continues to shrink, dropping to around 340 million in 2025 from 400 million in 2022. Between 2024 and 2025, new customer acquisition for luxury brands has declined by 5 percent.

Margins Under Pressure

Luxury companies have been reporting margin pressures, with profitability back down to 2009 levels, largely due to higher operating costs and challenges in sustaining revenue growth. Operating profit margins that peaked at 23 percent in 2012 should hit 15 to 16 percent in 2025, similar to the level in 2009. “With margins squeezed, brands must double down on performance discipline and AI-enabled efficiency to defend value, but without dulling desirability,” Levato said.

This contraction in margins has led to an estimated 100-billion-euro loss in the industry’s total enterprise value over the past 12 months.

“Fixed costs are much higher, so there is a call to action to control the cost base, to optimize marketing spending, which does not mean to spend less, but spend better in a more efficient and effective way, and of course, also optimizing store operations, and build a more efficient machine,” Levato said.

Accessible Luxury

“There has been a revamp of the accessible luxury brands that were able to catch the attention of Gen Z, the larger audience and the larger customer base with value for money. This does not mean cheaper or a cheap entry to luxury, but it’s a price that you pay for a value that you can see and touch, which is the equation that a bit is lacking in the high-end luxury brands now,” according Levato.

She contended that “the consumer demand is there,” and underscored that at constant exchange rate, both 2024 and 2025 were flat years. “So not a bad performance, given all the external turmoil, but partially, the turmoils are also internally generated and self-inflicted. The call to action is really to go back to creativity, which many brands have done with new creative directors. This has created a lot of interest and traffic in the stores. Authenticity and ethics are ways to regain trust and reconnect with the customer base, and to really build the value for price equation.”

Levato concluded that “the very wealthy customers do not see themselves respected anymore and reflected in the values of an industry. And this is a huge risk, because they then shift their spending on experiences and restaurants. Brands are trying to diversify into other categories, opening bars, food and dining locations within the stores, or spas. But the question is, will it be enough to win back the aspirational customers with these different categories?”

Altagamma’s 2026 Consensus

“The Italian high-end sector — which accounts for over 7 percent of national GDP — continues to demonstrate resilience, thanks to the creativity and manufacturing excellence that characterize the entire value chain. Now more than ever, to safeguard the global reputation of Italian-made luxury, we must commit to ensuring legality, transparency, and legal certainty,” said Matteo Lunelli, chairman of Altagamma. “We are working with the government and other associations to establish a renewed supply chain pact, knowing that we can count on the responsible ethical standards of our companies. Italy must remain the driving force of the high-end sector, preserving a virtuous ecosystem that brings together business, craftsmanship, innovation and culture: a true economic and cultural asset to champion.”

Stefania Lazzaroni, CEO of Altagamma, presented the association’s 2026 Consensus, which estimates the sector’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will grow 5 percent in 2026 compared with 2025, thanks to “an optimization of costs and the performance of the American, European and Middle Eastern markets.”

North America is expected to grow 4.5 percent with an increasing number of high-net-worth individuals.

Europe is seen growing 3.5 percent, slowed down by the political and economic crisis in France and Germany, while Spain is showing “a brilliant performance.”

China is expected to be up 4 percent, with a still cautious customer demand and real estate crisis, and still influenced by the luxury shame trend.

Asia, propelled by Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore, continues to grow, and is expected to be up 4 percent.

Japan is forecast to grow 2.5 percent and Latin America to gain 4.5 percent, driven by Mexico and Brazil.

The Middle East will continue to be a point of reference and is seen to grow 6 percent, and the Rest of the World is forecast to be up 4.5 percent.

Jewelry is expected to continue to grow by 5 percent. Shoes and leather goods are slowing down, up 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Beauty is seen to grow 4 percent, driven by the attention to longevity and wellness. Apparel is expected to be up 4 percent.

In Conversation

During a conversation with Lazzaroni, Michael Ward, managing director of Harrods and president of ECCIA, the European Cultural and Creative Industries Alliance, said he sees a “half-full glass” and that he is “really, really positive” about 2026, leveraging the “unique experiences” and events with customers at the store. “It’s important to understand what your brand stands for,” and avoid aiming “for a quick buck. For example, we have always refused tour groups” to offer high quality service and “this has paid off in spades,” also catering to “a strong local affluent customer.” Reaching out to Gen Z and staging art exhibition with Chanel and Dior for example, is also key. “People want their lives curated and we can do that.”

Lelio Gavazza, CEO of Tom Ford Fashion, also touted “taking care” of customers, paying attention to their evolution, and avoiding “elitism but offering exclusivity.” Gavazza, who was named to the post in 2023, said he continues to strengthen the U.S. market, while expanding the Middle East and growing Asia. “There have been signs of improvements in China and the market has great potential, with a growing middle class,” he said.

Stefano Canali, president and CEO of Canali, said “the importance of the value associated to price has become an obsession” for customers, and rightly so, he continued, because “even when wealthy, they don’t want to spend more for a product whose value is not aligned with the price.” This led to his belief Canali’s success also lies in its “credibility and authenticity, which does not mean staying put, but the evolution must be consistent.” Hence the opening of Canali’s first restaurant, called Locanda, in Hong Kong last summer, “credible, consistent with our brand also in terms of the quality of the interiors and with an Italian chef.”

[TITLE]Finovate Global South Africa: Acquisitions and Licensing Innovation in Banking:
[TEXT]
This week’s edition of Finovate Global looks at recent fintech headlines from South Africa.

Lesaka Technologies to Acquire Bank Zero

Lesaka Technologies, a fintech that provides low-cost financial services to underbanked South Africans, has secured approval from the Competition Commission to acquire Bank Zero. An app-only bank co-founded by Michael Jordaan in 2018 and publicly launched three years later, Bank Zero today has more than 40,000 funded accounts and deposits of more than $22 million. The financial institution offers personal and business banking solutions to both underbanked and tech-first customers.

Initially announced in July, the acquisition is valued at $60 million. The transaction consists of a combination of newly issued shares in Lesaka and up to $5 million in cash. Post-transaction, Jordaan will remain as Bank Zero’s chairman, and co-founder Yatin Narsai will continue to serve as CEO. Bank Zero’s entire management team will also remain in place.

Lesaka anticipates that the acquisition will fortify its balance sheet, enhance lending performance, and reduce the firm’s dependence on bank debt. The fintech suggested that the move could lower its gross debt by $57 million.

“The acquisition of Bank Zero is a transformative event in Lesaka’s journey, enabling us to better serve our consumers, merchants, and enterprise clients, by embedding a trusted, well-engineered neobank capability into our fintech platform,” Lesaka Chairman Ali Mazanderani said. “I am delighted to welcome the Bank Zero team to Lesaka as partners.”

Lesaka Technologies offers banking, lending, and insurance products to consumers and cash management, billpay, business funding, and card acquiring solutions to retail merchants in both the formal and informal sectors. Founded in 1997, the company is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa.

South African Retailer Explores New Banking Venture

One of South Africa’s largest discount retail groups may be getting into the banking business.

Pepkor Holdings operates more than 5,800 stores across a wide number of brands including PEP, Ackermans, and Tekkie Town. A subsidiary of Steinhoff International, Pepkor is reportedly looking to launch a new banking venture—informally referred to as “Pep Bank”—that will leverage the company’s market reach to offer zero-fee banking to millions of consumers with lower incomes. The company is said to be in conversation with Investec, seeking a partner to support the new bank’s regulatory, operational, and financial infrastructure.

There has been no public commentary from Pepkor on the initiative, and press reports assert that the talks are in “early stages.” Further, the launch of a new bank would require approvals from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and the National Credit Regulator, and no such engagement has been reported to date.

That said, the move could be a major expansion for Pepkor, which would benefit significantly from its relationship to its sizable—and largely underbanked—low-income customers. And leveraging the businesses’ nearly 6,000 retail outlets to offer those customers banking services geared toward their specific needs could give Pepkor’s new bank a strong start and make it an instant competitor to current providers.

Revolut applies for South African banking license

Speaking of launching banking operations in South Africa, Revolut announced that it has officially begun the process of securing a banking license in the country. The company has confirmed that it submitted a Section 12 application under the country’s Banks Act, the first step in becoming a licensed bank in South Africa. Revolut first signaled its intention to launch a bank in South Africa in September, highlighting the country as a “key growth market” with increasing rates of digital adoption and an openness to innovative financial products and services.

“Becoming a licensed bank will allow us to bring a full suite of products to the market and ensure we become the go-to financial app for millions of South Africans,” Revolut South Africa CEO Jacques Meyer said.

As a sign of the company’s growing engagement with the South African market, Revolut has appointed Dr. Gaby Magomola as Chairman of Revolut South Africa. A pioneer in the history of banking in South Africa, Dr. Magomola has served in senior executive roles at Citibank, Barclays Bank, First National Bank, and African Bank. He most recently served as Deputy Chairman of the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA).

“Dr. Magomola’s experience is invaluable as we deepen our commitment to the South African market,” Meyer said. “His strategic counsel will be critical in navigating the local regulatory environment, ensuring we build a locally relevant service that addresses the financial needs of all customers in South Africa.”

Revolut’s presence in South Africa would bring significant additional competition to the country’s digital bank industry, which consists of TymeBank, Discovery Bank, and Bank Zero, which has been acquired by Lesaka Technologies, as we noted in this week’s column. Already one of the largest digital banks in the world, Revolut has said its expansion in South Africa is part of the company’s goal to grow its customer base from 65 million to 100 million by 2027. Revolut also seeks to be active in 30 markets by 2030.

What is Meant by Gift Packaging?

Gift packaging is the procedure of presenting a gift attractively and thoughtfully, utilizing materials such as decorative paper, ribbons, boxes, and other embellishments. It goes beyond simple wrapping to make an experience, adding to the emotional impact and thus making the gift-giving more memorable. It is a growing industry boosted by increased consumer spending on gifts, the growth of e-commerce, and the need for personalized and sustainable alternatives.

The main drivers for gift packaging involve increased consumer spending on gifts and even a rise in celebrations, which boosts seasonal and recurring needs. Other key factors are the expansion of e-commerce, which needs secure and attractive shipping packaging, and even consumer demand for personalized, along with aesthetically pleasing options.

The corporate gifting sector is seeing investments in digital print lines and AI-driven recommendations, enabling personalized packaging at scale. Investments in sustainable materials: Private investment is fueling the development of new sustainable packaging materials, such as recycled cardboard and biodegradable options, to meet consumer demand and align with regulations.

What are the Latest Trends in the Gift Packaging Market?

Sustainability through Recycled and Biodegradable Materials

This is due to increased consumer requirements for eco-friendly alternatives, driven by growing environmental consciousness as well as a desire to reduce waste. Companies are accepting recycled and even biodegradable materials not only to meet these choices but also to enhance their brand image, comply with regulations, and achieve long-term cost savings via reduced waste and material use.

Thus, recycled materials and natural, fast-growing materials such as bamboo or FSC-accepted paper have a lower carbon footprint than virgin materials. Sustainable packaging decreases the usage of non-renewable resources and reduces the overall volume of materials needed.

What Potentiates the Growth of the Gift Packaging Market?

Increasing Emphasis on Aesthetics and Personalization

Consumers associate attractive, as well as high-quality packaging, with the quality and even thoughtfulness of the gift itself. Personalized elements, like names, custom messages, or unique designs, make the recipient feel valued and even understood, deepening the emotional connection between the giver as well as receiver and rising the perceived value of the gift.

Innovations such as digital printing, laser engraving, along AI-driven design platforms have made widespread customization more cost-effective and also accessible for both brands and consumers. This technology enables on-demand, intricate personalization, thus fueling market expansion.

[TITLE]Dehydrated Foods Global Overview 2025: Market to Reach $387.4 Billion by 2032, Fueled by Health Trends, Urbanization, and Processing Innovations Boost Quality and Accessibility:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Dehydrated Foods - A Global Market Overview" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global Dehydrated Foods market is forecast to increase from US$248.2 billion in 2025 to US$387.4 billion by 2032, advancing at a CAGR of 6.6%

This global report on Dehydrated Foods analyzes the global and regional markets based on Drying Technology, Product Type, Nature and Distribution Channel for the period 2022-2032 with projections from 2025 to 2032 in terms of value. In addition to providing profiles of major companies operating in this space, the latest corporate and industrial developments have been covered to offer a clear panorama of how and where the market is progressing.

Growth is supported by consumer preference for convenient, nutrient-rich, and plant-based foods, especially among professionals, students, and outdoor enthusiasts. Rising health awareness, coupled with improved spray-drying and energy-efficient dehydrators, is boosting product quality. In developing regions such as Asia-Pacific and South America, urbanization and rising incomes are expanding accessibility, while freeze-drying and packaging innovations enhance product appeal. Together, these factors position dehydrated foods as a key pillar in the global processed food sector.

Global demand is expanding rapidly as consumers shift from frozen and canned foods toward lightweight, shelf-stable formats that reduce logistics costs and offer convenience. Freeze-dried foods, positioned as premium due to their superior ability to retain flavor, nutrients, and appearance, are growing the fastest.

The popularity of ready-to-eat and ready-to-rehydrate products, including instant soups, beverage bases, and "just add water" meals, aligns with modern, single-household and on-the-go lifestyles, while clean-label attributes such as organic, non-GMO, and preservative-free claims are gaining shelf space and consumer traction. E-commerce and direct-to-consumer (DTC) models, particularly for emergency food kits, backpacking meals, and snacks, are strengthening distribution reach.

Regional Market Analysis

Asia-Pacific leads the market with a 35.2% share in 2025 and is also the fastest-growing, projected to expand at 7.6% CAGR through 2032. Growth is driven by urbanization in China, India, and Southeast Asia, where over 60% of the population is expected to live in cities by 2030. Smaller households and busier lifestyles are fueling demand for dehydrated snacks, meals, and ingredients, supported by the region's abundant agricultural output that enables large-scale vegetable dehydration for both domestic and export use.

E-commerce is expanding beyond tier-1 into tier-2 and tier-3 cities, while supermarkets and hypermarkets broaden physical access. Investments in advanced freeze-drying and spray-drying, combined with packaging innovations like resealable pouches, are elevating product quality and portability. Traditional culinary practices involving dried seafood, fruits, and spices underpin strong consumer acceptance, while rising health and nutrition awareness is increasing demand for organic, minimally processed dehydrated foods.

Market Analysis by Drying Technology

Spray-drying remains the most widely used method, commanding a 37.5% share in 2025, due to its scalability, cost efficiency, and suitability for high-volume production of products like milk powders, coffee, seasonings, and instant beverages. Its ability to convert liquids and emulsions into stable powders with controlled particle size ensures its relevance across supply chains, while decades of industrial use and ongoing equipment innovations in energy efficiency and process control sustain its competitiveness.

Freeze-drying, however, is set to grow the fastest at a 9.9% CAGR between 2025 and 2032, owing to its superior ability to preserve aroma, flavor, and heat-sensitive nutrients. Widely used for snacks, fruit crisps, specialty coffee, and premium food ingredients, freeze-drying is gaining traction thanks to modular, automated, and energy-efficient equipment that lowers adoption barriers. Its established use in pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals also supports capacity growth, and the resulting premium, additive-free foods are strongly favored by health-conscious consumers.

Market Analysis by Product Type

Fruits & Vegetables dominate the global product landscape with a 37% share in 2025, supported by their long shelf life, versatility, and wide use in snacks, ready-to-eat meals, bakery products, and foodservice. Dehydration ensures steady year-round supply, mitigating seasonal shortages, while freeze-dried fruits like strawberries remain especially popular in off-season markets. Health-conscious consumers, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, perceive dehydrated fruits and vegetables as nutrient-dense alternatives to processed snacks, while technological advances in freeze-drying and vacuum-drying enhance their appeal.

On the other hand, Spices, Herbs & Seasonings are projected to grow the fastest at 7.4% CAGR during 2025-2032. Demand is rising with globalization of cuisines, experimentation with ethnic flavors, and reliance of the vast processed food industry on dried spices for flavor and stability. E-commerce platforms and global logistics are making niche and artisanal products more accessible, while clean-label preferences and lower transport costs compared to fresh spices strengthen their adoption.

Market Analysis by Nature

Conventional Dehydrated Foods hold a commanding 86.8% share in 2025, driven by lower production costs, economies of scale, and well-established global supply chains. These products are widely adopted by large processors of ready-to-eat meals and snacks due to their affordability and versatility, while optimized spray-drying and air-drying technologies support efficient mass production. In contrast, Organic Dehydrated Foods, though smaller in scale, are expected to post faster growth at 8.6% CAGR through 2032.

Rising consumer demand for pesticide-free, GMO-free, and sustainably produced foods is fueling adoption, especially in North America and Europe, with momentum spreading globally. Premium pricing and profitability are encouraging investment, while certifications such as USDA Organic and EU Organic build trust. Broader availability of organic fruit snacks, spices, and specialty items via e-commerce is further expanding reach, supported by environmentally conscious consumers seeking ethical, natural options.

Market Analysis by Distribution Channel

Offline retail remains dominant with an 80.1% share in 2025, as supermarkets, hypermarkets, and specialty stores provide product visibility and allow consumers to inspect texture, quality, and packaging directly. In-store tastings and promotions drive impulse purchases, while foodservice and catering businesses rely heavily on offline wholesale networks for bulk buying. In emerging markets where digital penetration is limited, offline channels remain the primary access point. However, online channels are projected to grow much faster at 8.4% CAGR during 2025-2032.

Expanding smartphone and internet usage is boosting digital grocery shopping, with platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and regional e-commerce leaders increasing availability. Subscription models and direct-to-consumer strategies are particularly effective for dehydrated products such as emergency kits and health-focused snacks. Millennials and Gen Z are key adopters, while digital marketing, influencer campaigns, and personalized recommendations enhance repeat purchases, enabling brands to reach untapped markets without physical presence.
