[TITLE]Holiday 2025: What Retailers and Prognosticators Expect:
[TEXT]
Retailers are heading into the heart of the holiday season with a heap of concerns, from consumers cutting back on non-essentials and anxious over the economy, to higher prices from tariffs, inflation and potential stockouts.

Yet many retailers expect to pull through the 2025 holiday season with satisfactory, if modest, gains. Walmart, Amazon, Gap, TJX and Ross Stores have raised guidance for the year, reflecting confidence in the fourth quarter. And other retailers that have been performing well this year — Aritzia, Vuori, Primark, Bloomingdale’s, Abercrombie & Fitch, Costco and Ann Taylor-parent Knitwell should emerge from the 2025 holiday season in decent shape.

Several factors will fuel holiday gains. The S&P 500 index is up 11 percent this year, adding to the nation’s wealth factor. Also, newer channels for shopping, i.e. agentic commerce, are gaining traction, and channels that have around for awhile — like mobile shopping, social media apps such as TikTok, livestreaming, and the resale market — continue to increase in popularity. AI is also making it easier to personalize the shopping experience. So whatever makes shopping faster, easier and more convenient will stimulate purchasing.

An Undercurrent of Uneasiness

America’s mood is a bit brighter since the government shutdown ended, yet there remains an undercurrent of uneasiness over rising health, home and food costs, and the possibility of the economy deteriorating next year.

“Economic uncertainty keeps the brain and nervous system in a constant state of anxiety and alertness. This makes it harder for people to manage holiday shopping and planning. Thus, we can’t simply enjoy the season,” said Dr. Hannah Nearney, clinical psychiatrist and U.K medical director at Flow Neuroscience, which develops brain stimulation solutions for mental well-being, in a statement.

Still, retailers say consumers and their shopping patterns have shown resilience.

“While we do study data that suggests there’s macro pressure, particularly on the low-income consumer, our customers are really responding to our price, value and style,” Richard Dickson, president and chief executive officer of Gap Inc., told WWD last week after the company reported robust third-quarter sales. “Our offerings are breaking through the competitive landscape so we’re feeling very confident and excited as we head into the holiday season.”

But there’s plenty to keep brands and retailers on their guard.

“Between tariffs, inflation, the shutdown and the situation at Saks Global, there’s been a lot to worry about,” one chief executive of a major brand told WWD, referencing Saks’ sales declines and late payments to vendors. “With the price changes, we were expecting a drop in unit sales, but we really haven’t seen that, so it seems any increase has been received better than expected. Our numbers have been pretty good, so that’s a positive for going forward.”

One senior level apparel executive said the consumer prices at his brand are up this holiday season by 7 to 10 percent, though others in the supply chain would have absorbed some of the costs created by new tariffs.

“I feel we have a very solid season in front of us,” said Michael Kliger, CEO of LuxExperience, operator of the Mytheresa, Net-a-porter and Mr Porter websites, last week, after the company reported its fiscal first-quarter results. “At Mytheresa, Q1 was plus 12 percent, and even though we are still negative at Net-a-porter and Mr Porter, we clearly see momentum in that business. We are just coming from a lower base, so not including any negative macro effects, we’re looking at a solid season. The U.S. continues to be quite strong. Europe continues to be very stable, with single-digit growth and Asia, we feel, has reached the bottom. It’s stable at a low level, but it’s stable.”

Off-price stores, as well as dollar stores, appear headed for a decent holiday season. “Ross posted a stronger quarter than expected, with results showing that its core value shopper remained resilient despite lapsed SNAP [food stamp] benefits and broader tariff uncertainty weighing on household budgets,” said Suzy Davidkhanian, vice president of Emarketer, in an email. “Opportunistic buys and department-store excess helped margins and Ross’s no-frills, warehouse-style stores delivered exactly what budget-conscious families needed this season — strong, compelling assortment mix at sharp price points. Holiday gifting may still skew toward essentials for this shopper, but the quarter underscores that the lower-income consumer is holding up better than many feared.”

Modest Holiday Sales Gains Seen

The National Retail Federation predicts that retail sales for the November and December period will grow between 3.7 percent and 4.2 percent, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time in 2025. The trade organization also expects 186.9 million people in the U.S. will shop at one point or another during the Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday period, which is 3.5 million more than last year.

But not all industry sources are as sanguine. Deloitte projects holiday sales growth of just 2.9 to 3.4 percent, and others are even more bearish.

Target, which is one of the largest retailers in the country, sees its sales declining by a low single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter. The discounter is being impacted by both macro issues and its own internal merchandising issues.

Home Depot’s results, too, are not very encouraging. While the home improvement chain is believed to be gaining some market share, Home Depot’s third-quarter comparable sales in the U.S. rose just 0.1 percent, and net earnings were flat. “Our results missed our expectations primarily due to the lack of storms in the third quarter, which resulted in greater than expected pressure in certain categories. Additionally, while underlying demand in the business remained relatively stable sequentially, an expected increase in demand in the third quarter did not materialize,” said Ted Decker, chairman, president and CEO, in a statement. “We believe that consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand.” Bed, Bath & Beyond also experienced a tough third quarter. Its net revenue declined 17.4 percent due to lower customer demand, though the company did cite significant operational improvements, including an 85 percent improvement in both adjusted EBITDA and gross margin.

Digging further into NRF’s outlook, the percent gain for the holiday season the trade organization forecasts is lower than the 4.3 percent gain experienced last year. Also, the U.S. inflation rate is just over 3 percent and on the rise lately. That means that “real” holiday retail sales will grow around 1 percent, based on NRF’s projection for nominal sales which are not adjusted for inflation.

Once again, the annual shopping extravaganza known as “Black Friday” is nearly upon us, this year falling on November 28. But the sales are already well underway.

What started as a single-day discounted shopping event on the Friday after Thanksgiving in the United States has blown out to a week-long sales festival, in stores and online. And it has spread around much of the world – including to Australia.

It might feel like a great time to try to score a bargain. But this week, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) put retailers on notice. The consumer watchdog announced it would be watching out for various kinds of misleading sales conduct that can be used to trick consumers.

If found to be engaging in misleading or deceptive sales conduct, retailers may face heavy financial penalties. But as a consumer, it also pays to understand how these dodgy tactics work, so you can’t be duped this sales season.

Dodgy sales tactics

The ACCC says it is on the lookout for a range of misleading or deceptive sales advertising tactics. Examples include:

advertising sales as “storewide” when only some items are discounted

countdown clocks or timers that show a shorter period than the actual sale (to create false urgency)

fine-print disclaimers that exclude some items from the sale

“up to X% off” discounts that only apply to a few items (or the “up to” text is not prominently displayed)

price comparisons of before and after sale discounts that are not accurate (including where the price has gone up in a short period before the discount was applied).

Sadly, there are many examples of allegedly misleading sales conduct occurring at peak shopping periods.

Following a similar sweep of last year’s Black Friday sales, the ACCC recently fined three retailers for allegedly misleading customers by advertising discounts as “storewide” when only some items were on sale.

In 2019, the online marketplace Kogan offered a “tax time” discount of 10% on products that had had their price increased immediately before the promotion (by at least 10% in most cases). It was subsequently fined A$350,000 for misleading conduct in breach of Australian Consumer Law.

Why is the ACCC so strict about this kind of conduct?

These examples of dodgy conduct might seem annoying. But they don’t seem earth-shatteringly bad – such as selling physically dangerous products.

Why is the ACCC so concerned about misleading conduct at Black Friday sale time, and indeed retail pricing more generally?

Shouldn’t consumers just be more careful? The answer lies in the cumulative harms of misleading pricing conduct.

Manipulating consumers through marketing

Sales rely on consumers thinking they are getting a good deal on products they want. And sometimes sales marketing seeks to persuade consumers the deal is better than it really is.

Marketing strategies such as countdown timers, strike-through prices or promoted large percentage discounts are designed to appeal to consumers’ emotions and to rush them into closing off a purchase.

About the author Jeannie Marie Paterson is a Professor of Law (consumer protections and credit law) at the University of Melbourne. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.

Consumers with heightened emotions or feeling pressure to grab a deal are less likely to make a rational assessment of the real value of the discount being offered to them. This is why truth in sales advertising is so important.

What consumer protection laws are for

We have strong protections against misleading conduct in Australia for good reason. If sellers can trick consumers into buying goods at discounts that are actually illusory, those dishonest sellers gain an advantage over honest sellers selling at a transparent and accurate price.

This risks a market that rewards poor conduct and encourages an overall rush to the bottom.

Consumers shouldn’t have to assume they are going to be tricked by sellers ( AFP via Getty )

Australian Consumer Law takes the view that consumers should be able to take the advertisements they see at face value.

Consumers shouldn’t have to assume they are going to be tricked by sellers.

Such an approach would not conform to the object of enhancing the “welfare of Australians” through “the promotion of competition and fair trading” that underlies Australian Consumer Law.

Stopping a bad deal

If you are considering buying goods at the Black Friday sales, it is a good idea to screenshot the item before it goes on sale. That way, you can check if the sale discount is genuine and the item is actually the same as the one you want (not an older or cheaper model).

When shopping at a sale, take time to look at the discount offered. Is it a real discount? Does it justify the spend coming up to the holiday period? Discounts may be marked up in an attractive colour but still not represent good value.

Finally, if you think you have been misled by a pricing strategy, such as a discount that isn’t genuine or a fine-print qualification on the discount that is advertised, you can complain to the ACCC.

Ideally, take screenshots of what was advertised and what you received to support your claim to be treated fairly at sales time.

[TITLE]Jingle Bags, Jingle Bags: Kate Spade’s Black Friday Sale (up to 50% Off) Will Take Care of All Your Holiday Gifting Needs:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

Welcome to Black Friday week, a veritable celebration for every shopping-obsessed fashionista out there. Chances are, you’re using this week to get ahead of your holiday shopping — making a list and checking it twice to ensure everyone from your mom to your wife or sister gets the best of the best in 2025. Our recommendation? Treating her to Kate Spade‘s finest… at up to 50 percent off, no less, as part of the iconic label’s Black Friday sales event this year.

From November 24 to November 29, select leather goods from the brand will go for 30 to 50 percent off, while ready-to-wear fashions are up to 50 percent off, footwear is 40 percent off, and many pieces that already saw a markdown will be blessed by an additional half-off discount. Seems to good to be true, doesn’t it? Know that there are no gimmicks here: only Kate Spade’s sophisticated, feminine aesthetic and no shortage of ways in which to flaunt (and style!) it for the holiday season.

In case you somehow miss the Kate Spade Black Friday sale, you have one more chance to save big, with its Cyber Monday event (running from November 30 to December 2). The terms, conditions, and perks are identical to the sale’s Black Friday counterpart. The only difference? You’ll see even more instantly covetable styles added to Kate Spade’s online selections.

Case in point: The Liv Shoulder Bag, which was recently worn by none other than tastemaker Olivia Rodrigo, is an added 50 percent off right now, and you can snag it for every style-savvy woman in your life in the on-trend leopard print, large-and-slouchy hobo iteration, the very same butter-yellow hue that appeared in the hand of Lola Tung this summer, and many other versions. Amidst Kate Spade’s online sale aisles, you will also find no shortage of other leather-clad shoulder bag silhouettes, including the Grace Shoulder Bag — which is one of the most sleek and sophisticated purses we’ve spotted all year.

And because your giftee will certainly want to pair her new Kate Spade acquisition with more from the brand, in the form of perfect-for-winter footwear styles and glittering accessories, the Kate Spade Black Friday sale has some of that, too. Peep its selection of sensible loafers, for instance, and the Signature Mule Sneakers that help its wearers stay comfortable on their feet all day while tapping into the intersection of the sporty and the polished. They’ll be grateful for the shoes’ slip-on-and-go ease, no doubt donning them for many seasons and years on end… and thinking

[TITLE]G20 fails to deliver on sovereign debt distress:
[TEXT]
As total debt in developing countries has risen to a record high, there is frustration that existing frameworks, dominated by Western governments, have exerted undue influence over the repayment policies.

Heads of state from the world’s most powerful countries gathered in Johannesburg, South Africa, over the weekend for a summit that had been billed, under South Africa’s G20 presidency, as a turning point for addressing debt distress across the Global South.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa had consistently framed the issue as central to his agenda, arguing that spiralling repayment costs have left governments, particularly in Africa, with little room to fund essential services like healthcare and education.

But despite repeated pledges – including in the leaders’ summit declaration to “strengthen the implementation of the G20 Common Framework” – South Africa did not deliver any new proposals for easing fiscal constraints in indebted nations.

Hopes that world leaders would use the G20 summit to tackle sovereign debt distress were further dashed when United States President Donald Trump, at odds with South Africa over domestic policies, skipped the meeting altogether amid Washington’s retreat from multilateralism.

The summit also marked the close of a brief period of Global South leadership in the G20, following presidencies held by Indonesia in 2022, India in 2023, and Brazil in 2024. The US is set to assume the G20 presidency on December 1.

Debt ‘vulnerabilities’

The G20 – which consists of 19 advanced and emerging economies, the European Union and the African Union – represents 85 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and roughly two-thirds of the world’s population.

In October, G20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs met in Washington and agreed to a consensus statement on debt.

“We recognise that a high level of debt is one of the obstacles to inclusive growth in many developing economies, which limits their ability to invest in infrastructure, disaster resilience, healthcare, education and other development needs,” the statement said.

It also pledged to “reaffirm our commitment to support efforts by low- and middle-income countries to address debt vulnerabilities in an effective, comprehensive and systematic manner”.

The communique committed to improving the much-criticised Common Framework, a mechanism launched by the G20 five years ago to accelerate and simplify debt restructuring – when countries have to reprofile debts they can no longer afford to repay.

Elsewhere, the statement advocated for greater transparency around debt reporting and more lending from regional development banks.

Record-high debt levels

According to the Institute of International Finance, a banking industry association, total debt in developing countries rose to a record high of $109 trillion by mid-2025.

In recent years, COVID-19, climate shocks and rising food prices have forced many poor countries to rely on debt to stabilise their economies, crowding out other investments. For instance, the United Nations recently calculated that more than 40 percent of African governments spend more on servicing debt than they do on healthcare.

Africa also faces high borrowing costs. In 2023, bond yields – the interest on government debt – averaged 6.8 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 9.8 percent in Africa.

Meanwhile, Africa collectively needs $143bn every year in climate finance to meet its Paris Agreement goals. In 2022, it received approximately $44bn.

At the same time, countries on the continent spent almost $90bn servicing external debt in 2024.

No progress

Shortly before the release of the G20’s final communique, 165 charities condemned the group’s slow progress on debt sustainability and urged President Ramaphosa to implement reforms before transferring the G20 presidency over to the US in December.

“While this year’s G20 has been put forward as an ‘African G20’, there is no evidence that any progress has been made on the debt crisis facing Africa and many other countries worldwide during the South African presidency,” the group said in a letter.

The missive called on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to sell its gold reserves and set up a debt relief fund for distressed governments. It also backed the creation of a ‘borrowers club’ to facilitate cooperation among low-income countries.

The call for a unified debtor body reflects growing frustration with existing frameworks, notably the Paris Club, in which mostly Western governments, but not China, have exerted undue influence over the repayment policies of debtor nations.

In May 2020, the G20 launched a multibillion-dollar repayment pause to help poor countries cope with the COVID‑19 crisis. Known as the Debt Service Suspension Initiative, the programme is continuing to provide relief to some participating countries.

The launch of the Common Framework, soon afterwards, was designed to coordinate debt relief among all creditors. At the time, the initiative was hailed as a breakthrough, bringing together the Paris Club, China and private creditors to help prevent a full-blown debt crisis in developing countries.

But coordinating equal treatment, including government lenders, commercial banks, and bondholders, has made the process slow and prone to setbacks.

To date, none of the countries that joined the Common Framework – Ethiopia, Zambia, Ghana, and Chad – have completed their debt restructuring deals.

And even then, the programme has relieved just 7 percent of the debt costs for the four participating nations, according to ONE Campaign, an advocacy group.

‘Outmanoeuvred’

In March, South Africa convened an expert panel – headed by a former finance minister and a former Kenyan central banker – to explore how to assist heavily indebted low-income countries, particularly in Africa.

In a report released earlier this month, the panel echoed many of the ideas put forward by the 165 charities that wrote to Ramaphosa in October, calling for measures like an IMF-backed special debt fund and the formation of a debtors’ club.

But the experts’ proposals “weren’t even acknowledged at the leaders’ summit”, Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center, told Al Jazeera. He said that the G20 presidency “failed to address the scale of the global debt problem”.

“Ultimately,” Gallagher added, “South Africa was outmanoeuvred by larger, more economically important members of the G20 who saw little benefit to themselves in reforming the international financial architecture on debt.”

‘Double whammy’ of debt

In the early 2000s, the IMF, World Bank and some Paris Club creditors cancelled more than $75bn of debt – roughly 40 percent of external obligations – under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.

Since then, however, many developing countries have slipped back into the red. After the 2008 financial crisis, private creditors poured money into low-income economies, steadily replacing the cheaper loans once offered by institutions like the World Bank.

Between 2020 and 2025, almost 40 percent of external public debt repayments from lower-income countries went to commercial lenders. Just one-third went to multilateral institutions, according to Debt Justice, a United Kingdom-based charity.

China has also emerged as the world’s largest single creditor, especially in the Global South, committing more than $472bn through its policy banks – such as the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank – between 2008 and 2024.

“On top of debt becoming more expensive over the past 10 or 15 years, there is now a wider universe of lenders that developing countries have turned to,” says Iolanda Fresnillo, a policy and advocacy manager at Eurodad, a civil society organisation.

“It’s been a double whammy. Debt is now costlier and harder to resolve,” she said, noting the difficulty of coordinating creditors in a restructuring. Protracted debt crises slow growth by squeezing public investment.

Overcoming these hurdles is made harder when creditors pursue competing commercial interests. Fresnillo says an independent debt-restructuring body, designed to shorten negotiation times and limit economic costs, could help.

In September, the head of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Rebeca Grynspan, said, “There is no permanent institution or system that is there all the time dealing with debt restructuring … maybe we can create new momentum.”

However, talk of an international sovereign debt restructuring mechanism isn’t new. The IMF spearheaded a push for a neutral body – which would be akin to a US bankruptcy court – in the late 1990s.

The Fund’s proposed restructuring mechanism faced swift pushback. Major creditor countries, particularly the US, opposed ceding power to an international body that could override its legal system and weaken protections for US investors.

Still, “the need for this type of international solution is obvious”, says Fresnillo. “Having a basic set of rules, as opposed to an ad hoc negotiation for every new debt crisis, should be a bare minimum.”

“But with multilateral cooperation so weak right now, I wouldn’t hold my breath,” she added.

Exclusive: Bessent Says Trump Administration Has Conquered ‘Three I’s’ That Were ‘Eviscerating Working Americans’

breitbart ^ | Carney24 Nov 20257 | John Carney

Posted on by SoConPubbie

The Trump administration has successfully addressed the “three I’s” that he said were devastating working-class Americans: immigration, interest rates, and inflation, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an exclusive interview with Breitbart Business Digest co-authors Alex Marlow and John Carney released Monday.

Bessent pointed to a March 2024 article he wrote for Fox Digital titled “How the Three I’s Are Eviscerating Working Americans” as the framework for understanding the administration’s economic progress.

“Immigration, interest rates and inflation,” Bessent said, ticking off the three factors. On immigration: “Borders closed, promise made, promise kept.”

On interest rates, Bessent noted that the 10-year Treasury yield stood at 5.08 percent when Trump took office and now sits around 4 percent. “Mortgage rates key off of that,” he said, adding that he believes short-term interest rates could decline further.

Inflation to “Bite the Dust” in Coming Months

The Treasury Secretary expressed strong confidence

[TITLE]Holiday 2025: What Retailers and Prognosticators Expect:
[TEXT]
Retailers are heading into the heart of the holiday season with a heap of concerns, from consumers cutting back on non-essentials and anxious over the economy, to higher prices from tariffs, inflation and potential stockouts.

Yet many retailers expect to pull through the 2025 holiday season with satisfactory, if modest, gains. Walmart, Amazon, Gap, TJX and Ross Stores have raised guidance for the year, reflecting confidence in the fourth quarter. And other retailers that have been performing well this year — Aritzia, Vuori, Primark, Bloomingdale’s, Abercrombie & Fitch, Costco and Ann Taylor-parent Knitwell should emerge from the 2025 holiday season in decent shape.

Several factors will fuel holiday gains. The S&P 500 index is up 11 percent this year, adding to the nation’s wealth factor. Also, newer channels for shopping, i.e. agentic commerce, are gaining traction, and channels that have around for awhile — like mobile shopping, social media apps such as TikTok, livestreaming, and the resale market — continue to increase in popularity. AI is also making it easier to personalize the shopping experience. So whatever makes shopping faster, easier and more convenient will stimulate purchasing.

An Undercurrent of Uneasiness

America’s mood is a bit brighter since the government shutdown ended, yet there remains an undercurrent of uneasiness over rising health, home and food costs, and the possibility of the economy deteriorating next year.

“Economic uncertainty keeps the brain and nervous system in a constant state of anxiety and alertness. This makes it harder for people to manage holiday shopping and planning. Thus, we can’t simply enjoy the season,” said Dr. Hannah Nearney, clinical psychiatrist and U.K medical director at Flow Neuroscience, which develops brain stimulation solutions for mental well-being, in a statement.

Still, retailers say consumers and their shopping patterns have shown resilience.

“While we do study data that suggests there’s macro pressure, particularly on the low-income consumer, our customers are really responding to our price, value and style,” Richard Dickson, president and chief executive officer of Gap Inc., told WWD last week after the company reported robust third-quarter sales. “Our offerings are breaking through the competitive landscape so we’re feeling very confident and excited as we head into the holiday season.”

From Old Navy’s holiday campaign.

But there’s plenty to keep brands and retailers on their guard.

“Between tariffs, inflation, the shutdown and the situation at Saks Global, there’s been a lot to worry about,” one chief executive of a major brand told WWD, referencing Saks’ sales declines and late payments to vendors. “With the price changes, we were expecting a drop in unit sales, but we really haven’t seen that, so it seems any increase has been received better than expected. Our numbers have been pretty good, so that’s a positive for going forward.”

One senior level apparel executive said the consumer prices at his brand are up this holiday season by 7 to 10 percent, though others in the supply chain would have absorbed some of the costs created by new tariffs.

“I feel we have a very solid season in front of us,” said Michael Kliger, CEO of LuxExperience, operator of the Mytheresa, Net-a-porter and Mr Porter websites, last week, after the company reported its fiscal first-quarter results. “At Mytheresa, Q1 was plus 12 percent, and even though we are still negative at Net-a-porter and Mr Porter, we clearly see momentum in that business. We are just coming from a lower base, so not including any negative macro effects, we’re looking at a solid season. The U.S. continues to be quite strong. Europe continues to be very stable, with single-digit growth and Asia, we feel, has reached the bottom. It’s stable at a low level, but it’s stable.”

Off-price stores, as well as dollar stores, appear headed for a decent holiday season. “Ross posted a stronger quarter than expected, with results showing that its core value shopper remained resilient despite lapsed SNAP [food stamp] benefits and broader tariff uncertainty weighing on household budgets,” said Suzy Davidkhanian, vice president of Emarketer, in an email. “Opportunistic buys and department-store excess helped margins and Ross’s no-frills, warehouse-style stores delivered exactly what budget-conscious families needed this season — strong, compelling assortment mix at sharp price points. Holiday gifting may still skew toward essentials for this shopper, but the quarter underscores that the lower-income consumer is holding up better than many feared.”

Modest Holiday Sales Gains Seen

The National Retail Federation predicts that retail sales for the November and December period will grow between 3.7 percent and 4.2 percent, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time in 2025. The trade organization also expects 186.9 million people in the U.S. will shop at one point or another during the Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday period, which is 3.5 million more than last year.

But not all industry sources are as sanguine. Deloitte projects holiday sales growth of just 2.9 to 3.4 percent, and others are even more bearish.

Target, which is one of the largest retailers in the country, sees its sales declining by a low single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter. The discounter is being impacted by both macro issues and its own internal merchandising issues.

Home Depot’s results, too, are not very encouraging. While the home improvement chain is believed to be gaining some market share, Home Depot’s third-quarter comparable sales in the U.S. rose just 0.1 percent, and net earnings were flat. “Our results missed our expectations primarily due to the lack of storms in the third quarter, which resulted in greater than expected pressure in certain categories. Additionally, while underlying demand in the business remained relatively stable sequentially, an expected increase in demand in the third quarter did not materialize,” said Ted Decker, chairman, president and CEO, in a statement. “We believe that consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand.” Bed, Bath & Beyond also experienced a tough third quarter. Its net revenue declined 17.4 percent due to lower customer demand, though the company did cite significant operational improvements, including an 85 percent improvement in both adjusted EBITDA and gross margin.

Digging further into NRF’s outlook, the percent gain for the holiday season the trade organization forecasts is lower than the 4.3 percent gain experienced last year. Also, the U.S. inflation rate is just over 3 percent and on the rise lately. That means that “real” holiday retail sales will grow around 1 percent, based on NRF’s projection for nominal sales which are not adjusted for inflation.

Still, consumers show a willingness to spend even while being pickier, and worried

Babe, wake up: Black Friday deals are starting to crop up before November 28, which is when the official, post-Thanksgiving shopping holiday is actually taking place. What this means for sneakerheads and footwear aficionados everywhere? The shoes of your dreams are right around the corner — beckoning to be bought for some of their lowest prices to date. And the best part? We’re here to guide you to the most worth-it Black Friday footwear deals this year, cutting through the noise of inflated markdowns and getting right down to the good stuff, in the form of extra-25-percent-off sales on Nike sneakers (code BFRIDAY at checkout, you’re welcome), up to 60 percent off on top adidas styles until November 29, no shortage of Amazon-exclusive sales on cult-fave shoe brands like HeyDude, and so much more.

Other major retailers like Zappos, too, are hosting their very own Black Friday sales events. The shoe industry giant features savings of up to 40 percent off on all your most coveted brands (yes, this means Ecco, Steve Madden, Converse, Veja, and beyond). If you’re into On’s offerings, as our editors are, its site currently flaunts never-before-seen deals on silhouettes like the Cloudsurfer Next, a version of the Cloudsurfer Max shoe this writer right here can’t stop wearing. Allbirds is also blessing its card-carrying fan club members with up to half off on flats, Merino wool–powered sneakers, and other social media darlings.
