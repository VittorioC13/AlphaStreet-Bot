[TITLE]Princes Group unveils London listing in major vote of confidence in UK economy:
[TEXT]
Princes Group - leading manufacturer known for producing tinned tuna and Napolina tomatoes - lists on London Stock Exchange in major vote of confidence in UK’s capital markets.

The IPO will help drive growth and investment in key sectors – reflecting the Government’s modern Industrial Strategy and Plan for Change.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle calls Princes Group a ‘Great British success story’ and calls for more firms to follow in their footsteps.

In a major vote of confidence in UK capital markets, Princes Group has listed today on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in a move that cements the City’s position as a leading hub for global capital.

Today, Business Secretary Peter Kyle joined Princes Group at the LSE for its market debut, where he delivered a speech and championed the long-established company as a “great British success story”.

The listing on the LSE of the manufacturer of some of Britain’s best loved brands is a boost for the government’s modern Industrial Strategy and will help leverage further investment into the UK, in particular the food and drink and advanced manufacturing sectors.

The news builds on Make UK and RSM UK’s positive findings this week that more than a third of manufacturing firms will accelerate investment projects as a direct result of the government’s modern Industrial Strategy.

London is making a strong comeback following the government’s capital market reforms, which includes modernising UK listing rules to provide firms more flexibility to raise capital, reforming the rulebook for wholesale markets to improve liquidity for UK listed companies, as well as cutting paperwork and making it easier for companies to raise larger sums.

It follows a trend of more companies turning to the City to list and raise capital, including Shawbrook, Metlen, Fermi and The Beauty Tech Group - and more expected to follow.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

The London Stock Exchange is a renowned global trading hub and the Princes Group is a great British success story. The firm’s decision to list is not only a huge vote of confidence in this Government’s reforms to capital markets but in British business. With the FTSE 100 continuing to trade close to all-time highs, we’re making sure the UK is the best place in the world for businesses to start, scale, list and stay. I want this to just be the start – with more firms following in their footsteps and choosing London as the financial home for their thriving futures.

Angelo Mastrolia, Executive Chair of Princes Group said:

Choosing to list in London is a natural step for Princes group. Around 70% of our revenues come from the UK, which remains our largest and most dynamic market. London offers deep liquidity, a world-class regulatory environment, and access to a broad international investor base, making it the ideal home for our next stage of growth.

London remains the first listing choice for UK and international companies, with 91% of UK-incorporated public company IPOs listing in the UK between 2017–2022. London is also a leading hub for global capital and the largest equity capital market in Europe, consistently ranking among the world’s top exchanges and outperforming all other European centres every year for the past two decades.

With thousands of employees working at Princes Group facilities across the UK, including its HQ at the iconic Royal Liver Building in Liverpool, today’s announcement delivers a significant boost for the workforce and reinforces support for local communities and future growth.

Since entering office, the government has been focused on restoring economic stability and encouraging British businesses to grow and expand to reach their full potential, backing the Plan for Change.

[TITLE]Gran Tierra Energy Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results and Announces Further Exploration Success in Ecuador:
[TEXT]
Gran Tierra Secures $200 Million Prepayment Facility Highlighting Strength of Portfolio

Increase and Extension of Canadian Credit Facility

Three Major Ecuador Discoveries Add to the Existing Success in Country

Colombia’s Southern Putumayo Cohembi Field Achieves Highest Production in a Decade

CALGARY, Alberta, Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (“Gran Tierra” or the “Company”) (NYSE American:GTE) (TSX:GTE) (LSE: GTE) announced the Company’s financial and operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 (the “Quarter”) and provided an operational update. All dollar amounts are in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and all production volumes are on an average working interest before royalties (“WI”) basis unless otherwise indicated. Production is expressed in barrels (“bbl”) of oil equivalent (“boe”) per day (“boepd” or “boe/d”) and are based on WI sales before royalties. For per boe amounts based on net after royalty (“NAR”) production, see Gran Tierra’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed October 30, 2025.

Message to Shareholders

“The Third Quarter showcased continued operational success across our portfolio. In Ecuador, we achieved further exploration success with the Conejo A-1 and A-2 wells and confirmed a new discovery at Chanangue-1, all of which highlight the significant potential of our acreage position. We also recently cased and cemented the Conejo A-2 well, targeting multiple prospective reservoirs including the Basal Tena and Hollin. The well discovered 41 feet of net reservoir with an average porosity of 13.8% in the Hollin formation suggesting well-connected reservoir quality over the full Conejo structural trap.

In Colombia, new wells at Costayaco continued to perform well, and the Cohembi field delivered a strong waterflood response, with production reaching levels not seen in over a decade. In Canada, we successfully drilled and brought two additional Lower Montney wells onstream, both meeting or exceeding expectations.

Production during the Quarter was temporarily impacted primarily by externally driven events, including a landslide in Ecuador that required the shut in of all Ecuador production for several weeks and trunk line repairs at the Moqueta field which resulted in the field being shut in for the Quarter. These volumes represent deferred bbls rather than lost production, and we are already seeing a strong recovery, with current production(2) averaging approximately 45,200 boepd. Based on the deferrals, we are forecasting the lower end of our production guidance range. The underlying assets continue to perform well, and our teams remain focused on ongoing optimization and maximizing production efficiency and cash flow with an expected exit rate of 47,000 to 50,000 boepd. We completed a number of initiatives to enhance liquidity and will be releasing our 2026 budget in mid December which will focus on free cash flow generation. The 2025 capital program was focused on fulfilling exploration commitments, which resulted in numerous material discoveries, and facility construction primarily in the Suroriente Block. With substantially all commitments behind us, the focus turns to free cash flow generation from our substantial, diversified resource base and deleveraging,” commented Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra Energy.

Operational Update:

Ecuador Another successful exploration well, Conejo A-1 was drilled during the Quarter on budget. The well was subsequently completed and tested the Hollin and Basal Tena sands. The Basal Tena and Hollin oil zones perforated over 19 feet (“ ft ”) and 40 ft of reservoir, respectively. Under natural flow conditions, the well has produced at stabilized rates over 308 hours at 1,328 bbls of oil per day (“ bopd ”), 26.9-degree API gravity oil, a 23.7% water cut, and a gas-oil ratio of 289 standard cubic feet per stock tank barrel. During the fourth quarter, the Company plans to re-enter the well to install the final completion and conduct selective testing of each zone to optimize total well production. The Conejo A-2 well was spud on October 4, 2025, targeting multiple prospective reservoirs including the Basal Tena and Hollin. The well included coring of key intervals to further evaluate reservoir characteristics and potential. The Conejo A-2 well discovered 41 ft of net reservoir with an average porosity of 13.8% in the Hollin formation. Of particular interest is the outstanding reservoir quality suggesting high deliverability over the full Conejo structural trap. With the delivery of the Conejo A-2 well, Gran Tierra has completed all of the Exploration commitments in Ecuador and we are now well-positioned to continue to increase production into the development phase and establish our long-term growth position in Ecuador. A new oil discovery was made in the legacy Chanangue-1 well drilled in 1990 and suspended in 1992 on the Chanangue Block. The well was re-entered to test the previously bypassed Basal Tena formation, which was subsequently perforated and brought online. The well is currently producing approximately 600 bopd on jet pump. This discovery highlights significant reserve potential and is expected to generate additional future drilling opportunities on the eastern side of the Chanangue Block.

Colombia During the Quarter, Gran Tierra’s development program in the northern area of the Costayaco field continued to perform well, with all three new wells contributing to production growth. The Costayaco-63, -64, and -65 wells were drilled and brought onstream between late June to mid-August, achieving average initial 30-day oil rates ranging from approximately 600 to 1,100 bopd with water cuts between 25% and 70%. Combined production from these wells during the Quarter averaged approximately 1,700 bopd with an average water cut of around 60%, helping sustain stable field output. We are currently changing the artificial lift system from jet pump to electronic submersible pumps which is expected to add an incremental 1,000 - 1,500 bopd. Cohembi continues to deliver a strong waterflood response, with the five development wells drilled during the first half of 2025. Output from the northern area has increased by approximately 135%, rising from 2,800 to 6,700 gross bopd, with additional gains anticipated. Total field production has now exceeded 9,000 gross bopd – levels not achieved since 2014. Drilling has commenced a 6-well program which includes the Raju-1 exploration well, the 2nd well in the program, which is expected to spud in early November. The Raju-1 exploration well will be targeting a large prospective area north of the current development. We expect to have initial results from this well prior to year end 2025.

Canada Two additional Lower Montney wells were drilled, completed, and brought on stream in September, bringing total 2025 activity in Simonette to 4.0 gross (2.0 net) wells. Initial production performance has been very encouraging, with one well exceeding high-case expectations and another tracking closely to the base case and still cleaning up.

Capital Structure Optimization:

Executed Oriente Crude Oil Agreements providing for an initial advance of up to $150 million and an additional $50 million, to be repaid through scheduled deliveries of Ecuadorian Oriente crude oil; proceeds are expected to be used to repay debt and fund select capital initiatives.

Amended Colombian credit facility to align with the new prepayment structure, enhancing financial flexibility, reducing standby costs, and optimizing Gran Tierra’s overall capital structure.

Subsequent to the Quarter, the Company amended and restated the existing credit agreement of Gran Tierra Canada Ltd. (“ GT Canada ”) pursuant to a second amended and restated credit agreement dated October 30, 2025 to, among other things, increase the total available borrowing capacity available under its credit facilities (the “Canadian Credit Facilities”) from C$50.0 million to C$75.0 million. Other key amendments to the Canadian Credit Facilities as a result of such amendment and restatement are summarized as follows: The tenor of the Canadian Credit Facilities was extended by one year and converted from a “one year revolving facility with a one year term-out period” into a “two year revolving facility” with a maturity date of October 31, 2027; GT Canada’s lender completed its semi-annual borrowing base review, which resulted in the borrowing base remaining at C$100.0 million; and The existing uncommitted accordion feature (which contemplates a further increase of the Canadian Credit Facilities) was reduced from C$50.0 million to C$25.0 million.

Key Highlights of the Quarter:

Production: Gran Tierra’s total average WI production was 42,685 boepd, which was 30% higher than the third quarter of 2024 due to the production from the Canadian operations acquired on October 31, 2024 and positive exploration well drilling results in Ecuador. Total average WI production was 10% lower than the quarter ended June 30, 2025 (the “ Prior Quarter ”) primarily as a result of a landslide in Ecuador that required the shut in of all Ecuador production for several weeks and trunk line repairs at the Moqueta field which resulted in the field being shut in for the Quarter. Working interest sales in the Quarter were 44,077 boepd primarily due to the recognition of 143,730 bbls of Ecuador oil production, which were held in inventory at the end of June and subsequently sold in July.

We continue to generate momentum in key end markets, optimize operational efficiencies across our businesses, and drive strong contributions from our recent acquisitions.”

Mr. Lowe continued, “Through our recent refinancing and equity raise, we have strengthened our balance sheet giving us greater capacity to invest in growth, both organically and through disciplined M&A, where we continue to see a robust pipeline of attractive opportunities. Additionally, we continue to progress on several key organic initiatives, including the expansion plans for our Engineered Air Movement businesses and launch of the Olympus Max product.”

Mr. Lowe further commented, “Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2025, we remain confident in the strength of customer demand and our operational momentum. As a result, we are once again raising our full-year 2025 earnings guidance, including Adjusted EBITDA* to a range of $495 to $515 million — representing an approximately 20% year-over-year increase at the midpoint.

Segment Overview:

HVAC

Three months ended ($ millions) Q3 2025 Q3 2024 Revenue $ 387.4 $ 335.3 • Organic 9.0 % • Inorganic 6.7 % • Currency (0.2 )% Total Growth 15.5 % Segment income $ 94.4 $ 80.0 as a percent of revenues 24.4 % 23.9 % Change in bps 50bps

Third Quarter 2025

The revenue increase was primarily driven by:

an organic increase due predominantly to higher volumes of both heating and cooling products driven by continued strength in demand and higher throughput primarily resulting from increased production capacity; and

an inorganic increase from the acquisition of Sigma & Omega.

The segment income and segment income margin increases were due primarily to the revenue growth mentioned above and associated operating leverage.

Detection & Measurement

Three months ended ($ millions) Q3 2025 Q3 2024 Revenue $ 205.4 $ 148.4 • Organic 26.5 % • Inorganic 11.6 % • Currency 0.3 % Total Growth 38.4 % Segment income $ 51.7 $ 33.8 as a percent of revenues 25.2 % 22.8 % Change in bps 240bps

Third Quarter 2025

The revenue increase was primarily driven by:

an organic increase primarily due to higher project volumes within our communication technologies business; and

an inorganic increase from the acquisition of KTS.

The segment income and segment income margin increases were due primarily to the revenue growth mentioned above and associated leverage on our fixed costs, particularly within SG&A expenses. This increase was partially offset by the impact of a less favorable project mix primarily within our communication technologies and transportation systems businesses.

[TITLE]British Businesses to Save over £400m a Year as Government Slashes Electricity Costs:
[TEXT]
Government slashes electricity costs to save British businesses over £400m a year from April 2026 through landmark support under the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy.

UK industry including steel, chemicals, cement, glass and paper employing around 400,000 people to benefit from 90% discount on their electricity network charges.

Unprecedented support brings UK industrial energy costs in line with European competitors to protect jobs and attract new investment, helping drive growth and deliver Plan for Change.

Around 500 of the UK’s most energy-intensive businesses are set to save up to £420 million per year on their electricity bills from next April, as the Government takes decisive action to slash industrial energy costs.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle has today (31 October) announced that government will power ahead with plans to increase the discount on electricity network charges for businesses in sectors like steel, cement, glass, and chemicals, which employ around 400,000 people in total across the UK, from 60 percent to 90 percent.

Some of these businesses currently pay the highest industrial electricity prices in the G7, making it harder to stay competitive on the international stage, which is why the Government has taken decisive action to deliver this relief and level the playing field for industry.

The landmark support, which is being delivered at no extra cost to taxpayers, fulfils a crucial promise in the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy launched in June, and follows a four-week consultation on the plans for the increased discount which ran between July and August this year.

The increased discount will also slash costs for a range of businesses across Scotland and Wales to help them support local jobs and deliver growth, including Tata Steel at Port Talbot and INEOS in Grangemouth, ensuring the benefits are felt right across the country.

It comes on top of the Government’s landmark British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme announced in the modern Industrial Strategy, which will slash energy costs by 25 percent for over 7,000 businesses from 2027 in sectors like aerospace, automotive and chemicals, supporting hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs in these industries.

The Supercharger and British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will be funded through reforms to the energy system. The Government is reducing costs within the system to free up funding without raising household bills or taxes.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

British industry deserves a level playing field – and this government is delivering it. We’ve heard businesses loud and clear, and this landmark support will help them stay competitive on the global stage so they can invest and grow here in the UK. This is our Modern Industrial Strategy in action: practical, targeted support that secures jobs, attracts investment and drives our economy forward, as part of our Plan for Change.

Encirc Glass Managing Director Sean Murphy said:

This will be a major boost for our industry and will help British glass manufacturers compete with cheaper imports from regions that do not bear the same level of cost and regulation. By cutting the costs of energy in this way, the government is helping our industry to support thousands of jobs across the country whilst we make the transition to renewable sources of power. We welcomed the opportunity to engage with the Minister on the pressing challenges facing our sector. Continued government support for vital industries like glass manufacturing is essential to safeguarding jobs and unlocking investment across all regions of the UK.

Ben Martin, Policy Manager at the British Chambers of Commerce said:

Our research shows energy costs remain a major concern, forcing many businesses who are struggling to pay their bills to raise prices. Energy is a business essential not a luxury. The promise of cheaper bills for hundreds of energy-intensive firms through increasing the discount on electricity network charges is welcome.

Community Union Assistant General Secretary Alasdair McDiarmid said:

We welcome the government’s determination to reduce the industrial energy costs which are such a huge burden on energy-intensive industries like steel. Whilst there is still more to do, the decision to increase the level of compensation for network charging costs from 60% to 90% is a huge step in the right direction. This will help avert carbon leakage, and will go some way towards boosting the competitiveness of our steel producers in line with European counterparts. After long years of neglect, our members in the steel sector know that they now have a government which is on their side.

The increased discount under the Network Charging Compensation (NCC) Scheme will bring down electricity bills for businesses by slashing the prices they pay to access the UK’s electricity network.

This will help bring industrial energy prices in line with other major European economies to keep the UK competitive on the global stage, protect local jobs in the UK’s foundational industries, and attract new investment, delivering on the Government’s Plan for Change.

The Government is also driving forward plans to have a new Connections Accelerator Service in force by the end of 2025, which will streamline access to the UK’s electricity grid.

This will make it easier for major investment projects to speed up delivery, bringing new high-quality jobs and growth to local communities and boosting the UK’s investment attractiveness further.

[TITLE]Boeing pushes 777X jet deliveries to 2027 amid certification delays:

Boeing on Wednesday reported mixed third-quarter results, with higher aircraft deliveries and a growing order backlog offset by certification delays for its 777X jet

Boeing reported mixed third-quarter results on Wednesday, as higher aircraft deliveries and a growing backlog of orders were offset by continued certification delays for its 777X jets.

CEO Kelly Ortberg said the first delivery of its next generation of long-haul, wide-body jets is now expected in 2027 instead of 2026, resulting in a $4.9 billion charge in the quarter through September. But Ortberg emphasized in a call with analysts that the delays stemmed from the certification process, and not from any newly discovered technical issues.

“While we are disappointed in the 777 delays, it shouldn't overshadow the progress we're making," he said.

Ortberg said Boeing was making progress on stabilizing its production. The aerospace giant delivered 160 planes in the third quarter, the most quarterly deliveries since 2018. The same time last year, Boeing said it delivered 116 planes.

Boeing also reported that its backlog of orders, including 5,900 commercial planes, had grown to $636 billion in the third quarter.

“There’s strong demand in our products,” Ortberg said in an interview Wednesday morning with CNBC.

In September, the Federal Aviation Administration restored Boeing's ability to perform final safety checks and certify 737 Max jets for flight more than six years after two crashes of the then-new aircraft killed 346 people.

That decision was followed by the FAA's move this month to raise Boeing's 737 Max production limit that it had set in January 2024, after a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines jet. Boeing is now allowed to build 42 Max jets per month, up from 38, and Ortberg said Wednesday that the company expects to raise that cap further once it demonstrates to the FAA that it can do so safely.

If the FAA approves future production boosts, Ortberg said, they'd come in increments of five jets and wouldn't happen more than once every six months.

“We won’t move to higher rates until we reach stability and readiness,” he said.

Boeing also reported $238 million in free cash flow, marking its first cash flow-positive quarter since 2023. But that figure was partly boosted by a delay in a potential $700 million payment to the Justice Department, part of a still-pending deal under consideration by a federal judge that could spare Boeing from criminal prosecution in the two deadly 737 Max crashes.

The crashes off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia happened less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 and were later blamed on a new software system that Boeing developed for the aircraft.

Meanwhile, a strike was ongoing at three Midwest plants in the St. Louis area.
