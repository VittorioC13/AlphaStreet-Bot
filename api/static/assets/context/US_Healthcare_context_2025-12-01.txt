[TITLE]Eisai Completes Rolling Submission to US FDA for LEQEMBI® IQLIK™ (lecanemab-irmb) Supplemental Biologics License Application as a Subcutaneous Starting Dose for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Dise:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that Eisai has completed the rolling submission of the Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for lecanemab-irmb (U.S. brand name: LEQEMBI®) subcutaneous autoinjector (SC-AI), LEQEMBI IQLIK, as a weekly starting dose after the FDA granted Fast Track Status. LEQEMBI is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease (collectively referred to as early AD). Upon acceptance of the sBLA, the FDA will set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date (target date for review completion).

The sBLA is supported by data evaluating subcutaneous (SC) administration of lecanemab across a range of doses and as part of sub-studies within the Phase 3 Clarity AD open-label extension (OLE) following the 18-month core study in individuals with early AD. Data show that once-weekly administration of the 500 mg of SC-AI achieved equivalent exposure to once every two weeks intravenous (IV) administration and similar clinical and biomarker benefits. Subcutaneous administration demonstrated a safety profile similar to IV administration, with less than 2% incidence of systemic injection/infusion-related reactions.

Should the FDA approve the LEQEMBI IQLIK 500 mg SC dosing regimen (two 250 mg injections), the autoinjector could be used to administer a once-weekly starting dose, as an alternative to the current bi-weekly (every two weeks) intravenous (IV) dosing. This would enable patients and care partners to choose SC administration at home for both initial treatment and the currently approved maintenance therapy, offering the option of SC or IV administration throughout the entire treatment journey. The injection time for each LEQEMBI IQLIK autoinjector takes approximately 15 seconds. The SC formulation also has the potential to reduce healthcare resources associated with IV dosing, such as preparation for infusion and nurse monitoring, while streamlining the overall AD treatment pathway.

AD is a progressive, relentless disease, with amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau as hallmarks, that is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process driven by protofibrils* that begins before amyloid plaque accumulation and continues after plaque removal.1,2,3 Only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both protofibrils and amyloid plaque, which can impact tau downstream.

LEQEMBI is currently approved in 51 countries and regions and is under regulatory review in 9 countries. In August 2025, the US FDA approved LEQEMBI IQLIK 360 mg for weekly subcutaneous maintenance dosing after 18 months of IV treatment every two weeks.

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

*Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.1 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction.2

INDICATION

LEQEMBI® is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Treatment with LEQEMBI should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: AMYLOID-RELATED IMAGING ABNORMALITIES (ARIA) Monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA, characterized as ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). Incidence and timing of ARIA vary among treatments. ARIA usually occurs early in treatment and is usually asymptomatic, although serious and life-threatening events, including seizure and status epilepticus, can occur. ARIA can be fatal. Serious intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) >1 cm, some of which have been fatal, have been observed with this class of medications. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy to a patient being treated with LEQEMBI. Apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4) Homozygotes : Patients who are ApoE ε4 homozygotes (~15% of patients with AD) treated with this class of medications have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic, serious, and severe radiographic ARIA, compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers. Testing for ApoE ε4 status should be performed prior to initiation of treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. Prior to testing, prescribers should discuss with patients the risk of ARIA across genotypes and the implications of genetic testing results. Prescribers should inform patients that if genotype testing is not performed, they can still be treated with LEQEMBI; however, it cannot be determined if they are ApoE ε4 homozygotes and at higher risk for ARIA.

Consider the benefit of LEQEMBI for the treatment of AD and the potential risk of serious ARIA events when deciding to initiate treatment with LEQEMBI.

CONTRAINDICATION

Contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to lecanemab-irmb or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities

Medications in this class, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA-E, which can be observed on MRI as brain edema or sulcal effusions, and ARIA-H, which includes microhemorrhage and superficial siderosis. ARIA can occur spontaneously in patients with AD, particularly in patients with MRI findings suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), such as pretreatment microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis. ARIA-H generally occurs with ARIA-E. Reported ARIA symptoms may include headache, confusion, visual changes, dizziness, nausea, and gait difficulty. Focal neurologic deficits may also occur. Symptoms usually resolve over time.

Incidence of ARIA

Symptomatic ARIA occurred in 3% and serious ARIA symptoms in 0.7% with LEQEMBI. Clinical ARIA symptoms resolved in 79% of patients during the period of observation. ARIA, including asymptomatic radiographic events, was observed: LEQEMBI, 21%; placebo, 9%. ARIA-E was observed: LEQEMBI, 13%; placebo, 2%. ARIA-H was observed: LEQEMBI, 17%; placebo, 9%. No increase in isolated ARIA-H was observed for LEQEMBI vs placebo.

Incidence of ICH

ICH >1 cm in diameter was reported in 0.7% with LEQEMBI vs 0.1% with placebo. Fatal events of ICH in patients taking LEQEMBI have been observed.

Risk Factors of ARIA and ICH

ApoE ε4 Carrier Status

Of the patients taking LEQEMBI, 16% were ApoE ε4 homozygotes, 53% were heterozygotes, and 31% were noncarriers. With LEQEMBI, ARIA was higher in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (LEQEMBI: 45%; placebo: 22%) than in heterozygotes (LEQEMBI: 19%; placebo: 9%) and noncarriers (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 4%). Symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 9% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes vs 2% of heterozygotes and 1% of noncarriers. Serious ARIA events occurred in 3% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes and in ~1% of heterozygotes and noncarriers. The recommendations on management of ARIA do not differ between ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers.

Radiographic Findings of CAA

Neuroimaging findings that may indicate CAA include evidence of prior ICH, cerebral microhemorrhage, and cortical superficial siderosis. CAA has an increased risk for ICH. The presence of an ApoE ε4 allele is also associated with CAA.

The baseline presence of at least 2 microhemorrhages or the presence of at least 1 area of superficial siderosis on MRI, which may be suggestive of CAA, have been identified as risk factors for ARIA. Patients were excluded from Clarity AD for the presence of >4 microhemorrhages and additional findings suggestive of CAA (prior cerebral hemorrhage >1 cm in greatest diameter, superficial siderosis, vasogenic edema) or other lesions (aneurysm, vascular malformation) that could potentially increase the risk of ICH.

Concomitant Antithrombotic or Thrombolytic Medication

In Clarity AD, baseline use of antithrombotic medication (aspirin, other antiplatelets, or anticoagulants) was allowed if the patient was on a stable dose. Most exposures were to aspirin. Antithrombotic medications did not increase the risk of ARIA with LEQEMBI. The incidence of ICH: 0.9% in patients taking LEQEMBI with a concomitant antithrombotic medication vs 0.6% with no antithrombotic and 2.5% in patients taking LEQEMBI with an anticoagulant alone or with antiplatelet medication such as aspirin vs none in patients receiving placebo.

Fatal cerebral hemorrhage has occurred in 1 patient taking an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in the setting of focal neurologic symptoms of ARIA and the use of a thrombolytic agent.

Additional caution should be exercised when considering the administration of antithrombotics or a thrombolytic agent (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) to a patient already being treated with LEQEMBI. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, treating clinicians should consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy in a patient being treated with LEQEMBI.

Caution should be exercised when considering the use of LEQEMBI in patients with factors that indicate an increased risk for ICH and, in particular, patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy or patients with findings on MRI that are suggestive of CAA.

Radiographic Severity With LEQEMBI

Most ARIA-E radiographic events occurred within the first 7 doses, although ARIA can occur at any time, and patients can have >1 episode. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-E with LEQEMBI was mild in 4%, moderate in 7%, and severe in 1% of patients. Resolution on MRI occurred in 52% of ARIA-E patients by 12 weeks, 81% by 17 weeks, and 100% overall after detection. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-H microhemorrhage with LEQEMBI was mild in 9%, moderate in 2%, and severe in 3% of patients; superficial siderosis was mild in 4%, moderate in 1%, and severe in 0.4% of patients. With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-E was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (5%) vs heterozygotes (0.4%) or noncarriers (0%). With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-H was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (13.5%) vs heterozygotes (2.1%) or noncarriers (1.1%).

Monitoring and Dose Management Guidelines

Baseline brain MRI and periodic monitoring with MRI are recommended. Enhanced clinical vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 14 weeks of treatment. Depending on ARIA-E and ARIA-H clinical symptoms and radiographic severity, use clinical judgment when considering whether to continue dosing or to temporarily or permanently discontinue LEQEMBI. If a patient experiences ARIA symptoms, clinical evaluation should be performed, including MRI if indicated. If ARIA is observed on MRI, careful clinical evaluation should be performed prior to continuing treatment.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis, have occurred with LEQEMBI. Promptly discontinue the infusion upon the first observation of any signs or symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction and initiate appropriate therapy.

Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)

IRRs were observed—LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%—and most cases with LEQEMBI (75%) occurred with the first infusion. IRRs were mostly mild (69%) or moderate (28%). Symptoms included fever and flu-like symptoms (chills, generalized aches, feeling shaky, and joint pain), nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, and oxygen desaturation.

IRRs can occur during or after the completion of infusion. In the event of an IRR during the infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced or discontinued, and appropriate therapy initiated as clinically indicated. Consider prophylactic treatment prior to future infusions with antihistamines, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥5% with LEQEMBI infusion every 2 weeks and ≥2% higher than placebo were IRRs (LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%), ARIA-H (LEQEMBI: 14%; placebo: 8%), ARIA-E (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 2%), headache (LEQEMBI: 11%; placebo: 8%), superficial siderosis of central nervous system (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 3%), rash (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%), and nausea/vomiting (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%)

Safety profile of LEQEMBI IQLIK for maintenance treatment was similar to LEQEMBI infusion. Patients who received LEQEMBI IQLIK experienced localized and systemic (less frequent) injection-related reactions (mild to moderate in severity)

LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) is available :

Intravenous infusion: 100 mg/mL

Subcutaneous injection: 200 mg/mL

[TITLE]Eisai Submits New Drug Application for Subcutaneous Formulation of “LEQEMBI®” for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease in Japan:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that Eisai has filed a new drug application for “LEQEMBI®” (brand name, generic name: lecanemab) seeking approval for a subcutaneous formulation (subcutaneous autoinjector: SC-AI) as a new route of administration to Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA).

The application is based on data from multiple subcutaneous (SC) administration sub-studies of lecanemab conducted as part of the Phase 3 Clarity AD open-label extension (OLE), following the 18-month core study in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer‘s disease (AD) or mild stage of AD dementia (collectively referred to as early AD).

[TITLE]Piramal Pharma Solutions Achieves Regulatory Compliance for Nitrosamine Impurities:
[TEXT]
Piramal Pharma Solutions implemented a robust action plan to address evolving regulatory requirements pertaining to nitrosamine impurities.

Through comprehensive risk assessments, confirmatory testing, and control strategies, the Company is ensuring the safety and compliance of its drug substances and drug products.

By investing in site improvements and capability enhancements, the Company will continue to meet international regulatory guidelines for nitrosamines.

MUMBAI, India, Nov. 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Piramal Pharma Solutions, a leading global Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) and part of Piramal Pharma Ltd. (NSE: PPLPHARMA) (BSE: 543635), today announced the successful completion of its journey to compliance with global requirements for nitrosamine impurities in pharmaceuticals.

Rashida Najmi, Chief Quality Officer, Piramal Pharma Limited.

Nitrosamines are unintended carcinogenic byproducts that can be found in certain medications. International guidelines on nitrosamine drug substance-related impurities (NDSRIs) have evolved significantly over the last few years, requiring pharmaceutical companies to adapt their operations to maintain compliance. In response, Piramal Pharma Solutions has implemented a robust, multi-step action plan to ensure regulatory alignment with the latest NDSRI guidelines, and more importantly, patient safety.

The first step of this proactive approach involved the development of a cross-functional core team comprised of subject matter experts from Regulatory Affairs, Central Quality, R&D, and Manufacturing. These experts offered specialized insights from their unique perspective, interpreted regulatory guidance as it was published, and ensured every operation across our organization remains compliant with international NDSRI guidelines.

This team played a pivotal role in the publication and continual update of the Position Paper, a centralized guidance document aligned with the latest regulatory expectations. By clearly defining roles and responsibilities, the Position Paper enabled site teams to adapt to the challenges and changes associated with the new requirements.

A critical component of the Company's journey to nitrosamine compliance was prioritizing risk assessments for all relevant drug substances and drug products to analyze their level of safety and regulatory impact. All identified products received confirmatory testing, with control strategies and administrative controls implemented as needed. Currently, all existing Piramal Pharma Limited commercial products comply with global regulatory requirements. Some customer products are still pending approval, and new batches will only be executed following regulatory alignment.

The action plan also involved the development of in-house testing capabilities at key facilities, alongside the qualification of external laboratories to support additional testing needs. This included investments into new state-of-the-art equipment and capabilities at the Ahmedabad and Digwal pharmaceutical development sites to expedite testing and compliance processes and mitigate potential drug shortage issues. These enhancements also address industry-wide challenges posed by impurity standards and synthesis difficulties, enabling Piramal to synthesize and qualify impurities in-house, minimize impurity formation, and conduct additional screening studies to confirm product safety.

"At Piramal Pharma Solutions, patient well-being is our top priority. We are proud to have achieved regulatory compliance for nitrosamine impurities, which reflects our unwavering commitment to patient safety and operational excellence, while also solidifying our position as a trusted partner in the industry," said Rashida Najmi, Chief Quality Officer, Piramal Pharma Limited. "With our proactive approach and enhanced capabilities, we are well-equipped to adapt to evolving global NDSRI standards, ensuring the highest safety and quality standards for our products."

As international guidelines surrounding nitrosamines evolve, Piramal Pharma Solutions remains committed to patient safety, regulatory compliance, and operational excellence. The Company will continue to support partners as they navigate the complex landscape of nitrosamine control, prioritizing transparent communication and continuous improvement to maintain the highest standards of pharmaceutical quality and patient safety.

[TITLE]Dupixent® (dupilumab) Approved as the First Targeted Medicine in the European Union (EU) in Over a Decade for Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU):
[TEXT]
Approval based on Phase 3 trials showing Dupixent significantly reduced itch and hives at 24 weeks compared to placebo

In the EU, there are approximately 270,000 adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older living with CSU who remain symptomatic despite standard-of-care antihistamine treatment

Dupixent, which inhibits IL-4 and IL-13, two key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation, is now approved for patients across seven chronic, inflammatory diseases in the EU

TARRYTOWN, N.Y. and PARIS, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adult and adolescent patients 12 years and above with inadequate response to histamine-1 antihistamines (H1AH) and who are naïve to anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy for CSU. Eligible patients can use Dupixent as a first-line targeted treatment option.

“The unpredictable nature of chronic spontaneous urticaria leaves patients guessing when they’ll have their next outbreak of disruptive, debilitating hives and itch, which can make life challenging,” said Tonya Winders, President & CEO, Global Allergy & Airways Patient Platform. “Dupixent is proven to reduce these intense symptoms and has the potential to make a positive impact on people struggling to control this disease.”

“The approval of Dupixent for certain adults and adolescents with chronic spontaneous urticaria in the European Union represents the first innovation for patients with this disease in over a decade,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “Physicians now have a new approach for CSU with Dupixent, as the only treatment that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13, two key drivers of type 2 inflammation, and can offer patients significant improvement in debilitating itch and hives. This approval further demonstrates the ability of Dupixent to advance the treatment landscape for yet another chronic type 2 inflammatory disease, with a well-established safety profile across its indications.”

The approval is based on data from two Phase 3 clinical trials in the LIBERTY-CUPID program. Study A and Study C included 284 patients aged 12 years and older who were symptomatic despite the use of antihistamines and who were naïve to anti-IgE therapy. Both trials assessed Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone and demonstrated Dupixent significantly reduced urticaria activity (a composite of itch and hives), and individual measures of itch and hive severity compared to placebo at 24 weeks. Dupixent also increased the percentage of patients with well-controlled disease and complete response at 24 weeks compared to placebo. Study B included 108 patients and provided additional safety data and evaluated Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older who were inadequate responders or intolerant to anti-IgE therapy and symptomatic despite antihistamine use.

Safety results from Study A, Study B and Study C were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common adverse reactions for Dupixent overall are injection site reactions, conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis allergic, arthralgia, oral herpes and eosinophilia. Additional adverse reactions of injection site induration, injection site dermatitis and injection site hematoma were reported in the CSU adult and adolescent trials. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) than placebo in patients with CSU were injection site reaction, COVID-19, hypertension, CSU and accidental overdose.

“Standard-of-care, first-line treatment options like antihistamines offer limited relief for many people living with uncontrolled chronic spontaneous urticaria, leaving them to face unrelenting cycles of itch and hives,” said Alyssa Johnsen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Immunology Development at Sanofi. “Dupixent significantly reduced these symptoms of CSU and led to more patients experiencing well-controlled disease or a complete response compared to placebo in two Phase 3 studies. Now, eligible patients with CSU in the EU have a new option that is proven to reduce itch and hives.”

Beyond the European Union (EU), Dupixent is also approved for CSU in certain adults and adolescents in several countries including the United States and Japan.

The market for medical membranes is driven by the rising global burden of chronic kidney disease, along with the resulting increase in hemodialysis procedures that rely on high-performance dialysis membranes for efficient solute removal and biocompatibility. The geriatric population, the growing number of diabetes cases, and the rising number of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are contributing to this demand. Furthermore, membrane material advancements such as polysulfone, polyethersulfone, and mixed-matrix membranes with increased flux and antifouling properties are not only making treatment easier but also leading to better patient outcomes. The growth in application areas like drug delivery, tissue regeneration, and sterile filtration, along with the trend of switching to single-use systems to minimize infection risks, is also a great catalyst for the market. Favourable reimbursement policies and the development of healthcare infrastructure in emerging economies are also among the factors that contribute to the market's growth.

The medical membrane market is mainly focused on the development of new semipermeable materials with higher selectivity and biocompatibility, along with the efficiency of the process, to a great extent, for medical and life-science applications. Innovations in this sector comprise the usage of next-generation polymer formulations like modified polysulfone, PES, and PVDF, in addition to membranes with surface engineering that helps reduce fouling and provide better hemocompatibility. Moreover, precision manufacturing methods like phase inversion technique, electrospinning of nanofibers, and asymmetric or composite membrane structures yield membranes that have superior permeability and mechanical strength. The technologies that are developed for microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and sterile filtration purposes are now being incorporated into dialysis devices, diagnostic cartridges, and bioprocessing systems to a greater extent. Automation, membrane functionalization, and quality-control advancements are also gradually making sterilization, reliability, and performance consistency better.

[TITLE]Eisai Submits New Drug Application for Subcutaneous Formulation of “LEQEMBI®” for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease in Japan:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that Eisai has filed a new drug application for “LEQEMBI®” (brand name, generic name: lecanemab) seeking approval for a subcutaneous formulation (subcutaneous autoinjector: SC-AI) as a new route of administration to Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA).

The application is based on data from multiple subcutaneous (SC) administration sub-studies of lecanemab conducted as part of the Phase 3 Clarity AD open-label extension (OLE), following the 18-month core study in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer‘s disease (AD) or mild stage of AD dementia (collectively referred to as early AD). It was confirmed that the once-weekly administration of SC-AI 500mg resulted in equivalent exposure to once every two weeks intravenous (IV) administration and similar clinical and biomarker benefits. Subcutaneous administration demonstrated a safety profile similar to IV administration, with less than 2% incidence of systemic injection/infusion-related reactions.

If approved, the SC-AI of 500 mg (two 250 mg injections) could be used to administer a once-weekly dose at home from the initiation of treatment, as an alternative to the current IV administration every two weeks dose in the hospital setting. The potential approval of SC-AI would expand the option for patients and care partners to receive LEQEMBI treatment at home. The injection time for each autoinjector (250mg injection) is approximately 15 seconds. The SC formulation also has the potential to reduce healthcare resources associated with IV dosing, such as preparation for infusion and nurse monitoring, while streamlining the overall AD treatment care pathway.

AD is a progressive, relentless disease with amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau as hallmarks that is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process driven by protofibrils* that begins before amyloid plaque accumulation and continues after plaque removal.1,2,3 Only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both protofibrils and amyloid plaque, which can impact tau downstream.

LEQEMBI is currently approved in 51 countries and regions and is under regulatory review in 9 countries.

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

*Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.1 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction.2
