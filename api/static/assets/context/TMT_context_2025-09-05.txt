[TITLE]Figure Technology targets $526M in IPO amid crypto listing wave:
[TEXT]
Figure aims to raise $526M in IPO, valuing the blockchain lender at $4.3B.

IPO momentum grows as Gemini, Kraken, and Bullish drive the crypto listing wave.

Figure shifts from lending roots to blockchain finance, boosting investor interest.

Blockchain-focused lender Figure Technology Solutions is preparing to raise $526 million through its upcoming initial public offering (IPO), according to regulatory filings submitted Tuesday and reported by Bloomberg Law.

The company intends to sell 21.5 million shares priced between $18 and $20 each, with 4.9 million shares expected to come from existing holders.

At the high end of the price range, the IPO would assign the company a valuation of roughly $4.3 billion.

Figure first signaled its public market ambitions last month when it filed confidentially with regulators, followed by a formal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on August 18.

The latest filings suggest the company is targeting September 10 for its IPO pricing date.

The firm’s valuation has steadily increased since its 2021 Series D funding round, when it raised $200 million in a deal led by 10T Holdings that valued the company at $3.2 billion.

More recently, Figure reported financial momentum, with revenues reaching $191 million in the first half of 2025.

From consumer lending to blockchain infrastructure

While Figure is now recognized for its blockchain-driven financial products built on the Provenance Blockchain, the company originally focused on consumer lending.

Its first offering was a digitized home equity line of credit for US homeowners, before expanding into blockchain infrastructure designed to streamline lending, securitization, and related processes.

By leveraging blockchain technology, Figure has positioned itself at the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized systems, aiming to deliver faster, more transparent, and cost-effective financial solutions.

This pivot has helped the company differentiate itself from fintech rivals while attracting investor interest in its long-term growth prospects.

Crypto IPO momentum builds

Figure’s listing effort comes as more crypto and blockchain firms move toward the public markets during the ongoing bull market cycle.

On Tuesday, the crypto exchange Gemini also filed for an IPO, seeking to raise $317 million.

Rival exchange Kraken is rumored to be pursuing a $500 million raise at a valuation of around $15 billion, though reports suggest it may delay its public debut until 2026.

Meanwhile, several high-profile listings have already set a precedent this year.

In August, digital asset exchange operator Bullish launched its IPO with shares priced at $37, soaring as much as 218% on its first trading day.

Despite a pullback, Bullish still maintains a market capitalisation of roughly $9.6 billion, up from its IPO valuation of $4.8 billion.

Similarly, stablecoin issuer Circle completed an IPO that raised about $1.1 billion, with shares more than doubling on the first day of trading. The company now commands a market capitalization of approximately $30 billion.

Gemini, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’ crypto exchange also readying for its public debut, with the firm aiming to raise $317 million at a valuation of $2.2 billion.

Beyond traditional IPOs, the industry is exploring alternative routes.

A group of crypto executives recently launched Bitcoin Infrastructure Acquisition Corp, a Cayman Islands-based special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) targeting a $200 million raise through an IPO.

[TITLE]Despite whispers of a bubble, OpenAI is planning a gigawatt-scale data center in India:
[TEXT]
OpenAI is scouting for partners to help it build a huge data center in India, according to Bloomberg. The data center will reportedly be on the gigawatt scale, which would make it one of the largest in the country. This comes at a time of increasing diplomatic tension between the U.S. and India over trade tariffs, but with OpenAI Sam Altman visiting India later this month, those close to the matter believe he may make the announcement official.

OpenAI's immediate future has been repeatedly brought into question over the past month. After the disastrous launch of its next-generation language model, GPT-5, and a recent hiring freeze at Meta's AI division after months of heavy expenditure, many analysts started to question whether the AI bubble was easing closer to bursting. Had the $500 billion+ + rollout of AI infrastructure as part of OpenAI's Stargate plan finally run out of steam?

It seems not, though, as OpenAI will have to invest billions more to build out this newly planned data center. Its Stargate project was mostly seen as a way to quickly scale up American AI data center capacity, but OpenAI has also been pushing an 'OpenAI for Countries' initiative. On the surface, it's to accelerate AI development and adoption in democratic countries that share U.S. values, but it's also a way to entrench American AI developments as the premier solution for countries that might otherwise consider alternative initiatives, such as those developed by China.

As the world's largest democracy with close to 1.5 billion people, India is a prime candidate for such a scheme. OpenAI is said to be currently in talks with Indian officials and local companies in order to secure the land necessary to begin construction. It's also seeking regulatory approval and exploring local energy sources, as a one-gigawatt facility will require a substantial amount of power. Until those are secure, OpenAI won't be able to give too many details

[TITLE]Apple Plots AI Search to Challenge OpenAI, Perplexity:
[TEXT]
Apple is reportedly developing an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered web search tool that could be added to its Siri voice assistant, its Safari web browser and its Spotlight search features on the iPhone.

The search tool, dubbed World Knowledge Answers, would look up information from the internet and summarize the results, similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s AI Overviews and apps from companies like Perplexity AI, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Sept. 3), citing unnamed sources.

Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment.

PYMNTS reported in November 2024 that innovation in search is getting a shot in the arm by AI-powered chat interfaces that are challenging traditional models.

While Google has reigned supreme as the global leader in online search, a shifting technology is setting the stage for intensified competition from alternative search engines and AI-powered platforms.

In May, while testifying in the U.S. Justice Department’s lawsuit against Google parent company Alphabet, Apple Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue said Apple was “actively looking at” revamping its Safari web browser to concentrate on AI-powered search engines.

Cue noted a recent dip in Safari searches, which he attributed to increased use of AI, and said he believes that AI search engine providers such as OpenAI, Perplexity AI and Anthropic will eventually supplant standard search engines like Google.

It was reported in July that AI-powered chatbots account for a small but growing share of searches conducted through desktop browsers.

The share of those searches in the United States that went to chatbots rather than traditional search engines reached 5.6% in June, up from 2.48% in June 2024 and 1.3% in January 2024.

Wednesday’s report came at a time when Apple has been facing mounting criticism that the company has lagged in the AI race.

It was reported in August that Apple held a rare companywide meeting to cover its investment in AI and that CEO Tim Cook expressed a positive outlook

AMD CFO Jean Hu confirmed earlier today that the firm is not starting new chip production for its China products despite being granted licenses by the Trump administration. Hu, along with AMD's vice president of investor relations, Matthew Ramsay, spoke at a Citigroup conference earlier today, where they discussed the firm's total addressable market for artificial intelligence and rising costs and AMD's ability to convert them into improved margins in an industry where gross margins drive stock performance.

Hu and Ramsay's talk at the Citigroup conference touched on a variety of topics. AMD, like NVIDIA, had to write off its China GPU inventory due to US license restrictions. When asked
