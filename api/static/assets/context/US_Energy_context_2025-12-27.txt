[TITLE]3 Questions: How to launch a successful climate and energy venture:
[TEXT]
In 2013, Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship Managing Director Bill Aulet published “Disciplined Entrepreneurship: 24 Steps to a Successful Startup,” which has since sold hundreds of thousands of copies and been used to teach entrepreneurship at universities around the world. One MIT course where it’s used is 15.366 (Climate and Energy Ventures), where instructors have tweaked the framework over the years. In a new book, “Disciplined Entrepreneurship for Climate and Energy Ventures,” they codify those changes and provide a new blueprint for entrepreneurs working in the climate and energy spaces.

MIT News spoke with lead author and Trust Center Entrepreneur-in-Residence Ben Soltoff, who wrote the book with Aulet, Senior Lecturer Tod Hynes, Senior Lecturer Francis O’Sullivan, and Lecturer Libby Wayman. Soltoff explains why climate and energy entrepreneurship is so challenging and talks

[TITLE]What Would A Peace Deal In Ukraine Mean For The Global Oil Market?:
[TEXT]
The prospect of a peace deal in Ukraine has been gaining momentum in the global oil market over the past few days, stripping away part of the geopolitical risk premium that has kept prices elevated since Russia’s invasion on 24 February 2022. Following meetings last week in Berlin with Ukrainian and European officials, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner stated that consensus was reached on around 90% of the issues within a 20-point peace plan. Ukraine has indicated that it may drop its NATO membership bid in exchange for legally binding U.S. and European security assurances, similar to NATO’s Article 5. This states that an attack on one member is an attack on all, obligating other members to assist, potentially with armed force, to restore security. The U.S. has now said that it is offering ‘Article 5-like’ assurances, with President Donald Trump now reportedly willing to submit to the Senate for approval. Meanwhile, Russia has indicated it could accept Ukraine joining the European Union (E.U.) of 27 countries as part of a settlement, a major shift from its earlier stance. However, it continues to demand that Ukraine withdraw from parts of Donetsk still under Kyiv’s control, while Ukraine rejects ceding territory. Talks continue, with Trump saying in the last few days that “we’re closer now [to a peace deal] than we have been,” so what would it mean if such an agreement was reached tomorrow?

Even if a full peace agreement were reached tomorrow – freely agreed by both Ukraine and Russia -- it would likely take months for any significant rolling back of U.S. sanctions on Russia to occur, and years before all such prohibitions were removed. “Literally thousands of sanctions have been imposed on Russia since [24 February] 2022, involving codification through multiple executive orders, Treasury designations, and sometimes congressional legislation, so removing them doesn’t just mean a signature,” a senior Washington-based source who works closely with the U.S. Treasury Department exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “Removing each one will require a formal review process, inter?agency coordination, and sometimes Senate approval if treaty?level commitments are involved,” he noted. “Don’t forget that these sanctions often also feed into similar ones on third-country firms and individuals that are connected to Russia, so getting rid of those would require another level of legal process and negotiations with allies in Europe and Asia, which would be very time consuming,” he underlined. “And on top of that any major rollback could be challenged every step of the way by the lawmakers, which would take it out of the control of the executive,” he told OilPrice.com. Ultimately, sanctions are seen as the tangible sign of U.S. resolve, and any rapid removal – absent a clear milestone achieved by Russia – would risk being read by allies and adversaries alike as a reward for aggression. Given this, any substantive longer-term effects on the global oil market would likely be muted.

Even more so, as it is highly likely that such an initiative would involve a graduated process, as with Iran, according to the Washington source. Indeed, once the U.S. had agreed to the ‘Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action’ (JCPOA, or colloquially ‘the nuclear deal’) on 14 July 2015, sanctions relief for Iran was phased in over years, contingent on verified compliance milestones, with Treasury and State monitoring implementation before easing restrictions, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. “It’s pretty clear that the Europeans would want to see this sort of a rollback, and Ukraine too, with [sanctions] relief charted against benchmarks, not a blanket lifting overnight,” said the Washington source. “In this case [Ukraine], we’d be looking for proof that Russia is not continuing with military support for its occupied territories, or a further build-up of Russian military in those regions, and this would require international monitoring,” he observed. Moreover, as seen in the E.U.’s recent ‘Sanctions Snapback’ on Iran, any relief programme for Russia would almost certainly contain a similar mechanism to re?impose measures if Moscow breached peace terms. Judging from the Snapback on Iran, and the likely terms for Russia of any peace deal, such a snapback for Moscow would involve a quick and broad-based reimposition of sanctions on it and third parties relating to military hardware, dual-use (civilian and military) technology, and finance as monitored through the lens of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF enforces 40 standards against money laundering and nine against terrorist financing, with sweeping powers to sanction individuals, firms, or states that fall short. Its grey? and black?list designations trigger escalating restrictions, making it an aggressive enforcement tool.

In any event, Europe – both the E.U. and other countries, including Great Britain – looks even less likely than the U.S. to start rolling back sanctions on Russia any time soon. After years of effectively bankrolling the Russian war machine through vast imports of the country’s oil and gas, the message finally appears to have sunk in: the rest of Europe is in President Vladimir Putin’s sights after Ukraine. He laid the groundwork for what was to come back in his second state?of?the?nation speech after his 2004 re?election, broadcast live on Russian television, when he said: “The demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century. As for the Russian people, it became a genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory.” Following that, his tentative first military incursion into a sovereign European country – Georgia in 2008 – showed him that he could get away with more, in the classic ‘salami slicing’ strategy of territorial advancement that he has used since. This was because of the ineffectual response from Europe to this aggression – itself a result of the fact that the continent, particularly Germany, was unwilling to jeopardise its cheap Russian gas and oil supplies, as also detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. When the same meek response met his 2014 invasion of Ukraine, and subsequent annexation of Crimea, it was game on for the full invasion of Ukraine in 2022. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte laid it out bare for Europe just over a week ago: “We are Russia’s next target. And we are already in harm’s way.” With this view now widespread among Europe’s top leaders, the meaningful rollback of sanctions on Moscow looks unlikely, with the corollary lack of long-term follow-through in the global oil market.

President Trump has further fuelled Europe’s determination to take its own path on Russia, having made it clear early in this presidency that NATO members who did not dramatically increase their defence spending could not rely on U.S. military support in the event of attack from Russia. The last time NATO met, members agreed to increase their defence spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, up from an average of 2% last year. Against this backdrop, it would be too obscene even for Germany to advocate the resumption of oil and gas imports in size from Russia. Indeed, around two weeks ago, the E.U. fully agreed to implement its ‘REPowerEU Roadmap’, which European Commission (E.C.) President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted as enabling the continent to: “Enter the era of Europe’s full energy independence from Russia [as] Today, we are stopping these imports permanently.” She underlined: “By depleting [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.” E.C. Commissioner, Dan Jørgensen, put it even more plainly: “We [the E.U.] will “never go back to our dangerous dependence on Russia, we will never go back to volatile supplies and market manipulation, and we will never go back to energy blackmail and economic exposure.” As such, the agreement contains bans on E.U. imports of pipelined natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and oil from Russia, as analysed fully by OilPrice.com. As one senior source in the EU’s security complex exclusively told OilPrice.com last week: “Regardless of what the Americans do, and regardless of any peace deal in Ukraine, we’re not rolling back anything on Russia.”

[TITLE]Africa Needs $100 Billion in Refining Investment as Oil Demand Soars:
[TEXT]
Africa’s crude oil demand is set to more than double to 4.5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2050, which will need more than $100 billion in investment in refining over the next decades, according to the African Refiners and Distributors Association (ARDA).

Thanks to population growth, urbanization, and industrialization, Africa’s crude oil consumption is expected to jump from 1.8 million bpd in 2024 to as much as 4.5 million bpd by 2050, ARDA Executive Secretary, Anibor Kragha, has said, as carried by African news outlets including Arise News.

The expected surge in demand positions Africa’s refining industry as one of the world’s biggest untapped investment frontiers, according to the association.

Despite the growth in consumption, Africa remains reliant on fuel imports, which expose many of the countries on the continent to price swings, supply disruptions, and reduction of their foreign exchange (forex) reserves, ARDA’s Kragha said.

“Downstream investment has stagnated even as upstream production grows, leaving Africa stuck in the costly paradox of exporting crude and importing refined products at a premium,” ARDA’s Kragha said.

To boost domestic fuel supply, Africa will need more than $100 billion in upgrades of mothballed or dilapidated refineries, expansion of existing refining capacity, and new greenfield projects to supply fuels, the African refiners’ association reckons.

A key hurdle to Africa-made fuels is the lack of harmonized fuel specifications, Kragha noted, adding that out of 54 countries in Africa, as many as 46 maintain various national fuel standards. All these mean there are 12 different gasoline and 11 diesel varieties being sold across Africa.

“Africa’s downstream sector is one of the world’s last large-scale, high-growth energy investment frontiers. The demand curve is defined by demographics. The supply deficit is structural. The capital requirement exceeds $100 billion. And the economic upside is transformative,” Kragha said.

[TITLE]U.S. Snatches Venezuela Oil Tanker in Dark‑Hour Strike on Narco‑Terror Funding:
[TEXT]
In a stealth operation carried out before dawn on Dec. 20, the U.S. Coast Guard—working alongside the Department of War—seized an oil tanker last seen in the terrorist state of Venezuela. The United States accused the ship’s operators of moving sanctioned crude to fuel narco‑terror activity. Officials issued a stark warning to traffickers: “We will find you, and we will stop you.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem released a video on social media showing a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter landing on the deck of an oil tanker in international waters off the coast of Venezuela. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump declared the government of Venezuela to be a Foreign Terrorist Organization and ordered the complete naval blockade of the country.

“The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,” Noem posted on X. “We will find you, and we will stop you.”

DHS called the seizure a “lightning strike operation to seize the Motor Tanker Centuries. Officials stated the ship was carrying oil subject to U.S. sanctions.

U.S. and Venezuelan officials report that the seizure of the Panamanian-flagged “Centuries” tanker took place in international waters near the coast of Venezuela. The ship was reportedly bound for Asia, possibly China, reports indicate.

NBC News reported on the Venezuelan reaction, writing:

Venezuela’s minister of the interior, Diosdado Cabello, condemned the operation in a Saturday post on Instagram. “The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela denounces and rejects the theft and hijacking of a new private vessel transporting Venezuelan oil, as well as the forced disappearance of its crew, committed by military personnel of the United States of America in international waters,” Cabello said.

In a post on social media, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth added to the U.S. actions, writing, “President Trump has been clear: the blockade of sanctioned oil tankers departing from, or bound for, Venezuela will remain in full force until Maduro’s criminal enterprise returns every stolen American asset.”

Earlier this month, Breitbart’s John Hayward reported that the Trump administration ordered the seizure of another tanker carrying sanctioned Venezuelan oil. This vessel was reportedly headed to Cuba.

In a speech where he did not directly respond to the tanker’s seizure, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said, in a speech, that the Venezuelan military is “prepared to break the teeth of teh North American empire, if necessary.”

[TITLE]Energy Transfer LP (ET) Upsizes Desert Southwest Pipeline to Meet Surging Demand:
[TEXT]
We recently compiled a list of the 10 Cheap Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings on Wall Street. Energy Transfer LP is one of the cheap stocks to buy on our list.

TheFly reported that on December 18, Morgan Stanley downgraded ET from Overweight to Equal Weight, maintaining a $19 price target. The firm cited a lack of catalysts to re-rate the shares higher, noting that without a clear event-driven path to close ET’s valuation discount relative to peers, outperformance versus the group is likely to remain challenging, according to the analyst’s research note.

On the same day, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) announced it is suspending the development of its Lake Charles LNG project. Management stated that continued development was “not warranted” at this time, as the company seeks to focus on projects with superior risk/return profiles. The suspension follows challenges in securing enough equity partners to unload a desired 50% interest in the facility.

Energy Transfer LP (ET) Upsizes Desert Southwest Pipeline to Meet Surging Demand

Simultaneously, ET announced it will upsize the capacity of its planned Desert Southwest expansion project on the Transwestern Pipeline. To meet surging customer demand in Arizona and New Mexico, the company will increase the pipeline diameter from 42 inches to 48 inches. This modification will boost capacity to 2.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) and is expected to increase 2026 growth capital expenditures by approximately $200 million, bringing the total project cost to $5.6 billion.

Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) is a leading U.S. midstream energy company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. It operates over 140,000 miles of pipelines across 44 states, transporting and storing natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids (NGLs).

While we acknowledge the potential of ET as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]Russia’s Rosatom says first unit of Türkiye’s Akkuyu nuclear plant to launch in 2026:
[TEXT]

The physical and energized launch of the first unit of Türkiye’s Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant is scheduled for 2026, the head of Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom said, according to Russian news agency Tass.

Rosatom CEO Alexey Likhachev said construction of the plant in Mersin’s Gulnar district has continued despite severe disruptions caused by international sanctions imposed on Russia.

“We are targeting next year,” Likhachev said in response to a question about the timeline.

Sanctions disrupt supplies, financing

Likhachev said the Akkuyu project has been among those most affected by sanctions, citing the breakdown of payment systems and the refusal of some suppliers to deliver equipment despite contracts being fulfilled.

He specifically named Germany’s Siemens, saying equipment that had already been manufactured and paid for was not delivered to the project.

As a result, Rosatom turned to alternative suppliers from what Likhachev described as “friendly countries,” while also seeking new financing mechanisms.

He said about $2 billion in frozen funds had not been returned, forcing the company to find ways to route financing directly to Turkish contractors and suppliers involved in the project.

“A huge number of Turkish companies and workers are involved in this construction,” Likhachev said, adding that no other Rosatom project had faced such extensive sanctions-related challenges.

Türkiye confirms 2026 target

Despite the difficulties, Likhachev said Rosatom is continuing efforts to ensure the first unit becomes operational in 2026.

Meanwhile, Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alparslan Bayraktar said earlier in October that the first reactor at Akkuyu is scheduled to begin electricity production in 2026.

“The first unit of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant is planned to start electricity generation in 2026, which will be a historic milestone in our energy diversification,” Bayraktar said in October.

The Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant is being built under a 2010 intergovernmental agreement between Türkiye and Russia.

The facility will consist of four VVER-1200 Generation III+ reactors, each with a capacity of 1,200 megawatts, for a total installed capacity of 4,800 megawatts.

Once fully operational, the plant is expected to meet about 10% of Türkiye’s electricity demand. It is designed for a 60-year operating life, with a possible 20-year extension.

Luxury cars have missed out on India’s passenger vehicle boom in 2025, with sales growth slowing to its weakest pace since the pandemic amid geopolitical uncertainties, volatile stock markets and cost pressures from a weakening rupee.Industry estimates suggest sales of luxury vehicles — priced above ₹50 lakh — will rise just 1.6% year-on-year to around 52,000 units this calendar year, even as overall passenger vehicle retail sales are expected to grow 10.5% to a record 4.6 million, beating start-of-the-year forecasts.Choppy stock markets and mounting geopolitical tensions weighed on demand among the country’s rich and aspirational buyers, while persistent currency depreciation put pressure on costs and pricing, dragging down growth in the luxury segment, said Balbir Singh Dhillon, head of Audi India . “Additionally, the market saw a natural moderation following the strong post-pandemic rebound,” he added.However, Dhillon, along with the heads of rivals Mercedes Benz and BMW India, expect the market to return to a sustainable growth trajectory in 2026, helped by the full-year impact of GST reforms, policy stability and greater macroeconomic clarity.Santosh Iyer, managing director and chief executive officer of Mercedes-Benz India, said the year ended on a positive note for the industry, with pro-consumer policies helping create momentum despite inflationary pressures due to “deteriorating forex headwinds.”Mercedes Benz, BMW and Audi together account for nearly 85% of luxury vehicle sales in the country.India cut GST rates on automobiles to 18% and 40% from 29% and up to 50% (including compensation cess) with effect from September 22, 2025, helping lower acquisition costs and spur demand. Luxury vehicles, which were earlier taxed at 43-50%, now attract 40% GST.In the mainstream market, car sales zoomed 17.2% year-on-year in October and by 18.7% in November, after falling 1.4% in the first six months of the financial year. BMW Group India president Hardeep Singh Brar in recent interaction said consumer sentiments have improved significantly since the tax cuts. “We had more than 2,000 pending orders on October 1. We have been registering strong growth across our portfolio,” he said.Mercedes’ Iyer, too, expects the demand momentum to strengthen in the new year.“We forecast the current demand pattern (post GST cut) to cascade down in early 2026 with GST reform benefits continuing, while recent policy tailwinds are expected to sustain customer sentiment and their purchase resilience, owing to higher disposable income,” he said.Mercedes Benz has lined up multiple launches across internal combustion engine and electric vehicle segments to tap into the latent demand in the market in the new year.Audi, too, is cautiously optimistic. Dhillon expects a more stable currency environment, continued infrastructure development and the growing aspirations of a new, sophisticated generation of luxury buyers to provide tailwinds in the year ahead.“With these factors coming together, we believe the luxury car market in India is well-positioned to return to a path of steady, sustainable growth,” he said.Luxury cars currently have a little over 1% market share in India — the lowest among major economies.In the medium to long term, the country offers ample growth potential given it is home to one of the highest number of billionaires worldwide, industry experts said.

[TITLE]Abia enacts new electricity law, unveils regulatory agency:
[TEXT]
The Abia State Government has enacted the Abia State Electricity Law, 2025, and established the Abia State Electricity Regulatory Authority to oversee electricity market activities within the state.

The new law, enacted pursuant to powers granted to states under the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and the Electricity Act, 2023, empowers Abia to independently regulate electricity generation, transmission, distribution and trading within its territory.

Addressing journalists on Wednesday, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ASERA, Mr Emeka Onyegbule, said the authority had formally taken over regulatory oversight of the state’s electricity market following the issuance of a final transfer order by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission.

Onyegbule said the ASERA board was inaugurated on April 30, 2025, in line with the provisions of the new law.

Onyegbule said, “The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, NERC, in the exercise of the powers conferred under the Electricity Act 2023, issued an interim Transfer Order no: NERC/2025/058 dated the 24th day of June 2025; formally transferring regulatory oversight of the Electricity Market in Abia State from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to the ASERA.

“The Interim Order elapsed after a six-month transition period, paving the way for the Final Transfer Order from the Commission that completely put the regulatory oversight of the state market under ASERA.”

He said the transition culminated in the issuance of a final transfer of regulatory authority order by NERC on December 24, 2025.

“With this transfer, all activities within the electricity value-chain, including generation, transmission, distribution and trading, fall under the direct oversight and regulation of the Authority effective from the date of the Transfer Order,” he said.

He assured licensees and stakeholders that ASERA would operate a fair, objective and transparent regulatory regime, guided strictly by the provisions of the law and its regulatory instruments.

Onyegbule said the authority would ensure compliance with licence terms and contractual obligations, while protecting consumer interests and promoting quality service delivery.

“We will ensure that stakeholders discharge contractual obligations to one another while upholding the terms of their licenses, and customers’ voices will be heard and respected, while we will focus on quality service delivery,” he stated.

Also speaking, the Commissioner for Information, Prince Okey Kanu, said the enactment of the electricity law paved the way for the establishment of ASERA as an independent regulator of the Abia electricity market.

Kanu noted that the transfer of regulatory powers from NERC to ASERA was in line with the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2023, which allows states to regulate their electricity markets.

The Commissioner for Public Utilities, Mr Ikechukwu Uwanna, said the process began on March 17, following the enactment of the electricity law, describing it as a step towards building a world-class electricity market in the state.

Uwanna said the new regulatory framework would encourage investment, protect consumers and improve efficiency in electricity service delivery across Abia State.

[TITLE]Trump Just Sent This Lesser-Known Stock Plunging. Should You Buy the Dip?:
[TEXT]
Orsted ADR (DNNGY) stands as a global leader in renewable energy, specializing in offshore and onshore wind farms, solar power, energy storage, green hydrogen, and bioenergy solutions. The company drives the energy transition by developing large-scale projects that deliver clean power to millions, with a focus on cost-competitive offshore wind and innovative storage technologies to stabilize grids and support electrification.

Founded in 1973, it is headquartered in Fredericia, Denmark, with operations across Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific.

Orsted’s Stock Performance

Orsted ADR trades just above its 52‑week low of about $5.75 and far below the $33 high, reflecting a deep de-rating after capital raises and guidance cuts. Over the past five days, the stock has declined by roughly 12.8%, approximately 4.63% lower over the last month, and is down nearly 51.38% over the last three months, resulting in a year-to-date (YTD) loss of close to 59% and a decline of over 12 months.

By contrast, European utilities benchmarks have been roughly flat to modestly positive over the same 1‑year period, meaning Orsted has sharply underperformed its sector peers amid project delays, dilutive equity issuance, and weaker EBITDA guidance.

Orsted Results

Orsted ADR reported Q3 2025 EBITDA of DKK 3.1 billion, down DKK 6.5 billion from Q3 2024 as exceptional partnership and trading gains did not repeat. The quarter swung to a net loss of DKK 1.7 billion (around USD $260 million), versus a net profit of DKK 5.2 billion a year earlier, coming in weaker than analyst expectations that had anticipated a small profit or near‑breakeven result.

Underlying operating trends were mixed. Offshore EBITDA fell on lower wind speeds, step‑downs in subsidies at older projects, and the absence of last year’s unusually strong power trading, partly offset by ramp‑up at Gode Wind 3 and grid‑delay compensation at Borkum Riffgrund 3. Onshore EBITDA declined modestly to about DKK 0.8 billion, while Bioenergy & Other turned negative.

For the first nine months, EBITDA (ex-partnerships and cancellation fees) was DKK 17.0 billion, roughly in line with the prior year, but impairments and higher capital employed pushed reported ROCE down to 2.0% (10.2% on an adjusted basis). Operating cash flow for Q3 was negative DKK 1.2 billion, with 9M operating cash flow of DKK 6.7 billion versus DKK 8.1 billion in 2024.

Despite the weak quarter, Orsted reaffirmed full‑year 2025 EBITDA guidance of DKK 24–27 billion, excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees, citing solid nine‑month performance and typically stronger wind conditions in Q4. The company also maintained its 2025 gross investment guidance of DKK 50–54 billion and highlighted progress on its 8.1 GW offshore construction pipeline and capital-structure strengthening via a large rights issue and the planned 50% farm-down of Hornsea 3.

Orsted Stock Slides

Orsted shares plunged 13% in late trading after the U.S. Department of the Interior suspended leases for five offshore wind projects already under construction. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum cited national security concerns as the reason for the pause, impacting key U.S. developments in the Danish renewable giant's portfolio. Ørsted shares closed down 12.7% amid the news.

Should You Buy DNNGY?

Orsted offers compelling long-term value for renewable believers, trading near 52-week lows despite reaffirmed 2025 EBITDA guidance. Recent U.S. project pauses add near-term risk, but Europe's offshore wind pipeline remains robust, reflecting upside and providing investors an opportunity to buy the dip.
