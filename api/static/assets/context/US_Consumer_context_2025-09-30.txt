In a relief to the Reliance Industries arm Reliance Retail , appellate tribunal NCLAT has set aside a petition against the leading retailer, which in 2023 reduced the equity share capital of the company, saying non-promoters were offered a "fair value" of their shares.Reliance Retail had in 2023 decided to reduce and cancel 78,65,423 equity shares of the company, held by the minority shareholders , other than the promoters/holding company.Observing that non-promoter shareholders were offered a "fair value" of their shares during the exercise and an overwhelming majority voted in favour of the resolution, the appellate tribunal upheld the earlier order passed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and said it found "no reason to upset a reasoned order passed" by it.The NCLAT, while referring to previous judgements, said "selective reduction is permissible if objecting shareholders are paid a fair value of their shares".On July 4, 2023, the board of Reliance Retail Ltd (RRL), through a special resolution, approved the proposal to reduce and cancel 78,65,423 equity shares of the company, held by minority shareholders, other than promoters/holding company.The company had then offered Rs 1,380 per share to shareholders other than its promoter and holding company, which constituted only 0.09 per cent of the total shareholding.This was challenged by one N G Joshi, a shareholder of RRL having 129 shares, constituting 0.0000014 per cent of the authorised and issued paid-up capital of the company before the Mumbai bench of the NCLT, which had on January 5, 2024 dismissed the petition.As an intervenor, he had objected to the reduction of share capital, alleging that such a reduction is against the minority interest and is not permitted under Section 66 of the Companies Act, 2013, since RRL is forcefully removing its shareholders, and promoters are increasing their stakes by using this process.Subsequently, an appeal to the NCLT order was also filed before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which also dismissed it last week.Passing its order, a two-member NCLAT bench observed that the special resolution for reduction of the share capital was passed with 99.99 per cent approval and Rs 1,380 per share, consideration paid by RRL was at a premium of 56 per cent to its fair value determined by two independent valuers.The six-page-long NCLAT noted that Article 56 of the Articles of Association of RRL permits the company to reduce its capital in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules.Moreover, the Regional Director and ROC (Registrar of Companies) have not objected to the reduction of share capital, though it was remarked by the Regional Director that the proposed reduction is a selective reduction.NCLAT also observed the appellant held mere 129 shares and no other shareholder of RRL has filed any appeal against the NCLT order.Moreover, it is settled law the question of reduction of share capital is treated as a matter of domestic concern, it is the decision of the majority which prevails, the appellate tribunal said."Thus once it is established that non-promoter shareholders are being paid a fair value of their shares and at no point of time it was suggested the amount paid was less and where an overwhelming majority voted in favour of resolution, we find no reason to upset a reasoned order passed by the NCLT," said NCLT bench comprising Member (Judicial) Justice Yogesh Khanna and Member (Technical) Ajai Das Mehrotra.

[TITLE]Pepperfry’s acquisition by TCC Concept exposes deep cracks in online furniture retail:
[TEXT]
Bengaluru: Pepperfry’s sale to realty services firm TCC Concept is likely to expose further cracks in the online furniture retail, with systemic problems such as commoditised designs and supply-chain hurdles coming to light, leaving very few winners, industry executives told Mint .

Last week, small-cap realty services firm TCC Concept announced its acquisition of a 100% stake in Pepperfry for an undisclosed amount, saying it aimed to broaden its e-commerce and digital marketplace presence beyond its real estate management offerings and leasing services. “This acquisition is in line with TCC’s vision of building scalable and technology-enabled consumer platforms," TCC said in a filing with the stock exchanges late on Friday evening. While the size of the deal could not be ascertained, a person close to the company said it was valued at much less than its July 2023 valuation of $352 million.

India’s online furniture industry is struggling, with only a few innovative companies. With most companies relying on commoditised designs and a costly offline crutch, Pepperfry’s plummeting revenue and abandoned IPO weren't just signs of trouble, they were proof of a rapidly changing landscape.

Even the world’s largest furniture retailer is struggling to scale up profitably. Ikea India’s losses widened to ₹1,299 crore in FY24 from ₹1,133 crore a year earlier. The furniture giant entered India in 2018.

“Organising the largely unorganised sector is proving much more difficult in a price-sensitive and moat-less market. Venture capital funding is unable to do the trick either. The industry is prepared to see only one or two success stories – much like the Swiggy-Zomato duopoly in online food delivery," said a late-stage investor who watches the consumer space closely.

“It is unclear how TCC Concept will benefit from Pepperfry. Digital content play is the only obvious strategy here but we’ll have to wait and see how Pepperfry evolves. TCC's flexible office space vertical could synergise with Pepperfry's furniture portfolio," the investor added.

Another one bites the dust

Pepperfry’s acquisition marks the latest consolidation in the struggling sector. In 2020, troubled furniture retailer Urban Ladder was acquired by Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL), a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited, for ₹182 crore – a fraction of the ₹800 crore the startup had raised since its inception in 2012 from investors such as Sequoia Capital India & SEA (now Peak XV Partners), SAIF Partners and Kalaari Capital.

In 2016, Kishore Biyani’s Future Group bought online furniture store FabFurnish for no more than ₹15-20 crore after the firm failed to make a mark because of major operational challenges despite its early entry.

Chinmayi Lanka, senior consultant at Redseer, said, “In our analysis, only two models in this tricky category are showing success. One, having a full-stack model to control every step of the sourcing, manufacturing and assembly process. Two, being present across multiple categories through a healthy mix of online and offline access." Only those companies that are able to crack designs, manufacturing, price points and accessibility will make the cut, Lanka added.

[TITLE]GameGuard Joins Forces with Killara Outdoors in Landmark Acquisition Shaping the Next Era of Outdoor Apparel:
[TEXT]
Southlake, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SOUTHLAKE, TX September 23, 2025 - -

Killara Outdoors, the pioneering operator-led brand growth platform, today announced its acquisition of GameGuard Outdoors, the legendary Texas-born outdoor apparel company renowned for its Southwest-inspired camouflage and field-tested gear. The strategic acquisition marks a powerful new chapter for two celebrated Texas brands, joining operational muscle and deep-rooted heritage to unlock fresh innovation, scale, and reach.

"GameGuard represents the heart and soul of the Southwest outdoor experience. We're humbled that Craig and the team have entrusted their legacy to Killara," said Chris Macaulay, CEO of Killara Outdoors. "Our promise is simple: preserve everything that makes GameGuard iconic, while unlocking new levels of operational excellence, retail reach, and storytelling. This is how you build enduring brands, in partnership, honoring founders, and never losing sight of what makes the community tick."

Founded in Argyle, Texas, by Craig and his late wife Stacy Smith, GameGuard has become a staple among guides, hunters, outfitters, and outdoor families, earning national recognition for durable, innovative designs and its trademark camo patterns inspired by the Southwest's rugged landscape - mesquite, yucca, cactus, and Texas brush. With its trusted technical fabrics and devoted following, GameGuard has built a robust retail presence, now available in more than 2,000 stores across the country.

"We built GameGuard as a family, with our faith, customers, and Texas roots as our guide," said Smith. "As we looked toward the next chapter, finding a partner who respects our DNA and is committed to our people was non-negotiable. Killara brings not just resources, but real-world experience and a respect for legacy. I'm proud to know GameGuard's spirit is in good hands."

Distinguishing itself from traditional corporate acquirers, Killara Outdoors is known for its founder-centric, operator-first approach. The leadership teams both committed that GameGuard's identity and design vision will remain firmly intact, while Killara deploys its operational horsepower to accelerate growth and deepen community engagement.

"GameGuard is that rare brand - instantly recognizable, regionally authentic, and beloved by outdoor enthusiasts nationwide," said Paul Albrecht, President and Chief Strategy Officer of Killara Outdoors. "Our job is to ensure Craig's vision thrives as we help expand the brand's reach and scale their operations. Customers and retailers can expect the same GameGuard spirit and commitment to quality - but in more places and for more seasons."

Karyn McKenna, Killara's Chief Supply Chain Officer, added, "The GameGuard team has built an incredibly robust operation over the last 23 years. We're excited to build upon that great foundation with Killara's logistics and operational expertise. Fans and retailers can expect more frequent product launches, more variety, and the same industry-leading quality, backed by a robust, scalable supply chain."

Effective immediately, GameGuard will continue operating with its core team and signature products, further supported by near-term investments in inventory, retailer support, digital engagement, and limited-edition capsule releases. Looking ahead, the partnership aims to broaden GameGuard's national expansion, accelerate technical innovation, and double down on service to the Southwest's passionate outdoor community.

"This is about operational lift, not loss of soul," said Macaulay. "Our goal: Make GameGuard even more available, reliable, and exciting - without losing a bit of what makes it uniquely Southwest."

[TITLE]AI-native e-commerce platform Genstore secures $10 million in seed funding:
[TEXT]
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genstore, an emerging startup known for its AI-native, intelligence-driven approach to e-commerce operations, has recently completed its $10 million seed funding round. The round was led by Weimob, a leading SaaS enterprise with deep roots in the e-commerce and retail sectors, with participation from Lighthouse Founders' Fund.

This marks Genstore’s first round of funding since its establishment in late 2024. Junwei Huang, cofounder and president of Genstore, stated, “Weimob’s deep expertise in digital transformation and its proven track record in AI deployment align closely with Genstore’s founding vision. This round of funding will be used to accelerate product development and drive market expansion. Through extensive user research and feedback collection, we have identified a range of needs among merchants. We will continue to iterate and enhance our product capabilities to support the efficient and intelligent creation of online stores.”

A new category: AI-native commerce

Genstore is AI-native from the ground up, leveraging technology that helps merchants efficiently build and manage their online businesses. Centered around the concept of AI-native commerce, the company integrates deep, end-to-end e-commerce expertise into a suite of intelligent assistant agents. Its tagline, “Start selling online with just one prompt,” reflects its mission to simplify the entire process.

Genstore’s website immediately reveals its key differentiation: an AI-powered, conversation-based workflow. This departs fundamentally from the visual/template-driven models of competitors, elevating users from “operators” to “commanders.”

Genstore lets merchants launch a store in minutes through AI conversation, with no coding or design skills needed. It automates end-to-end operations like product listing, copywriting, customer service and marketing. For example, uploading images triggers auto-generated pages and templates, with conversational guidance through setup and launch.

Unlike traditional platforms that rely on a generic model, Genstore is built from the ground up as AI-native. While competitors add AI as late-stage assistants, they remain limited by non-AI architectures incapable of reshaping core workflows.

“AI-native isn’t a buzzword, it’s a strategic shift,” said Huang. “It’s
