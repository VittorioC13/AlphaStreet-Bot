[TITLE]Goldman Sachs leads investment in software delivery startup Harness at $5.5 billion valuation:
[TEXT]
Jyoti Bansal, co-founder and CEO of Harness, speaks at the company's Unscripted conference in London on Sept. 25, 2025.

Almost nine years ago, Jyoti Bansal sold AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion just as the software startup was set to go public.

Bansal's latest venture, Harness, is now worth substantially more than that, after raking in $200 million in fresh capital at a $5.5 billion valuation in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs .

Harness' technology helps companies manage and monitor code that's produced with the help of artificial intelligence, making sure it doesn't break, create security vulnerabilities or trigger cost overruns. It's a compliment to the so-called vibe coding trend that's taken off with the boom in generative AI.

In recent months, venture capitalists have poured money into startups such as Cursor, Lovable and most recently Kilo Code that sell subscriptions for tools for directing AI models to write and update software. Harness' software draws on models from Anthropic and OpenAI.

Earlier this year, Bansal bolstered Harness' cybersecurity chops by merging the startup with Traceable, another company he co-founded. The combined company, based in San Francisco, has a total of about 1,300 employees.

Harness is on track to exceed its goal of more than $250 million in annualized revenue, growing more than 50% year over year, Bansal said. That makes it larger than AppDynamics at the time it was acquired by Cisco.

Bansal is aiming for a different outcome this time.

"I'm a believer that at the right market timing, we want to operate as a public company, so we can build for the long term," Bansal said.

In addition to the funding round, Harness is also planning a $40 million tender offer to provide some liquidity to long-standing employees.

[TITLE]Exclusive-AI software startup Harness valued at $5.5 billion in latest financing round:
[TEXT]
Dec 11 : Harness, an AI software development startup, has raised $200 million in a Goldman Sachs-led fundraising round that values it at $5.5 billion, the company said on Thursday.

The financing marks a 49 per cent jump in the firm's valuation nearly four years after a Series-D round valued it at $3.7 billion.

Private market investors continue to plough into artificial intelligence as the nascent technology promises to universally automate structured and repetitive corporate and tech tasks.

Harness is also planning a $40 million tender offer with participation from existing investors IVP, Menlo Ventures and Unusual Ventures.

"We were not looking to actively raise capital right now," Harness Cofounder and CEO Jyoti Bansal told Reuters in an interview.

"But we had a lot of investor interest. So a lot of people were coming and reaching out to us, and that's what kind of created this financing," he said.

As boardrooms look to use AI to aid, and sometimes to replace, expensive software engineers, the velocity and volume of code being written has dramatically accelerated.

Harness has been benefiting from this shift, as it offers workflow AI tools that develop written code into practical use cases.

Its customers include National Australia Bank, Morningstar and United Airlines, whose deployment times accelerated by 75 per cent after using its tools, Harness said.

Major U.S. lenders JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have been vocal about AI-fueled productivity gains, are not only customers but also investors in Harness.

The blurring lines between client and owner labels across AI startups have led to comparisons with dotcom-era financing structures.

"We have very strong collaborative partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and AWS," Bansal said.

[TITLE]Private capital targets mission-critical software power and platforms in new space economy:
[TEXT]
Private capital targets mission-critical software power and platforms in new space economy

by Clarence Oxford

Los Angeles CA (SPX) Dec 09, 2025

Axle Point Capital and Balerion Space Ventures are directing new private capital into companies that build core infrastructure for the expanding U.S. space and defense economy, from mission software and guidance systems to deployable microreactors and high-temperature reactors. Axle Point's first transaction is a strategic equity investment in Odyssey Space Research LLC, a flight software and engineering firm that supports NASA and defense programs, while Balerion has taken stakes in Antares Industries, Samara Aerospace, and Valar Atomics, three companies focused on spacecraft platforms and nuclear energy systems for defense and industrial users.

Odyssey Space Research develops and sustains flight software and guidance, navigation and control (GN and C) systems for missions that range from small satellites to large human-rated spacecraft. Its work covers flight software development, simulation, mission analysis, avionics integration and test, spaceflight simulation and analysis, and human spaceflight operations, using software frameworks and tools that support configurable mission solutions. Odyssey's teams contribute to missions that include proximity operations such as rendezvous and docking, and support both uncrewed and crewed spacecraft operating in the vicinity of the International Space Station and in other complex orbital regimes.

A key growth driver for Odyssey is NASA's RPOC V contract, a five year award that extends the company's role in integrated GN and C assessments and trajectory and flight software integration. Under RPOC V, Odyssey supports commercial cargo and crew vehicles that approach and depart the ISS, as well as GN and C and trajectory work for Orion program missions. The contract continues a workload where Odyssey's analysis and software integration tasks must meet NASA human spaceflight certification and safety requirements, reinforcing its position as a supplier of mission-critical software and engineering to U.S. government customers.

Axle Point Capital, based in Newport Beach, completed the Odyssey transaction in partnership with the ONE Bow River National Defense Fund, which provided equity capital for the acquisition. The deal establishes Odyssey as a platform investment for Axle Point as it pursues additional aerospace, defense, and government services opportunities with institutional co investors. The firm's strategy centers on hard-to-access sectors such as space and defense, where programs often require long-term technical support, regulatory approval, and specialized engineering capabilities.

"Axle Point Capital was founded to identify and unlock value in hard-to-access sectors like space and defense," said Gerik Degner, CFA, Managing Partner. "We are thrilled to partner with ONE Bow River and the exceptional team at Odyssey and look forward to leveraging our sector expertise to help accelerate its growth and expand its impact on vital national space programs."

"Odyssey represents the very best of innovation in spaceflight software and guidance, navigation, and control systems for manned and unmanned spaceflight and robotics. The Odyssey team is stellar from top to bottom," added Kevin O'Neil, Chief Investment Officer of ONE Bow River. Steven Joanis, Senior Managing Director, added, "It is a privilege to partner with Axle Point, whose market understanding, strategic vision, and raw tenacity were pivotal in architecting this transaction and bode well for the valuation acceleration to come. This investment underscores our shared commitment to advancing technologies that are vital to our nation's capabilities in space."

Balerion Space Ventures is pursuing a parallel thesis across frontier technology, announcing investments in Antares Industries, Samara Aerospace, and Valar Atomics as part of a portfolio designed around systems that build, power, and operate critical space and industrial infrastructure. Antares is developing modular, transportable microreactors intended for rapid deployment in contested or remote environments to provide autonomous, resilient power for defense operations and critical infrastructure. These systems target growing demand for local, secure energy as defense spending increases and policymakers place more emphasis on energy security and grid resilience.

Samara Aerospace is building high precision spacecraft platforms that use advanced attitude control technologies to deliver agile on-orbit performance. Its satellite buses are aimed at missions that require fine pointing and maneuverability, including next-generation Earth observation and other constellations that depend on accurate pointing and rapid retasking. As government and commercial operators expand orbital infrastructure, platforms like those developed by Samara are positioned as enabling assets for imaging, data relay, and other services that rely on stable, responsive spacecraft.

Valar Atomics is focused on nuclear systems for heavy industrial power and hydrocarbon fuel production, and reports that it is the first U.S. nuclear startup to reach criticality at its Utah testing site. The company is advancing high-temperature reactors designed to provide industrial heat and support clean fuel production, and has achieved cold criticality under Project NOVA and been selected for U.S. Department of Energy efforts such as the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program and Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Program. Valar has begun construction of Ward 250, its first nuclear test reactor in Utah, after completing Ward Zero, a non nuclear prototype facility, and is working with partners including the Philippines Nuclear Research Institute as it develops TRISO-fueled, helium-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor technology for industrial users and AI infrastructure that require high reliability power.

"Launch costs are collapsing. Defense budgets are rising. Dual-use technologies are being adopted at a record pace," said Phil Scully, Co Founder and General Partner at Balerion Space Ventures. "The companies we're backing are building the foundational systems that will power the next trillion-dollar economy. Agile spacecraft, advanced nuclear systems, and deployable microreactors - these are the technologies that will determine who leads in space, defense, and domestic manufacturing over the next decade as we enter a new industrial era driven by mass access to space. Balerion is excited to back the companies developing the infrastructure that will power the space economy."

"These companies are building the enabling infrastructure that the broader space and defense ecosystem will rely upon for decades," said Daniel Wallman, Partner at Balerion. "As capital pours into the sector, our focus remains disciplined on backing mission-critical platforms with real technical depth and scalable economics. Antares, Samara, and Valar exemplify the kind of durable enterprise value being created at the frontier of this asset class."

Balerion states that the funding will support product development, facility build out, and progress toward commercial milestones at each of the three portfolio companies as they expand work with defense, civil, and commercial customers. The firm plans to discuss the investments and its view of the market at its annual general meeting in Bentonville, Arkansas.

The EU and Canada also plan to explore joint research and expand access to the powerful computing resources needed to train modern AI models.

Digital identity wallets were another focus. The EU and Canada signed an agreement to work toward interoperable digital credentials, which could make it easier for people to use things like digital licences or certificates across borders. They plan to run pilot programs and testing environments over the coming months (more on this below).

Both sides also raised concerns

[TITLE]Minister highlights Tinubu’s digital reforms, says 3MTT powering Nigeria’s tech future:
[TEXT]
The Minister of Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy, Bosun Tijani, on Thursday highlighted major policy decisions made under President Bola Tinubu in the last two years, saying the reforms have strengthened Nigeria’s digital economy and laid the foundation for large-scale technology talent development.

Mr Tijani spoke at the 3MTT National Impact Summit held at the Presidential Banquet Hall, Abuja, where he credited the president’s commitment to “firing up the base” and ensuring that reforms directly benefit the average Nigerian.

He said the administration has enacted far-reaching policies, including the signing of the National Data Protection Commission Act, which gave Nigeria its first standalone data protection regulator.

“This commission is now recognised all over the world as one of the very best in Africa,” he said.

The minister added that in October 2023, President Tinubu approved the 3MTT initiative as the “largest technology talent accelerator programme in the world.”

He also noted that in May 2024, the president committed to expanding national connectivity by approving a $2 billion investment in 90,000 kilometres of fibre optic cable to provide Nigerians with “the best internet that is available anywhere in the world.”

According to him, the project is the largest of its kind in any developing country.

Mr Tijani said the president further declared all telecommunications and ICT infrastructure as critical national infrastructure in August 2024, granting them protection similar to military assets.

Speaking on telecom sector challenges, he said: “For 10 years, they had been struggling to change the pricing of their services, and in January 2025, the president allowed these companies to increase their tariffs after a thorough study.”

He added that the government recently approved the deployment of about 4,000 telecom towers in rural communities.

“This initiative will bring close to 23 million Nigerians that are currently not connected at all into the digital economy,” he noted.

3MTT and job creation

Mr Tijani said the celebration of 3MTT aligns with the president’s commitment to job creation.

“Our president said he would like to create a million technology jobs,” he recalled.

He said analysis by the ministry showed that there were over 4.5 million unfilled jobs in the technology sector at the end of 2023, adding:

“This means creating one million technical jobs is not something Nigeria cannot achieve.”

He added that about 59 per cent of the workforce will require upskilling, and that global projections show 170 million tech jobs will be created by 2030.

With Nigeria’s youthful population, he said the country is well positioned for global competitiveness. “We are in a good position to truly become a net exporter of talent,” he said.

This realisation, he added, informed the establishment of 3MTT as the world’s largest technology talent accelerator, designed to train three million Nigerians for both local and international markets.

Mr Tijani said the ministry received strong private sector support even when there was no government budget for the programme.

“IHS Towers came forward and decided to put ₦1 billion into 3MTT,” he said.

He added that IHS further invested ₦1.5 billion into renovating the damaged tech park in Kano, alongside other investments in Kwara and Borno states.

“MTN also turned up with ₦3 billion, followed by ₦1 billion from Airtel,” he noted.

AWS provided credits, while Google “invested over ₦2 billion into training technical talents focused on deep technology.”

He said Wema Bank provided credit worth over $10 million, The Alternative Bank offered ₦5 billion in device financing, Microsoft invested $1 million in training, and SecureID supported fellows who contributed to what he described as “the first government-backed large language model in Africa.”

Progress so far

The minister said over 1.8 million Nigerians applied for 3MTT within a month of its launch, adding: “These are uniquely identified individuals from every state and every local government.”

To ensure proper delivery, he said the ministry adopted a phased model: “We focused on 1 per cent, then 10%, and finally 100% of the three million target.”

Training for the first 30,000 participants began in December 2023, while the second phase started in July 2024.

He said the programme has already recorded “over 15,000 direct jobs in the first batch,” with some participants earning over ₦250,000 in their first roles.

He added that 201 applied learning centres have been activated, with over 600 facilitators and 15 e-learning providers engaged.

He also noted that 37 community managers funded by IHS, support the programme across all states and the FCT.

“SCC provided laptops worth over ₦1.5 billion,” he added, while “over ₦400 million has been given out in prizes.”

He said the programme’s Net Promoter Score of 8.5 out of 10 shows strong satisfaction among participants.

“You didn’t need to know anybody to be part of this programme… this is a programme for you,” he said.

[TITLE]Needham Boosts Ciena (CIEN) Price Target to $240 Ahead of Earnings:
[TEXT]
Ciena Corporation (NYSE:CIEN) is one of the Hot AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar. On December 8, Needham raised its price target on the stock to $240.00 from $130.00 while maintaining a “Buy” rating.

The price target rating comes ahead of fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report on December 11 before markets open. Rising hyperscale AI capital expenditure and positive momentum in the telecommunications industry has led to strong demand for both Cloud and Telecom sectors for Ciena.

“Ahead of CIEN’s F4Q earnings, our industry checks indicate broad, strong demand in both Cloud and Telco, driven by rising hyperscale AI capex and positive momentum in Telco. As the industry leader in both plugs and line systems, we remain positive on CIEN heading into F26 and expect upside to 4Q results and F26 guidance.” -Analysts led by Ryan Koontz.

Analyst sees modest upside versus consensus estimates and increased beats moving through fiscal 2026. This is supported by the company’s impressive backlog and continued network investment trends. Overall, the firm is optimistic on Ciena’s ability to sustain its strong competitive position and global market share.

Ciena Corporation (NYSE:CIEN) is a telecommunications hardware and software provider.

[TITLE]Telcos set for steady sales, earnings growth in 2026 – Moody’s:
[TEXT]
The corporate finance group of major credit rating agency Moody’s reckons the global telecom operator sector is set for stable revenue and core earnings growth in 2026, although expectations for the different geographic regions vary quite markedly, with Latin America set for the strongest growth.

During the ratings agency’s recent Global Telecommunications Market Update 2026, Carlos Winzer, associate managing director of the corporate finance group, said average organic revenue growth for the global telco sector is projected at 2.3% and organic earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) growth at 2.9% for the largest operators globally.

“This stability is supported by price increases, which continue to gain traction, the phasing out of the legacy copper networks, which are being substituted with fibre, and the integration of GenAI [generative AI] to drive efficiency. Industry consolidation is expected to further strengthen the sector’s foundations,” Winzer said.

In terms of the different regions, North America is expected to see the lowest revenue growth of 1.3%, while Latin America (LatAm) will see the highest at 3.7%. LatAm also leads with the highest expected EBITDA growth of 5.2%, while Asia Pacific (APAC) brings up the rear with 2.2% (see map, above).

Although macroeconomic conditions are challenging and risks remain, Winzer said telecom service providers “continue to evolve their business models in a period of transformation marked by rising data consumption and expanding broadband access”.

M&A on the cards in Europe

Telcos in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are expected to see revenue and EBITDA growth of 3.6% and 4% respectively owing to growing data demand, higher broadband penetration and streamlining at an operational level, said Winzer.

At the same time, he noted that major European telcos “are positioned for a wave of mergers and acquisitions in 2026, with consolidation talks intensifying across several markets”, such as in France, Italy and Spain.

“All these developments suggest that 2026 could be a pivotal year for European telecom M&A as operators seek scale and efficiency in an increasingly competitive market,” said Winzer.

Telcos in Europe also continue to hold significant amounts of debt, and will “need to navigate a challenging funding environment, balancing investment demands with prudent financial management to ensure continued access to liquidity and support for future growth”, he added.

Turning to North America, Emile El-Nems, VP and senior credit officer at Moody’s, said the outlook for the US is stable because of underlying dynamics, such as a more supportive regulatory environment, limited pricing power, “operating leverage” owing to acquisitions, and modest subscriber growth.

“We are expecting seven to eight million subscribers [net adds] in wireless… and
