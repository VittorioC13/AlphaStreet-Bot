Previously, we reported that erstwhile high-flying nuclear energy stocks have crashed spectacularly, with the harsh reality of the long lead and construction times of nuclear facilities, coupled with the fact that some stocks in the space with zero revenues are in nosebleed territory, sending the sector into a tailspin.

[TITLE]Iraq's major oilfield West Qurna 1 to boost production by 2026:
[TEXT]
BAGHDAD, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's major oilfield West Qurna 1 plans to increase its crude oil production capacity to a maximum of 670,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2026 from the current 600,000 bpd, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported Thursday.

The development plan, including rehabilitating several wells and increasing drilling activity, reflects ongoing efforts to maximize Iraq's oil revenue for global markets, the INA said.

On Jan. 1, 2024, China's leading oil and gas producer, China National Petroleum Corporation, officially took over from U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil as the lead contractor for the oilfield.

[TITLE]Aramco Redefines Oil Power in $120 Billion U.S. Tech and LNG Alliance:
[TEXT]
The outcome of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, including his meeting with Trump and his entire entourage, has been successful, at least by media reporting. The impact of all is still to be seen, but from the start, MBS’s visit not just rebooted a strained political relationship. The primary outcome, based on all, is that it has reset the economic core of the US–Saudi partnership around Aramco. While the largest oil company in the world had already found its place in global power projections, Aramco has now become the principal vehicle for turning headline investment promises into hard assets, contracts, and code.

Though 2025 isn’t over yet, Aramco’s multibillion-dollar dealmaking spree with the United States has already reached staggering levels. In May 2025, the oil company had already unveiled 34 preliminary agreements with US companies worth up to $90 billion, encompassing a wide range of projects, including LNG, refinery upgrades, AI, advanced materials, and finance. The latter is now followed by another 17 MOUs, adding another $30 billion in potential projects, from LNG and manufacturing to services procurement. If you take both figures together, it shows clearly that the Saudi pledge to raise total investments is now anchored at around $1 trillion.

Analysts should understand that these levels of financial commitments are no longer just

[TITLE]Trump opens parts of Florida, California waters up to offshore oil drilling, breaking decades of precedent:
[TEXT]
The Trump administration is proposing to open federal waters off the entire coastline of California to drilling, as well as an area off the coast of Florida. Neither state’s waters have been open to new drilling for decades.

President Donald Trump’s Interior Department released a five-year offshore drilling plan on Thursday that would open up vast parts of California’s coastline to drilling, which hasn’t happened in that state since the late 1960s. The Department is also proposing new oil drilling in parts of the Eastern Gulf — located approximately 100 nautical miles off Florida’s coast — a decision opposed by Florida’s Republican leadership.

The Trump administration’s proposal would open the Eastern Gulf to federal oil drilling auctions starting in 2029. It would open auctions for drilling in central and southern California in 2027 and northern California in 2029.

The oil industry has been advocating for opening up parts of the Eastern Gulf that are adjacent to areas where oil production has been happening for decades in the Central Gulf, an industry source told CNN.

The proposal is sure to be met with resistance in California. The state’s coast has not seen drilling since a devastating oil spill in 1969, which drew national attention for destroying coastal wildlife and the state’s fishing industry.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the plan “idiotic” in a statement and vowed the state “will use every tool at our disposal to protect our coastline.”

“It’s interesting that Donald’s proposal doesn’t include the waters off Mar-a-Lago,” Newsom said in his statement.

During Trump’s first term, Florida’s congressional delegation — including Republicans — repeatedly pushed back against attempts to open the eastern Gulf of Mexico to drilling. The first Trump administration extended the offshore drilling ban for the Eastern Gulf, rather than opening it up.

This new Gulf action has also rankled many Florida Republicans, where memories of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill still shape public opinion. Molly Best, a spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, said the governor’s office still supports the ban on drilling in the area from Trump’s first term.

The DeSantis administration “urges the Department of Interior to reconsider,” Best said in a statement.

And a letter from several Florida Republican congressmen to the president urged the administration to withdraw the Eastern Gulf parcels, saying oil exploration there was “incompatible with military operations and recreational uses.” Among the signees is Rep. Byron Donalds, the Trump-endorsed candidate for governor in 2026.

Leading up to the release of Thursday’s five-year plan, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said he believed he had assurances from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that any new drilling in the Gulf would not threaten Florida economically, environmentally or militarily, a source with knowledge of their conversation told CNN. A source close to several Republicans in Florida’s delegation told CNN officials believe the proposal honors those assurances, though congressional staff were still studying the details.

National Ocean Industries Association president Erik Milito called the inclusion of the Eastern Gulf a “forward-looking approach” and American Petroleum Institute president Mike Sommers hailed it as a “historic step.”

The move is part of President Donald Trump’s agenda to open up more parts of the country to drilling for fossil fuels — the oft-repeated campaign promise of “drill, baby, drill.”

Trump’s plan also proposes holding lease sales in the western and central Gulf of Mexico, where the vast majority of offshore drilling currently takes place. It also proposes auctioning off federal waters along almost all of Alaska’s coastline at the end of the decade and into the early 2030s.

In response to the Trump administration’s new plan, California leaders vowed to push back on the federal government’s move to open waters up to drilling, including possible legal action.

“Time and again, President Trump has shown that his interest lies with his Big Oil friends profiting at the expense of our environment and public health,” said Christine Lee, a spokesperson for California attorney general Rob Bonta. “We won’t stand for this and are exploring our legal options.”

Sen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Jared Huffman, both California Democrats, said in a joint statement that Trump’s plan “targets California and the whole West Coast because they think we will roll over.”

“They are wrong,” Padilla and Huffman said. “We’re going to fight this with everything we have.”

Given Trump’s tariffs, it’s not currently boom time for oil drilling, experts told CNN. Companies instead are trying to curb their spending and hold onto their earnings, said Tom Seng, a professor of energy finance at Texas Christian University.

“Right now, the industry doesn’t have a lot going on,” Seng told CNN. “We certainly have a pro-fossil fuel administration. They’re going to streamline things for us, but the marketplace will always dictate activity.”

However, Seng said, some oil exploration companies will likely want to “take advantage of the lease offerings,” with an eye towards the long-term future.

“The question is, when will they deploy the capital to actually drill on the leases?” he said. “There won’t be a rush to do so. $60 oil won’t help.”

Environmental groups said the plan would pose a threat to marine life and oceanside communities around the country.

“This draft plan is an oil spill nightmare,” said Oceana campaign director Joseph Gordon. “The last thing America needs now is a massive expansion of offshore drilling that could shut down our shores with catastrophic oil spills.”

The latest move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken in recent days and weeks to expand oil drilling around the country. The Interior Department this week announced it was rolling back a Biden-era rule that had banned fossil fuel drilling on nearly half of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, over 13 million acres.

And environmental groups sounded the alarm as oil company ConocoPhillips proposed more oil drilling exploration in Alaska, including drilling four new exploratory wells in the NPRA. The company is currently developing the massive Willow project in NPRA where it expects to start producing oil by 2029. Willow was approved by former President Joe Biden in a move that roiled the Democratic president’s base.

“The public deserves the right to have a say on what happens on these critically important public lands in the Western Arctic,” Earthjustice attorney Ian Dooley said in a recent statement. “Seismic and drilling activities can cause impacts on this sensitive ecosystem that lasts decades.”

[TITLE]Smartkem and Jericho Energy Ventures Extend Letter Of Intent for Proposed All-Stock Merger to Form U.S.-Owned, AI-Focused Infrastructure Company:
[TEXT]
Proposed all-stock transaction aims to align JEV's scalable energy platform with Smartkem's semiconductor innovations to power next generation AI data centers

MANCHESTER, England, Nov. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Smartkem, Inc. (Nasdaq: SMTK), ("Smartkem"), a company developing a new class of organic semiconductor technology, today announced that it has agreed to a 60-day extension of its non-binding Letter of Intent ("LOI") for a proposed all-stock business combination (the "Proposed Transaction") with Jericho Energy Ventures Inc. (TSX-V: JEV, OTC: JROOF) ("Jericho" or "JEV"), an energy innovation company. The amendment to the LOI also extends the deadline by which Smartkem is required to invest in Jericho to prevent Jericho from having the right to terminate the LOI to December 31, 2025. The other terms of the LOI remain unchanged.

As previously disclosed, if completed, the Proposed Transaction would establish a Nasdaq-listed, U.S.-owned and controlled AI infrastructure company that integrates low-cost domestic energy with advanced semiconductor packaging and materials to support the rapidly growing demand for AI compute capacity.

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY

Ian Jenks, Chairman & CEO of Smartkem

"We are pleased to extend the LOI as both teams are committed to working towards a transaction that could unlock meaningful value across the rapidly converging energy and AI sectors. We believe the opportunity to integrate Smartkem's world-class semiconductor materials with JEV's scalable energy platform represents a compelling strategic path forward."

Brian Williamson, CEO of Jericho Energy Ventures

"Extending the LOI reflects the continued enthusiasm between JEV and Smartkem to progress with the proposed merger to create a U.S.-owned AI infrastructure company that brings together JEV's energy innovation and Smartkem's semiconductor capabilities. We look forward to discussions toward a definitive agreement."

Anthony Amato, Strategic Advisor to Smartkem

"This extension indicates the significant potential that both parties see in combining the complementary capabilities of JEV's energy platform with Smartkem's semiconductor technology to meet the power and performance needs of next-generation AI infrastructure."

The LOI is non-binding, and there can be no assurance that Smartkem and Jericho will ultimately enter into a definitive agreement for the Proposed Transaction, that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated, or as to the timing or ultimate terms of any Proposed Transaction that may occur. Both Smartkem and Jericho will need significant additional capital to complete the negotiation of the Proposed Transaction, obtain any required stockholder approvals and ultimately complete the Proposed Transaction. The closing of the Proposed Transaction would be subject to significant closing conditions, including the negotiation of the definitive agreement, the satisfactory completion of due diligence, required board and stockholder approvals, and approval of continued listing by Nasdaq.

[TITLE]Energy minister says 'there's no shortcut' to bringing down bills - as price cap rise announced:
[TEXT]
Households and businesses will have to wait for energy bills to fall significantly because "there's no shortcut" to bringing down prices, the energy minister has told Sky News.

Speaking as Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers ways of easing the pressure on households in next week's budget, energy minister Michael Shanks conceded that Labour's election pledge to cut bills by £300 by converting the UK to clean power has not been delivered.

It comes as Ofgem announced the average annual energy bill will rise by 0.2% in January, despite wholesale costs falling.

Major forecasters Cornwall Insight had predicted a 1% drop - but the energy regulator has moved in the opposite direction. Between January and March, the typical annual dual fuel bill will be £1,758 - up from the current £1,755 cap.

The UK has the second-highest domestic and the highest industrial electricity prices among developed nations, despite renewable sources providing more than 50% of UK electricity last year.

"The truth is, we do have to build that infrastructure in order to remove the volatility of fossil fuels from people's bills," Mr Shanks said.

"We obviously hope that that will happen as quickly as possible, but there's no shortcut to this, and there's not an easy solution to building the clean power system that brings down bills."

His comments come amid growing scepticism

[TITLE]Azerbaijan Bets Big on China to Power Its Green Energy Corridor:
[TEXT]
Azerbaijan is hoping China can play a big role in helping Baku fulfill its ambitions of building a “green energy corridor” to Europe.

Azerbaijani officials and representatives of China's Datang Overseas Investment Co. signed a deal on November 12 covering the construction of a 100 Megawatt solar power plant. The sides also agreed to explore the development of offshore wind power, energy storage systems, and the implementation of technical training programs.

The solar farm will be situated in the Gobustan District south of Baku, with a target completion date for the second half of 2026. China's Jinko Solar announced that it will supply solar panels for the plant, while Turkey's EPRA Energy has confirmed that it has conducted grid connection, grid code compliance, and power quality analyses for the project.

The Datang deal is an outgrowth of Azerbaijani leader Ilham Aliyev’s April visit to Beijing, which saw the signing of six separate cooperation agreements covering the potential development of renewable energy projects in Azerbaijan.

[TITLE]NextNRG Secures 28-Year Microgrid Power Purchase Agreement with California Healthcare Facility, Expanding into a Multi-Billion-Dollar Healthcare Resilience Market:
[TEXT]
Miami, FL, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NextNRG, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXXT), a pioneer in AI-driven energy innovation transforming how energy is produced, managed, and delivered, today announced the execution of a 28-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Sunnyside Nursing and Post-Acute Care Center in Torrance, California. This milestone marks a major step in NextNRG’s transition from development-stage projects into long-term ownership and operation of revenue-producing energy assets, generating approximately $5.0 million in gross revenue over the life of the agreement and establishing a stable, asset-backed cash flow stream.

This agreement positions NextNRG within one of the most attractive and underserved segments of the distributed energy market: the long-term care, post-acute, and assisted living sector. With more than 15,000 licensed nursing homes and an additional 32,000 assisted-living facilities in the United States, the total addressable market for resilient energy systems in this vertical exceeds $3.2 billion annually, with expected growth toward $7–8 billion over the next decade. These facilities must maintain continuous power for patient care, HVAC, and life-safety equipment, making them highly aligned with NextNRG’s “own-and-operate” microgrid model.

At the same time, regulatory pressure is rapidly reshaping this market and accelerating demand for on-site resiliency solutions. Many states are now requiring healthcare facilities to install extended backup power systems to protect patients who depend on continuous power during grid outages. In California, for example, mandates require that skilled nursing facilities maintain an alternate power source capable of operating for 96 hours as of January 1, 2024. In other states such as Florida and Texas, similar regulations now require long-term care facilities to maintain backup power capable of supporting heating and cooling systems for up to 96 hours during outages. These recently enacted requirements create a time-sensitive need for reliable, multi-source energy systems further validating the strategic value of entering this sector.

From the healthcare facility’s perspective, this PPA reduces risk by eliminating the need to fund high capital expenditures to build their own resiliency infrastructure. Under the PPA, they receive predictable, stable long-term energy pricing along with redundancy — solar, battery storage, and gas-powered backup generation — which supports their HCAI regulatory compliance and service requirements.

Project Overview

Under the agreement, NextNRG will develop and operate a multi-source microgrid at Sunnyside that blends 409 kW of rooftop solar, a 300 kW battery energy storage system, and integration with existing gas-fueled backup generation. This diversified energy mix ensures maximum reliability, enabling the facility to maintain power across grid disruptions while benefiting from optimized costs and clean generation. The system is expected to produce approximately 627,000 kWh in its first year.

As outlined in the project scope, NextNRG will complete a full roof replacement to support the solar array, deliver HCAI-compliant engineering and permitting, install QCells DuoPeak modules and SolarEdge inverters, upgrade electrical systems, and manage interconnection with Southern California Edison. NextNRG will own, operate, monitor, and maintain the system for the duration of the 28-year contract.

“Signing this long-term PPA with Sunnyside is a turning point for NextNRG,” said Michael D. Farkas, Executive Chairman and CEO of NextNRG. “We’re no longer just developing projects, we’re locking in long-term, contracted revenue for critical microgrid assets that we own and operate. This is exactly the evolution we’ve been working toward.”

“These kinds of facilities provide critical, power-dependent care, and simply cannot afford outages,” Farkas added. “Our microgrid will give Sunnyside dependable, clean, cost-controlled energy for decades to come, and we see this as the blueprint for many similar projects in the healthcare sector.”

[TITLE]Tesla deploys its first Superchargers owned by 3rd-party in the US:
[TEXT]
Tesla has officially deployed its first Supercharger station owned by a third party in the US, a step in the automaker’s effort to accelerate the charging infrastructure growth while reducing capital expenditure.

The new station, located at a Suncoast Charging in Land O’Lakes, Florida, consists of 8 stalls and is now open to the public.

While Tesla has previously sold Supercharger hardware to other networks – most notably BP Pulse back in 2023 – this site represents a different model.

The station is owned by the host but fully managed by Tesla, meaning it appears and functions exactly like any other Supercharger in the navigation system and app, maintaining the seamless user experience Tesla owners, and now non-Tesla owners, are used to.
