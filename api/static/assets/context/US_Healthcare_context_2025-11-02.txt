The United Kingdom Sleep Apnea Devices Market was valued at USD 0.79 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 1.18 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 6.76%

The growing emphasis on efficient healthcare management is a key factor propelling the expansion of the United Kingdom sleep apnea devices market. As healthcare systems increasingly prioritize early diagnosis, preventative care, and streamlined treatment pathways, conditions like sleep apnea - previously underdiagnosed - are gaining heightened clinical and commercial attention. This shift is driving increased adoption of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic devices that enable effective management of sleep disorders, thereby reducing long-term healthcare costs and improving patient outcomes.

Technological innovation remains at the forefront of this market transformation. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities into sleep apnea devices is enhancing the precision, efficiency, and user experience of diagnosis and treatment. Modern CPAP devices, for instance, now feature real-time monitoring, automated pressure adjustments, and cloud-based data sharing - enabling healthcare providers to track patient adherence remotely and make timely clinical decisions. This aligns with national digital health objectives and supports the broader transition towards remote patient monitoring and home-based care models.

Demographic and lifestyle trends further reinforce market growth. The UK's aging population and increasing prevalence of obesity are contributing to a rise in obstructive sleep apnea cases. As a result, healthcare providers are investing in scalable, cost-effective diagnostic solutions such as home sleep testing kits, which are gaining traction due to their convenience, affordability, and ability to accelerate diagnosis rates. In parallel, therapeutic devices - particularly CPAP machines and sleep apnea masks - are experiencing robust demand as awareness and diagnosis rates improve.

Key Market Drivers

Rising Demand for Efficient Healthcare Management

The rising demand for efficient healthcare management is a critical driver shaping the growth trajectory of the United Kingdom sleep apnea devices market. As the National Health Service (NHS) and private healthcare providers increasingly shift towards value-based care models, there is a strong emphasis on optimizing resource utilization, reducing hospital admissions, and enhancing clinical outcomes. Sleep apnea, a prevalent but often underdiagnosed chronic condition, poses significant long-term health risks including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Addressing this condition through early diagnosis and effective therapy aligns with broader healthcare efficiency goals.

To this end, healthcare systems are adopting innovative diagnostic and therapeutic solutions that enable timely intervention and remote patient management. Devices such as cloud-connected CPAP machines, home sleep testing kits, and wearable sleep trackers support this transformation by improving accessibility, enhancing monitoring accuracy, and reducing dependency on hospital infrastructure. Moreover, integration of digital health technologies such as AI-powered analytics and IoT connectivity streamlines treatment workflows and enables continuous care delivery outside traditional clinical settings.

This growing need for scalable, cost-effective, and patient-centric healthcare solutions is encouraging investment in sleep apnea devices across both public and private sectors. As efficient healthcare delivery becomes a national priority, the sleep apnea devices market in the UK is poised for sustained and accelerated growth.

Key Market Challenges

Low Diagnosis and Treatment Rates

Low Diagnosis and Treatment Rates represent a critical barrier to the growth of the United Kingdom sleep apnea devices market. Despite increasing awareness of sleep disorders, a significant portion of the UK population suffering from sleep apnea remains undiagnosed or untreated. Studies suggest that over 80% of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) cases go undetected, primarily due to a lack of public awareness and misinterpretation of symptoms such as snoring, fatigue, and poor concentration as normal or unrelated health issues.

This diagnostic gap is further compounded by limited screening protocols at the primary care level. General practitioners may not routinely assess patients for sleep-related disorders, and there is often a lack of standardized referral pathways to sleep specialists. Consequently, many individuals do not undergo timely testing or access to appropriate therapies, such as CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) or oral appliances.

Inadequate diagnosis directly impacts the addressable market for sleep apnea devices, restricting potential demand and slowing market penetration. It also delays intervention, increasing long-term healthcare costs due to untreated comorbidities like hypertension and cardiovascular disease. To unlock market potential, stakeholders must focus on raising awareness, expanding primary care education, and improving accessibility to diagnostic services across both urban and rural regions.

Key Market Trends

Rising Adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning

The rising adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is fundamentally transforming the United Kingdom sleep apnea devices market, driving innovation and enhancing clinical outcomes.

[TITLE]AstraZeneca’s gMG drug fails to fend off rivals despite Phase III win:
[TEXT]
While AstraZeneca’s gefurulimab met its primary and secondary endpoints in generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG), the drug failed to best AstraZeneca’s other approved medications, Soliris and Ultomiris in improving MG-ADL scores. Image credit: Jack_the_sparow via Shutterstock.com.

AstraZeneca’s gefurulimab met its primary endpoint, but has not managed to best the efficacy demonstrated by its rival therapies in a late-stage generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) trial.

In the Phase III PREVAIL study (NCT05556096), the drug offered a statistically significant 1.6-point improvement in myasthenia gravis activities of daily living (MG-ADL) scores from baseline compared with placebo.

Gefurulimab’s positive impact on MG-ADL was observed after one week of treatment, though this effect was maintained over the 26-week study period.

However, gefurulimab failed to meet the efficacy benchmark set by UCB’s Rystiggo (rozanolixizumab), which reduced MG-ADL values by up to 2.6 points in the Phase III MycarinG study.

The drug’s impact on MG-ADL scores was also lower than Regeneron’s Phase III candidate, cemdisiran, as well as AstraZeneca’s own gMG drugs, Soliris (eculizumab) and Ultomiris (ravulizumab), which triggered 2.3, 1.7, and 2.09-point drops in their respective late-stage trials.

Meanwhile, the complement 5 (C5) inhibitor significantly reduced quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) total scores, demonstrating a 1.8-point reduction from baseline by week four. By week 36, this effect was deepened, with patients experiencing a mean 2.1-point drop in QMG scores.

QMG is a common clinical outcome measure used in gMG to quantify a patient’s disease severity. It takes 13 different measures of muscular, motor and respiratory function into account, offering a broad view of a patient’s overall quality of life (QoL).

Gefurulimab’s impacts on MG-ADL and QMG scores were seen in patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive disease, which constitutes 85% of the gMG population.

The subcutaneous (SC) drug’s safety and tolerability profile was similar to Soliris and Ultomiris. AstraZeneca gained the rights all three drugs through its $39bn acquisition of Alexion Pharmaceuticals in 2021.

Of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) recorded in the gefurulimab arm, the majority were mild-to-moderate, with the most common events being headache, reactions at the injection site and diarrhoea.

Gefurulimab’s future in gMG

If gefurulimab were to gain approval in gMG, it would become the third targeted therapy AstraZeneca has commercialised in this market – joining Soliris and Ultomiris in an indication GlobalData valued at $6.1bn in 2024.

GlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.

Gefurulimab’s approval in gMG could be welcome news for AstraZeneca, as analysts at GlobalData forecast that both drugs will start to lose grip of their market share in the coming years.

While Ultomiris’ sales are expected to grow until 2029, analysts predict that its fortunes will change in 2030, with profits effectively halving between 2029 and 2033 from $2.41bn to $1.2bn.

It’s a similar story for Soliris, which is expected to peak sales-wise in 2026 at $1.5bn, where it will then see a steady decline to $1bn by 2033.

This drop in sales is likely driven by stiff competition from SC therapies such as UCB’s Zilbrysq (zilucoplan) and Rystiggo, as well as Argenx’s Vyvgart Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc), which offer enhanced patient convenience over intravenous (IV) alternatives.

While Soliris and Ultomiris may lose out on gMG market share moving forward, gefurulimab could offer renewed hope in the indication for AstraZeneca, as its SC administration follows the treatment paradigm’s progression to self-administered therapies.

[TITLE]GE HealthCare raises FY25 guidance amid cross-segment growth:
[TEXT]
GE HealthCare’s Q3 revenues of $5.9bn reflect a 6% rise on Q3 2024. Image credit: Poetra.RH via Shutterstock.com.

GE HealthCare has raised its fiscal year 2025 (FY25) profit outlook to between $3.02 and $3.04 per share amid solid demand across all of its business segments in Q3 2025.

Achieving revenues of $5.9bn in Q3, reflecting a 6% rise on Q3 2024, the imaging giant now expects profits of $4.51 to $4.63 per share, up from $4.43 at the low-end to $4.63 previously.

Patient Care Solutions and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics rose by 6% and 20% in Q3 to $731m and $749m, respectively. However, the lion’s share of revenue was down to GE HealthCare’s Imaging and Advanced Visualisation Solutions, with revenues rising by 5% and 7% to around $2.34bn and $1.3bn, respectively.

During its post-earnings conference call, GE HealthCare’s CEO, Peter Arduini highlighted that the company’s “synergistic portfolio” of diagnostic imaging equipment, radiopharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud, and software was giving it a competitive advantage in the imaging space.

Arduini added that strong commercial execution, with multiple large system deals in Q3, would drive almost $500m in future revenue, thereby further strengthening its ongoing growth momentum.

Earlier this month, GE HealthCare inked a 14-year care alliance with UC San Diego Health, focused on early detection and advancing cancer care with imaging solutions and novel therapies such as theragnostics.
