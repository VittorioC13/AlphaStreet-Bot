SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxart, Inc. (OTCQX: VXRT) (“Vaxart or “the Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a range of oral recombinant pill vaccines based on its proprietary delivery platform, today announced its business update and financial results for the third quarter of 2025.

“Our commitment at Vaxart is to advance the science of our novel, oral vaccine platform,” said Steven Lo, Chief Executive Officer of Vaxart. “The collaboration agreement with Dynavax is an important step forward in realizing this goal as it both brings in a proven partner to the future development and commercialization of our oral COVID-19 vaccine candidate and enhances our financial position. Following the completed enrollment of approximately 5,400 participants in our COVID-19 Phase 2b trial, we are on track to report multiple datasets in 2026 that we believe will provide useful insights and a strong foundation of evidence that could further validate our platform.”

“Additionally, we showcased positive topline results from our Phase 1 trial demonstrating that our second-generation oral pill norovirus vaccine constructs produced much stronger antibody responses than our first-generation constructs at various medical meetings globally. We continue to explore value-creating partnership opportunities for our norovirus candidate as well as our HPV and flu programs, which have demonstrated promising data in preclinical and clinical studies.”

Recent Business Highlights

COVID-19 Vaccine Developments

In November 2025, entered into an exclusive, worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Dynavax Technologies Corporation, for the rights to the Company’s COVID-19 oral vaccine candidate. Received an upfront license fee of $25 million plus a $5 million equity investment at a per share price premium to market pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement. Dynavax will receive an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize oral COVID-19 vaccines based on Vaxart’s delivery platform. Vaxart will retain full operational and financial responsibility for the oral COVID-19 vaccine program through the completion of the ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial and the subsequent End of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); In addition, after receiving the results of the Phase 2b clinical trial, Dynavax will pay an additional fee of $50 million to Vaxart, unless Dynavax elects not to assume responsibility for continued clinical development of the oral COVID-19 vaccine program (in which case, the license agreement will terminate); and In addition, if Dynavax elects to assume responsibility for the continued development of the oral COVID-19 program, Vaxart may be entitled to receive up to $195 million in potential future regulatory milestone payments, up to $425 million in potential future net sales milestone payments, and tiered royalties at rates in the low-to-mid teens on potential future net sales of oral COVID-19 vaccines.

Vaxart completed enrollment of approximately 5,400 participants for the COVID-19 Phase 2b trial. Vaxart continues all work as planned with the per protocol follow-up of all participants dosed. Participants are being monitored for up to 12 months post-vaccination to assess safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Topline data is anticipated in late 2026. Data from the 400-person sentinel cohort is anticipated in the first quarter of 2026. As of September 30, 2025, the Company has received $125.9 million of cash payments associated with this award.

Norovirus Vaccine Developments

In September 2025, Vaxart announced additional Phase 1 data supporting the potential efficacy of its second-generation norovirus oral pill vaccine candidate. Research demonstrated that second-generation constructs induce robust increases in fecal IgA, which was shown to be correlated with protection against infection in the company’s previous Phase 2b challenge study. Vaxart intends to publish the complete results of this study in a peer-reviewed journal. Data was presented at the 9th International Calicivirus Conference, World Vaccine Congress and IDWeek 2025. Pending a partnership or other funding, Vaxart expects to initiate the next clinical trial in 2026.

Financial Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2025

Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $28.8 million as of September 30, 2025. With the receipt of the upfront payment from Dynavax, Vaxart currently anticipates cash runway into the second quarter of 2027. The Company remains aggressive in exploring various strategies to extend its cash runway through business development partnerships and non-dilutive funding options, with the goal of achieving its upcoming clinical and regulatory milestones and maximizing stockholder value.

Revenue for the third quarter of 2025 was $72.4 million, compared to $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2024. Revenue in the third quarter of 2025 and the third quarter of 2024 were primarily from government contracts related to the BARDA contract awarded in June 2024.

Research and development expenses were $75.9 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $15.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. The increase is primarily due to an increase in clinical trial expenses related to Vaxart’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, partially offset by a decrease in preclinical, manufacturing expenses and personnel costs.

General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2024.

Vaxart reported a net loss of $8.1 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $14.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. Net loss per share for the third quarter of 2025 was $0.04, compared to a net loss of $0.06 per share for the third quarter of 2024.

Increases full year adjusted EBITDA margin guidance, reflecting the strong performance year-to-date and expectations for Q4 2025.

EDMONTON, Alberta and NEW YORK, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stantec (TSX, NYSE:STN), a global leader in sustainable engineering, architecture and environmental consulting, released its third quarter 2025 results today which were driven by the continued demand for Stantec's services, its diversified business model, and solid project execution.

In the third quarter, net revenue increased to $1.7 billion, an 11.8% year-over-year increase, driven by 5.6% organic growth1 and 5.2% acquisition growth1. Organic growth was once again achieved in each of Stantec's regional and business operating units, most notably in Water and Energy and Resources which achieved 12.8% and 9.7% organic growth, respectively. Third quarter 2025 adjusted EBITDA increased 17.8% or $48.8 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin reached an all-time high of 19.0%, up 100 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2024. Stantec delivered diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.32 and adjusted EPS of $1.53.

“Stantec delivered strong third quarter results, driven by the sustained global demand for our services and a continued focus on project execution and operational efficiency,” said Gord Johnston, President and CEO. “With the close of the Page acquisition in the quarter, and the continued demand we are seeing across all of our operating regions, we expect to deliver another record year for Stantec. We continue to make strong progress towards our 2024-2026 Strategic Plan, positioning us to successfully deliver on our targets.”

______________________

1 Adjusted EPS, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted ROIC are non-IFRS measures, and organic growth, acquisition growth and DSO are other financial measures (discussed in the Definitions section of the Q3 2025 MD&A).

2025 Outlook

Stantec is increasing and narrowing expectations for its adjusted EBITDA margin outlook, described below.

Previously Published 2025 Annual Range Revised 2025 Annual Range Targets Net revenue growth 10% to 12 % 10% to 12 % Adjusted EBITDA as % of net revenue (note) 17% to 17.4% 17.2% to 17.5% Adjusted net income as % of net revenue (note) above 8.8% above 8.8% Adjusted EPS growth (note) 18.5% to 21.5% 18.5% to 21.5% Adjusted ROIC (note) above 12.5% above 12.5%

In setting our targets and guidance, we assumed an average value for the US dollar of $1.36, GBP of $1.84, and AU of $0.90 for the remainder of the year. For all other underlying assumptions, see the Q3 2025 MD&A. These targets reflect the recent acquisitions of Ryan Hanley, Cosgroves, and Page. They do not include any assumptions regarding the impact of revaluing our share-based compensation, as further described below.

note: Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, and adjusted ROIC are non-IFRS measures discussed in the Definitions section of the Q3 2024 MD&A.

The revised guidance Stantec provided in the Outlook section of its Q2 2025 Interim Report (incorporated here by reference) was based on expectations for continuing high levels of activities in all regions, despite heightened levels of market uncertainty remaining in the near term, and on the completion of the Page, Ryan Hanley, and Cosgroves acquisitions. While these market uncertainties have moderated or abated in some geographies, they have continued to persist in the US in the short term. Global trends continue to drive strong demand for our services and our diversification of services across sectors and geographies creates resilience within our operations. On the strength of our operational performance in the third quarter and expectations for the fourth quarter, Stantec has increased its expectation for adjusted EBITDA margin, while other targeted measures remain consistent.

Overall, Stantec continues to expect net revenue growth of 10% to 12% in 2025. US organic net revenue growth expectations remain moderated in the lower half of the mid-single digits range due to slower procurement cycles persisting in the public sector in the near term and elevated caution in the private sectors, particularly for larger projects. Stantec continues to expect Canada’s organic net revenue growth to be in the mid- to high-single digits, driven by continuing strong momentum and elevated backlog levels. Stantec also continues to expect organic net revenue growth in Global to be in the mid to high single-digits, driven by continued high levels of activity in its Water business under the ongoing UK Asset Management Program (AMP) and framework agreements, strong demand in Infrastructure in Europe, and positive demand fundamentals in the Energy & Resources business.

Stantec has increased and narrowed the range for adjusted EBITDA margin to 17.2% to 17.5%, from 17.0% to 17.4%, reflecting strong project margins driven by solid project execution, continued discipline and enhanced strategies in the management of administration and marketing costs. Stantec continues to expect adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter to be below this range due to seasonal effects.

Stantec continues to expect its effective tax rate to fall within a range of 23.5% to 24.5%.

Overall, Stantec continues to expect to drive adjusted net income to a margin of greater than 8.8% of net revenue and deliver 18.5% to 21.5% growth in adjusted EPS in comparison to 2024.

The above targets do not include any assumptions for additional acquisitions beyond those noted in this Outlook section or further impact from significant share price movements subsequent to September 30, 2025, and the relative total shareholder return components on our share-based compensation programs.

Q3 2025 compared to Q3 2024

Net revenue increased 11.8% or $180.6 million, to $1.7 billion, driven by 5.6% organic growth and 5.2% acquisition growth. Stantec achieved organic growth in all of its regional and business operating units, most notably in Water with double-digit organic growth.

Project margin increased 12.1% or $99.8 million, to $927.9 million. As a percentage of net revenue, project margin increased 10 basis points to 54.4%, remaining in line with expectations.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 17.8% or $48.8 million, to $323.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.0%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to Q3 2024. The increase in margin primarily reflects lower administrative and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue, mainly due to Stantec's disciplined management of operations and higher utilization.

Net income increased 45.3% or $46.8 million, to $150.0 million, and diluted EPS increased 46.7%, or $0.42, to $1.32, mainly due to increases in project margin and, as a percentage of revenue, lower administrative and marketing expenses partly offset by higher income tax expense. As well, Q3 2024 included a non-cash impairment charge of $13.7 million from our real estate optimization strategy.

Adjusted net income grew 17.7% or $26.2 million, to $174.1 million, achieving 10.2% of net revenue—an increase of 50 basis points. Adjusted EPS increased 17.7% or $0.23, to $1.53.

Contract backlog increased to $8.4 billion at September 30, 2025, achieving 14.9% overall growth year over year, which includes 6.8% acquisition growth and 5.6% organic growth. Organic growth was achieved in all of Stantec's regional operating units. Contract backlog represents approximately 13 months of work.

Operating cash flows increased $137.0 million or 76.6%, with cash inflows of $315.9 million, reflecting strong revenue growth, operational performance, and collection efforts.

DSO was 73 days, a decrease of 4 days from December 31, 2024.

Net debt to adjusted EBITDA (on a trailing twelve-month basis) at September 30, 2025 was 1.5x, reflecting the funding of the recent acquisition of Page, and remained within our internal target range of 1.0x to 2.0x.

On July 31, 2025, we acquired Page, a 1,400-person architecture and engineering firm headquartered in Washington, DC that strategically complements Stantec's Buildings business and serves the advanced manufacturing, healthcare, mission critical, academic, civic, aviation, science and technology, and commercial markets.

On November 13, 2025, Stantec's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.225 per share, payable on January 15, 2026, to shareholders of record on December 31, 2025.

Year-to-date Q3 2025 compared to year-to-date Q3 2024

Net revenue increased 10.6% or $466.9 million, to $4.9 billion, driven by 5.4% organic growth and 3.1% acquisition growth, as well as the positive impact of foreign exchange. Stantec achieved organic growth in all of its regional and business operating units.

Project margin increased $253.8 million or 10.7%, to $2,636.1 million. As a percentage of net revenue, project margin was consistent with 2024 at 54.3%, remaining in line with expectations.

Adjusted EBITDA increased $126.3 million or 17.2%, to $860.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 100 basis points over the prior period to 17.7%, primarily reflecting lower administrative and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue, mainly due to disciplined management of operations and higher utilization.

Net income increased 46.3% or $122.0 million, to $385.5 million, and diluted EPS increased 46.3%, or $1.07, to $3.38, mainly due to increases in project margin and, as a percentage of net revenue, lower administrative and marketing expenses partly offset by higher income tax expense. As well, 2024 included a non-cash impairment charge of $30.6 million from Stantec's real estate optimization strategy.

Adjusted net income grew 22.1% or $83.5 million, to $461.6 million, achieving 9.5% of net revenue—an increase of 90 basis points—and adjusted diluted EPS increased 22.4%, or $0.74, to $4.05.

Operating cash flows increased $254.3 million or 86%, with cash inflows of $550.6 million, reflecting strong revenue growth, operational performance, and collection efforts.

[TITLE]Japanese investors turn to Europe as deep tech boom lures capital abroad:
[TEXT]
Huge swathes of cash are flowing from Japan to European tech startups as risk-averse investors favor a more mature entrepreneurial ecosystem, helping to scale the continent's booming deep tech cluster. While the European startup and venture capital ecosystem has long operated in the shadow of Silicon Valley, it has become fertile ground for Japanese corporates, whose domestic market is younger. Japanese investors or venture capital funds who themselves have Japanese investors, known as limited partners, participated in European financing rounds worth more than 33 billion euros ($38 billion) since 2019 when a trade deal between the European Union and Japan came into force, according to research from venture capital fund NordicNinja and data platform Dealroom. For the five years leading up to the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, investment totaled 5.3 billion euros. In Europe at that time, "there was no Japanese capital other than Softbank," Tomosaku Sohara, co-founder and managing partner of Japan-Europe VC NordicNinja, told CNBC. NordicNinja, which has 250 million euros of assets under management, is a collaboration between the firm's managing partners and Japan's JBIC IG Partners.

"Softbank was pretty active already at that moment, because they had acquired Finnish gaming company Supercell," Sohara said, noting that the acquisition injected life into Finland's startup ecosystem. Now, Mitsubishi , Sanden , Yamato Holdings , and Marunouchi Innovation Partners are among those directly backing European tech, per the report, while Japan-linked venture capital firms such as NordicNinja, Byfounders, and Toyota 's Woven Capital cut checks to startups on the continent. There are over two times more VC-backed startups in Europe than in Japan, per capita, and 4.3 times more unicorns, per the report.

The shadow of Silicon Valley

Japan's appetite for investing was always there, Sohara said. Its multinationals — like many — headed stateside to set up corporate venture capital arms in early 2000, in search of a slice of the action at the time when some of today's largest companies were just being thought up in dorm rooms. "Nobody wanted to look at Europe at that moment, but I think that after a couple of years they realized, 'Hey, maybe the U.S. culture is totally different from the Japanese culture,' and they began thinking, 'Hey, maybe we need to look at another region like Europe,'" Sohara said, adding that the profile of entrepreneurs in Europe, many of whom came from large corporates at the time, was more aligned with Japan. That's in contrast to the young founders coming from Stanford or university research and development departments, he said.

"They have experience at the corporates and also they have a mindset of entrepreneurship. Japan, unfortunately, is lacking the entrepreneurship mindset," Sohara added, referring to Europe's founders, many of whom came from Nokia and Skype.

The pull for founders

Japanese-linked investors have a penchant for one sector in particular: deep tech, which refers to companies building on top of scientific or engineering innovation. Deep tech and artificial intelligence accounted for 70% of deals made by such investors in Europe in 2024, echoing trends in the broader startup ecosystem as the AI, energy, and defense industries boom. The top-funded companies with Japanese participation include the U.K.'s autonomous vehicle startup Wayve, which raised $1.05 billion in an investment round in May 2024, British quantum computing firm Quantinuum, which secured 273 million euros in January 2024, and Spanish quantum firm Multiverse Computing, which saw investors cut it a check of 189 million euros in June 2025. The rounds were backed by Softbank, Mitsui and Toshiba, respectively. Such companies, however, typically need a lot of growth capital and industrial experience to scale successfully — two elements that Europe famously lacks.

"Investment appetite is way stronger than [in] any strategics I've seen here in Germany or in Europe," Sarah Fleischer co-founder and CEO, Tozero

"Japanese firms — and they're old, most of them that we're talking about, right — they're just sitting on a pile of money. They've been saving money throughout the last century, and now they're starting to spend it, to try to grow as a large corporate and increase their footprint outside of Japan," said Sarah Fleischer, co-founder and CEO of Germany-based battery materials recycling startup Tozero. "You see that investment appetite is way stronger than [in] any strategics I've seen here in Germany or in Europe," she added. Tozero has raised 14.5 million euros to date and counts NordicNinja, Honda and JGC among its investors. It's not just about the check. Japanese corporates and industrials have robust manufacturing and automotive know-how, Fleischer and Sohara noted respectively, meaning they are well positioned to plug Europe's knowledge gaps when it comes to scaling large manufacturing projects. Fleischer added that Japanese firms have long shored up their critical minerals supply chain and long-established trading firms, meaning they know how to secure essential components needed for the energy transition. For Tozero, this is an added plus, Fleischer said, given it's in the business of recovering such materials from spent batteries. In the age of political uncertainty amid choppy U.S.-China relations, Japan also acts as a good bridge to the Asian markets, Fleischer said.

A slower pace and lower risk appetite

Back in Japan, the number of entrepreneurs is "still very limited," Sohara said, as the older generation and "great talents" wanted to work for "a Toyota and Honda or Sony," he added, but the younger generation's mindset is beginning to change. Europe has also become the home to ambitious would-be founders searching for a tech ecosystem to build their companies in, Sohara said. However, as collaboration between Europe and Japan scales, language remains a barrier as fluency in English is not widespread in Japan, he added. For Fleischer, this also poses challenges. "There's so much miscommunication and local translation that could ruin a partnership instantly. And there's also some sort of cultural aspect as well, one needs to probably be aware of," she said, adding that she recently spent weeks in Japan getting to know her investors face-to-face, "because that's still the sentiment" there. Decision-making can therefore be slower, the founder said, due to thorough research and preparation. "They just do their homework," Fleischer said, noting that Japanese partners were hands-on in helping the company understand "how to build our next future commercial plant, potentially starting from Japan and then going worldwide."

Indeed, "without the support from NN [NordicNinja] it would have been much more difficult to build the right relationships," said Aaike van Vugt, co-founder and CEO of Dutch nanotechnology engineering firm VSParticle. That's in contrast to perhaps the most well-known Japanese player: Softbank. Softbank is "totally different" from traditional Japanese investor cultures, given it is driven by founder Masayoshi Son's decisions rather than operating on a consensus basis, like most Japanese business, Sohara added. The venture firm, known for its lofty bets on WeWork and, more recently, chip company Arm, poured huge sums of cash into tech startups amid the 2021 venture capital tech boom, which saw at least one Japanese-linked investor involved in deals worth 11.2 billion euros, per the report. Softbank stood out during this period; it was involved in 22% of deals with Japanese-linked participation in 2021.

[TITLE]Condor Announces 2025 Third Quarter Results:
[TEXT]
CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Condor Energies Inc. (“Condor” or the “Company”) (TSX:CDR), a Canadian based, internationally focused energy transition company focused on Central Asia is pleased to announce the release of its unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 (the “Financial Statements”), together with the related management’s discussion and analysis. These documents will be made available under Condor’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on the Condor website at www.condorenergies.ca. Readers are invited to review the latest corporate presentation available on the Condor website. All financial amounts in this news release are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.

HIGHLIGHTS

Production in Uzbekistan for the third quarter of 2025 averaged 9,978 boe/d comprised of 9,778 boe/d (58,668 Mcf/d) of natural gas and 200 bopd of condensate.

Uzbekistan natural gas and condensate sales for the third quarter of 2025 was $18.74 million.

Drilling of Uzbekistan’s first horizontal well continues and the planned 1000-meter lateral section is currently underway with numerous mud gas shows being encountered.

A field optimization study and engineering design for the first phase of field compression has been completed, and the procurement process has commenced. Installing compression will increase gas production rates and recoverable volumes by reducing well back pressure.

On August 12, 2025, the Company executed a USD $5.0 million-dollar bridge loan facility (the “Bridge Loan”) for the First LNG Facility which is scheduled to produce Kazakhstan’s first LNG in the third quarter of 2026.

MESSAGE FROM CONDOR’S CEO

Don Streu, President and CEO of Condor commented: “Condor is in an envious position given its diverse portfolio of energy-transition initiatives in Central Asia, a region that is drawing increased focus and foreign direct investment for its energy and critical minerals sectors. Our team has decades of experience operating in remote regions and has successfully introduced modern operating techniques and technologies, while maintaining a deep understanding of value realization in these environments.

The Company is currently drilling Uzbekistan’s longest horizontal well and is using Western tools and techniques never before deployed there. Our multi-well drilling campaign is intended to materially increase both gas production rates and associated cash flows, and Condor’s recently reprocessed 3-D seismic data set has generated an extensive inventory of undrilled structures, with numerous infill and undrained attic closure locations identified. Accordingly, we are actively pursuing a second drilling rig to accelerate our planned 12-well drilling program in 2026.

We continue to make strong progress in our efforts to deliver Central Asia’s first LNG production, and we are on track to commence production in the third quarter of 2026. The three LNG feedgas allocations awarded to Condor to-date total more than 625 million cubic meters of natural gas per year and the allocations are strategically located to supply LNG fuel to multiple consumers in various regions of the country. The Government of Kazakhstan supports Condor’s LNG initiative, since it will provide the country with greater energy security while assisting in achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets.

The Company is also conducting an aeromagnetic survey at one of our critical minerals licenses to help further define mineral deposits and structural trends which will allow us to better understand the potential for both copper and lithium development. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of mining licenses awarded in the areas adjacent to the Company’s license areas and active copper exploration activities are underway by major mining companies. Given the heavily faulted systems we’ve mapped in this geothermally active region, it appears that mineralized brines have migrated into the basin’s reservoirs, as is evident by the lithium concentrations on Condor’s blocks, as previously reported by the Ministry of Geology of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

Condor remains committed to advancing its diverse portfolio of assets for the benefit of our shareholders, stakeholders and host governments while continuing to position the Company as a leading energy transition developer in Central Asia”.

Production in Uzbekistan

The Company operates under a production enhancement services contract with JSC Uzbekneftegaz (“UNG”) in Uzbekistan to increase the production, recovery, and overall system efficiency from an integrated cluster of eight conventional natural gas-condensate fields (the “PEC Project”). Production in the third quarter of 2025 averaged 9,978 boe/d comprised of 9,778 boe/d (58,668 Mcf/d) of natural gas and 200 bopd of condensate.

Total production in Uzbekistan for the third quarter of 2025 decreased 1.7% compared to the second quarter of 2025 due mainly to natural reservoir decline but offset by the increased production from the various workovers performed during the third quarter of 2025 consisting of recompletions, tubing changes, and artificial lift installations. One of the recompletions in the third quarter of 2025 involved perforating a new zone of interest and resulted in an incremental average daily production rate of 2.2 MMscf/d.

On September 8, 2025 the Company commenced drilling its first well in Uzbekistan (the “First Well”). A pilot vertical hole was drilled to a total depth of 2,805 meters that penetrated the currently producing carbonate reservoir sections as well as deeper, under-exploited stacked clastic reservoir sections. After coring and extensive wireline logging operations, petrophysical analysis indicates 37.6 meters of non-contiguous net gas pay was identified consisting of 28.5 meters in carbonate reservoirs and 9.1 meters in deeper clastic reservoirs. Following logging, the pilot hole was open-hole sidetracked to drill a horizontal leg into a known carbonate reservoir. Drilling of the 1000-meter lateral section is ongoing with numerous mud gas shows being recorded. Depending on drilling conditions, the lateral section may be extended. Once reaching total depth, the lateral section will be flow tested and shut in for build up pressure evaluation while the rig moves to the next drill location (the “Second Well”). The First Well is expected to be tied into the Company’s production system in December 2025.

The Second Well will be drilled from the same pad location and target a shallower carbonate reservoir identified in the recently drilled pilot hole of the First Well. The Second Well will utilize a simplified casing design to leverage drilling learnings from the previous two penetrations to reduce drilling time and costs and is planned to be a geo-steered, 1,000-meter open hole horizontal well and aims to further de-risk the stacked carbonate reservoirs present across the Company’s licenses.

The Company is also in the process of contracting a second drilling rig to concurrently drill at a nearby under-developed gas field located in the southern region of the Company’s licenses in Uzbekistan. This field is currently producing from a single downdip gas well where Condor recently perforated an eight-meter thick carbonate interval which increased the well’s average daily production from 1.1 MMscf/day to 7.5 MMscf/day for the first thirty days and has produced an average of 6.0 MMscf/day for the past six months. This recompletion has also de-risked the large undeveloped, up-dip structural closure that was identified on the Company’s recently reprocessed and interpreted 3-D seismic data. With the second drilling rig, Condor plans to drill an initial vertical well through the top of the structure to confirm current mapping, collect modern wireline and core data, and provide test rates. This will be followed by a pad-style horizontal development drilling program targeting three reservoirs with up to six horizontal wells. A second pad location is also envisioned to develop this structure as it represents material undeveloped volumes. Up to twelve wells in total are planned to be drilled in 2026 with the two rigs to accelerate gas production volumes.

Installation of field compression remains a top priority for the Company in 2026. Engineering design for the first phase of field compression (“Phase 1”) has been completed, and the procurement process has commenced. Phase 1 compression will increase gas production by reducing the well’s back pressure and mitigate the negative impact of fluctuating and increasing gas sales line pressure. Simulation work conducted by an independent third-party engineering company indicates compression will yield over 20 MMscf/day of incremental gas production with the reduction of well back pressure and lost production due to increasing gas sales line pressure. The field compression facility is scheduled to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2026. Actual results may differ as described below in the Business Risks and

CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- South Bow Corp. (TSX & NYSE: SOBO) (South Bow or the Company) reports its third-quarter 2025 financial and operational results and provides its 2026 outlook. Unless otherwise noted, all financial figures in this news release are in U.S. dollars.

Highlights

Safety and operational performance

Recorded average throughput of approximately 584,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) on the Keystone Pipeline in the third quarter of 2025, and approximately 703,000 bbl/d on the U.S. Gulf Coast segment of the Keystone Pipeline System. Throughput on the Keystone Pipeline and the U.S. Gulf Coast segment of the Keystone Pipeline System averaged approximately 580,000 bbl/d and approximately 730,000 bbl/d, respectively, during the first nine months of 2025.

Achieved mechanical completion for the Blackrod Connection Project and placed the 25-km natural gas lateral into commercial service. Final facility activities are currently underway, and the project remains on schedule to be placed into service in early 2026. Associated cash flows are expected to increase throughout the second half of 2026 and into 2027.

Continued to advance remedial actions relating to the incident that occurred at Milepost 171 (MP-171) of the Keystone Pipeline, including completing six in-line inspections and 37 integrity digs to date. See "Milepost 171 incident" of this news release for additional details.

Financial performance

Delivered stable financial results in the third quarter of 2025 due to the Company's strong commercial underpinnings. Generated revenue of $461 million and net income of $93 million ($0.45/share). Recorded normalized earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (normalized EBITDA) 1 of $254 million, representing a 2% increase from the second quarter of 2025 due to higher contributions from maintenance capital expenditures for system integrity projects on the Keystone Pipeline System, offset by expected losses in the Marketing segment. Reported distributable cash flow 1 2 of $236 million, representing an increase of $69 million from the second quarter of 2025, driven primarily by changes in U.S. tax legislation and South Bow's tax optimization efforts.

Maintained total long-term debt and net debt 1 outstanding of $5.8 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, during the third quarter of 2025. The Company's net debt-to-normalized EBITDA ratio 1 was unchanged at 4.6 times as at Sept. 30, 2025.

outstanding of $5.8 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, during the third quarter of 2025. The Company's net debt-to-normalized EBITDA ratio was unchanged at 4.6 times as at Sept. 30, 2025. On Oct. 3, 2025, extended the tenor of the Company's C$2 billion revolving credit facility by one year, maturing on Oct. 3, 2029.

Returns to shareholders

Declared dividends totalling $104 million or $0.50/share to shareholders during the third quarter of 2025.

South Bow's board of directors (the Board) approved a quarterly dividend of $0.50/share, payable on Jan. 15, 2026, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 31, 2025. The dividends will be designated as eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes.

Corporate updates

South Bow expects to complete the transition to its new supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system in the fourth quarter of 2025, the final significant item in exiting the Transition Services Agreement (TSA) with TC Energy Corporation (TC Energy) as it relates to the spinoff transaction (the Spinoff).

In early October, South Bow and associated parties mutually agreed to withdraw all complaints and protests relating to the variable toll disputes filed with the Canada Energy Regulator, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Court of King's Bench of Alberta, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. As part of the Separation Agreement between South Bow and TC Energy, TC Energy indemnified South Bow for matters that existed prior to the Spinoff. Following the withdrawal of the variable toll disputes, South Bow reached its maximum indemnity liability of $22 million.

The Board has approved South Bow's 2026 budget, which is focused on strengthening the Company's financial position, maturing and executing a portfolio of organic and inorganic growth opportunities, and delivering strong and sustainable returns to shareholders. Normalized EBITDA is projected to be approximately $1.03 billion, within a range of 2%, with approximately 90% secured through committed arrangements. See "2026 guidance" of this news release for additional details.

The net debt-to-normalized EBITDA ratio was 4.5 times as at Dec. 31, 2024. The common shares issued on Oct. 1, 2024 have been used for comparative periods, as the Company had no common shares outstanding prior to the Spinoff. For periods prior to Oct. 1, 2024, it is assumed there were no dilutive equity instruments, as there were no equity awards of South Bow outstanding prior to the Spinoff. SOF measures South Bow's ability to deliver crude oil at the planned maximum rate of the Keystone Pipeline. Comprises throughput originating in Hardisty, Alta. transported on the Keystone Pipeline, and throughput originating in Cushing, Okla. transported on Marketlink for destination in the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Milepost 171 incident

Following the MP-171 incident, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued a Corrective Action Order (CAO) requiring South Bow to undertake corrective actions, including operating under pressure restrictions for specific segments of the pipeline.

Total costs relating to the incident, estimated at approximately $55 million, are largely expected to be recovered through the Company's insurance policies by early 2026. As of Sept. 30, 2025, South Bow has received approximately $16 million in reimbursements under its insurance policies.

The timing of PHMSA's expected release of the independent third-party root cause analysis (RCA) has been impacted by the U.S. federal government shutdown.

Initial findings

According to the mechanical and metallurgical analysis, both the pipe and welds conformed to industry standards for design, materials, and mechanical properties.

The failure resulted from a fatigue crack that originated along the pipe's manufactured long-seam weld.

Remedial actions

South Bow is actively progressing its remedial actions, with six in-line inspection runs and 37 integrity digs completed to date. Preliminary results indicate no injurious issues.

The in-line inspection process has been modified to address tool limitations by overlaying data from previous tool runs and implementing improvements in data analysis methods. South Bow will continue to work closely with its in-line inspection technology vendors to advance tool performance and validation, address and resolve tool limitations, and develop new technologies.

Additional in-line inspection tool runs and integrity digs are planned for 2025 and 2026 as part of South Bow's comprehensive program to address the findings and recommendations from the RCA investigation.

As part of PHMSA's CAO, South Bow is finalizing its remedial work plan to submit to the regulator for approval. This plan includes the corrective actions already completed. As South Bow conducts this remedial work, any findings will be incorporated into the plan and the Company's programs to enhance system integrity and ensure safe operations. South Bow is committed to maintaining transparency with its regulators, customers, and industry peers throughout this process.

Outlook

Market outlook

Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) crude oil supply is expected to grow modestly throughout 2026 and remain below available pipeline egress capacity, resulting in continued low demand for uncommitted capacity on the Keystone Pipeline.

Pricing differentials impacting the rates South Bow can charge for capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast segment of its Keystone Pipeline System are expected to remain tight throughout 2026.

[TITLE]Intermap Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
Commercial revenue grew 37%, driven by AI risk assistant adoption

United States and Europe accounted for 90% of revenue

Balance sheet strengthened by $21 million equity bought deal financing

Company reaffirms annual guidance and advances major government programs

DENVER, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intermap Technologies (TSX: IMP; OTCQB: ITMSF) (“Intermap” or the “Company”), a global leader in 3D geospatial products and intelligence solutions, today announced its financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2025.

During the quarter, Intermap completed a bought deal public offering and concurrent private placement, raising gross proceeds of $21 million, significantly strengthening its balance sheet, allowing it to invest in commercial markets and positioning the Company to execute large, multiyear contracts. As of September 30, 2025, shareholders’ equity increased to $27.2 million.

Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 million compared with $5.0 million for the same period in 2024. Year-to-date revenue was $9.0 million compared with $10.2 million for the same period in 2024. Revenue declines were as expected, reflecting the timing of milestone-driven program activity in Indonesia, causing lumpiness as the country tenders for much larger follow-on awards integrating financial support from the World Bank. Data products experienced temporary timing effects from the prolonged U.S. federal government shutdown.

The Company completed infrastructure upgrades, incorporating advanced NVIDIA GPUs and encryption methods compliant with NIST requirements for protecting the confidentiality of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-federal systems and organizations.

Commercial software revenue grew by 37% over the same period last year, which was more than expected. A significant amount of growth came from Europe, where the Company recently introduced its Risk Assistant platform, leveraging its latest AI advancements.

The Risk Assistant, a first to market AI-enabled agent for insurance, draws on Intermap’s proprietary data and allows established multi-peril underwriters to significantly expand, automate, and rapidly scale their processes, driving high conversion rates. Subscribers benefit from an independent, real-time and objective risk assessment, based on precise 3D property geolocation. Such analysis runs deeper than simple algorithms reliant on geolocated addresses, leveraging an enormous archive of historic data and claims experience to mitigate basis risk and improve underwriting outcomes. Intermap is the only commercial company with underwriting-quality, high-precision 3D foundation and vector data, available around the world, to support global insurance programs at this level of acuity. The Risk Assistant also incorporates proven, proprietary, easy to calibrate and patented global flood models, incorporating diverse views of risk. A typical small capacity provider will consider approximately 250,000 – 500,000 risks per year, representing $200 million of premium. The Risk Assistant empowers the provider to scale operations dramatically, delivering automated and efficient tools for real-time risk evaluation, premium setting, claims handling and reinsurance placement.

Operating cash flow year to date was $2 million (excluding $2.1 million of working capital investment) compared with negative $1.4 million for the same period last year. Cash flow was reinvested to improve working capital. Operating cash flow during the quarter improved to negative $1.7 million (excluding working capital) compared with negative $2.3 million last year.

Working capital was $23.3 million at the end of the quarter, allowing the Company to remove the going concern qualification from its financial statements. The Company is in the process of uplifting its audit to comply with U.S. securities regulations under PCAOB standards.

Adjusted EBITDA was negative $1.0 million for the quarter compared with positive $1.6 million for 2024. Net loss was $1.5 million compared with net income of $1.1 million for the same quarter last year. The Company continues to ramp its operations to qualify for and execute larger government contracts. During the quarter, Intermap submitted multiple bids covering all four lots of Indonesia’s $200 million Integrated Land Administration and Spatial Planning Project. The Tender Review Committee is evaluating technical submissions with financial evaluation scheduled for this December. Commercial demand remained strong. Intermap expanded recurring data subscriptions and analytics services during the quarter, building on momentum from prior quarters, reflecting ongoing adoption of elevation-as-a-service and risk modeling solutions.

Intermap was selected for multiple NOAA contracting teams, including the $250 million Coastal Geospatial Services Contract 5, for which proposals are under review, and the $250 million NGS Shoreline Mapping Support Services IDIQ where the Company is a team member with NV5 and Dewberry. The Company also continued requirements meetings with the U.S. Department of Defense during the government shutdown. Intermap expects U.S. government contracting will accelerate as the government reopens. Operating results for the quarter reflected normal pursuit and transition costs associated with these programs. The Company continues to invest in key contracts and software development that support recurring revenue growth and long-term value creation.

Outlook

Intermap reaffirms its previously announced 2025 guidance of $30–35 million in revenue and a 28% EBITDA margin. While the timing of certain government contracts may change due to funding delays and complex global tender processes, management believes these timing effects are typical for government contracting and are mitigated by having multiple concurrent pursuits. Risks to the guidance include uncertainties regarding the timing of subscription renewals, the award of future contracts and the timing of revenue recognition for future awards.

The Company’s consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, together with management’s discussion and analysis for the corresponding period, have been filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on the SEC’s EDGAR website at www.sec.gov.

Conference Call Details

Intermap’s CEO Patrick A. Blott and CFO Jennifer Bakken will host a live webinar on Thursday, November 13, 2025 at 5:00 pm ET to review the results, provide Company updates and answer investor questions following the presentation. A recording of the webinar and supporting materials will be made available on the investor relations page of the Company’s website.

Striking workers at Boeing Defense 's St. Louis-area facilities voted to approve the company's latest contract offer on Thursday, union officials said, ending a 101-day strike that has hampered production of fighter jets and other programs.The roughly 3,200 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District 837 voted 68% in favor of approving the five-year contract. They will start returning to work as early as Sunday. IAM District 837 members stood strong and united for over three months," union leaders said in a statement. "We're proud of what our members have fought for together and are ready to get back to building the world's most advanced military aircraft.""We're pleased with the results and look forward to bringing our full team back together on Nov. 17 to support our customers," a Boeing spokesperson said in an email.The workers assemble Boeing's F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets, the T-7 trainer aircraft, munitions and wing sections for the 777X commercial jet. The strike, which began on August 4, has disrupted F-15 deliveries to the U.S. Air Force and slowed production across several key programs.District 837 members had pushed Boeing for a higher ratification bonus and improved retirement plan contributions - closer to terms in Boeing's deal reached last year with Seattle-area IAM members after a 53-day strike.Boeing, however, throughout the strike, refused to increase the value of its offer, which includes a 24% general wage increase over five years.On Monday, Boeing unilaterally revised its offer, reducing the overall bonus. It increased the upfront cash incentive to $6,000, up from $3,000 in the previous proposal, but cut another $4,000 in bonuses that would have been paid later during the contract's term. The rest of the offer remained largely unchanged from earlier versions that had been rejected by union members.The company simply outlasted its wage-earners, District 837 member Brandon Thiel told Reuters. "They're basically bullying us with the fact that they have more disposable income than most of us do."He said he voted to reject the offer.Many fellow IAM members were "fatigued" by the strike and worried about the upcoming holidays, he said. "Nobody wants to give their kids a crappy holiday."Speaking publicly in July, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg dismissed any concern about the strike impacting the company."I wouldn't worry too much about the implications of the strike. We'll manage our way through that," he said.Workers at the facilities went on strike in August after rejecting a second offer from the company.Boeing was criticized by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress, who urged the company to negotiate with the union.The IAM had filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board in October, accusing the planemaker of negotiating in bad faith.

[TITLE]Global Drone Market Size Projected to Reach $163 Billion By 2030 as Technological Innovations Fuels Growth:
[TEXT]
MarketNewsUpdates News Commentary

NEW YORK, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Drones as a Service" (DaaS) industry outlook is extraordinarily strong, marked by rapid growth, increasing adoption across diverse industries, and significant technological advancements like AI integration. The market is projected to reach substantial values in the coming years, driven by the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of outsourced drone services. A recent report from Grand View Research projects that the global drone market size is estimated at USD 73.06 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 163.60 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 14.3% from 2025 to 2030. It said that this growth is largely driven by rapid advancements in drone technology, improvements in battery efficiency, AI-powered autonomous systems, and enhanced imaging sensors, which is further expanding the capabilities of drones across industries. The report said: “These technological innovations are boosting the performance and functionality of drones, allowing them to undertake more complex tasks. Additionally, the shift towards fully autonomous drones and the incorporation of hybrid product systems that combine the strengths of both fixed-wing and multi-rotor designs is expected to further propel the drone industry expansion in the coming years. The increasing adoption of drones across various industries such as agriculture, logistics, construction, and infrastructure inspection are accelerating the drone industry expansion. The growing need for real-time data collection, surveillance, and monitoring capabilities is one of the major drivers behind this trend. In agriculture, drones are being used for crop monitoring, pesticide spraying, and soil analysis, while in logistics, they are streamlining last-mile deliveries. This surge in demand across industries is expected to be one of the key growth drivers for the drone market in the coming years, especially as drone technology becomes more accessible and affordable. Another significant trend in the drone industry is the rise of Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS), where businesses can rent drones and drone-related services instead of purchasing them outright. This model is popular in industries that require drone services only periodically or in specific use cases, such as infrastructure inspection, surveying, or mapping. The ability to access drone technology without heavy upfront investment is democratizing the use of drones and making them more accessible to small businesses and industries with niche needs.” Active Companies in the drone industry this week include ZenaTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZENA), AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. (NYSE: UAVS), AIRO Group Holdings (NASDAQ: AIRO), Ondas Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: ONDS), Unusual Machines, Inc. (NYSE American: UMAC).

Grand View Research concluded: “Key Market Trends & Insights Are: The North America drone industry dominated the market in 2024 with a share of over 39%; and The U.S. drone industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13% from 2025 to 2030. The North America drone industry dominated the market in 2024 with a share of over 39%, driven by the widespread adoption of drones for various commercial uses, particularly in sectors like agriculture, construction, and oil & gas. Companies in this region are leveraging drones for tasks such as crop monitoring, land surveying, infrastructure inspection, and pipeline monitoring. The rapid integration of advanced drone capabilities, coupled with supportive regulatory frameworks in countries like the U.S. and Canada, is significantly enhancing the adoption of drone technology across diverse industries.”

ZenaTech (NASDAQ:ZENA) Drone as a Service Drives 82% of Q3 2025 Revenue as Company Advances Toward Goal of 25 Acquisitions by Mid-2026 - ZenaTech, Inc. ($ZENA) (FSE: 49Q) (BMV: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a technology business solution provider specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone, Drone as a Service (DaaS), enterprise SaaS and Quantum Computing solutions, announces that its Drone as a Service segment accounted for 82% of Q3 2025 revenue, generating $3.57 million of the record $4.35 million for the quarter. This builds on a 60% Drone as a Service contribution in Q2 2025 as the company strengthens revenue concentration in the drone services segment from the software services segment. The Company continues to expand its current global DaaS footprint of 11 US acquisitions and two international company-owned locations, with a goal to have acquired a total of 25 new companies by mid-2026 to lead drone-powered surveying, mapping, inspections, power washing and precision agriculture.

“Drone as a Service is one of the key growth areas of our business moving forward,” said CEO Dr. Shaun Passley. “Our targeted expansion in land surveying and geospatial sectors reflects our strategy to bring advanced aerial intelligence, speed and cost efficiencies to industries and tasks overdue for innovation. We have a strong pipeline of international acquisition opportunities to integrate with our drones across sectors and are focused on building a global, branded tech-driven services platform that creates both customer and shareholder value.”

ZenaTech focuses on industries where there are processes ripe for drone automation—such as surveying, construction, renewable energy, infrastructure, utilities, maintenance, cleaning, and agriculture—that still rely on low tech or manual methods for tasks. The DaaS platform offers services for real-time insights and efficiency without upfront drone ownership costs and is positioned to capture growing market share as drone adoption accelerates.

The fragmented land surveying industry in the US is dominated by aging, privately owned small firms constrained by a lengthy surveyor qualification and registration process, and using legacy technology making them ripe for consolidation. Using drone-enabled mapping and AI analytics, ZenaTech aims to deliver faster, more cost-effective and insight-rich 3D surveying services, while scaling recurring revenue with repeat customers in construction, building and government sectors.

ZenaTech’s disciplined roll-up strategy targets established regional providers ready for drone innovation. With ample acquisition prospects, the Company expects steady growth through 2026 as it expands across the US and internationally.
