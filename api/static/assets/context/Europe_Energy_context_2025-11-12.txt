[TITLE]The energy chessboard of Europe moves to Athens: Today the Summit with American and European ministers – The deals for LNG:
[TEXT]
Marianna Tzanne November 6 08:54

The 6th Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Summit (P-TEC), being held today November 6 and tomorrow November 7 in Athens, is evolving into a pivotal milestone for shaping the new energy landscape of the country and for the further upgrade of Greece’s geopolitical position in Southeastern Europe.

The event, which draws the interest of top American officials and representatives of energy giants, constitutes a strong message for the deepening US–Europe cooperation in the field of energy, but also a critical step for new strategic deals that will redefine the map of natural gas flows and investments in the region.

Since yesterday in our country, and meeting with the Prime Minister at the Maximos Mansion, are US Interior Secretary and “Energy Czar” Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Undersecretary of State for Management and Resources Michael Rigas, and Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and Environment Jacob Helberg.

Their presence in the Greek capital, along with senior executives from Cheniere Energy, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Venture Global LNG, and also technology giants such as Amazon and Google, underscores Greece’s new geostrategic role in Europe’s energy architecture.

The deals

Transatlantic cooperation in natural gas supply opened yesterday with DEPA Commercial and Aktor announcing the establishment of a joint venture for the supply and export of American LNG. The new company is named ATLANTIC SEE LNG, with a shareholding structure of 60% DEPA Commercial and 40% AKTOR. According to sources, the new entity will have a purely export-oriented character, with exclusive activity the transport of liquefied natural gas to Southeastern Europe.

The same sources note that the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the US state development bank, is expected to play a role in the joint venture. It remains to be seen from the announcements whether its role in the energy scheme will be financial or also equity. In any case, the involvement of the DFC, which also participates in other infrastructures in the country, is perceived as a clear message of American confidence and strategic investment in the Greek energy corridor.

ExxonMobil’s research in Crete also appears to be entering a new phase, with information indicating that the American giant is heading to a decision for an exploratory drilling.

The Vertical Corridor

The new cooperation between DEPA Commercial and Aktor at the heart of the Vertical Corridor will allow the flow of American LNG from Greece to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Ukraine.

According to information, Aktor will contribute to the agreement long-term LNG supply contracts of up to 2 bcm annually or even more, which will be channeled to Ukrainian companies, including the state energy company and the private DTEK group. The natural gas will come from American Venture Global LNG, based on a 20-year contract that is in the final stage of negotiation.

The project is part of the full utilization of the Alexandroupolis FSRU and the creation of new regasification terminals, such as the second Gastrade FSRU in Thrace – which has already received a positive opinion for the Environmental Impact Study.

As Gastrade executives recently said, the final investment decision for the project is expected within 2026, so that the new FSRU unit will be operational in 2028.

Given the planned capacity of 6 bcm of natural gas, the total investment cost is estimated between 550 and 600 million euros. For comparison, the existing Alexandroupolis FSRU, with a capacity of 5.5 bcm, cost about 500 million euros.

Gastrade, whose shareholders – Elmina Kopelouzos, DEPA, DESFA, Gaslog and Bulgartransgaz – jointly support the project, aims at the timely signing of station usage contracts. In this way, it seeks to secure the commercial viability of the project without having to proceed to a market test process. It should be noted that in 2024 natural gas consumption in the countries of the Vertical Corridor was 51 bcm and the forecast for 2030 is 68 bcm. This means that there will be a 17 bcm gap while additionally the approximately 15-16 bcm coming from Russia will be missing from the system.

The DFC and the “locking in” of European agreements

The conclusion of long-term contracts with European companies is estimated to be the “key” for activating financing from the US development organization DFC.

Such a development would open the way for the implementation of upgrade projects for the Vertical Corridor, through which American LNG will be able to be channeled from Greece to Hungary and Slovakia.

Thus, the Vertical Corridor will emerge as a main energy artery of Europe, simultaneously consolidating the role of Greece as a strategic fuel entry gate to the continent.

Acceleration factors

The conference takes place at a critical juncture, as European suppliers are preparing for the period after the end of 2027, when the supply of Europe with Russian natural gas will be fully discontinued.

At the same time, the clock is ticking for the implementation of the EU–US agreement, which provides for energy imports worth 750 billion dollars within three years, redefining the energy balance of the continent.

[TITLE]Lukoil’s Iraq Exit Marks Major Sanctions Victory for the West:
[TEXT]
Russia’s second-largest oil producer Lukoil is withdrawing from its core energy interests in Iraq following the recent tightening of the sanctions noose around the country by the West. The latest prohibitions introduced by the U.S. on 22 October included measures directly aimed at Lukoil, and Russia’s top oil producer Rosneft. Between them, the two companies export approximately 3.1 million barrels of oil per day, which the West sees as vital to Russia’s ability to keep funding its war in Ukraine. Lukoil’s almost immediate capitulation of its huge West Qurna 2 oil field and Block 10 assets in Iraq marks a “major turning point” in the West’s fightback against increasingly aggressive Russia and Chinese moves against the allies, a senior Washington-based legal source who works closely with the U.S. Treasury exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “It’s a big Russian major leaving two of its critical oil developments in one of its key areas of interest in the Middle East – it doesn’t get much bigger than that,” he added. Moreover, Lukoil’s exit from the major Iraq oil and gas sites opens new opportunities for Western firm to further extend the West’s resurgent influence across Iraq.

Washington and London are delighted with the news, according to the source, for three key reasons. First, Lukoil’s quick announcement of its exit underscores how effective the new set of sanctions on Russia is. The measures are part of a full range of blocking sanctions overseen by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) including not just the two corporate entities of Lukoil and Rosneft (and their multiple subsidiaries) being added to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List but key individuals connected to the firms as well. Moreover, both firms’ interests in the U.S. are now blocked, and all the U.S.’s companies and citizens are barred from any dealings with either. Targeting Russia’s top two oil firms is a huge step up from what the previous sets of sanctions that encompassed lower-tier firms such as Gazpromneft and Surgutneftegas, which were in turn part of Washington’s gradual ‘tightening of the screws’ on Putin. The second reason is that the European Union (E.U.) continued to mirror such prohibitions against the cogs financing Russia’s war machine in Ukraine, as seen in its 19th sanctions package. These include additional measures targeting Russia’s shadow fleet of vessels used to evade current restrictions. And for the first time, the E.U. also targeted Russia’s crucial liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector, having earlier agreed to halt all Russian gas imports by 1 January 2027 – one year earlier than previously agreed. This was part of a broader 16 October vote to accelerate the union’s phaseout of Russian oil, gas, and LNG, which also saw the proposal to implement a full ban on Russian oil imports into the region from 1 January 2026. The third reason is how difficult Lukoil has so far found it to dispose of its Iraqi assets, which Washington and London are taking as a sign that the sanctions in place against Moscow now appear so strong and well-coordinated that they are a true deterrent to other actors who in the past may have looked to support Russia. Most notable in this context was that Swiss-based trading firm Gunvor has lost interest in pursuing such talks with Lukoil.

It is also the case, from Iraq’s perspective, that it was seeing diminishing returns in its ongoing relationship with Lukoil, not just from the geopolitical pressure the U.S. was bringing to bear, but also from a petro-economic one. On the first point, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order, the battle for influence over Iraq’s oil fields is

[TITLE]Oil Rises on Shutdown Hopes:
[TEXT]
Oil rose as a push to end the US government shutdown buoyed wider markets, with crude traders also looking toward a data-heavy week that will yield insights into whether a long-awaited global surplus is forming.

West Texas Intermediate rose around 0.6% to settle above $60 a barrel after two weekly declines, while Brent closed around $64. In the US, the White House expressed support for a bipartisan deal to reopen the US government after its longest-ever shutdown. Markets took the progress as a breakthrough, with tech shares driving the equities rally.

Crude has dropped in five of the past six weeks as jitters over surplus supply gained greater traction. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have been loosening output curbs in an apparent effort to gain market share, while drillers from outside the alliance, including the US, have also been adding barrels.

OPEC is due to release its monthly analysis on Wednesday, with the International Energy Agency issuing an annual energy outlook the same day, followed by its regular monthly snapshot on Thursday.

US sanctions also remain in focus after the Trump administration last month targeted Russia's Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC in a bid to raise pressure on the Kremlin to end its war in Ukraine.

Governments across Europe and the Middle East are rushing to ensure Lukoil's sprawling oil operations can keep running after the US sanctions and a quashed bid by energy merchant Gunvor Group for its assets last week.

Iraq is said to have transferred operations at Lukoil's West Qurna 2 field to two state firms in an effort to ensure production continues. Earlier in the day Lukoil declared force majeure, allowing it to exercise the right to skip contractual obligations on the field, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Lukoil's moves are lending mild support to futures, said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Group. "Still, fundamentals remain soft — Dubai spreads continue to weaken, Asian demand is well supplied, and both Saudi Arabia and Iraq have reduced official selling prices," she added.

And in Moscow's view, the sanctions haven't curbed all oil flows. India has continued buying Russian crude, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko said, according to Russian news agency Interfax. That contrasted with President Donald Trump's comments last week praising India for "largely" reducing its purchases from Russia.

[TITLE]A New Oil Price War Is Now Underway:
[TEXT]
Contrary to popular belief, oil prices aren’t determined by any one country, company, or cartel. Instead, they’re the product of a global tug-of-war among producers, traders, and policymakers. It’s a market defined not just by physics, but by psychology, where the actions of a few key players can ripple across the world in a matter of hours.

On November 2nd, OPEC+ announced a modest 137,000 barrel-per-day production increase for December, followed by a pause on further increases in the first quarter of 2026. The move surprised many analysts who expected continued restraint. On the surface, boosting supply when prices are already under pressure seems counterintuitive. But this is not a move driven by near-term pricing. It’s a move

[TITLE]What to know about COP30, this year’s UN climate talks:
[TEXT]
Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.

People from around the world are beginning to gather at the gateway of the Amazon in Belem, Brazil, for the 30th annual United Nations climate summit, the Conference of the Parties, known less formally as COP30.

The aim is simple, but lofty: for countries to work together to stop the worst effects of human-caused climate change.

That’s a goal many experts say is slipping out of reach. But the stakes are high. Climate change is already escalating disasters that mean life or death for billions of people around the world, and delaying action will only worsen the problem.

[TITLE]Lula urges action as COP30 climate talks kick off in Amazon – DW – 11:
[TEXT]
As COP30 gets underway, Brazil's president calls for urgent climate action. UN analysis shows global emissions will only decline 12% by 2035, well short of the target for limiting warming.

Last year's UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, opened with the country's president, Ilham Aliyev, calling oil — the fossil fuel that, alongside gas and coal, drives global warming — a "gift of God."

The opening statements at this year's COP30 climate gathering, held on the edge of the Amazon rainforest in Belem, struck a very different note. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva gave a defiant speech, declaring it was time to confront climate change deniers.

"Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present," Lula said, criticizing those who reject climate science. He stressed that the crisis is hitting hardest in developing countries and poorer communities already suffering from extreme weather.

"We should have a fair transition," he added, referring to the drive to decarbonize economies and warning that the climate emergency is deepening inequality between "those who can live with dignity and those who should die."

Pressure is now on the negotiators from more than 190 countries who have descended upon Belem to make progress over the next two weeks in curbing record-high emissions and rising global temperatures. At the same time, climate change has slipped from the agenda amid growing economic and security concerns take precedence.

Right direction, wrong speed

UN climate chief Simon Stiell stated that the world has made progress since adopting the Paris Agreement in 2015, which aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) — and ideally to 1.5C — above pre-industrial levels.

Stiell said countries had successfully bent the global emissions curve downward, but warned that efforts must accelerate rapidly.

"I am not sugarcoating it," he said. "We have so much more work to do. We must move much, much, faster on both reductions of emissions and strengthening resilience."

Before the Paris deal, the world was on track for roughly 3.5C of warming by 2100. Current national climate action plans — known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — would limit warming to roughly 2.5C, assuming countries fully implement them. Yet many nations have failed to update their NDCs as required ahead of COP30.

[TITLE]Norway’s $2.1 Trillion Oil Fund Seeks Renewables Deals in U.S.:
[TEXT]
Norway’s $2.1-trillion oil fund is looking to invest in renewable energy assets in the U.S. and expand its clean energy portfolio in Europe, a senior executive at the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund told Bloomberg in an interview published on Monday.

The fund has recently hired three people in New York, Harald von Heyden, global head of energy and infrastructure at the Norwegian fund, told Bloomberg.

The Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), which is commonly referred to as ‘Norway’s oil fund’ because it was created with oil and gas revenues, sees bright prospects of owning solar, wind, and grid projects in the U.S. despite the unfavorable current political climate, according to the executive.

“You have political risk everywhere, you just have to be smart,” von Heyden told Bloomberg, when asked whether the Trump Administration’s assault on renewable energy, especially offshore wind, would weigh on market prospects.

“We have to find good deals, first and foremost, but we are optimistic,” von Heyden said.

“This year and last, you’re seeing gigantic projects becoming a reality, not just on the drawing board.”

The manager of the Norwegian fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, in September said it would commit $1.5 billion to Brookfield Asset Management’s latest energy transition fund, in fund’s latest investment in unlisted renewable energy infrastructure.

The commitment to Brookfield’s Global Transition Fund II (BGTF II) “will enable us to invest in projects that develop renewable energy infrastructure while also supporting the broader transition to low-carbon solutions across industries,” von Heyden said back then.

The largest energy asset deal for Norway’s fund so far was a transaction announced in September, in which it agreed to buy 46% in grid operator TenneT Germany from its Dutch owner TenneT in a deal worth up to $11 billion (9.5 billion euros), in consortium with APG, investing on behalf of Dutch pension fund ABP and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC.

[TITLE]Op-Ed: Japan's Offshore Wind Dream Hits a Wall:
[TEXT]
When Mitsubishi Corporation walked away from three massive offshore wind projects in August, paying ¥20 billion in penalties rather than proceeding, it sent shockwaves through Japan’s renewable energy sector. For a trading giant to abandon 1.7 gigawatts of capacity — enough to power 1.3 million homes — it signaled something more than a corporate retreat. It exposed a fundamental crisis in how Japan approaches its offshore wind future.

This story developed post Japan Mobility Show, when the discussion swerved to how 360° energy utilization will happen in Japan when the country’s energy mix is primarily based on fossil fuels (61%) like coal (28%), oil (2%), and natural gas (31%), whereas its low-carbon sources like hydropower (8%) and biomass (5%), particularly solar (11%) and nuclear power (10%), make up the remaining 39%.

Now, as the country lags dramatically behind its Asian neighbors in renewable deployment and major developers abandon projects and auctions falter, a new industry blueprint warns Japan risks missing its clean energy moment. This white paper from the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) is sounding the alarm: without immediate and comprehensive reform, Japan’s offshore wind ambitions may be dead in the water.

The Promise That Faded

The numbers tell a sobering story. Japan aims to reach 10 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 45 gigawatts by 2040. Current installed capacity? Just 0.3 gigawatts. While China added 8 gigawatts of offshore wind in 2024 alone, and Taiwan, South Korea, and Vietnam are racing ahead with ambitious buildouts, Japan’s three auction rounds have produced more cautionary tales than turbines.

Round 1’s sole winner withdrew. Round 2 and Round 3 winners are struggling with severe financial challenges. The government even postponed its fourth auction indefinitely in October to reassess the entire framework. Even before the delays, developers warned they were “at the brink of whether this business can continue.”

This isn’t just an industry problem — it’s an economic and strategic one for a nation that imports most of its energy and has pledged carbon neutrality by 2050. Japan’s electricity costs remain among Asia’s highest, its fossil fuel dependence near 70%, and its renewable energy share trails embarrassingly behind global peers. While wind provided just 1% of Japan’s electricity in 2024, it averaged 11% across other G7 nations.

“Japan holds vast offshore wind potential and cannot afford to miss its chance to become an offshore wind leader, especially within the Asia-Pacific region,” says Takeshi Matsuki, GWEC’s Japan Country Manager. The urgency in his assessment is palpable — and justified.

The GWEC white paper, Unlocking Japan’s Offshore Wind Potential, produced in partnership with renewable energy consultancy OWC, dissects what went wrong and maps a path forward through three critical reform areas.

Auction Framework

Japan’s current auction design creates a perfect storm of uncertainty. Price-focused evaluation criteria drove developers to submit unrealistically low bids — some at near-zero premiums — just to win projects. But winning means little when project economics don’t work.

The centralized survey model, while intended to reduce developer risk, hasn’t provided the certainty needed. Meanwhile, complex evaluation processes and academic-heavy review committees lack input from developers with “hands-on experience from the front lines,” according to the report.

The solution? Establish a dedicated public-private forum that supplements existing government working groups. Optimize evaluation criteria to better balance price and non-price factors. In the longer term, introduce two-stage auction structures that give developers clearer pathways from selection to financial close.

The Revenue Certainty Crisis

Here’s where the system truly breaks down. Japan uses a Feed-in Premium (FIP) scheme tied to volatile market prices on the Japan Electric Power Exchange, where spot prices averaged ¥9-16 per kilowatt-hour in 2025 — well below the ¥12-15/kWh needed for early offshore wind projects to pencil out.

Even when Mitsubishi secured FIP rates ranging from ¥11.99 to ¥16.49/kWh across its three projects, those levels proved insufficient as construction costs ballooned by more than 20% and turbine prices doubled. Material costs, labor shortages, and currency fluctuations combined to make even supposedly “winning” bids economically untenable.

The white paper strongly advocates transitioning to either a two-sided Contract for Difference (CfD) or Feed-in Tariff (FIT) — mechanisms that provide stable, predictable revenue streams and lower the weighted average cost of capital. The UK, facing similar auction failures, raised its CfD ceiling price 66% in 2024 and extended contract terms from 15 to 20 years. Denmark followed suit after receiving zero bids.

Japan also needs to review and raise price caps to align with current market realities while introducing lower limits closer to break-even points to prevent destructive underbidding. Greater access to Corporate Power Purchase Agreements, potentially backed by credit guarantees, could unlock additional financing.

Death By A Thousand Cuts

Beyond auctions and revenue structures, developers face a gauntlet of obstacles that make projects unbankable. Certification requirements lack transparency. The permitting process is byzantine. Grid curtailment — particularly in high-potential regions like Hokkaido, Tohoku, and Kyushu — threatens project returns without compensation mechanisms.

Perhaps most critically, Japan sets pipeline development targets rather than Commercial Operation Date (COD) targets. This creates phantom progress: projects awarded but never completed. COD-based targets would force accountability and enable the supply chain visibility that manufacturers and investors need to commit capital.

A Region Leaving Japan Behind

The contrast with neighboring markets is stark. In 2024, global offshore wind auctions awarded 56.3 gigawatts of capacity. China awarded 17.4 gigawatts. Europe awarded 23.2 gigawatts. South Korea awarded 3.3 gigawatts, Taiwan 2.7 gigawatts. Japan? Just 1.4 gigawatts.

The Asia-Pacific region expects to account for 61% of new wind capacity built worldwide between 2024 and 2030, with total onshore and offshore wind capacity potentially reaching 1,206 gigawatts by decade’s end. Japan has the offshore potential to be a major player in this transformation — its exclusive economic zone alone offers massive developable areas — yet it’s squandering that opportunity.

The economic costs of this failure extend beyond missed megawatts. Japan spent ¥3.7 trillion subsidizing electricity and gas bills between January 2023 and May 2024 due to fossil fuel price volatility. Every delayed offshore wind project is another year of import dependence, price exposure, and foregone job creation in manufacturing, installation, and operations.

The Window Is Closing

GWEC and OWC presented their findings to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), and Ministry of Environment (MOE) in late October. The government agencies expressed strong interest.

Interest, however, isn’t implementation. As the white paper notes, meaningful reform requires both short-term fixes — adjustments to Round 1 re-tendering and the upcoming auction that can be made without legislative changes — and long-term structural reforms envisioned for Round 5 and beyond.

“Japan stands at a pivotal moment in its clean energy transition, and offshore wind has emerged as a central pillar of its strategy,” says Masataka Nakagawa, OWC’s Japan Country Manager. “To enable stable and scalable deployment, Japan needs to address three critical areas: auction framework, offtake mechanisms, and other market bottlenecks.”

The question is whether Japan will act decisively enough, quickly enough. Other markets have shown that offshore wind can recover from setbacks with the right policy responses. But timing matters. Developers are increasingly mobile, directing capital to markets with clear, stable frameworks. Supply chain partners need demand visibility to justify investments in local manufacturing.

As GWEC prepares a detailed plan for the proposed public-private bridging forum, the message is clear: reform isn’t optional. It’s existential. Without it, Japan risks watching its offshore wind potential remain just that — potential — while the rest of Asia builds the clean energy infrastructure of the 21st century.

For a nation that pioneered hybrid cars and led in solar deployment before feed-in tariffs lapsed, that would be more than an industrial missed opportunity. It would be a strategic failure at precisely the moment when energy security, economic competitiveness, and climate leadership demand bold action.

The turbines are waiting. The question is whether Japan’s policymakers will build the framework to support them.

[TITLE]Hallador Energy Company Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial and Operating Results:
[TEXT]
- Q3 Total Revenue up 40% YoY to $146.8 Million -

- Q3 Net Income Increases to $23.9 Million or $0.56 Earnings per Share -

- Q3 Operating Cash Flow of $23.2 Million -

- Q3 Adjusted EBITDA up 1.6x to $24.9 Million -

- Filed ERAS Application for 525MW Gas Generation Expansion -

TERRE HAUTE, Ind., Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hallador Energy Company (Nasdaq: HNRG) (“Hallador” or the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

“This was an exceptional quarter for Hallador as we delivered significant gains across all key financial metrics, including material growth in revenue, net income, Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow from operations,” said Brent Bilsland, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Favorable summer weather, increased energy demand, and stronger natural gas prices provided a supportive backdrop that drove strong revenue at Hallador Power. Following the completion of our second unit’s planned maintenance early in the quarter, both generating units operated efficiently throughout the summer, while our coal operations continued to deliver solid production, increased shipments, and stable operating costs. The combination of higher dispatch levels and strong operational execution helped reduce inventories and meaningfully enhanced our financial performance.”

“We continue to see accelerating demand for accredited capacity, particularly from data center developers and load serving entities seeking dispatchable energy. The strength of this interest led us in early November to file an application seeking to expand our generation capabilities at the Merom site by 525 MWs through MISO’s Expedited Resource Addition Study (ERAS) program. ERAS aims to fast-track critical capacity additions to the grid and we are currently targeting an on-line date for the gas generation in the fourth quarter of 2028.”

Bilsland continued, “The combination of the ERAS application and the positive progress towards a long-term agreement in support of large load development is providing a definitive pathway for meaningful company growth. If we are able to execute on these growth initiatives, adding roughly 50% additional generating capacity to the Merom site should provide exceptional value to our shareholders now and in the future.”

[TITLE]New U.S. nuclear power boom begins with old, still-unsolved problem: What to do with radioactive waste:

Nuclear power is back, largely due to the skyrocketing demand for electricity, including big tech's hundreds of artificial intelligence data centers across the country and the reshoring of manufacturing. But it returns with an old and still-unsolved problem: storing all of the radioactive waste created as a byproduct of nuclear power generation. In May, President Trump issued executive orders aimed at quadrupling the current nuclear output over the next 25 years by accelerating construction of both large conventional reactors and next-gen small modular reactors. Last week, the U.S. signed a deal with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the country that could result in Westinghouse attempting to spinoff and IPO a stand-alone nuclear power company with the federal government as a shareholder. There's a growing consensus among governments, businesses and the public that the time is right for a nuclear power renaissance, and even if the ambitious build-out could take a decade or more and cost hundreds of billion of dollars, it will be an eventual boon to legacy and start-up nuclear energy companies, the AI-fixated wing of the tech industry and investors banking on their success. But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. Only two nuclear power plants have been built since 1990 — more than $15 billion over budget and years behind schedule — and they went online in just the last two years. Almost all of the 94 reactors currently operating in 28 states, generating
