[TITLE]From Nigeria to Namibia, Africa’s Energy Revival Draws a Flood of New Capital:
[TEXT]
Many of the resource-rich countries in Africa have intensified efforts to become more attractive for exploration and production (E&P) investment. Reforms in licensing rounds, production sharing contracts, and fiscal policy are improving investor returns and are set to drive $41 billion in upstream investment in 2026, the African Energy Chamber’s State of African Energy 2026 Outlook shows.

From legacy oil producers Nigeria and Angola to emerging exploration hotspots such as Namibia, African resource holders are looking to compete with other regions for the billions of U.S. dollars that foreign investors could pour into their energy and minerals sectors.

Long-time producers, including the biggest oil producers Nigeria, Libya, and Angola, have made their licensing and fiscal policy more attractive, and emerging wannabe producers are offering incentives. All African countries are betting on boosting natural gas exploration, production, and development amid growing demand for gas and LNG for domestic use and for exports to Europe and Asia.

“The continent offers compelling opportunities for investors who are prepared to engage in a transparent, regulated, and increasingly competitive E&P landscape,” AEC executive chairman NJ Ayuk said in a statement.

“Governments and operators must continue to balance national priorities with investor confidence to unlock Africa’s vast hydrocarbon potential.”

Reforms in recent years have allowed Angola to improve its above-ground risk score since 2017, reflecting extensive regulatory and institutional reforms. Angola’s fiscal incentives, including terms for gas, marginal fields, and incremental production, have successfully attracted upstream investment, consolidating its status as a continental leader, AEC’s report said.

While Angola is trying to reverse years of falling oil production, it bets big on standalone gas development and has just launched its first plant to process non-associated natural gas.

Angola also looks to accelerate the permitting phase of new minerals projects to attract investment. In October, Angola launched production at its first major copper mine, Tetelo, as the country looks to diversify into critical minerals.

Nigeria, the top oil producer in Africa, is auctioning 50 oil and gas blocks, eyeing $10 billion in new investments over the next ten years and 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in additional production capacity.

Nigeria’s licensing program with updated terms and incentives targeting specific terrains and resource types has renewed interest in projects in the country and has boosted investor confidence in the upstream potential, evidenced in recent project approvals by Shell and TotalEnergies, AEC said.

Senegal and Cote d’Ivoire in West Africa have also attracted the interest and investment of the international majors.

Cote d’Ivoire has seen majors expand offshore development, and its huge oil and gas field Baleine started up production two years after discovery, thanks to Italy’s Eni.

According to the African Energy Chamber, Cote d’Ivoire maintains a pragmatic approach to foreign investment and regardless of the outcome of the 2025 presidential election, authorities are expected to continue supporting upstream investors while emphasizing adherence to local content requirements, particularly for offshore developments.

[TITLE]Oil Closes Up as Peace Deal Falls Short:
[TEXT]
Oil edged up after a fresh round of US-Russia talks failed to reach a deal to end Moscow's war in Ukraine, boosting fears that restrictions on Russian oil supply could remain in place for longer.

West Texas Intermediate rose 0.5% to settle near $59, remaining within the tight range prices have been stuck in this week. The Kremlin says talks with a US delegation led by US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were "constructive," but no deal was made to end the Ukraine war.

The talks took place against a backdrop of recent attacks on Russia-linked tankers, with at least one ship manager saying it would stop sending vessels to the country. A deal to end Russia's war in Ukraine could mean the end of sanctions on Russian oil in a market already staring down concerns

[TITLE]Brazil’s Oil Sector Rallies Against Oilfield Services Merger Plan:
[TEXT]
Oil majors in Brazil have decided they’ve seen enough of the proposed Subsea7–Saipem tie-up, and they’re pushing antitrust regulator Cade to slow it down or break it up. The merger, announced earlier this year, would create a new oilfield services deepwater heavyweight called Saipem7 — a company large enough to matter in any basin, but especially in Brazil, where subsea contractors are already a small club.

Cade has now asked both firms for fresh data, saying it still doesn’t have the information it needs to assess the deal. That request landed shortly after IBP — the industry group representing Brazil’s majors — warned that a combined Subsea7–Saipem could raise costs, delay projects, and lean on operators to sign long, exclusive contracts. In other words, the exact behavior regulators are supposed to prevent.

TotalEnergies went further, filing a study arguing that no set of remedies could fully offset the competitive risks. According to Total, the merged firm would control eight of the twelve ships worldwide capable of handling the toughest SURF work — the subsea umbilicals, risers, and flowlines essential for Brazil’s ultra-deepwater fields. Exxon also raised flags, and Petrobras joined the chorus asking Cade to either block the deal outright or force asset sales.

The scale is hard to ignore. Saipem7 would launch with a €43 billion backlog and about €21 billion in annual revenue. And while the two companies insist the merger is on track for late 2026, Cade is clearly taking its time — meeting not only with operators in Brazil but with regulators in the U.S., U.K., and Mozambique. The U.K. has already approved the deal; Brazil is shaping up to be the real test.

It’s a familiar story, really. The consolidation in oilfield services accelerates, offshore activity rebounds, and operators remember why they are not keen on concentrated supplier power.

[TITLE]UK Windfall Tax Puts $20 Billion in North Sea Oil Investment at Risk:
[TEXT]
The UK government’s decision to keep the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators could wipe out as much as $20 billion (£15 billion) of potential investment in Britain’s offshore oil and gas output, according to a Wood Mackenzie estimate cited by the Financial Times.

The government last week kept the windfall tax on operators in the Budget, dealing a blow to the industry.

Keeping the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), as the windfall tax is officially known since it was first introduced by a Conservative government at the height of the 2022 energy crisis, would wipe out all non-essential investment in the UK shelf, as it would compete with friendlier tax jurisdictions, according to WoodMac.

The UK has one of the highest tax rates of all major producing basins worldwide. Together with the windfall tax, which the government kept against industry calls for reform, operators are paying a massive 78% overall tax rate.

This has prompted many companies to halt investment in the UK and move to cut workforce numbers.

The latest announcement came from one of the top independent producers, Harbour Energy, which on Monday said it expects to reduce employee numbers by another 100, on top of 600 jobs already eliminated since 2023.

The industry slammed the government’s decision, arguing that the windfall tax will eventually bury the offshore oil and gas industry and threaten Britain’s energy security.

“The future of North Sea energy depends on investment, which won’t come without urgent reform of the windfall tax,” Offshore Energies UK Chief Executive, David Whitehouse, said in a statement.

“The government turned down £50 billion of investment for the UK and the chance to protect the jobs and industries that keep this country running. Instead, they’ve chosen a path that will see 1,000 jobs continue to be lost every month, more energy imports and a contagion across supply chains and our industrial heartlands,” Whitehouse added.

The Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce said it’s “Lights out for North Sea oil and gas as Chancellor keeps windfall tax.”

The Chamber’s chief executive, Russell Borthwick, commented that instead of heeding advice from industry, “the UK Government has instead opted for a cliff-edge end to North Sea production and to tax the industry to death inside five years. Jobs will be lost in their thousands as a direct result of this government’s failure to act.”

[TITLE]Ottawa-Alberta deal ‘game changer’ for conventional oil and gas, industry head says:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

A federal-provincial agreement on energy policy is being characterized as “pragmatic” and “a game changer” by the president of a group representing oil and gas drillers in Canada, even as the industry comes off a down year.

Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Energy Contractors (CAOEC), which represents 89 Canadian land drilling, offshore drilling and service rig companies, told reporters Monday that the agreement reached between Alberta and Ottawa was “great news for the conventional side of the business.”

“This is really pragmatic policy. I think it’s competitive policy, and I think it’s a game changer for the conventional business,” Scholz said.

The agreement lays out the groundwork for a new bitumen pipeline through British Columbia. It also includes a suite of changes to Ottawa’s environmental regulatory landscape, many of which the CAOEC had long been pushing for, including the suspension of the proposed federal oil and gas emissions cap.

But the MOU won’t translate into a dramatic change to the CAOEC’s forecast, with impacts expected more in the long term, Scholz said.

" We don't see a dramatic change in 2026," he said, noting the proposed pipeline through B.C. is years away from being realized.

Drilling activity expected to slightly increase

Scholz said the sector will finish 2025 with less activity than it saw the year prior, with year-over-year drilling activity expected to decrease by about six per cent.

The start of the year appeared promising, with first-quarter drilling two per cent higher than in 2024, but conditions deteriorated sharply.

Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Energy Contractors, told reporters Monday that the recent Alberta-Ottawa deal is a positive step for the conventional oil and gas industry. (Mike Symington/CBC)

Still, the CAOEC is expecting a slight uptick in activity next year. The industry group wrote in its 2025 State of the Industry report that it is expecting about 5,700 wells to be drilled in 2026, which would be up about three per cent from this year.

“The reason why we were seeing such a drop in activity was because we were seeing gluts within the market for natural gas within Western Canada, and it impacted our operations significantly,” Scholz said.

“Part of that was because of the timing issue with LNG offtake, and the ability to export that off the continent. We see that well dealt with, in the second half [of 2026], and so we do see a continued strong demand for natural gas drilling within Western Canada.”

He said CAOEC is also hopeful that oil markets show more discipline.

“We have already heard discussions about production cuts with OPEC , some more discipline from the Middle East producers. So I think that will firm up crude oil prices, which will provide some stability,” he said.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said while price fluctuations are painful for governments who rely on energy revenue, she remained optimistic about the industry’s long-term outlook. (Mike Symington/CBC)

A separate industry forecast from the Calgary-based Enserva was released last week . It suggested that drilling activity would fall further in 2026, as North American oil prices remain below $60 US a barrel.

That report suggested oil and gas companies would see their total capital spending decline by 5.6 per cent this year and a further 2.2 per cent in 2026.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects prices will decline to an average of $55 US in 2026, and while projections vary, others see prices headed lower in 2027.

Speaking to reporters Monday, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said “short-term price fluctuations are painful for governments” that rely on oil and gas as a source of revenue.

“But I remain very confident that when we look forward five, 10, 15 years, that there’s going to be more Alberta energy on the market,” Smith said.

[TITLE]Europe strikes a deal to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027:
[TEXT]
Brussels Reuters —

The European Union agreed Wednesday to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decade-long dependency on Russian energy.

Representatives for EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement in the early hours of Wednesday on proposals set out by the European Commission in June to end shipments from the EU’s former top gas supplier following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move toward a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.

“Today, we are stopping these imports permanently,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement. “By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

For short-term contracts concluded before June 17 this year, the prohibition will apply from April 25, 2026, for LNG and from June 17, 2026, for pipeline gas.

For long-term contracts concluded before June 17, the cut-off dates will be the start of 2027 and the start of October 2026, with a possible one-month extension for EU members facing difficulties reaching required storage levels.

As of October, Russia accounted for 12% of EU gas imports, down from 45% before its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Hungary, France and Belgium among the countries still receiving supplies.

The European Commission is also committed to phasing out remaining oil imports from Russia by the end of 2027, with a legislative proposal to be presented early next year.

Under Wednesday’s agreement, EU members will submit “national diversification plans” regarding oil and gas supplies to the commission by March 1, and will be required to notify the EU executive whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national bans in place.

The commission will issue recommendations based on this feedback.

[TITLE]Global evidence on the income elasticity of willingness to pay, relative price changes and public natural capital values:
[TEXT]
Drupp, Moritz A., Turk, Zachary M., Groom, Ben ORCID: 0000-0003-0729-143X and Heckenhahn, Jonas (2025) Global evidence on the income elasticity of willingness to pay, relative price changes and public natural capital values. Environmental and Resource Economics. ISSN 0924-6460

Abstract

While the global economy continues to grow, ecosystem services tend to stagnate or decline. Economic theory has shown how such shifts in relative scarcities can be reflected in project appraisal and accounting, but empirical evidence has been sparse to put theory into practice. To estimate relative price changes (RPCs) for ecosystem services to be used for making such adjustments, we perform a global meta-analysis of contingent valuation studies to derive income elasticities of marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for ecosystem services to proxy the degree of limited substitutability. Based on 735 income-WTP pairs from 396 studies, we find an income elasticity of WTP of around 0.6. Combined with good-specific growth rates, we estimate an RPC of ecosystem services of around 1.7% per year. In an application to natural capital valuation of forest ecosystem services by the World Bank, we show that natural capital should be uplifted by around 40%. Our assessment of aggregate public natural capital yields a larger value adjustment of between 58 and 97%, depending on the discount rate. We discuss implications for policy appraisal and for estimates of natural capital in comprehensive wealth accounts.

[TITLE]Investment/Growth Opportunities in the ~$70 Billion Flavored Syrup Market, 2030 - Reduced-Sugar and Natural Sweetener Trends Reshape the Landscape:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Flavored Syrup Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Flavored Syrup Market, valued at USD 55.64 Billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.87% to reach USD 69.87 Billion by 2030. Market growth is strongly supported by rising consumer demand for flavor customization in both home and commercial settings, as well as the continued expansion of the global foodservice industry.

Key Market Drivers

The global flavored syrup market is experiencing sustained growth driven by shifting consumer preferences and a thriving commercial landscape. A key reflection of market strength is the performance of leading players. Torani, for instance, surpassed $500 million in annual revenue in 2024, as reported by Business Wire in October 2024, reinforcing strong demand for flavor solutions.

Consumers are increasingly drawn to diverse and exotic flavor experiences, especially younger demographics seeking customizable beverage options. According to Simpsons Beverages (February 2025), 70% of consumers aged 18-34 preferred flavored coffee, highlighting a significant taste-shaping trend. Additionally, strong growth in the foodservice and HoReCa sector amplifies demand for flavored syrups, as restaurants and cafes rely heavily on such ingredients for menu differentiation. The U.S. restaurant and foodservice industry is projected to generate $1.1 trillion in sales in 2024, according to the National Restaurant Association (via Escoffier, October 2024), demonstrating the size of the commercial ecosystem supporting syrup consumption.

Key Market Challenges

Health concerns related to high sugar content present a major restraint to the global flavored syrup market. Rising awareness of the health risks associated with excessive sugar intake - such as obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorders - is prompting consumers to reduce or avoid sugary products. This shift significantly impacts demand for traditional flavored syrups.

According to the International Food Information Council (IFIC), 66% of Americans in 2023 reported actively trying to limit or avoid sugar in their diet. As consumers increasingly prioritize healthier lifestyles, conventional full-sugar syrups face difficulty maintaining or expanding their market share, compelling manufacturers to adapt their formulations to meet evolving expectations.

Key Market Trends

Health-conscious consumer behavior is shaping new product development in the flavored syrup market. Manufacturers are actively introducing reduced-sugar, zero-sugar, and naturally sweetened syrups to align with preferences for cleaner and more transparent ingredient lists.

The IFIC reported in January 2024 that the food and beverage sector accounted for over 40.2% of the natural sweeteners market share in 2023, underscoring a clear shift toward healthier alternatives. The decline of sugar-heavy products is also reflected in market adjustments, such as the discontinuation of Coca-Cola Spiced in 2024 due to poor resonance with health-aware younger consumers.

[TITLE]Shareholder Frustration Kills Massive UK Renewable Infrastructure Fund Merger:
[TEXT]
HICL's portfolio includes UK infrastructure like the High Speed 1 rail link, while TRIG specializes in renewable assets across Britain and Europe, with both boards remaining convinced of the strategic rationale for the combination.

The deal was called off because HICL's board determined it could not proceed without substantial support from its own investors, who were reportedly frustrated with the terms.

HICL Infrastructure and The Renewables Infrastructure Group (TRIG) have abandoned their planned merger, which would have created the UK's largest infrastructure investment firm.

A plan to merge two FTSE-listed funds to form the UK’s largest infrastructure investment firm has been abandoned after shareholders expressed frustration with the terms of the deal.

HICL Infrastructure said it will no longer be proceeding with its planned merger with The Renewables Infrastructure Group (TRIG) after its board “determined that it cannot progress the transaction without a substantial majority of support from its own investors”.

“Both boards remain convinced of the strategic rationale for the combination,” HICL added.

As part of the terms of the deal, TRIG shareholders would have had the option of a partial cash exit of up to £250m in aggregate, representing approximately 11 per cent of TRIG’s share capital.

Assuming full take-up of the partial cash option, HICL shareholders were expected to hold 56 per cent, and TRIG shareholders 44 per cent, of the combined company.

But the deal, first announced on 17 November, attracted significant pushback from shareholders.

“We see multiple reasons for TRIG shareholders to be excited by the proposal, but fewer for HICL shareholders, where a liquidity opportunity is lacking despite a material shift in strategy and portfolio,” analysts at Peel Hunt said.

“Whilst we applaud the boards of both companies for working on a transformative transaction, we are concerned by the balance of incentives for each set of shareholders.”

TRIG shares fell 3.8 per cent to 71p following the announcement, while HICL shares rose 4.2 per cent to 118p.

Government and energy assets

HICL was listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange in 2006 and was originally set up to invest in infrastructure projects developed under the UK’s private finance initiative (PFI).

HICL’s portfolio includes a host of UK infrastructure assets such as the High Speed 1 rail link, the Westminster headquarters of the Home Office, The Northwood headquarters of the Ministry of Defence and Lewisham hospital.

[TITLE]Cap-and-Invest: A US Program to Ration Energy and Then Tax the Fations:
[TEXT]
This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé.

Several US states have implemented or are developing Cap-and-Invest programs, including California, Washington State, and New York State.

Climate change catastrophists will say that these programmes are to save the planet from global warming. But as with all things related to the climate change agenda, it has nothing to do with climate change and everything to do with money and control.

Carbon taxes and cap-and-invest systems have much in common. Both are market-based policies to make “carbon emitters” pay for their “emissions.”

Using climate change jargon, Cap-and-Invest is a tool designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a declining cap on total emissions from covered sources, such as large industrial facilities, fuel distributors, and utilities. Each covered entity must hold an allowance for every tonne of emissions it produces, with the total number of allowances equal to the annual emissions cap, which decreases over time to achieve long-term climate goals. This system creates a financial incentive for businesses to reduce emissions, as they can either cut their own pollution or purchase allowances from others, with the price of allowances determined by supply and demand.

In the following, David Wojick explains in simple terms what this nefarious programme is all about, using New York as the example.

By David Wojick, as published by CFACT on 3 December 2025

New York Governor Hochul says the emission reduction regulations required by the Climate Act are infeasible and ruinously expensive. She has yet to explain this, so here is my simple assessment.

The regulatory programme has two very different mechanisms. First, they ration your fossil fuels. Then, they tax you heavily on the ration you get. The rationing is infeasible; the tax is ruinous.

The programme is called “cap-and-invest,” which sounds good. Note the missing word: “tax.” You need the tax to get the money to “invest.” An honest name is “cap, tax, and spend.”

The cap is the amount of each type of fossil fuel that can be sold to consumers during a given period. Permissions to sell this amount are called allowances, and they cost money.

Here is how the Cap-and-Invest website explains it. (There is almost no other information.)

“The Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) are designing a programme that sets an annual cap on the amount of greenhouse gas pollution that is permitted to be emitted in New York. Under the programme, large-scale greenhouse gas emissions sources and distributors of heating and transportation fuels will be required to purchase or obtain allowances for the emissions associated with their activities.”

The cap is the ration, and the allowances are the ration tickets that have to be bought. Note that for heating and transportation fuels, the distributor, not the consumer, buys the allowances. Of course, these costs will be passed on to the consumers. We are mostly talking

[TITLE]Electricity Should Be Free at Noon:
[TEXT]
Electricity prices are becoming an outsize issue in American politics because they themselves are legitimately outsize. Compared with the cost of consumer goods, which have been rising rapidly over the past few years, electricity prices are climbing even faster, an estimated 13 percent nationwide since 2022. This year, roughly half of households making less than $50,000 struggled to pay their electricity bills. In California, where the rise has been particularly steep, rates have essentially doubled over the past decade.

When electricity was first commercialized, utilities were allowed to operate as monopolies for one main reason: to deliver lower costs. For a century, it worked. Companies spread the fixed costs of growing the system across their locked-in customers, and prices dropped precipitously. In 1890, a kilowatt-hour was $9.48 on average nationwide in today’s dollars; by 1950, it had dropped to 41 cents and, by 1990, to 21 cents. But recently, this century-long trend has reversed in many states; utilities are failing to keep prices low.

Prices are rising for many reasons, not all of which apply in every state. In some states, data centers are pushing up rates. In others, wildfire costs are showing up on bills. Despite what President Donald Trump has argued, higher prices have little to do with the country’s move toward clean energy. If anything, Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act has made it harder to invest in the cheapest ways of building new solar, wind, and batteries.

Ignoring those technologies will make electricity only more expensive in the years to come. If regulators, policy makers, and utility executives actually want to lower prices, they will have to deal strategically with both the clean-energy boom and climate change’s strain on the electricity system.

Clean energy is cheap energy. Building a large-scale solar or wind project costs less than a new gas plant, and solar and wind require no fuel to operate, making each additional kilowatt-hour essentially free. When combined with batteries, these projects can now operate like traditional power plants, providing power on demand.

In places with a lot of solar, including California, some installations are producing more energy than is being consumed, so some power is being wasted. If people shifted more of their electricity use toward the middle of the day, the grid’s overall costs would go down, because demand would decrease in later hours, when prices are the highest. And the easiest way to nudge people toward using that midday power is to make it cheaper—or even free.

Like California, Australia has an enormous amount of solar. The country’s climate-change-and-energy minister just announced that, starting in July, electricity suppliers will be required to offer at least three free hours of midday power in some regions. This will give people a reason to charge their electric vehicles, use heat pumps to precool or preheat their homes and water, and store more clean electricity in batteries when cheap energy is abundant. Later in the day, when the system relies on dirtier and more expensive energy sources, people will likely demand less power, reducing costs for everyone.

Plenty of places in the U.S. could try this, too. The states with the most solar, including California and Texas, are already wasting

[TITLE]Utility innovation, EV adoption, and digital twins define the 2025 Grid Changers:
[TEXT]

What makes a project worthy of celebration by the wider utility industry? Who are the people that enabled such ambitious initiatives? And what larger lessons can the industry learn from them?

These are just a few of the critical questions that 2025 Grid Changers nominees answered during the “Who are the Grid Changers?” panel that took place on November 18th, 2025, at DTECH Northeast. The awards themselves were given out at the conclusion of the panel, but the insights and lessons from all of the nominees showcase what it can mean to create and define blueprints that enable the sorts of transformations that are needed across the entire industry.

Increasing the number of chargers for the benefit of everyone

Andrew Farrell is Director, E-Mobility at Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. Their POWERREADY Program offers incentives to offset the costs of installing Level 2 and DC fast chargers for businesses, multi-family dwellings, and government entities in the region. While the larger goal was to build out supply ahead of actual demand, the company has already met its goal to support the installation of thousands of chargers, highlighting how much has been accomplished, but also showcasing what sort of opportunities this kind of proactive approach can enable in the short and long term.

Farrell explained that the goal of the initiative was to increase and accelerate EV adoption that connects with New York’s Climate Leadership & Community Protection Act. Doing so meant shifting the large power draw from EV charging to off-peak hours. This strategy helped mitigate rate increases and freed up capital for other necessary projects like safety and reliability improvements. The benefits can be seen in the bottom line numbers, but were also evident on a much more practical level.

“In the middle of June of this year, we had a heat wave that ended up being a top ten system peak day,” Farrell told the crowd. “An analysis was done to find out what of that was from EVs, and it ended up coming in at 4%. So the question became, what would the peak have been if those charging programs not existed? And it would have been an incremental 3% higher. It really shows these managed charging programs are working.”

Farrell outlined the practical benefits that increasing the number of chargers on streets can enable for utilities, and how the thinking behind doing so should be considered in terms of risk management conversations. A proactive shift in operational planning around the integration of innovations like EVs is what will both ensure system reliability and help avoid even costlier infrastructure upgrades that might be required in the near term.

“For us, 2% of system peak could just materialize overnight,” he said. “So you want to start thinking

[TITLE]TVA, Holtec to Get Up To $800MM in DOE Funding for SMR Development:
[TEXT]
The funding will help 'advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan and help expand the nation's capacity while facilitating additional follow-on projects and associated supply chains'.

The United States Department of Energy (DOE) on Tuesday announced funding for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Holtec Government Services to support the development of light-water small modular reactors (SMRs).

"The project teams will receive up to $800 million in federal cost-shared funding to advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan and help expand the nation's capacity while facilitating additional follow-on projects and associated supply chains", DOE said in an online statement.

"The selections announced today will help deliver new nuclear generation in the early 2030s, strengthen domestic supply chains and advance President Trump's executive orders to usher in a nuclear renaissance and expand America’s energy dominance agenda".

TVA has been allotted up to $400 million to advance the deployment of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee and additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl, DOE said.

"TVA is the first utility in the U.S. to have a construction permit application for a BWRX-300 SMR accepted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission", TVA said separately. "The Clinch River project will serve as a national model for how to deploy SMRs safely, efficiently and affordably - laying the groundwork for a new era of American nuclear energy leadership".

TVA president and chief executive Don Moul said, "As AI, data centers and digital infrastructure drive unprecedented energy demand, we're building our nation’s nuclear energy foundation right here in the Tennessee Valley".

Holtec is also getting up to $400 million to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan. "Holtec is pursuing an innovative one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator and electricity merchant selling the power to nearby utilities and end-users", DOE said.

Holtec said separately, "As part of the program, DOE will provide milestone-based cost-share support that is intended to advance licensing, pre-construction and supply-chain mobilization for the Palisades SMR-300 project".

"Holtec's proposal includes a multi-site deployment pathway that establishes a repeatable, fleet-scale model - a core requirement of the Tier 1 program [under the Generation III+ SMR Program] intended to drive down costs and shorten construction durations through standardization and manufacturing efficiency", Holtec said.

The selections resulted from the DOE's $900-million offer last March to derisk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs.

"[T]he remaining $100 million will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain and site readiness", DOE said.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said, "Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the president’s manufacturing boom, support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid".
