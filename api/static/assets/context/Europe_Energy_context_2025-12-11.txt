[TITLE]America’s LNG Boom Is About to Spike Your Power Bill:
[TEXT]
The US is the world’s largest exporter of LNG. And efforts are apace to further increase that export capacity. As the US exports LNG at an increasing rate, this implies good news and bad news. The good news is that gas producers and owners of gas liquefaction facilities will likely enjoy higher profitability in the years ahead. The bad news is that US residential and industrial consumers will be paying those higher prices for gas while also experiencing increased price volatility. Why? Because where or how commodity prices are set makes a huge difference. At present, in the US, our natural gas commodity prices are set (mostly) domestically. This means they are influenced mainly by local supply demand imbalances, taxes, regulation (which often decides what gets built), and infrastructure constraints like pipeline availability. Those are all things our industry leaders and local politicians influence, if not control. However, when commodity prices are set internationally, like oil, prices are no longer determined by the domestic concerns above. Instead, they are set by competitive global spot markets. And there’s the problem. The global market is often much bigger than domestic markets, meaning a buyer in Europe or Japan can now outbid its American counterpart for gas. And there’s often a hurricane, tsunami, or military skirmish somewhere in the world that can now temporarily spike prices adding increased volatility to the mix.

There is little disagreement that moving from a domestic to an international commodity gas market results in higher commodity prices and more volatility. More to the point, this is not a new idea. In 2018, Trump’s DoE issued a report on the implications of increased LNG exports and wrote the following: “On the negative side, producing incremental natural gas volumes to support natural gas exports will increase the marginal cost of supplying gas and therefore raise domestic natural gas prices in general.” The study further noted that more exports meant higher gas prices for households and industry. But the DoE authors did helpfully note that if gas consumers became stock investors and purchased shares of gas liquefaction companies, the gains on these securities would help offset some of the sting from higher prices. Yes, they really said this.

Our readers know why this is a potentially huge economic problem. We are in the middle of an electrification induced power plant build cycle, which includes lots of new gas fired power plants. Substantially raising the operating costs of new gas fired power generating units soon to come on line (via higher, globalized gas prices and more commodity gas price volatility) is not, as they say, on most people’s bingo cards. This could imply much higher future electricity costs than many are expecting. In the past, utility commissions have at least insulated utility companies from the adverse financial impact of commodity price spikes via so called fuel adjustment clauses. We think they will continue to do so, not least because it lowers corporate operating risks, which makes bond raters like Moody’s happy. This means all additional gas commodity costs will pass through directly to electricity consumers.

The economic downsides of a transition to a global gas commodity market are fairly simple to state: higher society-wide energy bills, adverse industry-wide impacts via higher level of operating costs, and relatedly, an adverse impact on corporate competitiveness. We’ve already started to see what appears to be some consumer electoral pushback in response to rapidly rising electricity prices. What makes this looming gas affordability problem different to us is that it is entirely self-inflicted. Our federal government has chosen to encourage further LNG exports (raising prices) while a rapid expansion of the domestic gas power generation fleet is also occurring. More profits for gas producers and higher prices for consumers. All we can say is that an issue like this has traditionally become political, increasing public scrutiny of utility finances with an eye toward lowering utility profitability.. As for obvious losers, consider the plight of consumers in deregulated states where the price of gas effectively sets all electricity prices (whether or not the electricity is generated by burning gas). For close to 30 years, deregulation has failed to reduce prices to consumers. Now it looks as if deregulation will raise prices for consumers thanks to a tighter gas market. Well, where there are losers, there are also winners, the obvious ones being all renewable forms of power generation and new nuclear, which will benefit from higher expected power prices.

[TITLE]Labor Shortages Threaten to Derail Europe's Energy Security Pivot:
[TEXT]
In addition to the workforce crisis, the IEA also warns that current electricity market designs are failing to send the right long-term investment signals and must be redesigned to value flexibility for a system dominated by renewables.

The global energy sector is booming, with jobs up by over 5 million since 2019, but a survey of 700 companies found that more than half reported critical hiring bottlenecks for electricians, engineers, and grid technicians.

The EU's goal to completely phase out Russian natural gas imports by 2027 is facing a major challenge due to a growing shortage of skilled labor needed to build the necessary alternative infrastructure.

The European Union has drawn a line in the sand. By 2027, the bloc intends to phase out Russian natural gas imports completely.

But as the policy ink dries in Brussels, a new challenge is emerging in the real economy…

We might not have enough hands to build the infrastructure that replaces it.

International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol stood alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last week and called it the "end of an era."

But he also delivered a warning.

The transition away from Russian energy is only as strong as the workforce available to execute it. And right now... that workforce is stretched to the breaking point.

The Golden Rule: Diversification

Following the invasion of Ukraine, the IEA responded with a 10-Point Plan to reduce reliance on Russian fuel. The results have been swift. Europe has moved toward firmer footing, diversifying suppliers and accelerating renewables.

Dr. Birol, speaking at the European Commission, laid out the new philosophy simply:

“In the energy world, overreliance can quickly turn into major geopolitical vulnerabilities. My number one golden rule for energy security is diversification.”

The deal is done. The timeline is set. But policy is just paper until it is built.

A Boom with a Bottleneck

The energy sector is growing. Fast.

According to the IEA’s newly released World Energy Employment 2025 report, the sector is a job-creation machine.

Global energy employment hit 76 million people in 2024. It is up by more than 5 million since 2019. Last year alone, energy jobs grew by 2.2%, a rate growing at twice the pace of the wider global economy.

The center of gravity is shifting, too.

The power sector has overtaken fuel supply as the industry's top employer.

Solar PV is the primary driver of growth.

Jobs in EV manufacturing and battery production surged by nearly 800,000.

At first glance, all seems well, but the report highlights a deepening shortage of skilled labor. Of the 700 energy-related companies surveyed, more than half reported critical hiring bottlenecks.

Europe is facing a paradox. It has the capital. It has the policy mandates. But it lacks the electricians, the engineers, and the grid technicians to deploy them on schedule.

These shortages threaten to slow the building of infrastructure, delay projects, and raise system costs exactly when Europe needs to move fastest.

Rewiring the Market's Operating System

As the grid transforms to accommodate wind, solar, and batteries, the market design—the economic logic that governs the grid—is struggling to keep up.

The IEA’s concurrent report, Electricity Market Design, finds a disconnect.

Short-term markets are working well; they are efficiently dispatching power hour-by-hour. But long-term markets? They are failing to send the right investment signals.

The old models weren't built for a system dominated by renewables. The report argues that we need to redesign these markets to value flexibility and attract long-term capital.

If we don't fix the market signals, the investment won't flow... no matter what the policymakers in Brussels say.

The Global Context

The pivot isn't happening in a vacuum. While Europe finalizes its divorce from Russian gas, the rest of the world is moving, too.

In Norway: Dr. Birol met with Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre to discuss Norway's role as a guarantor of energy security and a partner in clean cooking initiatives for Africa.

In Southeast Asia: 150 policymakers gathered in Vietnam for the IEA’s 22nd Energy Efficiency Policy Training Week, addressing rapidly growing demand in the region.

The Bottom Line

The 2027 phase-out deal is a massive geopolitical win for Europe. It signals resilience. But the hard work is just starting.

We have traded a geopolitical crisis for an industrial one. The race is no longer just about securing gas contracts; it is about securing the talent and the market structures to keep the lights on.

Europe has cut the cord. Now, it has to build the battery.

Broadly, any move away from our traditional suppliers must have strong commercial underpinnings, be it directly or indirectly by way of trade offsets in other sectors. From here on, we can expect an expansion in India’s hydrocarbons trade with the US, especially since the latter has recently approved the setting up of many LNG export terminals.

[TITLE]Where the Algo Meets the Asphalt:
[TEXT]
Geopolitically, the shift is marked by China's pivot from dominating solar panel manufacturing to cornering the green hydrogen market, and a return to "interventionist industrial strategy" in the West where governments are becoming energy shareholders.

The transition is forcing a move away from simple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) toward complex, flexible contracts and driving Big Tech to invest in on-site generation and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) to ensure reliability.

The rapid growth of AI is projected to push global data center power demand to 2,200 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2030, an "always-on" load that threatens to overwhelm the world's aging electrical grids.

There is the economy you see on the screen. And then there is the economy that runs the screen.

For the last few years, the screen has been winning.

We have been living in a "Zero Marginal Cost" fantasy…

We convinced ourselves that adding another million users to ChatGPT was free. That scaling a startup was just a matter of writing better code. That "The Cloud" was an infinite, weightless place where business happened by magic.

But today, S&P Global Energy dropped a bucket of ice water on that fever dream.

I’ve spent the morning reading through their new Horizons Top Trends 2026 forecast. It’s dense. It’s technical. It’s written in the polite, measured language of analysts who don't like to shout. But if you translate the data into plain English, they are shouting.

The bottleneck isn't the code anymore. It’s the copper. It’s the transformers. It’s the sheer, raw wattage required to keep the simulation running. And right now? We don't have enough of it.

Adding Another India to a Grid That Can’t Handle It

Let’s look at the raw numbers, because they are wild.

S&P projects that by 2030, global data center power demand could hit 2,200 terawatt-hours (TWh).

It is easy to glaze over a number like that. We hear stats

[TITLE]Europe Locks In Endgame for Russian Gas And Oil:
[TEXT]
The European Union (E.U.) of 27 member countries will “never go back to our dangerous dependence on Russia”, said Dan Jørgensen, European Commissioner (E.C.) for Energy last week. “We will never go back to volatile supplies and market manipulation, and we will never go back to energy blackmail and economic exposure,” he added. This followed the full agreement on 3 December of the E.U.’s ‘REPowerEU Roadmap’, which E.C. President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted as enabling the continent to: “Enter the era of Europe’s full energy independence from Russia [as] Today, we are stopping these imports permanently.” She underlined: “By depleting [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

The agreement contains deadlines with serious implications for Russia’s economy. Most important of all are the bans on E.U. gas imports from Russia, which long provided huge income for the country and gave it great political leverage over Europe. All liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will end by 31 December 2026 and pipeline gas will cease by 30 September 2027. For short-term contracts concluded before 17 June 2025, the prohibition on Russian LNG applies from 25 April 2026 and for pipeline gas from 17 June 2026. For long-term LNG contracts concluded before 17 June 2025, the ban applies from 1 January 2027, in line with the 19th sanctions package. Pipeline gas imports under long-term contracts will only be allowed until 30 September 2027.

Strong safeguards against circumvention are included. Provisions to enhance the transparency, monitoring, and traceability of Russian gas within E.U. markets will support the implementation of the import ban. During the transition period, prior authorisation will require detailed information to ensure imports are limited to volumes based on historical contracts. To prevent Russian gas from entering through other countries, importers must provide information on the country of production. These anti-circumvention measures will be run in tandem with the E.U. Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, and the European Anti-Fraud Office. The same procedures will apply to E.U. imports of Russian oil – all of which will end by 2027.

This marks a remarkable turnaround from the situation in the early aftermath of Russia’s 24 February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. It was obvious to the U.S. and Great Britain that Moscow’s ability to fight the war over the long term would depend on its ability to finance it, and that a key source of this was revenue from Europe’s imports of gas and oil. Moreover, Washington and London believed that the E.U.’s unwillingness to impose meaningful sanctions on Russia when it invaded independent sovereign country Georgia in 2008 was instrumental in encouraging it to invade Ukraine in 2014 and annex its Crimea region, as fully analysed in my latest book on the new global oil market order. And they believed the E.U.’s failure to act again at this point in any meaningful way against Moscow at that point was instrumental in encouraging the full-blow invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Consequently, the U.S. and Great Britain knew they would need the support of Germany – the E.U.’s de facto economic and political leader. However, Germany had built much of its economic might since 1999 from cheap and abundant Russia energy supplies and from the effective devaluation of the mighty deutschmark to the softer euro. Germany had also long been opposed to what it regarded as interference from the U.S. in its affairs, exacerbated by Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013 of Washington spying on Germany. After that, Berlin had been at the forefront of several E.U. initiatives designed to circumvent the mainly US-led sanctions on Iran before 2018, specifically during the phase of heightened sanctions from 2011/2012. Shortly after the U.S. announcement of its withdrawal from the ‘nuclear deal’ deal in May 2018, Germany had been instrumental in influencing the E.U. to impose its ‘Blocking Statute’ that made it illegal for E.U. companies to follow US sanctions on Iran.

At around the same time, Germany’s then-Foreign Minister, Sigmar Gabriel, warned: “We also have to tell the Americans that their behaviour on the Iran issue will drive us Europeans into a common position with Russia and China against the USA.” Shortly after that, Germany was a key mover in the E.U.’s introduction of a special purpose vehicle – the ‘Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges’ – that would act as a clearing house for payments made between Iran and E.U. companies. It was little wonder, then, that Berlin’s primary concern after Russia’s 2022 Ukraine invasion was to ensure that it – and other E.U. countries – could meet the 31 March 2022 demand from President Putin that required E.U. buyers to pay in roubles for Russian gas via a new currency conversion mechanism or risk having supplies suspended. It was only after the U.S. managed to secure alternative interim supplies of gas that Germany was gradually brought onto the side of increasing sanctions on Russia, as also detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order.

Despite this early reticence to sanction Russia for its move westwards into Europe – which Washington and London believe is the prelude to the full ‘reunification’ of Russia’s former Soviet empire, as President Putin has alluded to – the E.U. has significantly stepped up its sanctions pressure on Russia in recent months, in line with the U.S. At the beginning of the Ukraine War, the E.U. was paying Russia over €12 billion a month for fossil fuel imports, according to E.U. data. This is now down to €1.5 billion. Its 19th sanctions package formally adopted on 23 October included additional measures targeting Russia’s shadow fleet of vessels used to evade current restrictions. And for the first time, the E.U. also targeted Russia’s crucial LNG sector. It also mirrored the U.S.’s earlier direct sanctions on Russia’s number one and number two oil firms – Rosneft and Lukoil. Between them, the two companies export approximately 3.1 million barrels of oil per day, which the West sees as vital to Russia’s ability to keep funding its war in Ukraine. Targeting Russia’s top two oil firms was a huge step up from what the previous sets of sanctions that encompassed lower-tier firms such as Gazpromneft and Surgutneftegas, which were in turn part of Washington’s gradual ‘tightening of the screws’ on Putin.

These latest sanctions from the E.U. in tandem with the U.S. have not only hit Russia’s finances harder than before, but they have also significantly diminished its ability to project power across the Middle East, which is seen by Washington and London as the crucial geopolitical region for energy supplies in future conflicts with Russia and China. Specifically, Lukoil almost immediately announced its withdrawal from Iraq’s huge West Qurna 2 oil field and Block 10 assets, marking a major turning point in the West’s fightback against increasingly aggressive Russia and Chinese moves against the allies in the country. Moreover, Lukoil’s exit from the major Iraq oil and gas sites opens new opportunities for Western firms to extend influence across Iraq. Rosneft then followed suit, announcing the downsizing of its operations in Iraq’s strategically crucial Kurdistan region, as also fully analysed in my latest book on the new global oil market order. The Russian oil giant reduced its stake in the Kurdistan Pipeline Company from the 60% it acquired in 2017 to 49%. The KPC is the key operator of the feeder pipeline network within the Iraqi Kurdistan region which connects oil fields (such as Taq Taq and Tawke) to the border metering station at Fishkhabur. At Fishkhabur, the pipeline links up with the main Iraq-Turkey Pipeline system.

The E.U.’s latest sanctions against Russia also now include the targeting of entities connected to its key superpower supporter, China, which also remains a major buyer of its energy. The 19th package of sanctions against Russia stated that: “We propose further measures on Chinese actors supporting Russia’s military industry.” It added: “These new sanctions will also squeeze Russia’s access to technologies including AI [artificial intelligence] and geospatial data, as well as critical resources that feed weapons production [...] This includes those received from foreign suppliers including China [and India].” E.C. President von der Leyen also stated in the accompanying press conference to the Package announcement that: “We target refineries, oil traders, petrochemical companies in third countries, including China.” At the same time, E.U. foreign policy head Kaja Kallas, posted on social media that: “We’re adding more chemicals, metal components, salts, and ores to our export bans and tighter export controls on entities from Russia as well as China [and India].” As a senior source in the E.U.’s security complex exclusively told OilPrice.com last week: “We and Washington said we’d keep tightening the screws on Putin and that’s what we’ve done.”

And they believed the E.U.’s failure to act again at this point in any meaningful way against Moscow at that point was instrumental in encouraging the full-blow invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Consequently, the U.S. and Great Britain knew they would need the support of Germany – the E.U.’s de facto economic and political leader. However, Germany had built much of its economic might since 1999 from cheap and abundant Russia energy supplies and from the effective devaluation of the mighty deutschmark to the softer euro. Germany had also long been opposed to what it regarded as interference from the U.S. in its affairs, exacerbated by Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013 of Washington spying on Germany. After that, Berlin had been at the forefront of several E.U. initiatives designed to circumvent the mainly US-led sanctions on Iran before 2018, specifically during the phase of heightened sanctions from 2011/2012. Shortly after the U.S. announcement of its withdrawal from the ‘nuclear deal’ deal in May 2018, Germany had been instrumental in influencing the E.U. to impose its ‘Blocking Statute’ that made it illegal for E.U. companies to follow US sanctions on Iran.

At around the same time, Germany’s then-Foreign Minister, Sigmar Gabriel, warned: “We also have to tell the Americans that their behaviour on the Iran issue will drive us Europeans into a common position with Russia and China against the USA.” Shortly after that, Germany was a key mover in the E.U.’s introduction of a special purpose vehicle – the ‘Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges’ – that would act as a clearing house for payments made between Iran and E.U. companies. It was little wonder, then, that Berlin’s primary concern after Russia’s 2022 Ukraine invasion was to ensure that it – and other E.U. countries – could meet the 31 March 2022 demand from President Putin that required E.U. buyers to pay in roubles for Russian gas via a new currency conversion mechanism or risk having supplies suspended. It was only after the U.S. managed to secure alternative interim supplies of gas that Germany was gradually brought onto the side of increasing sanctions on Russia, as also detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order.

Despite this early reticence to sanction Russia for its move westwards into Europe – which Washington and London believe is the prelude to the full ‘reunification’ of Russia’s former Soviet empire, as President Putin has alluded to – the E.U. has significantly stepped up its sanctions pressure on Russia in recent months, in line with the U.S. At the beginning of the Ukraine War, the E.U. was paying Russia over €12 billion a month for fossil fuel imports, according to E.U. data. This is now down to €1.5 billion. Its 19th sanctions package formally adopted on 23 October included additional measures targeting Russia’s shadow fleet of vessels used to evade current restrictions. And for the first time, the E.U. also targeted Russia’s crucial LNG sector. It also mirrored the U.S.’s earlier direct sanctions on Russia’s number one and number two oil firms – Rosneft and Lukoil. Between them, the two companies export approximately 3.1 million barrels of oil per day, which the West sees as vital to Russia’s ability to keep funding its war in Ukraine. Targeting Russia’s top two oil firms was a huge step up from what the previous sets of sanctions that encompassed lower-tier firms such as Gazpromneft and Surgutneftegas, which were in turn part of Washington’s gradual ‘tightening of the screws’ on Putin.

These latest sanctions from the E.U. in tandem with the U.S. have not only hit Russia’s finances harder than before, but they have also significantly diminished its ability to project power across the Middle East, which is seen by Washington and London as the crucial geopolitical region for energy supplies in future conflicts with Russia and China. Specifically, Lukoil almost immediately announced its withdrawal from Iraq’s huge West Qurna 2 oil field and Block 10 assets, marking a major turning point in the West’s fightback against increasingly aggressive Russia and Chinese moves against the allies in the country. Moreover, Lukoil’s exit from the major Iraq oil and gas sites opens new opportunities for Western firms to extend influence across Iraq. Rosneft then followed suit, announcing the downsizing of its operations in Iraq’s strategically crucial Kurdistan region, as also fully analysed in my latest book on the new global oil market order. The Russian oil giant reduced its stake in the Kurdistan Pipeline Company from the 60% it acquired in 2017 to 49%. The KPC is the key operator of the feeder pipeline network within the Iraqi Kurdistan region which connects oil fields (such as Taq Taq and Tawke) to the border metering station at Fishkhabur. At Fishkhabur, the pipeline links up with the main Iraq-Turkey Pipeline system.

The E.U.’s latest sanctions against Russia also now include the targeting of entities connected to its key superpower supporter, China, which also remains a major buyer of its energy. The 19th package of sanctions against Russia stated that: “We propose further measures on Chinese actors supporting Russia’s military industry.” It added: “These new sanctions will also squeeze Russia’s access to technologies including AI [artificial intelligence] and geospatial data, as well as critical resources that feed weapons production [...] This includes those received from foreign suppliers including China [and India].” E.C. President von der Leyen also stated in the accompanying press conference to the Package announcement that: “We target refineries, oil traders, petrochemical companies in third countries, including China.” At the same time, E.U. foreign policy head Kaja Kallas, posted on social media that: “We’re adding more chemicals, metal components, salts, and ores to our export bans and tighter export controls on entities from Russia as well as China [and India].” As a senior source in the E.U.’s security complex exclusively told OilPrice.com last week: “We and Washington said we’d keep tightening the screws on Putin and that’s what we’ve done.”

[TITLE]Fuel, fear and falsehoods: Defending Europe and Ukraine from Russia’s hybrid energy war:
[TEXT]
In the fourth year of its war against Ukraine, Moscow continues to pummel the country’s infrastructure with missiles and drones, leaving thousands without electricity and heating. While these ‘terror attacks on the energy grid’, in the words of HR/VP Kaja Kallas, continue, the Kremlin is simultaneously waging its hybrid war on the EU: targeting critical infrastructure, launching drone incursions and conducting massive disinformation campaigns.

Moscow’s hybrid warfare is testing European resolve once again. While the EU has agreed to end all Russian gas imports by 2027, it continues to face a surge in energy and climate-related disinformation. In parallel with its support for ‘winterisation’ – the process of preparing critical infrastructure for severe winter conditions – and the defence of Kyiv’s energy grid, Europe must also fight back in the information space. It is essential for Europe to seize the narrative to protect its citizens from energy-linked disinformation.

The physical and hybrid context

Russia’s energy disinformation forms part of a broader strategy that weaponises the energy sector for both physical and hybrid attacks.

In Ukraine it has relentlessly and brutally targeted energy infrastructure and generation capacity. Since the start of the war and up until October 2025, Ukraine has lost around 50% of its generation capacity through destruction and occupation. Russia shows no sign of changing strategy with attacks in late November hitting targets including LNG tankers, energy generation facilities and substations in the vicinity of nuclear power stations.

These physical attacks against Ukraine exist in parallel to a broader hybrid war against the EU. Russia’s shadow fleet is increasingly used not only to transport oil but also to spy on and attack European energy infrastructure. On 6 October, Finnish authorities confronted the Scanlark, a Russian shadow fleet vessel which had been previously detained by German authorities for sending out drones to spy on a military base, as it anchored 3km away from the nuclear power station at Olkiluoto. When German authorities boarded it, the ship was found to have surveillance equipment onboard considered ‘atypical’ for such a ship. Such findings mirror those of the Eagle S, another shadow fleet vessel which severed a major electricity interconnector in December 2024, (although a Finnish court was unable to prove criminal intent) or the Boracay which was boarded by French authorities in October 2025 on suspicion of launching drones at military facilities.

Pipelines and propaganda: a long-term strategy

The weaponisation of energy and information has long been central to Russia’s hybrid warfare toolbox. Recently, gas prices have hit an 18 month low, and the question is no longer whether Russia will use energy as leverage but how material pressures on energy supply and prices will be reinforced through information manipulation and interference (FIMI). The challenge here is to anticipate and counter the narratives that will accompany these efforts. Unless policymakers and societies are prepared on both fronts, Europe is facing a new phase of hybrid confrontation in which energy disinformation is part of a broader strategy to destabilise democracies from within.

Implementing the clean energy transition, while simultaneously decoupling European energy systems from Russian gas by 2027, comes at a cost and some in the EU are resisting. Russia has been able to exploit these societal frictions with targeted disinformation campaigns: blaming EU governments’ policies for rising prices and natural hazards while fuelling climate scepticism and extremist movements. Recent examples across Europe illustrate how these dynamics play out.

The weaponisation of energy and information has long been central to Russia’s hybrid warfare toolbox.

When the Baltic states disconnected from the Russian energy grid in February 2025, Moscow’s disinformation campaigns sought to undermine confidence in the transition by claiming that desynchronisation would trigger shortages and soaring prices.

Similar tactics occurred in Poland and Czechia as they worked to build energy independence after Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Both countries moved to diversify supplies and the Kremlin sought to discredit these efforts by portraying them as harmful to the economy or the environment – while simultaneously carrying out cyberattacks on critical energy infrastructure. In Poland, disinformation targeted the cost and effectiveness of projects like the Baltic Pipe and LNG terminals. In Czechia, the government’s decision to stop importing nuclear fuel from Russia for the Temelín and Dukovany power stations prompted a Russian disinformation campaign casting doubt on new nuclear expansion and promoting the notion that reliance on Russian gas was unavoidable.

In Western Europe, Russian hostile state activity emerges as a key amplifier of energy and climate-related disinformation, especially during electoral periods, with Moscow’s proxies flooding social media with energy disinformation content aligning with far-right and anti-EU positions. These narratives claim that Germany’s energy transition will harm the country’s economy, criticise EU climate policy in France on the basis of false allegations, and have stoked climate scepticism in the Netherlands. This summer, after the EU adopted its 18th package of sanctions targeting Russian oil, Russian disinformation targeted the EU’s Green Deal.

At the EU’s borders, Moldova has served as a testing ground for Moscow’s playbook since 2022. Russia has exploited Chisinau’s energy dependence to fuel narratives that rising energy prices and the cost-of-living crisis stem from the country’s EU accession path.

Fighting back

The EU and its Member States should counter Russian energy-related disinformation with a dedicated, coordinated approach.

Firstly, on the operational level, by integrating strategic communications into resilience planning for key energy infrastructure. EU institutions and governments should work with energy authorities in Member States to invest in long-term strategic communications, notably through sustained pre-bunking campaigns that anticipate and neutralise common falsehoods about supply, price and dependency before they take hold in public debate. They should also leverage networks of fact-checkers – for example the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO) as proposed by the Commission under the Democracy Shield – to establish countermeasures that can rebut energy-related disinformation as soon as it emerges.

Secondly, on a strategic level, Member States should break decisively with Russian fossil exports and communicate this shift through a positive narrative. The myth of cheap Russian gas endures even while cheaper forms of energy are widely available. The strongest card the EU can play is to prove that energy independence, powered by an electrified economy and locally generated energy, is the most effective antidote to Russian interference in the energy system.

[TITLE]NNPC/Heirs Energies ends gas flaring at OML 17, seals deals with offtakers:
[TEXT]
The NNPC/Heirs Energies OML 17 Joint Venture on Tuesday signed Gas Flare Commercialisation Agreements under the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme and approved Non-NGFCP frameworks.

At the ceremony held in Lagos, the JV said the event marked a significant transition from regulatory approvals to structured commercial execution, enabling flare gas volumes across OML 17 to be captured and deployed for productive use, including power generation, industrial applications, cooking gas and compressed natural gas, in alignment with Nigeria’s gas development priorities and energy-transition objectives.

The agreements brought together Heirs Energies, as operator of the OML 17 Joint Venture, and approved flare gas offtakers under frameworks designed to eliminate routine flaring while converting previously wasted resources into economic value.

The offtakers are AUT Gas, Twems Energies, Gas & Power Infrastructure Development Limited (PCCD) and Africa Gas & Transport Company Limited.

Speaking at the ceremony, the Chief Upstream Investment Officer of NNPC Upstream Investment Management Services, Seyi Omotowa, representing NNPC Limited, described the milestone as a practical demonstration of Nigeria’s commitment to gas-based development.

“For us at NNPC Limited and NUIMS, flare gas commercialisation is not a compliance exercise; it is a strategic pathway to improving energy availability, deepening gas-based industrialisation and strengthening Nigeria’s position as a responsible energy producer. OML 17 has become a practical model of this vision, moving decisively from approval to delivery.”

He commended Heirs Energies for disciplined execution and investment, noting that the JV continues to set benchmarks for operational delivery and gas development within Nigeria’s upstream sector.

The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission Chief Executive, Gbenga Komolafe, who was represented at the ceremony by the Senior Manager, NUPRC, Mr Ojo Olalekan, reaffirmed the commission’s commitment to supporting the implementation of flare gas commercialisation projects and ensuring that operators and offtakers are enabled to deliver bankable, environmentally responsible gas-to-market solutions in line with the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.

“This ceremony demonstrates Heirs Energies’ commitment to eliminating routine gas flaring across OML 17 and aligns fully with the commission’s Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme and national energy and emission-reduction objectives,” he said.

Heirs Energies’ Chief Executive Officer, Osa Igiehon, noted that the agreements reflect the company’s broader gas-led strategy and brownfield excellence approach, focused on creating long-term value for Nigeria.

“Gas sits at the heart of Nigeria’s development journey. Through disciplined investment, partnership with regulators and credible offtakers, and a clear execution focus, we are converting waste into value, strengthening domestic energy supply and supporting responsible operations across OML 17,” he noted.

Igiehon added that the NGFCP and Non-NGFCP flare gas projects build on recent operational progress by the OML 17 Joint Venture, including a significant increase in gas delivery to the domestic market through brownfield interventions and infrastructure optimisation.

“The JV has also continued to deepen its host-community partnerships through targeted healthcare interventions, education support and skills-development programmes across its areas of operation.

“With the symbolic signing completed, the flare gas offtakers are expected to progress into full project implementation, working closely with the JV, regulators and communities to deliver commercial, environmental and social outcomes.

“The OML 17 NGFCP initiative reinforces Nigeria’s position as a gas-led economy, supporting domestic power generation, industrial growth and responsible resource development while advancing the country’s energy-transition objectives,” he stated.

[TITLE]Chinese Firms Pour $80B Into Global Clean-Tech:
[TEXT]
Chinese foreign investment in clean energy has jumped to $80 billion in the year to November 2025, with Trump’s aggressive trade tariffs prompting many countries to deepen energy ties with China. That’s good for a 60% annualized increase compared with a total of $100 billion spent over the previous two years with Beijing leveraging its dominance in energy transition technologies. China already was the global leader in sectors such as solar and wind energy as well as electric vehicles and EV batteries before the Trump administration withdrew federal support for clean energy projects.

“The clean-tech economy represents a flourishing form of South-South cooperation, where national development goals meet China’s techno-industrial might,” Caroline Wang, analyst at Australian-based think tank Climate Energy Finance (CEF) said in a report. “While the US sees China’s rise as a threat, many developing countries are inspired by its success and aim to emulate it.”

According to CEF, Southeast Asia is China’s top destination for clean energy investments, led by Indonesia and Malaysia. Major projects here include a $6 billion battery plant in Indonesia being jointly developed by Indonesia Battery, Aneka Tambang and China’s EV battery giant, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL).

The Middle East and North Africa are also seeing a surge in Chinese renewable energy investments as governments try to lower reliance on oil. Countries are offering diverse incentives in a bid to attract Chinese clean-tech investments, including competitive tax rates and fast-tracked project approvals. These projects are mainly focused on facilitating joint-venture projects with local partners, building local manufacturing capacity and boosting employment.

Interestingly, China’s clean energy sector is also doing brisk business with less developed economies even as the U.S. retreats from the clean energy race. In fact, 51% of China’s EV sales growth in the current year has come from nations outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Exports to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) surged 75% during the first eight months of 2025, while EV exports to Africa nearly tripled, led by Morocco and Nigeria with the West African nation recording a six-fold surge in purchases. Meanwhile, exports to the Middle East jumped 72% while sales to Latin America grew 11%. But it's not just electric vehicles. China exported 46 GW of solar PV equipment in August, more than Australia’s total installed capacity.

“China’s electrotech is becoming the basis of the new energy system, with continued cost reductions driving faster growth than ever, especially in emerging economies,” Ember analysts wrote.

And, it’s all being driven by a virtuous cycle of falling renewable energy prices, an economic phenomenon where increased adoption and production lead to lower costs, which in turn encourages more adoption and production, creating a self-sustaining downward spiral of prices and upward surge in deployment. This cycle is driven by technological advancements, economies of scale in manufacturing, increased competition, and more efficient installation and operation of renewable systems.

China’s value of green energy exports has actually declined by 47% in dollar terms since its March 2023 peak, with the country’s solar manufacturers currently embroiled in a vicious price war. Since 2020, China has seen dramatic price reductions in both solar panels and EV batteries, with solar module prices falling significantly. An average EV battery pack price in China dropped by

[TITLE]America’s LNG Boom Is About to Spike Your Power Bill:
[TEXT]
The US is the world’s largest exporter of LNG. And efforts are apace to further increase that export capacity. As the US exports LNG at an increasing rate, this implies good news and bad news. The good news is that gas producers and owners of gas liquefaction facilities will likely enjoy higher profitability in the years ahead. The bad news is that US residential and industrial consumers will be paying those higher prices for gas while also experiencing increased price volatility. Why? Because where or how commodity prices are set makes a huge difference. At present, in the US, our natural gas commodity prices are set (mostly) domestically. This means they are influenced mainly by local supply demand imbalances, taxes, regulation (which often decides what gets built), and infrastructure constraints like pipeline availability. Those are all things our industry leaders and local politicians influence, if not control. However, when commodity prices are set internationally, like oil, prices are no longer determined by the domestic concerns above. Instead, they are set by competitive global spot markets. And there’s the problem. The global market is often much bigger than domestic markets, meaning a buyer in Europe or Japan can now outbid its American counterpart for gas. And there’s often a hurricane, tsunami, or military skirmish somewhere in the world that can now temporarily spike prices adding increased volatility to the mix.

There is little disagreement that moving from a domestic to an international commodity gas market results in higher commodity prices and more volatility. More to the point, this is not a new idea. In 2018, Trump’s DoE issued a report on the implications of increased LNG exports and wrote the following: “On the negative side, producing incremental natural gas volumes to support natural gas exports will increase the marginal cost of supplying gas and therefore raise domestic natural gas prices in general.” The study further noted that more exports meant higher gas prices for households and industry. But the DoE authors did helpfully note that if gas consumers became stock investors and purchased shares of gas liquefaction companies, the gains on these securities would help offset some of the sting from higher prices. Yes, they really said this.

Related: Rosneft Oil Cargo Wanders for Weeks as Sanctions Mount

Our readers know why this is a potentially huge economic problem. We are in the middle of an electrification induced power plant build cycle, which includes lots of new gas fired power plants. Substantially raising the operating costs of new gas fired power generating units soon to come on line (via higher, globalized gas prices and more commodity gas price volatility) is not, as they say, on most people’s bingo cards. This could imply much higher future electricity costs than many are expecting. In the past, utility commissions have at least insulated utility companies from the adverse financial impact of commodity price spikes via so called fuel adjustment clauses. We think they will continue to do so, not least because it lowers corporate operating risks, which makes bond raters like Moody’s happy. This means all additional gas commodity costs will pass through directly to electricity consumers.

The economic downsides of a transition to a global gas commodity market are fairly simple to state: higher society-wide energy bills, adverse industry-wide impacts via higher level of operating costs, and relatedly, an adverse impact on corporate competitiveness. We’ve already started to see what appears to be some consumer electoral pushback in response to rapidly rising electricity prices. What makes this looming gas affordability problem different to us is that it is entirely self-inflicted. Our federal government has chosen to encourage further LNG exports (raising prices) while a rapid expansion of the domestic gas power generation fleet is also occurring. More profits for gas producers and higher prices for consumers. All we can say is that an issue like this has traditionally become political, increasing public scrutiny of utility finances with an eye toward lowering utility profitability.. As for obvious losers, consider the plight of consumers in deregulated states where the price of gas effectively sets all electricity prices (whether or not the electricity is generated by burning gas). For close to 30 years, deregulation has failed to reduce prices to consumers. Now it looks as if deregulation will raise prices for consumers thanks to a tighter gas market. Well, where there are losers, there are also winners, the obvious ones being all renewable forms of power generation and new nuclear, which will benefit from higher expected power prices.

[TITLE]Federal judge overturns Trump ban on wind energy projects:
[TEXT]
Federal judge overturns Trump ban on wind energy projects

States challenging the president’s January executive order win a battle in court

President Trump suffered a significant legal defeat on Monday, when a federal judge declared his sweeping ban on new wind energy projects unlawful, delivering a victory to environmental advocates and more than a dozen states that challenged the directive.

US District Judge Patti Saris ruled that the executive order signed by Trump in January was arbitrary, capricious and violated federal law. The decision strikes down a policy that effectively halted all federal approvals for wind farms across the country, both onshore and offshore, while the administration conducted what it called a necessary review of approval processes.

The ruling arrives less than a year after Trump signed the controversial order within hours of beginning his second term in office. That directive immediately froze dozens of clean energy projects in various stages of development, including massive offshore installations planned along the Eastern seaboard that represented billions of dollars in potential investment.

Wind projects caught in political crossfire

The executive order created immediate chaos within the renewable energy sector. Project developers warned that the freeze would eliminate thousands of jobs and force companies to abandon investments already years in the making. Several large offshore wind farms planned from Massachusetts through Maryland found themselves in limbo, unable to proceed with construction despite having secured necessary permits under the previous administration.

Trump justified the ban by claiming the government’s approval process for wind projects contained serious legal deficiencies that required immediate attention. His administration has since indicated in court documents that it may move to revoke permits already granted to several offshore wind developments.

The legal challenge brought by states and clean energy organizations argued that the president lacked authority to unilaterally suspend an entire category of energy projects without following proper administrative procedures. Judge Saris ultimately agreed with that assessment, finding the order exceeded presidential powers.

A broader war on renewable energy

The wind ban represents just one front in Trump’s campaign against renewable power sources. Since returning to office, the president has systematically worked to reverse climate policies established during the Biden administration, which had prioritized transitioning American electrical grids toward cleaner energy sources.

Trump has instead focused on bolstering traditional fuel industries, including coal, natural gas and nuclear power. His administration argues these conventional sources provide more reliable around the clock electricity, particularly important as data centers drive unprecedented growth in power demand nationwide.

The policy whipsaw has created uncertainty throughout the energy sector. Companies that invested heavily in wind and solar projects based on Biden era incentives now face an administration openly hostile to their business model. The dramatic shift has complicated long term planning for utilities, developers and investors alike.

Competing visions of energy future

White House officials defended the executive order even after Monday’s ruling, characterizing Biden administration renewable energy policies as providing unfair advantages to wind projects while burdening other energy sectors with excessive regulation. A spokesperson suggested offshore wind developments received preferential treatment that distorted the energy marketplace.

Environmental organizations celebrated the court decision as vindication for clean energy advocates. Groups that challenged the ban described the ruling as a win for consumers, workers, businesses and environmental protection efforts. They urged the administration to abandon what they characterized as illegal interference with renewable energy expansion.

The decision also carries implications for union workers whose jobs depend on wind project construction. Thousands of positions in manufacturing, installation and maintenance hung in the balance while the ban remained in effect.

What happens next

The administration must now decide whether to appeal Judge Saris’s ruling or allow wind project approvals to resume. Even if officials choose not to contest the decision, the months long freeze has already disrupted project timelines and potentially scared off investors wary of future policy reversals.

The case highlights the vulnerability of energy policy to political winds. Projects requiring years of planning and billions in capital face tremendous uncertainty when presidential administrations hold dramatically different views on which power sources deserve government support.

For now, wind energy proponents can claim a meaningful legal victory, though the broader political battle over America’s energy future remains far from resolved.

[TITLE]Where the Algo Meets the Asphalt:
[TEXT]
Geopolitically, the shift is marked by China's pivot from dominating solar panel manufacturing to cornering the green hydrogen market, and a return to "interventionist industrial strategy" in the West where governments are becoming energy shareholders.

The transition is forcing a move away from simple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) toward complex, flexible contracts and driving Big Tech to invest in on-site generation and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) to ensure reliability.

The rapid growth of AI is projected to push global data center power demand to 2,200 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2030, an "always-on" load that threatens to overwhelm the world's aging electrical grids.

There is the economy you see on the screen. And then there is the economy that runs the screen.

For the last few years, the screen has been winning.

We have been living in a "Zero Marginal Cost" fantasy…

We convinced ourselves that adding another million users to ChatGPT was free. That scaling a startup was just a matter of writing better code. That "The Cloud" was an infinite, weightless place where business happened by magic.

But today, S&P Global Energy dropped a bucket of ice water on that fever dream.

I’ve spent the morning reading through their new Horizons Top Trends 2026 forecast. It’s dense. It’s technical. It’s written in the polite, measured language of analysts who don't like to shout. But if you translate the data into plain English, they are shouting.

The bottleneck isn't the code anymore. It’s the copper. It’s the transformers. It’s the sheer, raw wattage required to keep the simulation running. And right now? We don't have enough of it.

Adding Another India to a Grid That Can’t Handle It

Let’s look at the raw numbers, because they are wild.

S&P projects that by 2030, global data center power demand could hit 2,200 terawatt-hours (TWh).

It is easy to glaze over a number like that. We hear stats

Federal judge overturns Trump ban on wind energy projects

States challenging the president’s January executive order win a battle in court

President Trump suffered a significant legal defeat on Monday, when a federal judge declared his sweeping ban on new wind energy projects unlawful, delivering a victory to environmental advocates and more than a dozen states that challenged the directive.

US District Judge Patti Saris ruled that the executive order signed by Trump in January was arbitrary, capricious and violated federal law. The decision strikes down a policy that effectively halted all federal approvals for wind farms across the country, both onshore and offshore, while the administration conducted what it called a necessary review of approval processes.

The ruling arrives less than a year after Trump signed the controversial order within hours of beginning his second term in office. That directive immediately froze dozens of clean energy projects in various stages of development, including massive offshore installations planned along the Eastern seaboard that represented billions of dollars in potential investment.

Wind projects caught in political crossfire

The executive order created immediate chaos within the renewable energy sector. Project developers warned that the freeze would eliminate thousands of jobs and force companies to abandon investments already years in the making. Several large offshore wind farms planned from Massachusetts through Maryland found themselves in limbo, unable to proceed with construction despite having secured necessary permits under the previous administration.

Trump justified the ban by claiming the government’s approval process for wind projects contained serious legal deficiencies that required immediate attention. His administration has since indicated in court documents that it may move to revoke permits already granted to several offshore wind developments.

The legal challenge brought by states and clean energy organizations argued that the president lacked authority to unilaterally suspend an entire category of energy projects without following proper administrative procedures. Judge Saris ultimately agreed with that assessment, finding the order exceeded presidential powers.

A broader war on renewable energy

The wind ban represents just one front in Trump’s campaign against renewable power sources. Since returning to office, the president has systematically worked to reverse climate policies established during the Biden administration, which had prioritized transitioning American electrical grids toward cleaner energy sources.

Trump has instead focused on bolstering traditional fuel industries, including coal, natural gas and nuclear power. His administration argues these conventional sources provide more reliable around the clock electricity, particularly important as data centers drive unprecedented growth in power demand nationwide.

The policy whipsaw has created uncertainty throughout the energy sector. Companies that invested heavily in wind and solar projects based on Biden era incentives now face an administration openly hostile to their business model. The dramatic shift has complicated long term planning for utilities, developers and investors alike.

Competing visions of energy future

White House officials defended the executive order even after Monday’s ruling, characterizing Biden administration renewable energy policies as providing unfair advantages to wind projects while burdening other energy sectors with excessive regulation. A spokesperson suggested offshore wind developments received preferential treatment that distorted the energy marketplace.

Environmental organizations celebrated the court decision as vindication for clean energy advocates. Groups that challenged the ban described the ruling as a win for consumers, workers, businesses and environmental protection efforts. They urged the administration to abandon what they characterized as illegal interference with renewable energy expansion.

The decision also carries implications for union workers whose jobs depend on wind project construction. Thousands of positions in manufacturing, installation and maintenance hung in the balance while the ban remained in effect.

What happens next

The administration must now decide whether to appeal Judge Saris’s ruling or allow wind project approvals to resume. Even if officials choose not to contest the decision, the months long freeze has already disrupted project timelines and potentially scared off investors wary of future policy reversals.

The case highlights the vulnerability of energy policy to political winds. Projects requiring years of planning and billions in capital face tremendous uncertainty when presidential administrations hold dramatically different views on which power sources deserve government support.

For now, wind energy proponents can claim a meaningful legal victory, though the broader political battle over America’s energy future remains far from resolved.

[TITLE]CPUC approves ‘first-ever’ statewide energy efficiency market transformation initiatives:
[TEXT]

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has unanimously approved the “first-ever” statewide energy efficiency Market Transformation Initiatives (MTIs) for California.

The MTIs, proposed by CalMTA (the California Market Transformation Administrator), are designed to work with manufacturers and market supply chains to accelerate market adoption energy-efficient products that will help realize the state’s goals on efficiency and decarbonization. CalMTA is a program of the CPUC and is administered by Resource Innovations, Inc.

The Decision authorizes CalMTA to immediately implement the Room Heat Pumps MTI, which CalMTA argues is projected to deliver $480 million in benefits to California ratepayers over the initiative’s lifetime. Those benefits include the value of energy savings, greenhouse gas reductions, and increased demand flexibility to help keep the electric grid healthy. The Room Heat Pumps MTI are meant to accelerate market adoption of a 120-Volt (V) plug-in room heat pump air conditioner. This emerging technology provides both heating and cooling for small single-family and multifamily households while avoiding some costly electrical upgrades. A $41 million budget was approved to fund this initiative over the next six years.

The CPUC also granted conditional approval for the Induction Cooking MTI, which seeks to accelerate market adoption of induction cooktops and ranges to provide a more efficient technology than traditional electric resistance and gas stoves. The effort includes bringing battery-enabled 120V stoves and cooktops to market to make induction cooking more accessible to California households. The conditional approval requires CalMTA to focus more on 120V plug-in products and resubmit via a Tier 2 Advice Letter in early 2026.

“These initiatives are designed to transform markets to drive long-term energy savings,” said CPUC Commissioner Matthew Baker. “The investment over the next six years will promote affordable room heat pump air conditioners and induction cooking ranges. They will remove barriers to electrification and improve access for Californians, especially those in disadvantaged communities.”

Together, the two MTIs target barriers to large-scale residential decarbonization that are “beyond the reach” of traditional energy efficiency programs, CalMTA argues.

“We are thrilled to begin delivering the benefits of market transformation to all Californians. These technologies include efficient products that are vital to home electrification, and the initiatives are intentionally designed to increase affordability and accessibility – especially for California’s environmental and social justice communities.” said Lynette Curthoys, VP Market Transformation at Resource Innovations.

The CalMTA team at Resource Innovations will seek third-party firms via a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement the Room Heat Pump MTI, which is expected to be in market by early 2026. Upon CPUC approval of the Tier 2 Advice Letter, CalMTA will issue an RFP for the Induction Cooking MTI later in 2026.
