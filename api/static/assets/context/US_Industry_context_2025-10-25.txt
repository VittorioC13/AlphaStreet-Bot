[TEXT]
Lyten announces it has completed the acquisition of Northvolt Dwa in Gdańsk, Poland, the largest Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) manufacturing facility in Europe.

Lyten is immediately restarting production and product development from Northvolt Dwa and targets sales before year end.

Lyten is on track to complete the acquisition of the remaining Northvolt assets in Sweden and German in the 4Q 2025.

SAN JOSE, Calif. & GDAŃSK, Poland — Lyten, the global leader in lithium-sulfur batteries and energy storage, announced this week that it has completed its acquisition of Northvolt Dwa in Gdańsk, Poland. Northvolt Dwa is a 25,000-square meter (270,000-square foot) battery energy storage system (BESS) manufacturing and R&D facility that was opened in 2023. The facility includes equipment to ramp up to 6 GWh of energy storage manufacturing capacity and the ability to expand to up to 12 GWh in the future.

The Northvolt Dwa acquisition accelerates Lyten’s entry in the rapidly growing BESS market. The Gdańsk location will serve as a major EU hub for Lyten’s BESS manufacturing and will export products to countries throughout the EU and across the world. Lyten intends to initiate the restart process immediately and to produce first commercial units off the line prior to year-end 2025.

“The Northvolt Dwa facility in Gdańsk is a world-class asset servicing the rapidly growing and strategically important BESS market. As demand for electricity continues its rise throughout the world to support AI and economic development, distributed energy storage will become increasingly critical,” said Dan Cook, Lyten CEO and Co-Founder. “We are seeing demand from across the world and are restarting production immediately to begin fulfilling orders before the end of the year.”

Lyten acquired Northvolt’s BESS product portfolio and intellectual property in the third quarter 2025. The first product to be produced at Northvolt Dwa is the Voltpack Mobile System (VMS). The 3rd generation family of modular BESS products is optimized for the rapidly growing commercial, industrial, and evolving data center markets.

Robert Chryc-Gawrychowski was recently announced as CEO of Lyten Poland and will lead operations at Northvolt Dwa. Robert was previously CEO of Northvolt Poland and led Northvolt’s efforts in Poland through the planning, construction, and startup of Northvolt Dwa.

Robert stated, “BESS is now a critical technology for energy security and economic development, and it is increasingly important that Europe is able to manufacture batteries locally. We are appreciative of the support of this acquisition by the Polish government at the city, provincial and national level and for their shared enthusiasm for Gdańsk as an important BESS hub for Europe.”

Andrzej Domański, Poland Minister of Finance and Economy, stated, “Lyten’s operations in Gdańsk are part of a broader process of developing advanced energy technologies in Poland and across Europe. International cooperation in this field supports knowledge transfer, innovation, and the growth of local industrial expertise. We support projects that contribute to building a sustainable and competitive economy.”

Aleksandra Dulkiewicz, President of Gdańsk, added, “For Gdańsk, Lyten’s activities represent an opportunity to collaborate on the creation of energy innovation centers. We see many opportunities for cooperation – from research and development partnerships with universities, through pilot projects, to other activities aligned with Gdańsk’s development strategy and national and regional economic specializations.

On August 7th, Lyten announced binding agreements to acquire all remaining Northvolt operations in Sweden, Poland, and Germany, with manufacturing assets totaling approximately $5 billion in book value. Close of the remaining Sweden and Germany acquisitions are expected to continue through the 4Q 2025.

[TITLE]Lianhe Sowell International Group Enters into a Non-binding Term Sheet Regarding $105 Million International Funding to Establish the First AI Robot Manufacturing and R&D Base in UAE:
[TEXT]
Global Strategy Enters New Phase via Setting Up Middle East Headquarters​​

Dubai, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lianhe Sowell International Group Ltd. (the “Company”, NASDAQ: LHSW) today announced that it has signed a $105 million financing non-binding frame agreement (the “Term Sheet”) with Excellent Capital Investments (ECI), a European infrastructure investment fund.

[TITLE]Navigating growth: How Latin American enterprises are adapting to a changing economic landscape:
[TEXT]

Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.

Growth across Latin America no longer follows traditional lines. It is shaped by volatility, technology, and the region’s evolving relationship with regulation and innovation. From Santiago to Guadalajara, leaders are reassessing what it means to expand responsibly in an economy that demands both agility and accountability.

In today’s Latin America, growth does not always mean scaling fast or chasing capital. Instead, it reflects a more profound shift toward sustainability, purpose, and inclusion. Companies across industries are adjusting their structures to respond to new realities: stricter regulations, accelerating digitization, fragile supply chains, and the global call for more equitable business models.

The shift is not isolated to one sector or country. It spans finance, logistics, technology, and creative industries, each responding to unique pressures with local solutions and global ambition. Investors and policymakers are watching closely as the region positions itself as both an innovation hub and a testing ground for sustainable capitalism. Economic resilience is no longer measured only by growth rates but by how well companies can withstand uncertainty while building trust among employees, customers, and communities. In this climate, adaptability has become Latin America’s most valuable export.

Enterprises from Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and beyond are adapting to these pressures. Drawing insights from finance, technology, logistics, retail, and the creative economy, leaders across the region are not just surviving disruption; they are applying it as a framework for long-term resilience.

Adaptive growth in regulated environments

Latin America’s financial and legal sectors operate under some of the world’s most complex regulatory systems. Yet instead of seeing regulation as a constraint, several firms are using it as a framework for innovation. This approach has led to a new era of creative compliance, where companies address bureaucratic challenges through transparency and trust. By aligning technical precision with ethical intent, these firms are providing examples of how responsible growth can function within tightly controlled environments.

Redesigning the financial architecture

At International Disruption, chief executive Brian Minutti has focused on turning compliance into a catalyst for efficiency. The firm integrates legal, regulatory, and fund-administration services into one cohesive platform. It’s a structure designed to simplify private-credit investment in a space traditionally burdened by bureaucracy.

The result is measurable. Processes that once spanned years now close within weeks, creating faster capital movement for pension funds, asset managers, and fintechs across Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. The model has also been extended to Panama and the United States, signaling a regional blueprint for lean financial operations.

Minutti’s strategy centers on disciplined simplicity. By aligning legal, compliance, operations, and administrative functions, his company minimizes redundancies while maintaining full regulatory clarity. The emphasis on people and teams that understand both technical rigor and cultural nuance has proven essential in managing expansion across borders, where trust remains a currency as valuable as cash flow.

Expanding access to capital

A similar philosophy guides Jorge Márquez, co-founder and managing partner of Inteligencia Capital, who has spent more than a decade building financial bridges for mid-sized enterprises. His firm champions small and medium-sized enterprises and non-bank financial intermediaries, sectors often sidelined by traditional lenders despite their economic significance.

Márquez introduced joint securitization mechanisms that allow multiple institutions to pool portfolios and share costs. This approach gives smaller entities access to capital markets on fairer terms, lowering the barriers that once excluded them from growth opportunities.

His work illustrates a critical principle for Latin American finance: innovation thrives when regulators, investors, and rating agencies collaborate rather than compete. By emphasizing credibility and transparency, Márquez reframes profitability as a product of shared trust. In doing so, Inteligencia Capital reinforces that sustainable growth depends on inclusion, the idea that when more players can participate, entire economies stabilize.

Together, International Disruption and Inteligencia Capital demonstrate how the region’s financial leaders are adapting to new pressures. Their strategies demonstrate that regulatory systems, often perceived as obstacles, can serve as levers for equitable development when combined with vision and technical precision.

Technology and operational change

If regulation defines the financial landscape, technology defines the future of every other industry in Latin America. Enterprises are moving beyond simple digital adoption toward structural transformation, where agility, decentralization, and co-creation shape how companies grow. As cloud computing, AI, and data-driven tools become more accessible, organizations are learning to integrate them not as isolated systems but as extensions of human potential. In doing so, they are proving that true digital maturity depends as much on culture as it does on code.

Collective technology consulting

In the technology consulting arena, Denis Genova San Juan, founder and chief executive of XalDigital, leads one of Mexico’s fastest-growing enterprise-technology firms. Established in 2017, the company approaches digital transformation as a collaborative process rather than a top-down service.

Genova’s teams begin every engagement by studying a client’s operational pain points before designing a single technical solution. This empathy-driven method, coupled with rigorous engineering, earned XalDigital recognition as Amazon Web Services’ first Premier Partner in Mexico. This credential underscores both scale and reliability.

Internally, the company operates through multidisciplinary “cells,” agile micro-teams that function like startups inside the organization. Each unit has autonomy to experiment, make decisions, and learn from rapid feedback loops. This structure enables XalDigital to sustain its entrepreneurial energy as it expands to over 200 employees across Latin America.

The company’s guiding approach links technological progress with human adaptability. XalDigital’s trajectory suggests that sustainable expansion relies on cultivating workplace cultures that value flexibility over hierarchy.

Software for a moving economy

That same philosophy extends to Jaime Calderón-Mátar, co-founder and chief executive of Nuvigant, an enterprise-software firm focused on operational intelligence. Nuvigant has developed integrated systems that help clients, from small manufacturers to hospitals, manage everything from accounting to logistics under one platform.

Calderón-Mátar’s approach emphasizes usability and speed. By embedding artificial intelligence tools into daily workflows, his company reduces hours-long processes to minutes, freeing organizations to focus on innovation rather than administration.

His leadership is marked by accessibility. Building genuine relationships with clients, he argues, transforms business exchanges into partnerships rooted in trust. Nuvigant’s flexible structure, shaped by his own experiences living and working across multiple countries, reinforces this principle: a company grows sustainably when it mirrors the diversity and mobility of the people it serves.

Together, XalDigital and Nuvigant highlight a regional shift from technology as infrastructure to technology as organizational identity. Latin American enterprises are not merely digitizing; they are restructuring operations to meet markets that move faster than regulation or tradition can accommodate.

Infrastructure, logistics, and regenerative models

Few sectors illustrate the balance between expansion and responsibility as clearly as infrastructure and logistics. In these fields, the pursuit of efficiency increasingly coexists with environmental awareness and regional integration. Across railways, mining, and transport, new business leaders are re-evaluating established models to ensure that economic progress supports, rather than strains, the ecosystems around it. The result is a more deliberate approach to infrastructure that values regeneration and education alongside construction and output.

Mining with a regenerative perspective

At Durango Corp, positions mining as a practice grounded in long-term stewardship rather than short-term extraction. His model combines geology, finance, and environmental science to create frameworks that generate value beyond production.

Berdegué’s professional background includes conservation projects in Africa, which informed his understanding of how resource management can support community stability. Applying those lessons to Latin America, he developed methodologies to assess success not only through production metrics but also by measuring social and environmental outcomes.

Durango Corp operates alongside related entities such as Pacifica Silver Corp and maintains advisory roles with international mining firms. Across these initiatives, Berdegué promotes transparency and accountability as integral components of profitability. In a region rich in minerals yet environmentally sensitive, this approach challenges traditional assumptions

Operating revenue was $673.5 million for the first nine months of 2025 compared with $733.3 million for the first nine months of 2024. Excluding fuel surcharges, operating revenue was $593.5 million for the 2025 period compared with $637.1 million for the 2024 period. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased to $80.0 million for the 2025 period from $96.1 million for the 2024 period.

Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Randolph L. Marten stated, “Our earnings have continued to be significantly pressured by the historic duration and depth of the freight market recession’s oversupply and weak demand -- and the cumulative impact of inflationary operating costs, unacceptable freight rate reductions and freight network disruptions. Our unique multifaceted business model’s value continued to be highlighted by the operating results of our dedicated and brokerage operations for the first nine months of this year and throughout last year.”

“We remain focused on minimizing the freight market’s impact with our emphasis on safe, premium service, data-driven operating efficiencies and cost controls. Our strong, debt-free balance sheet enhances our ability to continue investing in our technology and modern fleet and position our operations to capitalize on future profitable organic growth opportunities. We expect the current administration’s recent immigration enforcement efforts including stricter standards for non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses and increased enforcement of English Language Proficiency and B-1 visa regulations to positively impact such opportunities.”

“We also closed on the previously announced agreement to sell assets related to our intermodal business to Hub Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: HUBG), effective September 30, 2025. The transaction was structured as an asset sale of certain intermodal equipment, including over 1,200 refrigerated containers, and contracts to Hub Group, Inc. for $51.8 million in cash. This transaction clarifies our focus on investing in and positioning our core operations for future expansion.”

[TITLE]European aerospace groups reach framework deal on satellite merger, sources say:
[TEXT]
ROME/PARIS :European aerospace groups Leonardo, Airbus and Thales have reached a framework deal on a proposed merger of their satellite businesses, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Leonardo is scheduled to hold an extraordinary board meeting on Tuesday to discuss details of the deal, which is subject to board and regulatory approvals, one of the sources said.

Leonardo, Thales and Airbus declined to comment.

PROPOSED VENTURE AIMS TO COMPETE WITH ELON MUSK

Europe's largest satellite makers have been in talks for more than a year to create a new satellite manufacturing company to compete on a larger scale with rivals led by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which owns the highly successful Starlink service.

Reuters reported last month that the three groups had redoubled efforts to combine their satellite businesses into a roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.66 billion) joint venture modelled on the pan-European MBDA missiles business.

Code-named "Project Bromo," talks had hit a roadblock over the summer when the parties could not agree on governance and valuation, insiders said.

One of the sources said the talks, which involve dividing politically sensitive technology and jobs between France and Italy, had not been helped by the government crisis in Paris.

Problems have also included disputes over the politically sensitive share of work, according to French daily La Tribune.

ANTI-TRUST REVIEW

The key remaining hurdle, analysts say, will be getting past a competition review by the European Commission.

Previous attempts to merge satellite activities in the past decade foundered on anti-trust concerns and national rivalries.

But the dramatic rise of Musk's Starlink network and a shift in the market towards cheaper satellites have increased pressure on Europe to combine assets or be pushed out of the market.

The deal could take up to two years to implement and the initial umbrella deal is the first step, sources familiar with the matter said. Last week, Thales denied a report that a sought-after provisional deal had been reached at that time.

Europe's top satellite makers have long competed to build complex spacecraft in geostationary orbit but have been hit by the arrival of cheap tiny satellites in low Earth orbit.

The deal will combine loss-making satellite activities of Airbus with those of Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio - two ventures currently controlled by France's Thales and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.

Paris-based consultancy Novaspace says more than 43,000 satellites will launch over the next decade, representing a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services.
