[TITLE]Finovate Global South Africa: Acquisitions and Licensing Innovation in Banking:
[TEXT]
This week’s edition of Finovate Global looks at recent fintech headlines from South Africa.

Lesaka Technologies to Acquire Bank Zero

Lesaka Technologies, a fintech that provides low-cost financial services to underbanked South Africans, has secured approval from the Competition Commission to acquire Bank Zero. An app-only bank co-founded by Michael Jordaan in 2018 and publicly launched three years later, Bank Zero today has more than 40,000 funded accounts and deposits of more than $22 million. The financial institution offers personal and business banking solutions to both underbanked and tech-first customers.

Initially announced in July, the acquisition is valued at $60 million. The transaction consists of a combination of newly issued shares in Lesaka and up to $5 million in cash. Post-transaction, Jordaan will remain as Bank Zero’s chairman, and co-founder Yatin Narsai will continue to serve as CEO. Bank Zero’s entire management team will also remain in place.

Lesaka anticipates that the acquisition will fortify its balance sheet, enhance lending performance, and reduce the firm’s dependence on bank debt. The fintech suggested that the move could lower its gross debt by $57 million.

“The acquisition of Bank Zero is a transformative event in Lesaka’s journey, enabling us to better serve our consumers, merchants, and enterprise clients, by embedding a trusted, well-engineered neobank capability into our fintech platform,” Lesaka Chairman Ali Mazanderani said. “I am delighted to welcome the Bank Zero team to Lesaka as partners.”

Lesaka Technologies offers banking, lending, and insurance products to consumers and cash management, billpay, business funding, and card acquiring solutions to retail merchants in both the formal and informal sectors. Founded in 1997, the company is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa.

South African Retailer Explores New Banking Venture

One of South Africa’s largest discount retail groups may be getting into the banking business.

Pepkor Holdings operates more than 5,800 stores across a wide number of brands including PEP, Ackermans, and Tekkie Town. A subsidiary of Steinhoff International, Pepkor is reportedly looking to launch a new banking venture—informally referred to as “Pep Bank”—that will leverage the company’s market reach to offer zero-fee banking to millions of consumers with lower incomes. The company is said to be in conversation with Investec, seeking a partner to support the new bank’s regulatory, operational, and financial infrastructure.

There has been no public commentary from Pepkor on the initiative, and press reports assert that the talks are in “early stages.” Further, the launch of a new bank would require approvals from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and the National Credit Regulator, and no such engagement has been reported to date.

That said, the move could be a major expansion for Pepkor, which would benefit significantly from its relationship to its sizable—and largely underbanked—low-income customers. And leveraging the businesses’ nearly 6,000 retail outlets to offer those customers banking services geared toward their specific needs could give Pepkor’s new bank a strong start and make it an instant competitor to current providers.

Revolut applies for South African banking license

Speaking of launching banking operations in South Africa, Revolut announced that it has officially begun the process of securing a banking license in the country. The company has confirmed that it submitted a Section 12 application under the country’s Banks Act, the first step in becoming a licensed bank in South Africa. Revolut first signaled its intention to launch a bank in South Africa in September, highlighting the country as a “key growth market” with increasing rates of digital adoption and an openness to innovative financial products and services.

“Becoming a licensed bank will allow us to bring a full suite of products to the market and ensure we become the go-to financial app for millions of South Africans,” Revolut South Africa CEO Jacques Meyer said.

As a sign of the company’s growing engagement with the South African market, Revolut has appointed Dr. Gaby Magomola as Chairman of Revolut South Africa. A pioneer in the history of banking in South Africa, Dr. Magomola has served in senior executive roles at Citibank, Barclays Bank, First National Bank, and African Bank. He most recently served as Deputy Chairman of the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA).

“Dr. Magomola’s experience is invaluable as we deepen our commitment to the South African market,” Meyer said. “His strategic counsel will be critical in navigating the local regulatory environment, ensuring we build a locally relevant service that addresses the financial needs of all customers in South Africa.”

Revolut’s presence in South Africa would bring significant additional competition to the country’s digital bank industry, which consists of TymeBank, Discovery Bank, and Bank Zero, which has been acquired by Lesaka Technologies, as we noted in this week’s column. Already one of the largest digital banks in the world, Revolut has said its expansion in South Africa is part of the company’s goal to grow its customer base from 65 million to 100 million by 2027. Revolut also seeks to be active in 30 markets by 2030.

[TITLE]Inside Crocs marketing: What they do differently on social media (and why it works):
[TEXT]
If there’s any brand that understands the power of the comeback, it’s Crocs. Its most recognizable product—lightweight, perforated clogs—were a fashion staple in the early to mid-2000s. However, the fallout from the 2008 global recession paired with overproduction left the American footwear business in a precarious state.

But nearly 20 years later, Crocs has emerged stronger than ever.

With the help of a new executive team and a refreshed marketing strategy (including social media marketing), Crocs increased its annual global revenue from $1.2 billion in 2014 to $4.1 billion in 2024.

The number of Crocs stores worldwide also hit its highest point in seven years as of 2024, with a total of 390 stores. Although the United States has the highest proportion of Crocs storefronts, the brand has expanded globally, with most of its international retail shops in South Korea (95), China (51) and Japan (21).

Crocs’ revival is undeniably impressive, and its social strategy has been a driving force in its overall marketing success.

In this guide, we’ll break down Crocs’ approach to social media and what you can learn from it.

Crocs’ marketing strategy is embedded in their brand ethos

Although its style can be polarizing, Crocs is unapologetic

[TITLE]Research on the impact of User-Generated Content (UGC) in shaping the purchase behavior of environmentally friendly products and the moderatings role of brand reputation:
[TEXT]
Abstract This paper aims to explore the effect of User-Generated Content (UGC) on the purchasing behavior of environmentally friendly products at Hospitality and Food Service Industry in Vietnam, particularly in Ho Chi Minh City. A conceptual model has been developed based on literature reviews and empirical studies. Furthermore, the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method was employed to investigate the impact of UGC on the purchasing behavior of environmentally friendly products at Hospitality and Food Service Industry in Vietnam. The results confirm that environmental concerns, attitudes, and the intention to purchase green products are all positively and significantly influenced by UGC. Especially, the results validate that brand reputation plays a moderating role in the connections between UGC and environmental concern, UGC and environmental attitude, as well as the relationship between the intention to purchase environmentally friendly products and actual purchasing behavior.

Introduction Environmental concerns are increasingly becoming a global issue, prompting researchers to examine the role of individuals in promoting green consumption behavior and environmental protection [131]. User-Generated Content (UGC) plays a prominent role in spreading environmentally friendly consumption behaviors. UGC includes posts, product reviews, videos, and content shared on social media, created and disseminated by consumers, helping to raise awareness and promote green actions on a global scale [34,35]. [49] defined environmental concern as the degree of human understanding of environmental issues, support for efforts to address them, and the willingness to contribute to solutions. Thanks to the widespread dissemination of UGC, awareness and information on environmental issues are quickly shared, making it easier for consumers to access knowledge

[TITLE]The role of brand commitment and external information in urban consumers’ organic produce choices: Evidence from Japan and China:
[TEXT]
Abstract Although organic agriculture brands are growing globally, urban consumer uptake in East Asia remains modest. We examine how brand commitment and external certification information shape willingness to pay (WTP) for organic vegetables based on multiple-store memory model. Online surveys of adult urban consumers in Japan (n = 412) and China (n = 422) are followed by a choice experiment in which respondents are randomly assigned to external certification information. Using latent profile analysis, we segment consumers’ brand commitment into five groups and estimate conditional logit models of choice and WTP. Results show that higher brand commitment and external certification information increase WTP for organic cabbage and tomatoes. Among Chinese consumers, information does not significantly affect WTP for carrots, indicating product-specific value perceptions. In Japan, information

[TITLE]Sudeep Pharma IPO: Should you subscribe?:
[TEXT]
Sudeep Pharma, which manufactures excipients and speciality ingredients for pharma, food and nutrition industries, is coming with an IPO that is open till November 25. The company has reported a modest revenue growth of 8.2 per cent in FY23-25. Strong growth from specialty ingredients business offset the weak growth in pharma and food segment. The growth in high-margin segment has also elevated the margins, with PAT growth of 49 per cent in FY23-25.

The IPO prices the company at a premium valuation of 48 times FY25 earnings. At such valuation, the growth prospects are fully factored, including the expansion plans of the company. With little margin of safety in valuations, we recommend investors to skip the IPO. Investors should also monitor the promoter-pledged shares, which are contingent on offer-for-sale proceeds to be released. The IPO involves a fresh issue of ₹95 crore (with objective of capital expenditure) and an offer for sale (OFS) of ₹800 crore.

Segment drivers

Pharmaceutical, food and nutrition division accounted for 66 per cent of FY25 revenues. The segment manufactures mineral-based single ingredients such as calcium, zinc, iron, potassium, magnesium, sodium and copper, which also act as excipients. Excipients are added to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to support stability of the formulations.

The segment reported flat growth in FY23-25. A significant shareholder from Germany, who also accounted for a significant share of revenues, had sold shareholding in the company to the promoter. This occurred as Sudeep Pharma pursued specialty ingredients which differed from shareholder’s strategy. The loss of sales from the shareholder along with the weak prices in the segment (following high prices post-Covid) impacted the division. The company expects to return to growth in FY26 and is now operating sales offices in Europe to accomplish the same.

Specialty ingredients is the other segment, which the company started in FY22. The segment reported a strong 32 per cent CAGR in FY23-25 and now accounted for 33 per cent of FY25 revenues. The segment adds value to the pharma, food and nutrition segment output. The segment manufactures client-customised ingredients designed to improve functionality, stability and bio-availability. The company has developed proprietary technology to deliver the minerals or nutrients in encapsulate, granulate or deliver liposomal or in spray-dried format, as per client specifications. This also delivers delayed-release or extended-release route of administration for nutrient premixes. The ingredients are either sourced from the company or are sourced from third parties before undergoing the encapsulation, granulation or other processes. The technology, while prevalent in pharmaceuticals, is limited in nutrient and food additives sector especially in India, which should ensure high growth for the company.

Expansion plans

The company expects to double its capacity with the addition of a new facility, which is under construction in Nandesari, Gujarat (near its existing facilities). This will add capacity to the pharma, food and nutrition segment. The speciality ingredients segment is now operating at a third of its capacity and doesn’t need capex, as per the company. The project is expected to cost around ₹110 crore.

The company is also one of the largest producers of food-grade iron phosphate for infant nutrition. The fresh issue proceeds will be used for procuring machinery to expand the production of iron phosphate. Also, the company is venturing into battery-grade iron phosphate production, which is used to produce lithium ion-based batteries.

It also acquired Nutrition Supplies and Services, an Ireland-based infant nutrition manufacturer with an established European clientele, a proprietary technology of manufacturing and requisite approvals. This acquisition, at the cost of ₹135 crore, has a margin profile similar to Sudeep Pharma and should not be margin-dilutive. The consolidated subsidiaries performance is yet to be reflected in company financials as only a portion of sales was reflected in Q1FY26.

Financials, valuation

The company reported a near-doubling of EBITDA margins from 20.8 per cent to 37.8 per cent in FY25. The director remuneration, lowered from ₹46 crore to ₹3.5 crore in FY25, accounted for half of the improvement. The remaining improvement is from increasing share of speciality ingredient, which has an EBITDA margin profile higher than the company. This is reflected in gross margin improvement of 10 percentage points in the period as well. With speciality ingredient expected to continue a higher growth, the revenue share and EBITDA margin profile of the company is expected to increase.

The company has a manageable net debt to EBITDA profile of 0.4 times as on March 2025. The company plans to fund the expansion plans from internal accruals as well.

As mentioned, close to 90 per cent of the promoter shareholding was pledged. Contingent on OFS funds, the debt and pledge are expected to be released. This debt was raised by the promoters to buyback the shareholding from the German shareholder last year. The release of pledged shares following the listing is an important monitorable.

The company has strong growth prospects from speciality ingredients and expansion plans. The resumption of growth in the larger pharma, food and nutrition segment should be monitored in FY26.

[TITLE]DPZ Stock Price Prediction: Where Domino's Pizza Could Be by 2025, 2026, and 2030:
[TEXT]
Domino's long-term strategy remains compelling for those who believe in scalable, franchise-driven restaurant growth. The company's aim to reach 50,000 global stores provides a clear expansion pathway, particularly in international markets where new units continue to open at a rapid pace. More than 85 percent of U.S. revenue now comes from digital ordering, giving Domino's an efficiency edge and helping lift average order values. The franchise model also insulates the parent company from many operational risks while allowing it to generate stable, high-margin royalty and supply chain revenue.

Wall Street currently maintains a Buy rating on Domino's, with Benzinga reporting an average price target around 488 dollars . The most bullish target sits at 574 dollars , while the lowest is 340 dollars , reflecting a wide range of expectations driven by cost pressures and uneven demand trends.

This breakdown looks at DPZ's 2030 forecasts, current Wall Street sentiment and the forces behind both the bullish and bearish cases.

Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." Here’s how you can earn passive income with $100 .

Missed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel could be the next AI powerhouse — join 10,000+ early backers and invest now just $0.81 per share .

Domino's Pizza has leaned heavily on its massive delivery network, rapid store expansion and fast-growing digital ordering system, but investors should expect continued volatility as the company chases ambitious global targets in a challenging consumer environment. Rising food and labor costs, tightening household budgets and intensifying competition continue to shape the stock's risk–reward profile.

Analysts are saying that Domino's Pizza could decline by 2030, a bearish long-term outlook that has some investors questioning whether DPZ can maintain its dominance in a slowing pizza market. If you're bullish and want exposure anyway, SoFi lets you trade Domino's Pizza stock with zero commissions, and new users who fund their account can receive up to 1,000 dollars in stock . You can also earn a 1 percent bonus if you transfer your investments to SoFi and keep them there until December 31, 2025, giving investors a small kicker on top of potential returns.

Story continues

Meanwhile, Domino's management has shown strong discipline in controlling costs, adjusting pricing and protecting margins during periods of inflation — all while maintaining a long history of dividend increases, signaling healthy cash flow and consistent shareholder returns.

Bear Case

On the downside, Domino's valuation remains high relative to the broader restaurant sector, leaving it vulnerable if store growth slows or international demand softens. The pizza category as a whole has shown flat growth, meaning new gains require taking share from rivals — a process that increasingly depends on expensive promotions.

Rising ingredient and labor costs are adding pressure across the franchise network, and additional tariff-driven food basket inflation poses further challenges. Competition from third-party delivery platforms and aggressive rivals like Papa John's is also reducing Domino's pricing power. International performance remains a swing factor, heavily influenced by currency fluctuations and geopolitics.

DPZ Stock Price Prediction for 2025

Bullish: 424.45

Average: 403.64

Bearish: 391.65

CoinCodex expects DPZ to trade within a relatively stable channel in 2025, with moderate volatility and no decisive long-term shift. Cost management efforts and rising digital penetration may help steady the business, though technical indicators still reflect short-term bearish pressure.

DPZ Stock Price Prediction for 2026

Bullish: 412.19

Average: 290.8

Bearish: 231.16

The models widen substantially in 2026, pointing to dramatically higher uncertainty. Success depends heavily on the strength of international expansion — but a consumer downturn, slowing discretionary spending or rising costs could pull the stock sharply lower. This is a pivotal period for Domino's ability to defend margins and maintain its unit growth strategy.

DPZ Stock Price Prediction for 2030

Bullish: 304.17

Average: 221.56

Bearish: 176.6

By 2030, algorithmic forecasts point to a meaningful decline from current levels. This scenario assumes that Domino's competitive moat weakens, potentially due to rising delivery fees, changing consumer food preferences or disruption in the broader quick-service industry.

If competitors innovate faster or if delivery economics shift unfavorably, Domino's long-term expansion model could face heavy pressure. On the other hand, a successful push into new markets could soften potential downside.

Investment Considerations

Investors evaluating DPZ should focus on the durability of two core strengths: its franchise-based operating model and its digital ordering ecosystem. Domino's supply chain and royalty revenue structure allow the business to scale without the full financial burden carried by individual operators, but this also means franchisee health is critical. Rising food, labor and tariff-driven costs could slow new store openings or strain operators' profitability.

Strategic partnerships — including its integration with DoorDash — may improve reach, but they also introduce new fee structures that could weigh on margins. Persistent promotions across the industry suggest that customer acquisition may become more expensive, making it harder for Domino's to sustain past levels of high-margin growth.

At the same time, Domino's remains committed to shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks. Long-term investors should assess whether these capital allocation decisions are sustainable given rising costs and uneven unit economics.

The bearish long-term forecasts through 2030 add a layer of caution. Much of Domino's future success depends on whether it can hit its store expansion targets, maintain digital leadership and protect margins in a landscape being reshaped by delivery apps, commodity inflation and evolving consumer habits.

For now, DPZ remains a premium-valued stock with meaningful upside drivers — and equally meaningful risks — as it navigates the next stage of global expansion.

[TITLE]Trump claims California's $20 fast-food minimum wage hurts businesses. The truth is a lot more complicated:
[TEXT]

President Donald Trump on Monday said that California Gov. Gavin Newsom is "laying siege on the minimum wage." Trump's comments at the McDonald's Impact Summit likely referred to California's higher hourly pay floor for fast-food workers, which took effect a year and a half ago. However, data so far indicate the policy hasn't been the danger Trump described. Research shows that the state's fast-food worker turnover is down. Widespread closures haven't occurred, and restaurant chains are still opening locations in California. To be sure, the increased wages have put more pressure on restaurant chains and operators at a time when other costs are climbing and diners are eating out less frequently. Plus, consumers are paying more for their burgers, chicken tenders and fries as a result of the new pay floor. But after a protracted fight over whether higher pay for workers would harm restaurants, critics' worst fears have not come to pass. Fast-food workers in California at chains with more than 60 national locations started earning $20 an hour in April 2024, 25% more than the state's broader minimum wage of $16 an hour. The sectoral pay floor is part of larger law passed in California that also establishes a council that will recommend proposed industry standards to state agencies and carries the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually. Fast-food workers' big break only came after a compromise between the restaurant industry and unions that ended months of fighting between the two parties. The Service Employees International Union championed the legislation, saying it would improve workers' lives and help with industry turnover. Quick-service restaurants argued that they were being unfairly targeted and the wage hike would burden their businesses. "I firmly believe that everyone should be entitled to a fair wage. The issue that I and my colleagues in this industry have is that we, as an industry, were targeted," said Kerri Harper-Howie, who runs WEH Organization and its 25 McDonald's locations in Los Angeles County with her sister, Nicole Harper-Rawlins.. "If someone works at Macy's and they're making minimum wage, or they work at CVS ... They also should deserve that increase in wages." California hasn't supported a wider minimum-wage increase. Last November, just months after the fast-food pay floor went into effect, voters in the state struck down a ballot measure that would have raised the statewide minimum wage to $18 an hour. It reportedly was the first time in nearly three decades that voters shot down a statewide minimum wage hike on any state ballot. For now, other states have yet to follow California's lead, as the nation monitors the effects of the law and the restaurant industry continues to lobby against it.

A scramble for franchisees

Broadly, the restaurant industry struggles with razor-thin profit margins. Labor is typically the biggest cost, and operators often aim to keep it roughly 30% of their overall costs. The higher minimum wage has been yet another challenge for operators, on top of commodity inflation and weakness in consumer spending. "What we can say without a doubt is that it's really tough to operate any restaurant, any concept, any size, in California right now," said Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs for the National Restaurant Association, a major trade group that opposed the wage hike. For 17 months after the higher minimum wage went into effect, Harper-Howie's WEH Organization saw its same-store sales decline. The trend finally reversed in October, as McDonald's rounded the one-year anniversary of an E. coli outbreak that sent company-wide sales plunging by double-digits overnight. The burger chain more broadly has seen its U.S. performance struggle, although it reported same-store sales growth in the third quarter. "For a long period of time, we were just bleeding money," said Harper-Howie, who formed the California Alliance of Family Owned Businesses with fellow McDonald's franchisees to push back against the California legislation. Harper-Howie estimates that her restaurants passed along price increases of less than 10% to customers. Raising prices further would be difficult amid a pullback in dining across the restaurant industry, particularly from low-income consumers. Plus, she said other minimum-wage workers who frequent McDonald's didn't receive the same pay hike, which made the food "unaffordable for many." Harshraj Ghai, who operates more than 200 Burger King, Taco Bell and Popeyes locations across California and Oregon, has similarly raised menu prices by roughly 10% to 12% at California locations. That wasn't enough to offset the wage increases, Ghai said. To further mitigate the higher costs, Ghai has worked to cut labor hours by testing artificial intelligence to take drive-thru orders, using pre-cooked bacon for breakfast and adding automatic batter mixers. "The cost and maintenance of of these technologies starts to become a little bit better than it would to pay somebody to actually do it," he said. The wage hike was just one more rapidly increasing cost for franchisees to wrangle. For example, Harper-Howie said WEH's insurance costs have soared, on top of rising prices for beef and other key ingredients. The Los Angeles wildfires put more pressure on Harper-Howie's business. One of her locations was temporarily closed, but the bigger blow came from the shrinking traffic as fires raged across the county, displacing many residents and scaring off tourists. Trump's hardline immigration stance has been another issue. "Our employees are predominantly Latino, and they're terrified," Harper-Howie said. "That's all of our hourly workers, our general managers, our shift managers, our department managers, and supervisors — and it's our customers." Harper-Howie said that she hasn't had to close any restaurants yet, crediting WEH's decades in the McDonald's system after her parents joined the franchise in the 1980's. But that isn't the case for Ghai, who has had to shutter some unprofitable locations permanently. He said that he's shuttered roughly 10 California locations over the last year and half, and he anticipates shuttering another 12 over the next year or two. While closures are a typical part of a large-scale restaurant business, those closures are much steeper than normal for Ghai, he said. For comparison, Ghai operates only Taco Bell restaurants in Oregon, but those locations are "significantly more profitable" than those in California, he said. He hasn't had to close any of his Oregon Taco Bells, but he has closed at least three in California. Taco Bell broadly has outperformed the broader fast-food industry over the last year, helped by its value perception and strong brand equity. Meanwhile, Kennedy said some franchisors are choosing to refranchise their California restaurants, collecting franchising fees in place of the headaches of operating the locations themselves. Despite higher labor costs, California is still a desirable market for fast-food chains. The state added nearly 2,300 fast-food restaurants from the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That increase represents a 5% jump, faster than the rest of the country's growth of 2% and outpacing California's increase of 2% in the year-ago period, based on analysis by the California Fast Food Workers Union.

[TITLE]Trump’s Tariffs Don’t Help Workers. Labor Solidarity Across Borders Does.:
[TEXT]
Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The Trump administration’s sprawling new tariffs took effect in August, and U.S. consumers are starting to feel the heat. The president and his cabinet have said the tariffs will bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and put American workers first. But are these tariff policies a real solution to the “race to the bottom” that has undercut so many U.S. jobs? Nike, the world’s single largest athletic apparel and footwear brand and an iconic American company, is a prime example of how Trump’s tariffs will actually hurt workers in the U.S. and abroad.

Even with higher tariffs than those implemented, American workers cannot compete with the current wages in Nike’s global supply chain. Many garment workers make Nike products for below $1 per hour in South and Southeast Asia, where the brand’s production is concentrated. In the lead up to August, Nike and other U.S.-based garment giants showed little interest in onshoring jobs. Instead, Nike has already begun to pass the cost of tariffs onto working people in the U.S. by increasing prices for consumers, who already face an affordability crisis. Meanwhile, garment workers reported Nike supplier factories enforcing mandatory overtime and anticipating mass layoffs ahead of the tariffs coming into effect.

By targeting countries, rather than corporations, Trump deliberately misidentifies the culprits of the global “race to the bottom.” Global corporations like Nike have pursued profit at any cost, which has undercut American jobs and pushed countries around the world to compete for industry by offering their citizens’ labor to companies like Nike for the lowest possible price. These tariffs don’t change that. Instead, Trump’s tariffs follow the consistent model of his administration: use the authority of the United States government to empower corporations and billionaires. Trump’s tariffs will do nothing to prevent corporations like Nike from pursuing higher profits at the expense of workers at home and abroad.

Nike Profited From the COVID Crisis

Nike showed us its playbook on how to profit from crises during the COVID pandemic in 2020. When COVID began, clothing and footwear corporations canceled and paused orders to factories in their supply chains with no plan for the impact on the millions of workers, the vast majority women, who make their products. Garment workers in South and Southeast Asia saw their already low wages slashed, many facing months of layoff with no income and no safety net. Women workers reported eating one meal a day and taking on crippling debt. Meanwhile, Nike bounced right back and made record profits by 2021. From 2020 to 2021, Nike’s billionaire founder Phil Knight’s family grew its wealth by $20 billion. In 2022, Nike authorized a new $18 billion share buyback program, benefitting investors.

Garment workers never saw any of Nike’s pandemic-era profits returned to them, despite repeated demands by their unions. If Nike had returned the $18 billion it is spending on buybacks to workers instead, it could offer a $125 per month raise to every garment worker who makes Nike products for 10 years — doubling the wages of many and transforming the lives of a million families.

Nike’s greed is not limited to its supply chain workers in the Global South. The company has announced two rounds of U.S. staff layoffs since February to reduce labor costs. And just this month, it ended a pandemic-era “wellness week” for its workers in order to increase productivity.

The company is also hoarding profits at the cost of public benefits to working people in Oregon, where Nike is headquartered. The company struck a favorable state income tax deal in 2012 that locked in a low tax rate and has paid no federal income tax in the U.S. for years. In the aftermath of Nike’s success in lobbying for continued low state taxes — which are paid into Oregon’s General Fund, which provides two-thirds of education funding for Oregon public schools — Oregon public education faces a budget crisis that has worsened in recent years, putting at risk critical resources for students and leading to cuts in teachers’ jobs. The taxes that Nike should have paid could go a long way toward funding Oregon public school budgets and avoiding further cuts.

The COVID pandemic previewed how Nike is again poised to profit at the expense of working people from Oregon to Cambodia, as Trump’s tariffs bring a new industry disruption. But another way forward is brewing, and it’s not coming from the White House.

Workers Are Coming Together Across Borders

In the aftermath of Nike’s grotesque show of greed, thousands of unionized garment workers from across South and Southeast Asia have come together to demand wage increases and labor rights protections from Nike, organized by Asia Floor Wage Alliance and supported by Global Labor Justice. These workers have been educating each other and finding common cause with unions across the U.S., especially in Nike’s home state of Oregon, in an example of what’s possible when working people unite across borders to challenge corporate power.

A recent action in Beaverton, Oregon, might be a blueprint for the labor movement’s broader fight for a truly fair global economy. On May 28, three Indonesian union garment worker activists walked into Nike’s corporate headquarters. The brave worker activists, who represent tens of thousands of Asian garment workers, wanted to be seen and heard directly by the company’s top executives. They were joined by leaders from the Portland Association of Teachers and other allied unions angry over Nike’s contribution to the underfunding of public schools. Together they were kicked out but vowed to continue their fights together until Asian garment workers and Oregon teachers and students take back their share of the money Nike has hoarded.

The next day, the same garment worker activists held a protest with the Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation (GTFF) outside of Hayward Field track and field stadium at the University of Oregon. The $270 million renovation of Hayward Field in 2020 is one of many vanity projects funded by Nike founder Phil Knight at the University of Oregon, but one with particularly offensive timing — it was undertaken at the same moment hundreds of thousands of Nike supply chain workers lost their livelihoods without any support from the company.

GTFF pointed out how Knight’s massive donations, made possible through years of profiting from the work of underpaid garment workers, have reshaped the priorities of the public University of Oregon, where the union is fighting for decent conditions and a democratic voice. New buildings named for the Knight family have popped up throughout the University of Oregon campus in recent years even as the administration cuts jobs to address deficits. Moving forward, Nike supply chain workers and their allies in the labor movement in Oregon and across the United States are evaluating how they can take united action to hold Nike accountable for its role in both local and global inequality.

Beyond Oregon, the women garment workers leading the Fight the Heist campaign have found strong allies with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), a constituency organization within the AFL-CIO devoted to building women’s leadership in unions. CLUW and CWA’s Women’s Committee led nationally-coordinated protests outside of Nike stores and events last year. More recently, the CLUW chapter in New York City has been publicly calling on Nike board member Michelle Peluso, the Revlon CEO, to meet directly with women garment workers and their unions in Asia.

What is Meant by Gift Packaging?

Gift packaging is the procedure of presenting a gift attractively and thoughtfully, utilizing materials such as decorative paper, ribbons, boxes, and other embellishments. It goes beyond simple wrapping to make an experience, adding to the emotional impact and thus making the gift-giving more memorable. It is a growing industry boosted by increased consumer spending on gifts, the growth of e-commerce, and the need for personalized and sustainable alternatives.

The main drivers for gift packaging involve increased consumer spending on gifts and even a rise in celebrations, which boosts seasonal and recurring needs. Other key factors are the expansion of e-commerce, which needs secure and attractive shipping packaging, and even consumer demand for personalized, along with aesthetically pleasing options.

The corporate gifting sector is seeing investments in digital print lines and AI-driven recommendations, enabling personalized packaging at scale. Investments in sustainable materials: Private investment is fueling the development of new sustainable packaging materials, such as recycled cardboard and biodegradable options, to meet consumer demand and align with regulations.

What are the Latest Trends in the Gift Packaging Market?

Sustainability through Recycled and Biodegradable Materials

This is due to increased consumer requirements for eco-friendly alternatives, driven by growing environmental consciousness as well as a desire to reduce waste. Companies are accepting recycled and even biodegradable materials not only to meet these choices but also to enhance their brand image, comply with regulations, and achieve long-term cost savings via reduced waste and material use.

Thus, recycled materials and natural, fast-growing materials such as bamboo or FSC-accepted paper have a lower carbon footprint than virgin materials. Sustainable packaging decreases the usage of non-renewable resources and reduces the overall volume of materials needed.

What Potentiates the Growth of the Gift Packaging Market?

Increasing Emphasis on Aesthetics and Personalization

Consumers associate attractive, as well as high-quality packaging, with the quality and even thoughtfulness of the gift itself. Personalized elements, like names, custom messages, or unique designs, make the recipient feel valued and even understood, deepening the emotional connection between the giver as well as receiver and rising the perceived value of the gift.

Innovations such as digital printing, laser engraving, along AI-driven design platforms have made widespread customization more cost-effective and also accessible for both brands and consumers. This technology enables on-demand, intricate personalization, thus fueling market expansion.

Canola Oil Market Segmental Analysis

Product Analysis

The processed canola oil segment dominated the market in 2024, as linoleic acid is a kind of omega-3 fatty acid, which is frequently named as brain-building fuel, found in the unsaturated fats of cold-pressed canola oil. This fatty acid is more perfect for children and babies as it carries the capability to assist in constructing the pattern of the brain cells during early growth. An accurate and healthy balance of the linoleic acid and the omega-3 helps in regulating the mood and may lower issues like anxiety and depression.

The virgin canola oil segment is expected to rise fastest during the forecast period. Virgin canola oil is manufactured by the mechanical extraction of the seeds at lower temperatures, which generally are below 50 degrees Celsius, without the use of high heat or chemical solvents such as hexane.

This procedure is similar to how extra virgin olive oil is created. The cold-pressing procedure protects more of the naturally occurring antioxidants, such as beta-carotene and vitamin E, and the evergreen factors, which are lost during the high-heat updating for commercial canola oil.

Application Analysis

The food processing segment dominated the market in 2024, as canola oil is utilised in different sectors due to its different characteristics. In industrial uses, it is a main ingredient in biofuels, lubricants, and other environmentally friendly alternatives to petroleum-based products. Basically, it has less viscosity and chemical stability, which makes it perfect for biodiesel manufacturing, which contributes to sustainable energy solutions.

In the culinary industry, canola oil is widely used for its high smoke point, mild flavor, and heart-healthy combination. It is a prevalent selection for frying, baking, sauteing, and salad dressings. It is due to the nutritional profile and the texture, which contains omega-3 fatty acids and the low saturated fat content, as canola oil is a selected choice for the health-conscious users and the food producers.

The food service segment is expected to rise fastest during the forecast period. Canola oil is frequently chosen due to its neutral flavor, balanced fatty acid profile, and low saturated fat content. The vegetable oil, on the other hand, serves as a more reliable and versatile option. It's crucial to note that items which are being labelled as “vegetable oil” are a mixture of various plant oils and have soybean, canola, corn, and sunflower oil that are used in restaurants and cafes.

The temperature at which oil begins to smoke is perfect for the high-hat frying. The oils that have a smoke point, like the peanut and canola oil, are perfect for deep frying.

Distribution Analysis

The supermarket and hypermarket segment dominated the market in 2024, as in this space, canola oil is sold in liquid form in plastic bottles, dispensers, and cans of different sizes, which are frequently found among other prevalent cooking oils. It is a neutral-flavored oil, which is high in unsaturated oils and is available under several famous brands.

The canola oil is most commonly sold in the transparent plastic PET bottles that are shatter-resistant and lightweight. These are accessible in many standard sizes, such as 1 litre, 2 litres, and 5 litres.

The online segment is predicted to rise fastest during the forecast period.
