Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.

AI has rewritten the economics of company building, and therefore, the venture capital model that funded the last 20 years is no longer fit for the next 20. AI-native companies may be built more quickly, often with leaner teams and more efficient resource use, enabling them to pursue outcomes that historically required larger teams or longer timelines in traditional models. Brainworks Ventures, which officially announced its launch, was explicitly created for this new era.

The company recognizes that the traditional venture capital playbook that has guided Silicon Valley for the past 20 years is no longer effective. Brainworks Ventures’ initial fund will focus on AI applications, infrastructure, tooling, healthcare and life sciences, enterprise productivity, and education. Investment sizes will range from $250,000 to $2M, with a geographic focus on North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Brainworks aims to identify and support the best AI-native founders, wherever they are building.

What is Brainworks Ventures?

Brainworks Ventures is an AI-native venture capital fund investing in pre-seed, seed, and Series A companies that leverage artificial intelligence to solve global challenges. Operating as an AI-native fund with AI-powered operations, Brainworks partners with AI-native startups worldwide to build the next generation of technology companies. With deep expertise spanning AI research, company building, and venture investing across four continents, the Brainworks team brings valuable experience to the AI venture landscape.

Co-founded by Dr. Phillip Alvelda, who has been working in AI since 1987, Brainworks Ventures draws upon his immense experience and expertise. As he describes it, “I’ve watched every hype cycle, every ‘AI winter,’ every false dawn. I’ve built companies applying machine learning when computing didn’t exist to make it work and watched the same ideas succeed two decades later when infrastructure caught up. That pattern recognition, knowing when technology is genuinely ready versus when it’s still laboratory research, is what 37 years in the field teaches you.”

AI-focused vs. AI-native

The most common misunderstanding Brainworks Ventures had to overcome from the start was the conflating of “AI-focused” with “AI-native.” Most funds today are AI-focused, investing in AI companies but operating with 1990s processes.

Conversely, Brainworks Ventures is genuinely AI-native; they use artificial intelligence to automate deal flow, portfolio design, diligence, and operations internally. More than mere marketing language, it’s a clear structural differentiation for the company.

Brainworks Ventures highlights what they describe as a “new math,” suggesting that AI-native companies may reach meaningful milestones with significantly lower capital requirements and shorter development cycles than traditional startups.

A bright future

Moving forward, Brainworks Ventures is excited to spearhead further innovation with AI in the sector. In 5–7 years, success for the company would ideally see the validation of its overarching thesis. As Dr. Alvelda says, “If AI-native companies really do reach exits in four years instead of fourteen, with $6 million instead of $150 million, our portfolio should demonstrate that dramatically. We’ll know we’re right if 3–5 portfolio companies achieve DARPA-portfolio-scale outcomes. 92x isn’t the goal, but proving those multiples are possible at early stages is.”

Beyond returns, the team strives for Brainworks Ventures to become the fund AI founders think of first when building something genuinely ambitious.

: Tesla shares have staged an impressive comeback, turning what began as a challenging year for investors into a reason for celebration. After suffering a steep 36% drop in the first quarter, its worst stretch since 2022, Tesla stock has surged, closing at an all-time high of $489.88 on Tuesday, up 3.1% for the day and now 21% higher for the year, as per a report. The previous intraday high of $488.54 was reached nearly a year ago, and the last record closing price was $479.86, as reported by CNBC.The rally comes amid news that CEO Elon Musk said that the EV giant has been testing fully driverless Tesla vehicles in Austin, Texas, months after starting a pilot program with safety drivers. The automated driving systems being tested are not yet widely available, and safety questions remain. Still, investors are optimistic that the company may finally deliver on its long-promised robotaxi service through a software update.Tesla’s market capitalization has climbed to $1.63 trillion, making it the seventh-most valuable publicly traded company, just ahead of Broadcom and behind giants like Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, as per the CNBC report. Elon Musk’s personal net worth now stands at around $684 billion, surpassing Google co-founder Larry Page by more than $430 billion.ALSO READ: US stock market today ends mixed: Nasdaq gains but S&P 500, Dow fall for third day as November jobs report, oil price crash and AI selloff raise concerns Despite this recent surge, Tesla’s year has been a roller-coaster. Musk’s political activities, including his work with US president Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency and endorsements of far-right figures, fueled a consumer backlash that affected Tesla’s brand and sales.In the first quarter, Tesla reported a 13% drop in deliveries and a 20% decline in automotive revenue. The second quarter saw a partial recovery in stock price, but sales continued to lag, with auto revenue down 16%, as per the CNBC report.The second half of 2025 has been stronger. In October, Tesla posted a 12% rise in third-quarter revenue as buyers rushed to take advantage of a federal EV tax credit before it expired. The stock jumped 40% during the period.Business challenges remain. The loss of the federal tax credit, continued backlash against Musk, and increased competition from lower-cost EVs by companies like BYD, Xiaomi, and Volkswagen have weighed on sales. Tesla’s more affordable Model Y and Model 3 variants, introduced in October, have yet to boost US and European sales significantly, with Cox Automotive reporting that US sales fell in November to a four-year low, as per the CNBC report.ALSO READ: MIT professor shot dead at Brookline home: Who was Nuno Loureiro and what we know about the ongoing investigation Still, analysts remain bullish.

This Series L round would value the company at $134 billion, up 34% from its last session of funding during the summer, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Tuesday (Dec. 16).

Ali Ghodsi, Databricks’ co-founder and CEO, told the WSJ the company plans to use the new funding to invest in its core data-analytics products and AI software, while also letting its workers engage in secondary share sales.

The company, among the most valuable private firms in Silicon Valley, also plans to hire around 600 fresh college graduates in 2026, the CEO added, in addition to adding thousands of new jobs worldwide in Asia, Latin America and Europe. It also plans to hire AI researchers, who are typically paid top salaries, the WSJ added.

The report noted that Databricks has benefited from the AI boom, which relies partially on private corporate data to customize AI models. Databricks told the WSJ that its data-warehousing product, which can serve as an underlying data platform for AI services, surpassed a $1 billion revenue run rate at the end of October.

This year has seen Databricks ink deals with OpenAI and Anthropic to help sell AI services to business customers. Each of these partnerships are designed to push clients to develop AI agents, or independent bots that can carry out tasks on behalf of humans.

The company’s new funding round comes three months after Databricks’ Series K round, which valued it more than $100 billion, up from $62 billion at the start of the year.

In other AI news, PYMNTS wrote earlier this week about The General Intelligence Company of New York, a start up developing agent-based systems designed to take over large portions of company operations.

“The company’s name deliberately evokes Gilded Age ambition, and founder Andrew Pignanelli told PYMNTS that the reference was intentional,” that report said. “He said he views AI as foundational infrastructure for the next era of company-building, much as railroads and industrial capital reshaped the United States economy more than a century ago.”

The company started by working backward from “the one-person billion-dollar business,” as Pignanelli termed it.

“We started at the end, the actual one-person billion-dollar company, and worked our way back and we were like, ‘What can we do today?’” he said.

[TITLE]NVIDIA Extends Open HPC and AI Stack With SchedMD Acquisition and Nemotron 3:
[TEXT]
NVIDIA has announced two significant moves targeting high-performance computing and AI: the acquisition of SchedMD, the company behind the Slurm workload manager, and the launch of the Nemotron 3 family of open models, data, and tools for multi-agent AI. Together, these efforts reinforce NVIDIA’s position across HPC, generative AI, and enterprise AI infrastructure while maintaining a strong emphasis on open, vendor-neutral software.

Slurm and SchedMD: Strengthening Open, Vendor-Neutral HPC Scheduling

SchedMD is the primary developer of Slurm, one of the most widely deployed open-source workload managers for HPC and AI clusters. Slurm is used to queue, schedule, and allocate compute resources across large-scale clusters that run tightly coupled parallel workloads. As cluster sizes and model complexity increase, efficient scheduling becomes critical to maintain utilization and throughput.

Slurm’s footprint in HPC is substantial. It is used in more than half of the top 10 and top 100 systems on the TOP500 list, driven by its scalability, high throughput, and support for complex policy management. For AI workloads, Slurm has become a key component of the infrastructure used by foundation model developers and AI builders to orchestrate large-scale model training and inference on GPU-accelerated systems.

Following the acquisition, NVIDIA plans to continue developing and distributing Slurm as open-source, vendor-neutral software. The company states that Slurm will remain accessible to the broader HPC and AI community and will continue to support heterogeneous environments across a wide range of hardware and software platforms. NVIDIA has collaborated with SchedMD for more than a decade, and this formal acquisition is intended to accelerate that roadmap rather than represent a strategic pivot.

SchedMD leadership views the deal as validation of Slurm’s central role in HPC and AI. The company noted that NVIDIA’s expertise in accelerated computing should help advance Slurm to meet future AI and supercomputing requirements while preserving its open-source model and community engagement.

Customer Impact and Platform Support

For existing SchedMD customers, NVIDIA intends to maintain continuity in Slurm support, training, and development. Current Slurm deployments span cloud providers, manufacturers, AI companies, and research organizations across sectors such as autonomous driving, healthcare and life sciences, energy, financial services, government, and general manufacturing.

NVIDIA also expects to accelerate SchedMD’s access to new systems and architectures. For customers standardizing on NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform, this should translate into faster support for new GPU generations and system configurations. At the same time, NVIDIA reiterates that Slurm will continue to support a broad set of heterogeneous environments, enabling mixed-vendor clusters to adopt new Slurm capabilities without being locked into a single hardware stack.

The combined effort between NVIDIA and SchedMD is framed as part of a broader initiative to strengthen the open-source software ecosystem in HPC and AI, enabling innovation across industries and deployment scales.

Nemotron 3: Open MoE Models for Multi-Agent, Agentic AI

At the same time, NVIDIA has introduced the Nemotron 3 family, an open ecosystem of models, datasets, and libraries for building transparent and efficient agentic AI systems. As organizations move from single-model chatbots to more complex multi-agent architectures, they encounter challenges such as communication overhead among agents, context drift across long workflows, and escalating inference costs. There is also growing demand for transparency to enable understanding and trust in AI systems embedded in critical business processes.

Nemotron 3 targets these requirements with a hybrid latent mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture designed for multi-agent workloads at scale. The models are intended to support collaborative agent behavior, specialized skills, and efficient task routing while maintaining predictable performance and cost profiles.

Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, emphasized that open innovation is essential for AI advancement. He highlighted that Nemotron transforms cutting-edge AI into an accessible platform, enhancing transparency and efficiency to support the development of large-scale agentic systems.

National and regional AI initiatives across Europe, South Korea, and other regions are already considering Nemotron as a foundation for open, locally controlled AI development. Early adopters, including Accenture, Cadence, CrowdStrike, Cursor, Deloitte, Palantir, Perplexity, and others, are incorporating Nemotron models into workflows that span manufacturing, cybersecurity, software engineering, media, and communications.

Model Lineup: Nano, Super, and Ultra

Nemotron 3 consists of three main MoE model tiers, each targeted at different classes of workloads:

Nano is a small, approximately 30-billion-parameter model that activates up to 3 billion parameters per token for efficient inference. It is suitable for tasks lik e debugging, summarization, AI pipelines , and information retrieval, where low latency and cost are crucial. Its hybrid MoE design delivers up to 4x the token throughput of Nemotron 2 Nano and reduces reasoning costs by up to 60 percent, lowering overall inference costs . With a 1-million-token context window, Nemotron 3 Nano maintain s more state across long workflows, improving accuracy and connecting distant context. Independent benchmarks rank it among the most open and efficient models in its class , with top accuracy among peer s .

Super is a higher-accuracy reasoning model with roughly 100 billion parameters and up to 10 billion active parameters per token. It is designed for multi-agent applications in which many agents collaborate to achieve complex objectives under low-latency requirements. Super is suitable for scenarios where reasoning depth, tool usage, and coordination across agents need to scale without incurring the cost profile of the largest models.

Ultra is the top-tier model and functions as a large reasoning engine, with approximately 500 billion parameters and up to 50 billion active parameters per token. It is intended for the most demanding AI workflows, including deep research, strategic planning, and complex decision-support systems that require high-quality reasoning across very long contexts.

Nemotron 3 Super and Ultra are trained using NVIDIA’s 4-bit NVFP4 format on the Blackwell architecture. This training format significantly reduces memory footprint and improves training throughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to higher-precision formats. For enterprises and service providers, this can enable larger models to be trained on existing infrastructure or reduce the hardware footprint required for a given scale.

With this tiered family, developers can match model size and capabilities to specific workloads and cost targets, scaling from dozens to hundreds of agents while maintaining faster, more accurate long-term reasoning across complex, multi-step workflows.

Routing, Token Economics, and Hybrid Model Strategies

As multi-agent systems mature, many organizations are adopting hybrid model strategies. Frontier proprietary models are used for the most complex reasoning tasks, while efficient, customizable open models handle routine or domain-specialized workloads. Nemotron 3 is explicitly designed for this kind of routing-based architecture.

In a typical setup, an agent router analyzes tasks in real time. It dispatches them either to a fine-tuned Nemotron model, such as Nemotron 3 Ultra, or to a proprietary model when that provides unique value. This approach helps optimize token economics by reserving expensive frontier capacity for the most demanding cases and leveraging Nemotron for high-throughput, high-efficiency workloads.

Partners building AI assistants and agent platforms report that this routing strategy enables them to deliver greater responsiveness and better cost control while maintaining the flexibility to integrate different model providers and training strategy over time.

Open Data, Libraries, and Safety Tooling

Beyond the models themselves, NVIDIA is releasing a substantial set of open resources to support custom agent development:

Training and RL Datasets

NVIDIA is providing 3 trillion tokens of Nemotron datasets for pre-, post-, and reinforcement learning. These datasets include a wide range of examples involving reasoning, coding, and multi-step workflows that can be used to train or fine-tune domain-specific agents. The Nemotron Agentic Safety Dataset offers real-world telemetry data that teams can use to evaluate and enhance the safety of complex, autonomous systems.

NeMo Gym and NeMo RL

To simplify reinforcement learning and post-training, NVIDIA has released NeMo Gym and NeMo RL as open-source libraries. These provide training environments and post-training foundations aligned with Nemotron models, which can also be extended or adapted for other architectures. NeMo Evaluator is included to assess model safety and performance across a range of benchmarks and use cases.

All of these tools and datasets are available on GitHub and Hugging Face, enabling teams to integrate them into existing MLOps pipelines and training workflows. Ecosystem players like Prime Intellect and Unsloth are already integrating NeMo Gym training environments into their platforms to simplify reinforcement learning for enterprise users.

Nemotron 3 models are also compatible with popular inference and deployment frameworks, including LM Studio, llama.cpp, SGLang, and vLLM, which make it easier to conduct local experimentation and deploy to various environments.

Availability

Nemotron 3 Nano is available today through multiple distribution channels outlined below.

Model Hubs and Inference Providers: The Nemotron 3 Nano model is available on Hugging Face and through inference providers including Baseten, DeepInfra, Fireworks, FriendliAI, OpenRouter, and Together AI. These services give teams a fast path to evaluate the model and integrate it into existing applications.

Enterprise Platforms: Nemotron models are being integrated into enterprise AI and data platforms, including Couchbase, DataRobot, H2O.ai, JFrog, Lambda, and UiPath. This enables customers to embed Nemotron-powered capabilities directly into their data, orchestration, and automation stacks.

Public Cloud and NIM Microservices: For public cloud users, Nemotron 3 Nano will be available on AWS via Amazon Bedrock for serverless inference, and will also be available on Google Cloud, CoreWeave, Crusoe, Microsoft Foundry, Nebius, Nscale, and Yotta.

Nemotron 3 Nano is also offered as an NVIDIA NIM microservice for secure, scalable deployment on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure, giving enterprises more control over privacy, data locality, and performance.

Nemotron 3 Super and Ultra are expected to be available in the first half of 2026, giving organizations time to standardize on the Nano tier for early agentic use cases and plan future migrations to larger models as requirements grow.

[TITLE]Biren Technology's Hong Kong IPO gets green light as China's AI chip firms rush to list:
[TEXT]
Beijing has greenlit Biren Technology's initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong, as more Chinese artificial intelligence chip designers rush to go public amid heightened investor interest in these stocks.

Biren, which designs high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs), received regulatory approval to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange, according to a China Securities Regulatory Commission filing on Monday. This was expected to put the company on track to become the first GPU developer to go public in Hong Kong.

Co-founded by Wall Street veteran and entrepreneur Michael Zhang Wen in 2019, Biren planned to float

[TITLE]China AI chip firm Biren to launch Hong Kong IPO in coming weeks, sources say:
[TEXT]
BEIJING/HONG KONG, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Chinese AI chip startup Biren Technology aims to launch a Hong Kong initial public offering in the coming weeks, four sources with knowledge of ​the matter said.

The IPO could raise $300 million, local Chinese media reported. One of the sources ‌confirmed the number to Reuters.

The Shanghai-based company, along with other domestic rivals, is banking on rapid growth as China seeks to develop ‌domestic alternatives to U.S. semiconductors amid stringent export restrictions by Washington on advanced chips.

Biren could kick off the offering as early as this month and debut in January, said two of the sources.

According to a Monday notice from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), Biren plans to issue up to 372.5 million shares in Hong ⁠Kong and its shareholders will convert ‌873.3 million onshore shares into Hong Kong-listed stock.

The sources declined to be identified as the information was confidential. Biren did not respond to a Reuters query for ‍comment.

CHINA'S CHIP AMBITIONS

Beijing has prioritised building homegrown champions in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are critical for artificial intelligence development.

The planned IPO would follow successful offerings from industry peers Moore Threads and MetaX that were thousands of times oversubscribed.

Moore Threads' ​shares soared over 400% in its December 5 Shanghai debut.

Founded in 2019, Biren's co-founders include Zhang Wen, ‌formerly a president at leading AI face-recognition company SenseTime, and Jiao Guofang, who previously worked at Qualcomm and Huawei.

The company initially drew attention in 2022 when it unveiled a first batch of products, including its BR100 chip, which it claimed could match the performance of Nvidia's advanced H100 AI processor.

However, the company was added to the U.S. 'Entity List' in 2023, preventing it from using leading global foundry TSMC to ⁠manufacture its chips.

Biren was valued at approximately 14 billion yuan ($2 ​billion) prior to a funding round in the first half ​of 2025, when it raised

[TITLE]General Assembly Speakers Push to Close Digital Divides, Transform Promise of World Summit on Information Society into Real-World Gains for All:
[TEXT]
Ministers from around the world today underscored the role of the UN in creating a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented digital future as the General Assembly took stock of the implementation of commitments made at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).

The Summit is an evolving multi-stakeholder platform that addresses issues raised by information and communications technologies. It was first held in two phases, in Geneva in 2003 and in Tunis in 2005. The WSIS Forum is an annual multi-stakeholder event, and in 2025, it took the shape of the WSIS+20 High-Level Event, held in July in Geneva, Switzerland.

Solly Malatsi, Minister for Communications and Digital Technologies of South Africa, who chaired that event, said there was widespread support for the continuation of the WSIS architecture, “provided that the process and the way we work evolves with changing times”. “We must close the remaining digital divides”, address affordability, and equip people — especially women, youth, persons with disabilities and communities in the Global South — to participate meaningfully in the information society. WSIS has been a compass for his country’s digital journey. In 2005, fewer than 1 in 10 South Africans were online. Today, almost 8 in 10 are connected, 4G coverage is at 99 per cent “and more than a million kilometres of fibre knit our country together”. But 13 million South Africans are still offline.

Digital Divides as Development Divides

Many speakers from the Global South highlighted this disconnect — despite concerted efforts to adopt technology, it is challenging to keep pace. The representative of Lesotho highlighted the WSIS+20 outcome document’s focus on closing persistent digital divides, which is crucial for remote communities in landlocked least developed countries such as hers. Lesotho has achieved over 95 per cent mobile coverage across mountainous terrain; integrated non-geostationary orbit satellite services to extend high-speed broadband and is leveraging “its unique high-altitude location, natural quietness and cold climate to attract investments in energy and data centers”, she said. However, she expressed concern

[TITLE]Verizon partners with Array Digital Infrastructure for tower usage:
[TEXT]
Verizon Communications Inc. and Array Digital Infrastructure, Inc. have entered into a new strategic partnership through which the carrier will use Array’s national portfolio of 4,400 towers to enhance its 5G network.

The multi-year deal permits Verizon to co-locate on several new Array Digital Infrastructure sites over the next several years for an established — though undisclosed — price.

“This strategic partnership with Array is a key part of our network tower management strategy,” Phillip French, Verizon vice president of engineering, said in a prepared statement.

“It provides us with the nimbleness and flexibility to manage our network portfolio efficiently. The streamlined agreement allows for greater cost efficiency and, most importantly, accelerates our ability to deploy advanced wireless technologies to Verizon customers across the nation.”

“Our partnership with Verizon, particularly with this new agreement, creates great opportunities for both organizations,” said Array Digital Infrstructure President and CEO Anthony Carlson. “We’re pleased to continue growing Array and strengthening our position as one of the leading tower companies in the United States.”

Array Digital Infrastructure, formerly known as UScellular, was in the news recently after the purchase of some of its spectrum by AT&T was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

The $101.8 billion deal, first announced in early November 2024, was part of Array Digital Infrastructure’s effort to divest itself of licenses that were not included in the company’s acquisition by T-Mobile.

The FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau portrayed the deal as posing little risk and agreed that a significant upside potential exists. But the Rural Wireless Association (RWA) released a statement criticizing the FCC decision and a decision related to a different Verizon/Array Digital Infrastructure deal than the one announced today.

“These two staff level decisions, along with an expected decision allowing Verizon to acquire UScellular spectrum collectively, amount to the death of mobile wireless competition,” RWA outside counsel Carri Bennet said in the statement.

[TITLE]Anger at Corporate Power Is Everywhere:

It was a warm, late summer night, September 11, and hundreds of residents had packed the spacious chambers of City Hall in College Station, Texas, to collectively protest what has become a common occurrence in America: the corporate strip-mining of our resources, our communities, and our future.

Less than a week earlier, the city announced that it was considering selling 200 acres of city-owned land on the south end of town to a developer planning to build one of the largest commercial developments in the city’s history.

Data centers are notoriously bad neighbors; their massive banks of servers, generating the computational power needed to run generative AI or mine cryptocurrencies, require immense amounts of water and electricity to operate. Developers and city staff had struck the deal in back rooms without public input, and residents had just days to react to a plan that would, in effect, hand over much control of the city’s water and power to a privately run server farm.

So, on vanishingly short notice, residents packed the chamber. Nearly 80 folks spoke at the six-hour marathon meeting, the majority against what they saw as an unnecessary giveaway to a predatory developer, all for a scant 45 permanent jobs and a onetime, $30 million payout to city coffers. “I want the sale of property to do things that benefit me and my family and the community,” local resident Jeffrey Herron said at the hearing, according to local media. “It seems like this sale benefits a very few people. The timing was terrible. We only had four days to figure out a solution for this. We do not want this in our neighborhoods.” By the time the hearing ended after midnight, the city council had voted to kill the deal.

Scenes of public resistance like the one in College Station have played out in the halls of local governments around the country, where residents have organized to fight back against corporate invasions of their neighborhoods and communities. Resource-thirsty data centers, often backed by Amazon, Google, and other tech titans, have been a frequent target, for good reason. But pockets of people-led resistance have risen to fight Amazon warehouses, dollar stores, Live Nation concert venues, agriculture monopolies, private equity landlords and more—all outcroppings of what residents increasingly view as extractive corporate power that inflict real harms on communities and their resources.

The growing collective outcry against corporate control suggests there’s something far larger going on: Americans, fed up with decades of declining fortunes, have found a common and culpable enemy in the powerful companies that control so much of our lives and politics. While populism has been rising in America for years, this moment feels different. Resistance is happening everywhere, not just in liberal big cities or in communities known for their activism. The broad backlash against corporate power today bridges partisan lines and channels a philosophy that has been core to America since its founding. It is the worldview of anti-monopoly, brought to life in city halls and community hearings nationwide.

If we are to transform this growing movement against monopoly into real power, it must ascend to our electoral politics as a dominant and unifying governing philosophy—a worldview that once called the Democratic Party its home. Today it’s unclear whether the majority of the party is willing to again embrace freedom from corporate control as its guiding light. Whether it’s the obsession with the “abundance” framework or “national security moms,” party leadership seems set on ignoring or flatly rejecting the core thing Americans actually want and need: freedom from corporate abuse. Embracing anti-monopoly as a political lodestar would unleash the broad prosperity needed if we are to be a true democracy. Today a real, national movement against domination may be rising. And whether this blossoming but nascent anti-monopoly movement takes over the Democratic Party or lives on otherwise, it’s inevitable, and Democrats would be wise to use it as a light out of the darkness.

On September 2, a typically mundane meeting outside of Jonesboro, Arkansas between farmers and representatives for Senators Tom Cotton and John Boozman and Representative Rick Crawford turned into a makeshift rally against the corporatization and monopoly control of agriculture. More than 400 corn and rice growers lined up in a parking lot and sat in a meeting hall for hours in the middle of harvest season—a remarkable thing on its own—and demanded that the lawmakers do something to break the grip corporate monopolies and financiers held over their farms and livelihoods. When almost every part of the agriculture economy is under the control of a handful of corporations, as it is today, farmers’ struggles become systemic and inescapable, Bailey Buffalo from the Farm Protection Alliance told the Farm Journal after the meeting. “That’s where I believe we’re at in farming. We can’t climb out of this mess partly because we’re at the mercy of agriculture monopolies.”

From rural communities to the skyscraper-shaded streets of New York and Chicago, being bullied by unchecked corporate power has become the most common experience in America. It’s the thread that connects Americans of all walks of life and political persuasions. Family farmers have seen their livelihoods devastated under the control of some corporate conglomerate, be it Monsanto, JBS, Tysons, John Deere, or otherwise. Hundreds of thousands of good-paying, union factory jobs have been lost to a bad corporate merger or a move overseas. The families that once owned grocers, pharmacies, toy stores, and so on have been bled dry by the vampires of the retail economy, the Walmarts and Amazons, ConAgras and PepsiCos. Our pathways to prosperity are fewer and narrower than they’ve ever been.

Corporate power has likewise brutalized the physical spaces we inhabit. Small towns and cities that for generations were anchored by factories and the work they offered live on today as service-industry zombie towns, existing only on the meager wages offered by the local Amazon warehouse or chicken packing plant. Our downtowns and main streets, once filled with useful business that boosted the fortunes of the community, are now chock-full of dollar stores, salons, tattoo parlors, and sketchy head shops that are among the only businesses immune to the constant predation of Amazon and Walmart. Good jobs and useful businesses have been almost wholly replaced by nuisance, exploitation, and, in so many communities, the corporate grift of data center hyper-scaling.

[TITLE]Nvidia's Depreciation Time Bomb: Jim Chanos Warns Of 'Massive Financial Risk' For CoreWeave, Oracle:
[TEXT]

Legendary short-seller Jim Chanos is sounding the alarm on the AI infrastructure boom, warning that a critical accounting oversight regarding Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips creates a “massive financial risk” for the sector's aggressive spenders.

Depreciation Trap

In a recent podcast interview, Chanos argued that data center operators, specifically Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) and “neocloud” provider CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV), are overstating their future profitability by relying on unrealistic depreciation schedules for their artificial intelligence (AI) hardware.

The core of Chanos' bearish thesis is the estimated lifespan of the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering the AI revolution.

Don’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

While hyperscalers and neoclouds typically depreciate these expensive assets over six years, Chanos contends that the relentless pace of Nvidia's innovation renders them obsolete much faster.

He noted that rental rates for Nvidia's “Hopper” chips have already plummeted roughly 28% year-over-year as newer models enter the market. If the useful economic life of a chip is closer to three or four years rather than six, companies must drastically increase their annual depreciation expenses, which would crush reported earnings.

“If the chips last for three years, you have to depreciate a third of what you spend,” Chanos explained. “That's the bet you have to make if you're a CoreWeave investor.”

Benzinga reached out to Nvidia for comment on Chanos’ claims regarding GPU depreciation schedules and the useful life of its chips, but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Oracle's ‘Fundamental' Problem

Chanos singled out Oracle as the most vulnerable among the tech giants. He noted that, unlike Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Oracle is not currently earning its cost of capital on its massive AI investments.

He described the company's aggressive spending spree as a “bet the company” strategy that leaves little room for error.

“If AI monetization gets pushed out... to 2030 or whenever, then Oracle will have fundamental financial problems,” Chanos warned.

Worse Than 1999

The investor views the current cycle as potentially riskier than the Dotcom bubble. In the late 1990s, the companies buying telecom equipment were profitable giants like General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T).

[TITLE]Welcome to AI-native VC: A $50M fund claims it can do what used to take $500M:
[TEXT]

Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.

AI has rewritten the economics of company building, and therefore, the venture capital model that funded the last 20 years is no longer fit for the next 20. AI-native companies may be built more quickly, often with leaner teams and more efficient resource use, enabling them to pursue outcomes that historically required larger teams or longer timelines in traditional models. Brainworks Ventures, which officially announced its launch, was explicitly created for this new era.

The company recognizes that the traditional venture capital playbook that has guided Silicon Valley for the past 20 years is no longer effective. Brainworks Ventures’ initial fund will focus on AI applications, infrastructure, tooling, healthcare and life sciences, enterprise productivity, and education. Investment sizes will range from $250,000 to $2M, with a geographic focus on North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Brainworks aims to identify and support the best AI-native founders, wherever they are building.

What is Brainworks Ventures?

Brainworks Ventures is an AI-native venture capital fund investing in pre-seed, seed, and Series A companies that leverage artificial intelligence to solve global challenges. Operating as an AI-native fund with AI-powered operations, Brainworks partners with AI-native startups worldwide to build the next generation of technology companies. With deep expertise spanning AI research, company building, and venture investing across four continents, the Brainworks team brings valuable experience to the AI venture landscape.

Co-founded by Dr. Phillip Alvelda, who has been working in AI since 1987, Brainworks Ventures draws upon his immense experience and expertise. As he describes it, “I’ve watched every hype cycle, every ‘AI winter,’ every false dawn. I’ve built companies applying machine learning when computing didn’t exist to make it work and watched the same ideas succeed two decades later when infrastructure caught up. That pattern recognition, knowing when technology is genuinely ready versus when it’s still laboratory research, is what 37 years in the field teaches you.”

AI-focused vs. AI-native

The most common misunderstanding Brainworks Ventures had to overcome from the start was the conflating of “AI-focused” with “AI-native.” Most funds today are AI-focused, investing in AI companies but operating with 1990s processes.

Conversely, Brainworks Ventures is genuinely AI-native; they use artificial intelligence to automate deal flow, portfolio design, diligence, and operations internally. More than mere marketing language, it’s a clear structural differentiation for the company.

Brainworks Ventures highlights what they describe as a “new math,” suggesting that AI-native companies may reach meaningful milestones with significantly lower capital requirements and shorter development cycles than traditional startups.

A bright future

Moving forward, Brainworks Ventures is excited to spearhead further innovation with AI in the sector. In 5–7 years, success for the company would ideally see the validation of its overarching thesis. As Dr. Alvelda says, “If AI-native companies really do reach exits in four years instead of fourteen, with $6 million instead of $150 million, our portfolio should demonstrate that dramatically. We’ll know we’re right if 3–5 portfolio companies achieve DARPA-portfolio-scale outcomes. 92x isn’t the goal, but proving those multiples are possible at early stages is.”

Beyond returns, the team strives for Brainworks Ventures to become the fund AI founders think of first when building something genuinely ambitious.

[TITLE]Databricks Targets $134 Billion Valuation in New Funding Round:
[TEXT]
Data analytics/artificial intelligence (AI) firm Databricks is reportedly raising $4 billion in a new funding round.

This Series L round would value the company at $134 billion, up 34% from its last session of funding during the summer, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Tuesday (Dec. 16).

Ali Ghodsi, Databricks’ co-founder and CEO, told the WSJ the company plans to use the new funding to invest in its core data-analytics products and AI software, while also letting its workers engage in secondary share sales.

The company, among the most valuable private firms in Silicon Valley, also plans to hire around 600 fresh college graduates in 2026, the CEO added, in addition to adding thousands of new jobs worldwide in Asia, Latin America and Europe. It also plans to hire AI researchers, who are typically paid top salaries, the WSJ added.

The report noted that Databricks has benefited from the AI boom, which relies partially on private corporate data to customize AI models. Databricks told the WSJ that its data-warehousing product, which can serve as an underlying data platform for AI services, surpassed a $1 billion revenue run rate at the end of October.

This year has seen Databricks ink deals with OpenAI and Anthropic to help sell AI services to business customers. Each of these partnerships are designed to push clients to develop AI agents, or independent bots that can carry out tasks on behalf of humans.

The company’s new funding round comes three months after Databricks’ Series K round, which valued it more than $100 billion, up from $62 billion at the start of the year.

In other AI news, PYMNTS wrote earlier this week about The General Intelligence Company of New York, a start up developing agent-based systems designed to take over large portions of company operations.

“The company’s name deliberately evokes Gilded Age ambition, and founder Andrew Pignanelli told PYMNTS that the reference was intentional,” that report said. “He said he views AI as foundational infrastructure for the next era of company-building, much as railroads and industrial capital reshaped the United States economy more than a century ago.”

The company started by working backward from “the one-person billion-dollar business,” as Pignanelli termed it.

“We started at the end, the actual one-person billion-dollar company, and worked our way back and we were like, ‘What can we do today?’” he said.
