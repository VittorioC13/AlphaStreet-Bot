Overview

Solid Group Q3 performance with AMPs +9% and revenue +17% year-over-year reflecting the benefit of Snai and Betnacional acquisitions ("M&A"), combined with excellent organic iGaming growth which offset the impact of customer-friendly sports results

US: Revenue +9% year-over-year led by strong, product-driven iGaming revenue growth of 44% Sportsbook AMP growth accelerated to 5% (Q2: -4%). Sportsbook revenue was -5% year-over-year due to the temporary impacts of sports results, and very high levels of uneconomic generosity from sportsbook competitors at NFL season start, leading to Q3 Adjusted EBITDA of $51m, -12% year-over-year In response, increased FanDuel investment during Q4 has been effective, with year-over-year handle growth +10% Q4 to date, and the NBA season off to a strong start FanDuel Predicts, a new prediction market product which will include sports in states without access to regulated sports betting, to launch in December. Capitalizing on FanDuel's strong brand presence and CME Group's exchange capabilities, with strategic investment to expand the FanDuel customer ecosystem

International: Revenue +21% and adjusted EBITDA of $505m, +10% year-over-year including the benefit of M&A Organic iGaming revenue +10%, with strong SEA iGaming growth offsetting the impact of previously announced regulatory changes in India 3 Organic Sportsbook revenue -6% due to the impacts of a strong European Football Championships ("Euros") and bookmaker friendly results in the prior year

Group Q3 adjusted EBITDA grew 6% and adjusted EBITDA margin declined 130bps, driven by the factors detailed above. This, combined with the benefit of non-controlling interest credits, contributed to adjusted earnings per share +29% to $1.64

Group Q3 net loss of $789m was $675m higher year-over-year due to the non-cash impairment charge of $556m triggered by Indian regulation changes 3 , and the previously communicated $205m payment to Boyd to revise US market access terms 4 ("Boyd payment"). As a result, net loss margin and loss per share were 20.8% and $3.91 respectively

, and the previously communicated $205m payment to Boyd to revise US market access terms ("Boyd payment"). As a result, net loss margin and loss per share were 20.8% and $3.91 respectively Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in Q3 declined by 28% and 78% respectively, due to the Boyd payment

Updated full year 2025 guidance

Q4 has started well on an underlying basis. In the US, FanDuel's increased customer acquisition and retention investment in Q4 is proving effective with continued player momentum and year-over-year handle growth stepping up to 10% quarter to date with the NBA season off to a strong start. Sports results, however, have been customer friendly across the Group with an adjusted EBITDA impact of approximately $170m from October 1, through November 9, 20256.

2025 outlook5 is therefore primarily updated to include the impact of: (i) Q3 performance, (ii) Q4 sports results6, (iii) Q4 sportsbook investment, (iv) FanDuel Predicts investment7, (v) tax costs associated with the Illinois wager fee which we are now treating as taxable, and (vi) Indian regulatory change

Group revenue is now expected to be $16.69bn with adjusted EBITDA of $2.915bn at the midpoint. This reflects a reduction from previous guidance of $570m and $380m in revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations respectively, with updated guidance now representing 19% and 24% year-over-year growth.

Peter Jackson, CEO, commented:

"Flutter delivered a solid third quarter, with continued momentum in both our US and International businesses. We are the clear number one operator in the US, and we will continue to build on that position to drive future profitability. Our strategic investments, including the launch of FanDuel Predicts and recent International acquisitions, position us exceptionally well to capture new opportunities and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Our diversified portfolio and disciplined approach give me great confidence in our ability to lead the industry and increase long-term value for shareholders.”

To our shareholders

Flutter delivered a solid Q3 performance with AMP growth of 9%, revenue increasing 17% and adjusted EBITDA 6% ahead year-over-year. These results reflect the positive impact of our recent Snai and Betnacional acquisitions, as well as excellent organic iGaming growth which helped offset customer-friendly sports results. The Group reported a net loss of $789m for the quarter compared to $114m in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of a non-cash impairment charge relating to regulatory changes in India and the previously communicated $205m payment to Boyd for improved US market access terms.

I am really pleased with the strong positioning of Flutter's core business as we continue to execute in the final quarter of the year. Before sharing more detail on our Q3 performance and outlook, I first want to present how we are strategically positioning FanDuel to capture the emerging prediction markets opportunity. This area has been a source of significant industry discussion over recent months and I am very excited to announce our expansion into the market with the launch of “FanDuel Predicts”, a new FanDuel branded app which we expect to launch in December, through our joint venture with the CME Group.

FanDuel Predicts unlocks an immediate growth opportunity by allowing us to offer a compelling sports product to the vast majority of the US adult population in states that do not currently have access to sports betting. This represents a significant incremental addressable market for FanDuel in addition to our existing sportsbook and iGaming business. We believe this new sports opportunity lies solely in these states, as prediction markets are having a negligible impact in the states where FanDuel sportsbook is already available to customers. FanDuel Predicts will also accelerate acquisition of customers into the FanDuel ecosystem ahead of the state regulation of sports betting. Furthermore, the strength of our world-class pricing and risk management capabilities present potential market-making opportunities which we continue to assess.

We are exceptionally well positioned to harness this growth opportunity. We have a powerful combination of assets enabled through our strategic partnership with CME Group, who have a long track record of operating the world's leading derivatives marketplace, together with FanDuel's nationwide brand presence and sports betting expertise, which has already successfully delivered a position as the clear leader in sports betting. Our extensive experience operating the Betfair Exchange within the Flutter Group also equips us with a deep understanding of this space.

Our launch strategy has been developed in close consultation with state regulators and tribal authorities, resulting in a tailored, state-specific approach that enables us to launch in those states where no local regulation exists. At launch, FanDuel Predicts will offer sports markets in states without a current sports betting regulatory framework. Sports markets will also be restricted to non-tribal lands. This means that a significant proportion of the US population will soon have access to a brand new FanDuel sports product, operating with the same high standards regarding customer protection, know your customer, and anti-money laundering as all our FanDuel products. A range of financial and cultural markets will also be offered across virtually all states. In our existing sportsbook and iGaming states our primary focus will continue to be the state-regulated market and strengthening our leadership position in our core sports betting and iGaming businesses.

The opportunity to extend the FanDuel footprint into new states is significant and our aspiration is to be the clear market leader. Our investment will therefore be meaningful, while maintaining a disciplined approach, a strategy which has served us so well since the inception of sports betting in the US. At this early stage, we anticipate incremental EBITDA cost of $40-$50m in Q4 2025 and $200m-$300m in 2026 with the majority arising in H27. In line with our proven investment strategy on sportsbook to date, we will closely monitor returns with a priority on building value for the future, while also maintaining the flexibility to accelerate investment where performance warrants. We believe this will position FanDuel to deliver future growth and harness the long-term opportunities for our business.

In conclusion, we believe prediction markets present a very significant incremental growth opportunity for FanDuel, and that their evolution will also accelerate the path to state-regulated sports betting and iGaming. In the long-term, we firmly believe that state-regulated sports betting and iGaming remains the most valuable long-term opportunity in the US. The importance of having the best quality sports betting product, combined with the ability to price increasingly complex sports products accurately, cannot be overstated. These are both areas where Flutter and FanDuel excel. As demonstrated by international precedent, long-term success in the US gaming sector will be achieved by those operators with scale positions and the highest quality sports betting product.

US update

Q3 AMP growth in the US was encouraging at 8% year-over-year, with continued strong iGaming AMP growth of 30%, and sportsbook AMP growth of 5% representing an acceleration in year-over-year growth compared to Q2.

FanDuel's revenue performance was underpinned by another very strong iGaming quarter with revenue growth of 44% delivering a GGR market share of 27% in Q3. Player frequency continued to grow with over 500 new slots titles added during the quarter, as access to the proprietary Flutter gaming platform unlocked a faster pace of content delivery. Exclusive content also continued to resonate strongly and drive increased customer engagement, with new Wonka and Samurai titles added in Q3 as well as the latest installment of our Huff and Puff series. Huff 'N Lots of Puff was our most successful game launch to date, setting all-time highs in actives and GGR on launch. Our consistent delivery of innovative and engaging iGaming product features ensures we are well positioned to capitalize on the long-term opportunity. With population penetration still well below our long-term expectations, we believe a very long runway for future growth remains in existing states, before factoring in any future state legalization.

Turning to sportsbook, and while September and October have been impacted by customer-friendly NFL sports results, it is still early in the season. We have complete conviction in our pricing and we remain confident that this short-term variability of outcomes will revert to expected levels over time. Higher levels of parlay and SGP penetration ultimately drive higher structural revenue margin, and we continue to make good progress toward our longer-term 16% structural hold expectation.

The start of the NFL season consistently sees heightened levels of competition in the market and Q3 this year was even more pronounced than in previous years. September was characterized by very high levels of competitor customer generosity, including a range of unsustainable, uneconomic customer offers. These competitive dynamics resulted in lower than anticipated FanDuel NFL handle growth and Same Game Parlay (SGP) penetration in the opening weeks of the season. This impact was transitory in nature, with trends significantly improved by the start of the fourth quarter as FanDuel's disciplined investment approach proved effective. Despite this impact in September, FanDuel's structural advantages ensured we maintained a strong sportsbook market share, with a 47% net gaming revenue (NGR) share of the online sports betting market in September8.

While market competitive intensity has moderated from the NFL season start, it still remains at elevated levels. FanDuel's scale as the #1 operator in the US (Q3 GGR share: 38%, Q3 NGR share: 41%), has subsequently enabled us to take action to strengthen our market leadership. We responded in a strong but disciplined way at the start of Q4, with increased investment in customer acquisition and retention, and we have been very pleased with the momentum that this has driven.

During the quarter we believe the impact from prediction market activity on our business was negligible, as in regulated states customers continue to prefer the richer experience provided by regulated sportsbooks. Based on our analysis, we believe the vast majority of this activity is taking place in states without sportsbook regulation. We therefore do not see sports prediction markets as a meaningful challenge in states where regulated sportsbooks like FanDuel are available.

From a product perspective, the NFL season launch in September was an important milestone for innovation. FanDuel Futures Day showcased a new, first-to-market NFL feature enabling customers to create season long SGPs, driving high levels of parlay engagement. Live betting represents over half of handle, with further enhancements to our live SGP proposition including expanded NFL drive offerings. This helped deliver an NFL parlay penetration increase of 300 bps in the season to date. Our Your Way feature benefited from the addition of SGP+ capabilities and while this currently remains a separate sportsbook experience, the underlying next-generation pricing technology now powers our entire NFL sportsbook pricing and is driving a number of product improvements. This included an increased range of cashout markets helping drive a 20% increase in cashout activity.

We have been really pleased with our NBA performance since the season start in late October. Customer engagement, handle and SGP penetration are all tracking strongly in the early weeks of the season, giving us confidence that growth this season is shaping up to be stronger than last year. We are excited to see what our new strategic NBA partnership with Amazon Prime can unlock including merchandising integrations, product integrations and in-game virtual signage.

Finally, I wanted to share my thoughts on recent concerns around sports integrity. This is hugely important to us and something we take very seriously across the Group. At FanDuel, we use advanced technology and real-time monitoring to identify suspicious activity and work closely with leagues, data monitoring groups, and law enforcement to alert them to any suspicious activity. This highlights the important role the regulated industry plays in assuring the integrity of these great sports. We will continue to work closely with all key stakeholders to ensure that effective frameworks are in place to protect sports integrity, the players and our customers.

International update

The International division delivered 21% year-over-year revenue growth, with the Snai and Betnacional acquisitions contributing 18 percentage points of the increase. Organic growth was impacted by the cessation of real-money gaming in India and a strong prior-year sportsbook performance, which benefited from the Euros and more favorable sports results. iGaming continued to drive organic growth in Q3, with exceptional growth in Turkey and positive momentum in SisaI's Italian online business.

Our focus on the Flutter Edge is delivering innovation across our International business. In Southern Europe and Africa (SEA), we launched MyCombo on Sisal, the only full SGP product available in the Italian market, in time for the start of the Italian soccer season. Customer engagement has been strong with half of customers placing a MyCombo bet during the first seven rounds of the season.

The September integration of Flutter Studios into the SEA Italian online platform has enabled in-house content to be offered to our Italian customers, with a strong pipeline of future content. In July, we migrated PokerStars Italian customers to our SEA platform, a key milestone in the PokerStars transformation which will deliver material savings in 2027 after completion of the final migration from the existing PokerStars technology stack.

The Snai integration has been progressing well; we have enhanced the iGaming proposition, optimized retail gaming machines and commission structures, and increased customer acquisition volumes by deploying Sisal's proven retail signup program. The migration of Snai customers to the SEA online platform remains on track for H1 2026, providing increased confidence in our Snai synergy targets.

In the UK and Ireland (UKI), the successful migration of Sky Bet onto our shared Flutter UKI platform has enabled delivery of new product and improvements for our Sky Bet customers. This included the launch of our highly popular SuperSub offering and the new Squad Bet proposition, powered by our next-generation pricing capability. Continued roll out of premium content has also helped drive positive iGaming momentum.

There has been much speculation around potential gaming tax increases in the upcoming UK budget. We remain engaged with policymakers and expect decisions will be based on economic merit, taking into account the industry's substantial contribution to UK tax revenues and employment. Significant increases to the tax rates would threaten jobs and investment across the UK market, as well as driving more customers to unregulated operators on the black market - where there are no player protections and regulatory oversight. We continue to engage with policymakers and await the outcome in the Budget later this month, however, should taxes increase, Flutter's growing scale and market leading position will help to mitigate the impact, and we would likely benefit from the consolidation of share among sub-scale operators over time.

Brazil is an exciting growth opportunity for Flutter and we retain a strong conviction that scale operators with the best products will win the largest share of the market. This quarter, our expanding portfolio of games and more sophisticated generosity delivered record iGaming revenues. On sportsbook we will continue to integrate Flutter's in-house pricing capabilities and generosity functionality to materially elevate the overall customer proposition ahead of the World Cup next year.

The good progress we are making across the numerous transformation projects both detailed above and in previous quarters, is helping us deliver further scale benefits and positions us to deliver enhanced experiences for our customers. Our cost efficiency drivers go beyond the $300m target we set out our Investor Day last year, with the redesign of our UKI organizational structure a good example of an incremental initiative.

Outside of performance during the quarter, the enactment of the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025 forced Junglee and all other operators to immediately cease real-money operations. We are extremely disappointed with the sudden and unexpected change to the regulatory landscape in India. Flutter has invested significantly in India over the last number of years, responsibly delivering innovative skill-based games to Indian customers. Junglee will now only offer free-to-play gaming content as we assess our medium-term options in that market.

[TITLE]Beyond Meat® Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:

These are significantly reducing our overall leverage in connection with the previously announced exchange of substantially all of our 2027 convertible notes; meaningfully extending our debt maturity; and finally, adding substantial liquidity to our balance sheet.”

Brown continued “Simultaneously, we are taking equally strong measures to accelerate our path to sustainable operations, including pursuing further and sizable cost reductions, gross margin expansion investments and targeted strategic growth initiatives. Though category headwinds and an accompanying softer top-line continue to weigh on and reverberate throughout our current performance, including our Q3 results, we are closing out the year with a much improved balance sheet, important transformation spadework underway, and genuine optimism and excitement regarding our future.”

Third Quarter 2025

Net revenues decreased 13.3% to $70.2 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $81.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 10.3% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 3.5% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand, reduced points of distribution in the U.S. retail channel, and lower sales of burger products to Quick Service Restaurant (“QSR”) customers in the international foodservice channel. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts, changes in product sales mix and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

U.S. retail channel net revenues decreased 18.4% to $28.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $35.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 12.6% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 6.6% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand and reduced points of distribution. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.

U.S. foodservice channel net revenues decreased 27.3% to $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $14.5 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 27.1% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 0.3% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand and the lapping of sales of chicken products to a U.S. QSR customer in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.

International retail channel net revenues decreased 4.6% to $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $16.6 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 12.5% decrease in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 9.1% increase in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by reduced sales of the Company’s burger, dinner sausage and chicken products. The increase in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, price increases of certain of our products and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by higher trade discounts.

International foodservice channel net revenues increased 2.3% to $15.3 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $15.0 million in the year-ago period. The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by a 4.4% increase in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 2.0% decrease in net revenue per pound. The increase in volume of products sold was primarily due to higher sales of chicken products to a QSR customer, partially offset by reduced sales of burger products to certain QSR customers. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by changes in product sales mix, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, lower trade discounts and, to a lesser extent, price increases of certain of our products.

Gross profit in the third quarter of 2025 was $7.2 million, or gross margin of 10.3%, compared to gross profit of $14.3 million, or gross margin of 17.7%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin in the third quarter of 2025 included $1.7 million in expenses related to the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China. Additionally, gross profit and gross margin in the third quarter of 2025 were negatively impacted by increased cost of goods sold per pound and decreased net revenue per pound. The increase in cost of goods sold per pound primarily reflected higher materials costs and higher inventory provision, partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses, including depreciation, and lower logistics costs.

Operating expenses were $119.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $45.2 million in the year-ago period. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2025 included $77.4 million in non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets. The Company performed a quantitative assessment in accordance with ASC 360 and concluded that an impairment of its long-lived assets existed at September 27, 2025. There were no such impairment charges in the year-ago period. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2025 also included $0.8 million in certain non-routine SG&A expenses, $0.7 million in incremental legal and other fees and expenses associated with arbitration proceedings related to a contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer and $0.6 million in costs related to the partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s Campus Headquarters. Excluding these items, the decrease in operating expenses compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by reduced marketing expenses and reduced non-production salaries and related expenses.

Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2025 was $112.3 million, compared to $30.9 million in the year-ago period. The increase in loss from operations was driven by the increase in operating expenses and the reduction in gross profit.

The following table summarizes certain charges recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the third quarter of 2025 (unaudited):

(in thousands) Charges recorded in cost of goods sold Expenses related to suspension and substantial cessation of operational activities in China $ 1,721 Total charges recorded in cost of goods sold $ 1,721 Charges recorded in operating expenses Non-cash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets $ 77,414 Certain non-routine SG&A expenses $ 838 Incremental legal and other fees and expenses related to a contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer $ 662 Costs related to partial lease termination $ 555 Expenses related to suspension and substantial cessation of operational activities in China $ 36 Total charges recorded in operating expenses $ 79,504 Total $ 81,225

Total other income, net, was $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to total other income, net, of $4.4 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in total other income, net, was primarily due to a reduction in net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and an increase in interest expense related to leases and to the Company’s delayed draw term loan facility, partially offset by benefit from the remeasurement of warrant liability and interest income.

Net loss was $110.7 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $26.6 million in the year-ago period. Net loss per common share was $1.44 in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.41 in the year-ago period. The increase in net loss in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by the increase in loss from operations and the decrease in total other income, net.

[TITLE]Kaltura Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire eSelf.ai, a provider of AI-based Interactive Avatars:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kaltura, Inc. (Nasdaq: KLTR), the AI Video Experience Cloud, today announced it has signed on November 5th, 2025, a definitive agreement to acquire eSelf.ai, a multimodal AI lab developing technology for agentic interactions with live avatars.

eSelf.ai provides conversational photorealistic avatars that support over 30 languages and an easy-to-use studio to create, guide, and deploy them. Its proprietary technology combines AI-based live, expressive visual agents, with low-latency speech recognition and generation, screen understanding, dynamic media sharing, and an agentic enterprise-grade framework and workflows.

eSelf.ai commenced development in 2023 and was named by FastCompany as one of the “Next Big Things in Tech” in 2025. Comprised of over 15 AI experts in the fields of computer vision models, NLP, and speech technology, eSelf.ai is led by co-founders Dr. Alan Bekker and Eylon Shoshan. Dr. Bekker holds a PhD in machine learning with a specialization in speech, NLP and computer vision, and was recognized by Forbes magazine in their “30 under 30 - Europe” list. Before founding eSelf Dr. Bekker co-founded Voca.ai, a pioneer in voice-based agents, which was acquired by Snap, where he subsequently led all conversational AI efforts.

Kaltura plans to integrate eSelf.ai’s immersive virtual agents technology across the Kaltura AI Video Experience Cloud, inserting avatars into its market-leading video products. This technology will also turn Kaltura’s Genies (Class, Work, CX, and TV Genies) into conversational, visually expressive agents that will hear, talk, and “see” user screens and analyze them in real time. Easy integration with enterprise systems and content repositories are planned to enable these agents to augment human roles cost-effectively, and to boost customer engagement, employee retention and business results.

Kaltura also plans to provide embeddable, stand-alone, self-served interactive avatars, expanding the company’s product-led growth (PLG) motion. In addition, eSelf’s avatar technology will serve as the foundation for a planned new video-on-demand content creation tool, designed to enable customers to automatically add speaking photorealist and animated avatars into any video. This dual capability positions eSelf as a key driver of Kaltura’s next-generation video-on-demand content creation, and live, conversational agentic experiences.

The acquisition is expected to provide upsell opportunities across Kaltura’s premium customer base, attract new large enterprise customers, and open new self-serve sale opportunities with small and medium-sized enterprises and with departmental entry points into large enterprises. The new capabilities are expected to add conversational, immersive virtual agents to the following use cases, and many more:

[TITLE]On Holding Continues to Beat Projections in Third Quarter:
[TEXT]
Story was updated at 4:16 p.m. Wednesday.

Nike may be clawing its way back to popularity, but don’t count out On Holding.

Despite some analyst hesitation that the popular Swiss running brand may be losing some of its steam to a reviving Nike, the company once again posted record sales and profits in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.

“We continue to reiterate that we are on a different journey — to become the most premium brand in the industry,” Martin Hoffmann, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, told WWD.

It appears to be working.

Adjusted net income in the period nearly tripled to 142 million Swiss francs from 50 million Swiss francs in the prior year on a 24.9 percent sales gain, or 34.5 percent on a constant currency basis, to 794.4 million Swiss francs. Adjusted earnings per share were 0.36 Swiss francs, up from 0.09 Swiss francs in the prior year.

This beat Wall Street expectations of a quarterly sales increase of 20.1 percent and adjusted earnings per share of 0.27 Swiss francs.

The company’s direct-to-consumer sales increased 27.6 percent to 14.7 million Swiss francs, or 37.5 percent on a constant currency basis, while sales in the wholesale channel rose 23.3 percent, or 32.5 percent on a constant currency basis, to 479.6 million Swiss francs.

By region, net sales increased 33 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 21 percent in the Americas and 109.2 percent in Asia-Pacific on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific is the company’s fastest-growing region with four consecutive quarters of triple-digit sales growth, and analysts were expecting sales in the American market to slow.

“The U.S. continues to be strong,” Hoffmann said. This comes despite a price increase of around 7 percent on select lifestyle products starting in the second half of the year. He said the company has experienced no resistance to the price hikes. “We continue to power on full-price sales,” he said on an earnings call Wednesday morning, adding that “affluent consumers are not price-sensitive.”

By category, net sales from shoes rose 21.1 percent to 731.3 million Swiss francs; apparel sales increased 86.9 percent to 50.1 million Swiss francs, and accessories sales rose 145.3 percent to 13 million Swiss francs.

Although apparel still represents around 8 percent of overall sales, Hoffmann said it is growing more strongly than footwear. And in the quarter, the company sold more than 1 million pieces of apparel for the first time, and the short-term goal is to raise the total sales percentage of the category to double digits. Hoffmann said on the call that the training and tennis categories are most popular, and the plan for the future is to “attack in additional categories” that can be worn every day.

He added that apparel penetration in the company’s retail stores is much higher, hitting between 10 and 20 percent, and in many cases serves as an introduction to the brand. On the call, he said apparel has become “a key acquisition channel” since apparel shoppers “buy more frequently and with bigger baskets. We are also seeing a clear shift toward younger customers in apparel, highlighting the sizable and well-defined long-term opportunity. Importantly, we are not building apparel as an add-on to our footwear business, but as a company within the company serving the same communities but with a unique product offering and customer experience. As a result, apparel is driving incremental high value growth across all our channels.”

Turning to retail, On operates 60 stores globally with additions in the Ginza in Tokyo; a flagship in its hometown of Zurich; Palo Alto, Calif.; its first South Korean store in Seoul, and a unit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Hoffmann said only a small number of stores are slated to open this year but the company will continue to add between 20 and 25 units a year in the future. “That’s the cadence we had this year,” he said.

While its own stores are an important part of the business, Hoffmann stressed that wholesale continues to be a key cog in its wheel. He said with the big-box stores such as Dick’s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker, there are 60 percent of doors that do not carry the brand. And within the run specialty channel, he expects business to be strong next year as the company introduces new models of some of its key franchises, such as the Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner.

On the earnings call, Caspar Coppetti, cofounder and executive co-chairman of On, singled out New York City Marathon women’s winner Hellen Obiri, an On athlete, who wore the new Cloudboom Strike Lightspray, as proof that its “new technology is being trusted and adopted by the world’s best athletes in the most iconic races. Our strategy is clear. Technology is proven at the highest level of competition and then refined to deliver the best experience for every type of runner. This elite credibility flows directly to our core performance running franchises Cloudsurfer, Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner. These are the engines that have won millions of fans and driven our significant sustained growth in the run category.”

Next year, Coppetti said, the company will launch the Cloudsufer Max, a model featuring “engineering and foam innovations,” as well as the LightSpray Cloudmonster Hyper, a shoe for everyday runners that features the company’s “championship level technology.”

As a result of the strong third-quarter results, the company raised its outlook for the year and is expecting net sales to grow 34 percent on a constant currency basis, to 2.91 billion Swiss francs, up from 31 percent previously. Analysts were expecting sales for the year to increase 28.2 percent. And in 2026, Hoffmann said, the company is projecting growth of at least 23 percent.

Hoffmann said the optimism is driven by the momentum already experienced in the fourth quarter and the strong sales in China. Looking ahead, the company plans to release a holiday campaign and continue to lean into collaborations, such as ones that just released with Loewe, with which it codesigned a Cloudsolo sneaker, as well as a capsule of apparel and footwear with SkyHigh Farm Goods.

Hoffmann declined to say if its partnership with Zendaya will get a refresh later this year, but Coppetti pointed to the popularity of the Cloudzoon Moon shoe collaboration it introduced with her this August as evidence of the company’s ability to blend fashion and performance. The shoe — and the fall collection she wore in the campaign — are helping the brand gain “connection and traction with young, aspirational consumers, especially teens,” he said on the earnings call.

Despite the strong showing, analysts still had some reservations. Tom Nikic of Needham & Co. said although On “remains the strongest growth company in our coverage,” he lowered his price target to $52 from $62 “as we believe that multiples in the second have moved structurally lower.” But he retained his “buy” rating on the stock.

Peter McGoldrick of Stifel also maintained a buy rating on the stock, writing that while there may be a “deceleration in fourth-quarter reported revenue growth and higher operating expenses,” he remained encouraged by the results against a challenging environment.

John Kernan of TD Cowen also retained a buy rating on the stock and reiterated his $55 target, and Cristina Fernandez of Telsey Group said the strong results disproved “concerns of a slowdown due to intense competition and a discerning U.S. consumer.”

Shares on Wednesday of On Holding closed up 18 percent to $41.51.

[TITLE]Qorium Raises 22 Million Euros for Lab-grown Leather; Modern Meadow’s Handbag Collab: Sustainable Scene:
[TEXT]
GOING DUTCH: Dutch biotechnology company Qorium has raised a 22 million euro series A round to accelerate the commercialization of its cultivated leather technology.

“This investment is a powerful vote of confidence in our mission to transform the leather industry,” said Qorium chief executive officer Michael Newton. “By combining cutting-edge science with deep leather expertise and sustainable practices, we are creating real leather that offers better performance than traditional animal-derived leather, without the environmental and ethical costs.”

The round was led by the Dutch national impact investor Invest-NL and Limburg regional development agency LIOF. They joined existing backers Brightlands Venture Partners and Sofinnova Partners, which re-upped their investment, as well as several private investors.

The investment from Invest-NL was made under the European Commission’s InvestEU program.

The funding follows an 8-million-euro raise across two seed rounds, with the first 2.6 million euros raised in 2021, and an additional 7.4 million euros in 2024.

The round will support Qorium in its scaling and commercialization efforts. The company will expand capacity at its Maastricht facility and work to build new partnerships for its lab-grown leather.

Qorium’s lab-grown leather.

The company delivered its first proof of concept with a sample of leather grown from animal cells released last year. The lab process eliminates the need for livestock farming, reduces waste and lowers environmental impact.

“At Invest-NL, we invest in technologies that drive systemic change,” said Invest-NL senior investment manager Lisette Kersting-van der Boog. “Qorium’s leather is a breakthrough innovation that can transform one of the world’s most polluting industries.”

Guillaume Baxter, partner at Sofinnova Partners, added: “This investment reflects Qorium’s impressive progress to date and our strong belief in the economic and sustainability potential of its leather.”

Qorium said that it will appoint a new director to its board in the coming weeks.

NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED: Meanwhile, leather alternative producer Modern Meadow has partnered with German brand Melina Bucher on its first collection of handbags made from its next-gen, animal-free material, Innovera Suede.

Among the offerings are the half-moon shape Loulou style and the elongated architectural style Tessa. A third style, the Bailey, is a structured handle bag with the handles reinforced with Elevate material from Uncaged Innovations. All are handmade in the brand’s Berlin atelier in on-trend deep chocolate tones for winter.

“Our collaboration with Melina Bucher aligns with our ethos of creating products that are good for the planet,” said Modern Meadow chief executive officer David Williamson. “Our innovative bio-design technology offers them the look, feel and smell of suede and gives them the creative freedom to customize their designs for any need. Innovera proves that aesthetics, responsibility and performance can co-exist in one versatile, forward-facing material.”

Modern Meadow was an early pioneer in the lab-grown leather space, before pivoting to bio-fabricated materials. Its Innovera Suede is termed an “animal-free leather alternative” made from plant proteins, biopolymers and recycled tire rubber. The material incorporates more than 80 percent renewable carbon content.

YES, SYRE: Textile impact company Syre has unveiled a multiyear partnership with Nike Inc. to integrate circular, textile-to-textile recycled polyester into Nike’s performance wear, marking a significant step toward “closing the loop” in apparel materials.

Under the agreement, Syre will become Nike’s lead strategic supplier for textile-to-textile recycled polyester. The collaboration reflects Nike’s sustainability ambitions and Syre’s mission to “accelerate the great textile shift.” The first products made with Syre’s circular polyester are expected within the next few years.

“Our partnership with Syre represents a shift in our materials strategy and how we source,” said Nike vice president, materials supply chain Sitora Muzafarova. “Innovation is at the heart of Nike’s DNA and textile-to-textile recycled polyester is essential in our ambition to design and produce breakthrough products that both perform to the highest standards that our athletes expect and are more sustainable at the same time.”

Founded in 2023 by H&M Group and Swedish impact investing firm Vargas Holding, Syre is backed by investors including TPG Rise Climate, Giant Ventures, IMAS Foundation, Leitmotif, Norrsken VC, and Volvo.

For Syre, which is developing a global network of recycling plants starting with its first large-scale facility planned for Vietnam in 2027, the Nike deal marks a pivotal step.

“Having Nike, the global leader in sportswear and innovation, commit to textile-to-textile generated polyester sends a powerful signal to the entire industry,” said Dennis Nobelius, Syre’s chief executive officer. “This is not a one-off initiative or capsule collection; this is a moment when circular materials move from concept to commercial reality at scale.”

Karla Magruder and Eileen Mockus Frank Rocco / Courtesy of Accelerating Circularity

AROUND IN CIRCLES: New York-based nonprofit Accelerating Circularity, dedicated to scaling textile-to-textile recycling, has elevated chief operating officer Eileen Mockus to the chief executive officer role.

Founder and current CEO Karla Magruder will become board chair, and contine to guide the organization’s strategic direction as it seeks to scale operations.

San Francisco-based Mockus brings more than two decades of experience in sustainable textile innovation, including over a decade as president and CEO of organic beddings and home goods company Coyuchi, as well as executive and sourcing positions at Pottery Barn, The North Face, and Patagonia.

“I’m thrilled to step into this role at such a pivotal time,” said Mockus. “The groundwork has been laid, partnerships are strong, and the demand for scalable textile-to-textile recycling has never been greater. Together, we can ensure the transition to a future where textiles are no longer wasted.”

Since its founding in 2019, Accelerating Circularity has convened brands and supply chain actors, brought post-consumer textile-to-textile products to market at scale, and launched working groups for textile chemical recyclers and trim suppliers. The nonprofit also secured a Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action to divert 325 tons of textiles from landfill.

“With Eileen’s expertise and passion for low-impact textile systems, the organization is perfectly positioned to move from pilot programs to industry-wide implementation,” said Magruder.

Accelerating Circularity will continue advancing textile circularity through scalable programs, tools, and commercially viable business models. The group has partnered with companies including Zara parent Inditex, Gap Inc., Nike, Target, Walmart, and Zalando, and most recently revealed a partnership with U.S.-based fashion-technology firm Dhana Inc., which uses AI and data integration digital tools to help brands move toward circular solutions.

[TITLE]E-Commerce Market Shares Analysis, Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033 - AI, 5G, and Secure Payments Propel Growth Amidst Cybersecurity Challenges:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "E-Commerce Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The E-Commerce Market is expected to reach US$ 12.63 trillion by 2033 from US$ 6.56 trillion in 2024, with a CAGR of 7.54% from 2025 to 2033. The market is expanding due to the growing demand for AI-powered features, the substantial expansion of cross-border commerce opportunities, and advancements in safe digital payment systems.

Growth Drivers for the E-Commerce Market

The notable growth in opportunities for cross-border trade. High-speed internet connections' wider reach, the widespread use of smartphones, and the growing accessibility of digital payment methods are all making it much easier for people all over the world to shop from international e-commerce platforms, which is helping the market grow.

The globalization of supply chains, which makes it much simpler for any company to get goods and components from around the globe, is another factor driving the e-commerce market statistics. This gives customers access to a wider range of products, frequently at competitive prices. As more third-party logistics companies appear, the shipping and delivery procedure is shortened considerably, making it easier, faster, and less expensive to complete a cross-border order than it was previously.

Features Driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI-generated interpretations are utilized to improve client satisfaction during sales operations and offer a deeper comprehension of market trends. In addition, virtual fitting rooms are becoming more popular. These rooms use AI for a number of methods, including improving fit prediction accuracy and enhancing the overall shopping experience.

By enabling customers to see how apparel items will appear on them before making a purchase, virtual fitting rooms offer more participatory and captivating experiences. These rooms are offered by many e-commerce businesses since they lower return rates and the related expenses for merchants.

Zalando, a prominent European online fashion and leisure portal, for example, launched a virtual fitting room in 2023 where millions of clients may design a 3D avatar by entering their gender, height, and weight to see how different sizes from different brands might suit them.

The creation of safe online payment methods. The growth of mobile (m)-commerce modes, which enable customers to transact using a mobile application, digital wallet, and contactless technology, is supported by secure digital systems and high individual dependability. Furthermore, the market is still heavily influenced by developments in encryption technology, multi-factor authentication, and the implementation of strict security protocols.

A lot of people feel at ease disclosing their financial information online. High e-commerce platform sales fuel the payment method, which is backed by safe digital payment that facilitates transactions. Additionally, digital payment solutions make it easy for overseas customers to complete transactions with only a few clicks, which supports the expansion of the e-commerce market.

Challenges in the E-Commerce Market

Cybersecurity and Data Privacy. Online businesses have serious difficulties as the risk of identity theft, data breaches, and cyberattacks increases with the volume of e-commerce transactions. Retaining credibility and confidence requires protecting sensitive consumer data, including payment information and personal information.

Cybersecurity methods including encryption, secure payment gateways, and multi-factor authentication are critical to safeguard data and ensure secure transactions. A single breach may result in monetary damages, legal repercussions, and serious harm to one's image. Additionally, companies need to remain in compliance with legislation like the CCPA and GDPR as data protection standards get more stringent. In addition to being required by law, maintaining strong cybersecurity and data privacy procedures is essential for sustained success in the cutthroat e-commerce industry.

Return and Refund Management. Since handling returns and refunds may be expensive and time-consuming, it presents a big issue for e-commerce companies. Consumers demand a smooth and easy return process; therefore, companies must manage product returns, refunds, and item restocking effectively. High return rates can raise operating expenses for things like shipping, inspection, and restocking, particularly in industries like electronics and clothing.

Retaining client loyalty also depends on promptly processing returns while ensuring consumer satisfaction. A company's reputation might be harmed by bad return experiences. Businesses must employ technology to track returns, optimize reverse logistics, and establish clear return procedures in order to manage this. One of the biggest challenges is still managing returns effectively while cutting expenses and preserving a satisfying customer experience.

[TITLE]Cold Chain Logistics Market Set to Reach Valuation of US$ 1,455.8 Billion by 2033 | Astute Analytica:
[TEXT]
Chicago, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global cold chain logistics market was valued at US$ 371.4 million in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 1455.8 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 16.39% over the forecast period of 2025–2033.

The biopharmaceutical sector is a primary engine of growth for temperature-controlled logistics. In 2024, the U.S. FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 50 new molecular entities. Of these approvals, 18 were new biologic entities requiring specialized handling and transport. A significant 81% of these new biologics were antibody-based drugs, products that frequently depend on an uninterrupted cold chain. Furthermore, the FDA designated 22 of the new drugs approved in 2024 as "first-in-class," many with complex temperature stability requirements that challenge existing supply chains. These developments are directly impacting the global cold chain logistics market.

Consequently, the air freight sector reflects this specialized demand. Worldwide air transport of temperature-controlled pharmaceutical products grew by a tonnage of 2% in 2024. Regional data underscores this trend, with the Middle East & South Asia recording an 8% increase in outbound pharma air cargo weight in 2024. Similarly, outbound volumes from North America rose by 4% in 2024 and accelerated significantly in the first three months of 2025, with outbound tonnage increasing 16% year-over-year. Specialized hubs are also seeing growth; Vienna Airport's Pharma Handling Center processed 4,238 tons of these sensitive goods in 2024 alone.

Online Grocery Adoption Redefines Last-Mile Consumer Expectations in cold Chain Logistics Market

The digital shift in consumer shopping habits is a monumental force. By mid-2025, an estimated 81 million U.S. households are expected to buy their groceries online, creating massive last-mile delivery needs. The number of individual Americans shopping for groceries online is projected to climb from 138.3 million in 2024 to 148.4 million in 2025. This sustained growth is a cornerstone of the modern cold chain logistics market. Consistent high demand is now the new normal for temperature-controlled delivery services.

Sales figures provide a stark illustration of this new reality. U.S. online grocery sales reached an unprecedented peak of US$ 12.5 billion in the single month of September 2025. Impressively, this figure represents a US$ 3 billion increase over September 2024 sales. The market's momentum is undeniable, with sales hitting US$ 10 billion in July 2025 and US$ 9.7 billion in March 2025. Moreover, March 2025 marked the eighth consecutive month where sales exceeded US$ 9.5 billion, while in November 2024, 77.8 million U.S. households participated in online grocery shopping.

Global Quick Commerce Creates New Hyper-Localized Logistics Challenges

The rise of quick commerce places immense pressure on hyper-localized cold chains but favoring the cold chain logistics market growth. Globally, an estimated 1.4 billion consumers are using online grocery services monthly in 2024, setting a broad stage for rapid delivery models. Within this group, a substantial 600 million people worldwide will use quick commerce services for essentials in 2024. The growth trajectory for this sub-sector is steep, with the number of global quick commerce users expected to reach 900 million by 2029.

In the United States, the quick commerce user base is already significant and growing. In 2024, 56.1 million people in the U.S. are using these rapid delivery services. The expansion of this model, exemplified by Amazon's launch of 15-minute deliveries in India in December 2024, intensifies the need for distributed micro-fulfillment centers with sophisticated refrigeration. The cold chain logistics market must adapt to service these on-demand expectations for perishable goods, a trend validated by a 25% rise in such deliveries in India during the 2024 Diwali season compared to 2023.

Critical Cold Storage Infrastructure Expands Amidst Tightening Vacancy Rates

The demand is fueling a wave of new construction in the cold storage sector. In the U.S., five speculative cold storage (SCS) projects were completed in 2024, adding 1.1 million square feet of crucial space. The pipeline remains robust across the cold chain logistics market, with another 2.2 million square feet of speculative cold storage space expected to be completed in the U.S. during 2025. As of early 2024, 15 specialized spec cold buildings were under construction or

[TITLE]Tariffs Near 107 Percent Threaten to Pull Italian Pasta Brands From American Shelves:
[TEXT]
Italian pasta makers are warning that some of their products may soon disappear from U.S. grocery stores if a Commerce Department plan to raise tariffs on these goods goes into effect.

In a ruling published this September, the Commerce Department said several Italian pasta manufacturers—including La Molisana and Garofalo—sold pasta in the U.S. at "less than fair value" from July 2023 to June 2024. The decision stems from a petition filed by U.S. pasta manufacturers last year, which triggered an administrative review under U.S. antidumping law. As a result, the agency has proposed implementing antidumping duties of 91.74 percent on some of Italy's largest pasta exporters. Those duties would come in addition to an existing 15 percent tariff on most European Union goods, leaving the affected producers to face total tariff rates of 107 percent if the preliminary determination is finalized. A decision is expected early next year.

Several companies have already told The Wall Street Journal they are preparing to pull their products from U.S. shelves if the duties are finalized, which would provide a significant blow to one of America's closest allies. In 2023, the U.S. was the second-largest importer of Italian pasta, trailing only Germany, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.

And, as with most of the protectionist trade policies implemented under the Trump administration, this one will not only hurt businesses but also leave consumers worse off.

While most pasta sold in the United States is produced domestically, including by Italian-owned companies like Barilla, which manufactures much of its U.S.-sold pasta in Iowa and New York, American consumers and restaurants still readily enjoy premium foreign-made pasta. The Washington Post reports that Italy exported roughly $780 million in pasta to the U.S. last year. For specialty brands marketed specifically as "Made in Italy," absorbing a near-100 percent tariff is not financially viable without passing the cost directly to consumers. With most distributors and retailers typically setting prices months in advance, consumers may not see any changes until current stock cycles through, but a cost increase is still likely to occur.

The ruling also runs contrary to one of President Donald Trump's campaign promises to make groceries more affordable. Grocery-store food prices have nonetheless continued to rise, with the "food-at-home" CPI sector having jumped 0.6 percent in August alone, according to Axios. While this trend is yearslong and Trump isn't solely to blame, the president's plan to address these prices by cracking down on meat producers or taxing imported food won't do anything to solve the problem.

The Italian government has publicly criticized the U.S. decision. Italy's foreign ministry said in a statement that it was working with the European Commission to contest the proposed duties. E.U. officials have similarly said they are evaluating possible responses if the U.S. moves ahead with the tariff increases.

For now, the tariff is not final. The Commerce Department is accepting comments and will conduct additional review before issuing a final determination, which could adjust the duty rate or leave it unchanged. However, any formal challenge would likely take months, and the tariffs could still be imposed while legal disputes play out. In the meantime, foodies and American restaurants will pay the price.

[TITLE]A 107% U.S. import tax on Italian pasta could make your favorite spaghetti pricier — or hard to find:
[TEXT]
Americans may soon be paying more for their favorite Italian pasta brands — or even have trouble finding imported spaghetti — as the Trump administration eyes a new import duty on 13 of Italy's largest pasta exporters.

The proposal, published by the Commerce Department in September, would add a new 92% antidumping duty after a U.S. government probe found that some Italian pasta brands, including La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, were selling their products below U.S. market prices. Combined with the existing 15% tariff on European Union imports, the total duties on Italian-made pasta could rise to 107%.

That would represent one of the Trump administration's highest import duty rates on any product, according to the Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported on the pasta dispute.

If the anti-dumping duty goes into effect, the impact on American consumers would be substantial, according to Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru. Some Italian pasta makers may simply stop exporting their products to the U.S., while others might raise their prices, he added.

"You don't have enough domestic manufacturing to fill up those shelves," Lempert said. "So you're going to walk into the pasta aisle and you're going to see it half empty."

White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS News, "Italian pasta is not 'disappearing.'"

He added that the antidumping duty is a proposal and that it is not yet final. "The pasta makers still have several months to continue participating in this review before this preliminary finding becomes finalized," he said.

Yet some Italian pasta companies are preparing to pull out of U.S. stores as soon as January because of the threat of the new antidumping duty, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Which pasta brands could be affected?

The antidumping duties — a type of federal tariff applied to imported products sold in the U.S. for less than their market value — would impact 13 Italian pasta makers, including La Molisana and Garofalo, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce publication. The companies did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.

What comes next for Italian pasta

Desai, the White House spokesperson, told CBS News that the companies in question failed to adhere to multiple data requests from the Commerce Department as part of a long-running probe into Italian pasta makers that has been ongoing since the mid-1990s.

Desai added that there's no "hard date" for when the duties would take effect.

The Commerce Department and International Trade Administration did not immediately respond to CBS News' requests for comment.

American pasta makers have long accused their Italian rivals of unfairly undercutting them on price. But the Commerce Department's proposal may mark a tipping point for Italian exporters that rely heavily on the U.S. market.

Last year, the U.S. imported pasta from Italy valued at $684 million, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, which offers global trade data.

[TITLE]Qorium Raises 22 Million Euros for Lab-grown Leather; Modern Meadow’s Handbag Collab: Sustainable Scene:
[TEXT]
GOING DUTCH: Dutch biotechnology company Qorium has raised a 22 million euro series A round to accelerate the commercialization of its cultivated leather technology.

“This investment is a powerful vote of confidence in our mission to transform the leather industry,” said Qorium chief executive officer Michael Newton. “By combining cutting-edge science with deep leather expertise and sustainable practices, we are creating real leather that offers better performance than traditional animal-derived leather, without the environmental and ethical costs.”

The round was led by the Dutch national impact investor Invest-NL and Limburg regional development agency LIOF. They joined existing backers Brightlands Venture Partners and Sofinnova Partners, which re-upped their investment, as well as several private investors.

The investment from Invest-NL was made under the European Commission’s InvestEU program.

The funding follows an 8-million-euro raise across two seed rounds, with the first 2.6 million euros raised in 2021, and an additional 7.4 million euros in 2024.

The round will support Qorium in its scaling and commercialization efforts. The company will expand capacity at its Maastricht facility and work to build new partnerships for its lab-grown leather.

Qorium’s lab-grown leather.

The company delivered its first proof of concept with a sample of leather grown from animal cells released last year. The lab process eliminates the need for livestock farming, reduces waste and lowers environmental impact.

“At Invest-NL, we invest in technologies that drive systemic change,” said Invest-NL senior investment manager Lisette Kersting-van der Boog. “Qorium’s leather is a breakthrough innovation that can transform one of the world’s most polluting industries.”

Guillaume Baxter, partner at Sofinnova Partners, added: “This investment reflects Qorium’s impressive progress to date and our strong belief in the economic and sustainability potential of its leather.”

Qorium said that it will appoint a new director to its board in the coming weeks.

NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED: Meanwhile, leather alternative producer Modern Meadow has partnered with German brand Melina Bucher on its first collection of handbags made from its next-gen, animal-free material, Innovera Suede.

Among the offerings are the half-moon shape Loulou style and the elongated architectural style Tessa. A third style, the Bailey, is a structured handle bag with the handles reinforced with Elevate material from Uncaged Innovations. All are handmade in the brand’s Berlin atelier in on-trend deep chocolate tones for winter.

“Our collaboration with Melina Bucher aligns with our ethos of creating products that are good for the planet,” said Modern Meadow chief executive officer David Williamson. “Our innovative bio-design technology offers them the look, feel and smell of suede and gives them the creative freedom to customize their designs for any need. Innovera proves that aesthetics, responsibility and performance can co-exist in one versatile, forward-facing material.”

Modern Meadow was an early pioneer in the lab-grown leather space, before pivoting to bio-fabricated materials. Its Innovera Suede is termed an “animal-free leather alternative” made from plant proteins, biopolymers and recycled tire rubber. The material incorporates more than 80 percent renewable carbon content.

YES, SYRE: Textile impact company Syre has unveiled a multiyear partnership with Nike Inc. to integrate circular, textile-to-textile recycled polyester into Nike’s performance wear, marking a significant step toward “closing the loop” in apparel materials.

Under the agreement, Syre will become Nike’s lead strategic supplier for textile-to-textile recycled polyester. The collaboration reflects Nike’s sustainability ambitions and Syre’s mission to “accelerate the great textile shift.” The first products made with Syre’s circular polyester are expected within the next few years.

“Our partnership with Syre represents a shift in our materials strategy and how we source,” said Nike vice president, materials supply chain Sitora Muzafarova. “Innovation is at the heart of Nike’s DNA and textile-to-textile recycled polyester is essential in our ambition to design and produce breakthrough products that both perform to the highest standards that our athletes expect and are more sustainable at the same time.”

Founded in 2023 by H&M Group and Swedish impact investing firm Vargas Holding, Syre is backed by investors including TPG Rise Climate, Giant Ventures, IMAS Foundation, Leitmotif, Norrsken VC, and Volvo.

For Syre, which is developing a global network of recycling plants starting with its first large-scale facility planned for Vietnam in 2027, the Nike deal marks a pivotal step.

“Having Nike, the global leader in sportswear and innovation, commit to textile-to-textile generated polyester sends a powerful signal to the entire industry,” said Dennis Nobelius, Syre’s chief executive officer. “This is not a one-off initiative or capsule collection; this is a moment when circular materials move from concept to commercial reality at scale.”

Karla Magruder and Eileen Mockus Frank Rocco / Courtesy of Accelerating Circularity

AROUND IN CIRCLES: New York-based nonprofit Accelerating Circularity, dedicated to scaling textile-to-textile recycling, has elevated chief operating officer Eileen Mockus to the chief executive officer role.

Founder and current CEO Karla Magruder will become board chair, and contine to guide the organization’s strategic direction as it seeks to scale operations.

San Francisco-based Mockus brings more than two decades of experience in sustainable textile innovation, including over a decade as president and CEO of organic beddings and home goods company Coyuchi, as well as executive and sourcing positions at Pottery Barn, The North Face, and Patagonia.

“I’m thrilled to step into this role at such a pivotal time,” said Mockus. “The groundwork has been laid, partnerships are strong, and the demand for scalable textile-to-textile recycling has never been greater. Together, we can ensure the transition to a future where textiles are no longer wasted.”

Since its founding in 2019, Accelerating Circularity has convened brands and supply chain actors, brought post-consumer textile-to-textile products to market at scale, and launched working groups for textile chemical recyclers and trim suppliers. The nonprofit also secured a Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action to divert 325 tons of textiles from landfill.

“With Eileen’s expertise and passion for low-impact textile systems, the organization is perfectly positioned to move from pilot programs to industry-wide implementation,” said Magruder.

Accelerating Circularity will continue advancing textile circularity through scalable programs, tools, and commercially viable business models. The group has partnered with companies including Zara parent Inditex, Gap Inc., Nike, Target, Walmart, and Zalando, and most recently revealed a partnership with U.S.-based fashion-technology firm Dhana Inc., which uses AI and data integration digital tools to help brands move toward circular solutions.

[TITLE]E-Commerce Market Shares Analysis, Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033 - AI, 5G, and Secure Payments Propel Growth Amidst Cybersecurity Challenges:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "E-Commerce Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The E-Commerce Market is expected to reach US$ 12.63 trillion by 2033 from US$ 6.56 trillion in 2024, with a CAGR of 7.54% from 2025 to 2033. The market is expanding due to the growing demand for AI-powered features, the substantial expansion of cross-border commerce opportunities, and advancements in safe digital payment systems.

Growth Drivers for the E-Commerce Market

The notable growth in opportunities for cross-border trade. High-speed internet connections' wider reach, the widespread use of smartphones, and the growing accessibility of digital payment methods are all making it much easier for people all over the world to shop from international e-commerce platforms, which is helping the market grow.

The globalization of supply chains, which makes it much simpler for any company to get goods and components from around the globe, is another factor driving the e-commerce market statistics. This gives customers access to a wider range of products, frequently at competitive prices. As more third-party logistics companies appear, the shipping and delivery procedure is shortened considerably, making it easier, faster, and less expensive to complete a cross-border order than it was previously.

Features Driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI-generated interpretations are utilized to improve client satisfaction during sales operations and offer a deeper comprehension of market trends. In addition, virtual fitting rooms are becoming more popular. These rooms use AI for a number of methods, including improving fit prediction accuracy and enhancing the overall shopping experience.

By enabling customers to see how apparel items will appear on them before making a purchase, virtual fitting rooms offer more participatory and captivating experiences. These rooms are offered by many e-commerce businesses since they lower return rates and the related expenses for merchants.

Zalando, a prominent European online fashion and leisure portal, for example, launched a virtual fitting room in 2023 where millions of clients may design a 3D avatar by entering their gender, height, and weight to see how different sizes from different brands might suit them.

The creation of safe online payment methods. The growth of mobile (m)-commerce modes, which enable customers to transact using a mobile application, digital wallet, and contactless technology, is supported by secure digital systems and high individual dependability. Furthermore, the market is still heavily influenced by developments in encryption technology, multi-factor authentication, and the implementation of strict security protocols.

A lot of people feel at ease disclosing their financial information online. High e-commerce platform sales fuel the payment method, which is backed by safe digital payment that facilitates transactions. Additionally, digital payment solutions make it easy for overseas customers to complete transactions with only a few clicks, which supports the expansion of the e-commerce market.

Challenges in the E-Commerce Market

Cybersecurity and Data Privacy. Online businesses have serious difficulties as the risk of identity theft, data breaches, and cyberattacks increases with the volume of e-commerce transactions. Retaining credibility and confidence requires protecting sensitive consumer data, including payment information and personal information.

Cybersecurity methods including encryption, secure payment gateways, and multi-factor authentication are critical to safeguard data and ensure secure transactions. A single breach may result in monetary damages, legal repercussions, and serious harm to one's image. Additionally, companies need to remain in compliance with legislation like the CCPA and GDPR as data protection standards get more stringent. In addition to being required by law, maintaining strong cybersecurity and data privacy procedures is essential for sustained success in the cutthroat e-commerce industry.

Return and Refund Management. Since handling returns and refunds may be expensive and time-consuming, it presents a big issue for e-commerce companies. Consumers demand a smooth and easy return process; therefore, companies must manage product returns, refunds, and item restocking effectively. High return rates can raise operating expenses for things like shipping, inspection, and restocking, particularly in industries like electronics and clothing.

Retaining client loyalty also depends on promptly processing returns while ensuring consumer satisfaction. A company's reputation might be harmed by bad return experiences. Businesses must employ technology to track returns, optimize reverse logistics, and establish clear return procedures in order to manage this. One of the biggest challenges is still managing returns effectively while cutting expenses and preserving a satisfying customer experience.

[TITLE]Business With a Backbone:
[TEXT]
Ulrich Eichelmann has seen many rivers over his lifetime as the head of RiverWatch, an organization dedicated to protecting the world’s waterways. He’s spent time on the Tigris floating through Turkey and Iraq, on the Tagliamento in Italy, and traveled along the Danube as it winds across Europe. Yet none, he said, have measured up to the Vjosa River. From the Greek Pindus Mountains, its rushing headwaters flow 169 miles to Albania’s Mediterranean coast, calming as it finally nears the sea.

“The river is a bit like an intact living being,” Eichelmann said. “It starts young and fast in the mountains of Greece, and it ends as an old river near the Adriatic Sea.”

The Vjosa is dam-free, a rare feat in a world where the majority of rivers are confined by barriers. While hydropower dams may provide so-called “clean” energy, they also destroy ecosystems and emit methane. Fish can get trapped, unable to reach their spawning grounds, while nearby communities can be displaced. The Vjosa, however, remains one of Europe’s last free-flowing systems of water. The entire watershed is still untouched and is now likely to remain that way, thanks to a public-private coalition that created Europe’s first wild river national park in Albania — fighting dozens of planned dams along the way.

Outdoor apparel company Patagonia’s support was integral to the effort, providing both resources and advocacy that helped turn local activists’ bold vision into reality. In 2013, activists launched the Save the Blue Heart of Europe campaign to raise awareness

[TITLE]On Holding Continues to Beat Projections in Third Quarter:
[TEXT]
Story was updated at 4:16 p.m. Wednesday.

Nike may be clawing its way back to popularity, but don’t count out On Holding.

Despite some analyst hesitation that the popular Swiss running brand may be losing some of its steam to a reviving Nike, the company once again posted record sales and profits in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.

“We continue to reiterate that we are on a different journey — to become the most premium brand in the industry,” Martin Hoffmann, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, told WWD.

It appears to be working.

Adjusted net income in the period nearly tripled to 142 million Swiss francs from 50 million Swiss francs in the prior year on a 24.9 percent sales gain, or 34.5 percent on a constant currency basis, to 794.4 million Swiss francs. Adjusted earnings per share were 0.36 Swiss francs, up from 0.09 Swiss francs in the prior year.

This beat Wall Street expectations of a quarterly sales increase of 20.1 percent and adjusted earnings per share of 0.27 Swiss francs.

The company’s direct-to-consumer sales increased 27.6 percent to 14.7 million Swiss francs, or 37.5 percent on a constant currency basis, while sales in the wholesale channel rose 23.3 percent, or 32.5 percent on a constant currency basis, to 479.6 million Swiss francs.

By region, net sales increased 33 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 21 percent in the Americas and 109.2 percent in Asia-Pacific on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific is the company’s fastest-growing region with four consecutive quarters of triple-digit sales growth, and analysts were expecting sales in the American market to slow.

“The U.S. continues to be strong,” Hoffmann said. This comes despite a price increase of around 7 percent on select lifestyle products starting in the second half of the year. He said the company has experienced no resistance to the price hikes. “We continue to power on full-price sales,” he said on an earnings call Wednesday morning, adding that “affluent consumers are not price-sensitive.”

By category, net sales from shoes rose 21.1 percent to 731.3 million Swiss francs; apparel sales increased 86.9 percent to 50.1 million Swiss francs, and accessories sales rose 145.3 percent to 13 million Swiss francs.

Although apparel still represents around 8 percent of overall sales, Hoffmann said it is growing more strongly than footwear. And in the quarter, the company sold more than 1 million pieces of apparel for the first time, and the short-term goal is to raise the total sales percentage of the category to double digits. Hoffmann said on the call that the training and tennis categories are most popular, and the plan for the future is to “attack in additional categories” that can be worn every day.

He added that apparel penetration in the company’s retail stores is much higher, hitting between 10 and 20 percent, and in many cases serves as an introduction to the brand. On the call, he said apparel has become “a key acquisition channel” since apparel shoppers “buy more frequently and with bigger baskets. We are also seeing a clear shift toward younger customers in apparel, highlighting the sizable and well-defined long-term opportunity. Importantly, we are not building apparel as an add-on to our footwear business, but as a company within the company serving the same communities but with a unique product offering and customer experience. As a result, apparel is driving incremental high value growth across all our channels.”

Turning to retail, On operates 60 stores globally with additions in the Ginza in Tokyo; a flagship in its hometown of Zurich; Palo Alto, Calif.; its first South Korean store in Seoul, and a unit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Hoffmann said only a small number of stores are slated to open this year but the company will continue to add between 20 and 25 units a year in the future. “That’s the cadence we had this year,” he said.

While its own stores are an important part of the business, Hoffmann stressed that wholesale continues to be a key cog in its wheel. He said with the big-box stores such as Dick’s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker, there are 60 percent of doors that do not carry the brand. And within the run specialty channel, he expects business to be strong next year as the company introduces new models of some of its key franchises, such as the Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner.

On the earnings call, Caspar Coppetti, cofounder and executive co-chairman of On, singled out New York City Marathon women’s winner Hellen Obiri, an On athlete, who wore the new Cloudboom Strike Lightspray, as proof that its “new technology is being trusted and adopted by the world’s best athletes in the most iconic races. Our strategy is clear. Technology is proven at the highest level of competition and then refined to deliver the best experience for every type of runner. This elite credibility flows directly to our core performance running franchises Cloudsurfer, Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner. These are the engines that have won millions of fans and driven our significant sustained growth in the run category.”

Next year, Coppetti said, the company will launch the Cloudsufer Max, a model featuring “engineering and foam innovations,” as well as the LightSpray Cloudmonster Hyper, a shoe for everyday runners that features the company’s “championship level technology.”

As a result of the strong third-quarter results, the company raised its outlook for the year and is expecting net sales to grow 34 percent on a constant currency basis, to 2.91 billion Swiss francs, up from 31 percent previously. Analysts were expecting sales for the year to increase 28.2 percent. And in 2026, Hoffmann said, the company is projecting growth of at least 23 percent.

Hoffmann said the optimism is driven by the momentum already experienced in the fourth quarter and the strong sales in China. Looking ahead, the company plans to release a holiday campaign and continue to lean into collaborations, such as ones that just released with Loewe, with which it codesigned a Cloudsolo sneaker, as well as a capsule of apparel and footwear with SkyHigh Farm Goods.

Hoffmann declined to say if its partnership with Zendaya will get a refresh later this year, but Coppetti pointed to the popularity of the Cloudzoon Moon shoe collaboration it introduced with her this August as evidence of the company’s ability to blend fashion and performance. The shoe — and the fall collection she wore in the campaign — are helping the brand gain “connection and traction with young, aspirational consumers, especially teens,” he said on the earnings call.

Despite the strong showing, analysts still had some reservations. Tom Nikic of Needham & Co. said although On “remains the strongest growth company in our coverage,” he lowered his price target to $52 from $62 “as we believe that multiples in the second have moved structurally lower.” But he retained his “buy” rating on the stock.

Peter McGoldrick of Stifel also maintained a buy rating on the stock, writing that while there may be a “deceleration in fourth-quarter reported revenue growth and higher operating expenses,” he remained encouraged by the results against a challenging environment.

John Kernan of TD Cowen also retained a buy rating on the stock and reiterated his $55 target, and Cristina Fernandez of Telsey Group said the strong results disproved “concerns of a slowdown due to intense competition and a discerning U.S. consumer.”

Shares on Wednesday of On Holding closed up 18 percent to $41.51.

[TITLE]Mobile Applications Industry Report 2025: Market Trends, Outlook & Strategy Forecast to 2033 - Rising Demand for In-App Purchases Boosts Market Growth Beyond Initial Downloads:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Mobile Application Market Trends, Outlook & Forecast 2025-2033" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Mobile Application Market is expected to reach US$ 740.25 billion by 2033 from US$ 259.55 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 12.35% from 2025 to 2033. Smartphone penetration, 5G penetration, increased internet usage, in-app purchase, mobile commerce expansion, gaming and entertainment app demand, digital shift, AI incorporation, and increasing workplace mobility solutions are some of the key drivers contributing to the mobile application industry.

Growth Drivers for the Mobile Application Market

Rising Smartphone Penetration

One of the primary drivers of the mobile application market is rising smartphone penetration. Mobile users are still growing rapidly as smartphones expand their reach and become cheaper, especially in developing nations. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates 5.4 billion internet users in the world as of 2023, from 5.3 billion in 2022. That's 67% of the population. Increasingly, more individuals are able to access and use mobile apps on a daily basis due to this ubiquitous connectivity. Also, based on industry observers, 21% of millennials use an app as many as 50 times a day, illustrating the rising reliance on apps for productivity, communication, entertainment, and buying. This again propels market growth.

Growing In-App Purchases

The growth of the mobile application market is largely fueled by growing in-app purchases. Through the ability to buy additional features, content, or services within an app, in-app purchases provide developers with a steady revenue stream outside of initial downloads. Especially typical applications of this revenue model are subscription-based, gaming, and lifestyle apps. The aspiration of individualized experiences and high-quality information on the part of users makes them willing to pay for applications. Reliable digital wallets and enhanced payment integrations play their roles in this development. Since more businesses are adopting freemium business models, in-app purchases play a significant role in the mobile app economy due to increased user engagement, retention, and profitability.

AI and Machine Learning Integration

Growth of the mobile app market is primarily fueled by growing in-app purchases. Through allowing users to buy additional features, content, or services inside an app, in-app purchases provide developers with a stable source of revenue aside from upfront downloads. Especially prevalent applications of this monetization strategy are in subscription-based, game, and lifestyle applications. Users' need for personalized experiences and quality information makes them more willing to pay for apps. Secure digital wallets and enhanced payment integrations also make them more likely to do so. Since more and more companies are employing freemium business models, in-app purchases are a significant aspect of the mobile app economy since they raise user engagement, retention, and profitability.

Challenges in the Mobile Application Market

Intense Competition

With millions of apps available on sites like Google Play and the Apple App Store, fierce competition is a major obstacle in the mobile application business. Strong branding, outstanding user experience, and constant innovation are necessary to stand out in such a crowded market. Because of the dominance of established players and short user attention spans, many new apps have difficulty being visible. Without efficient marketing techniques, even top-notch apps could have trouble getting downloaded. In order to keep customers and stay competitive in the market, developers must also provide distinctive features, frequent updates, and interesting content because user expectations are always rising.

Data Privacy and Security

Security and privacy of data are major issues in the market for mobile applications. Because applications gather sensitive user data, including contacts, location, financial information, and personal preferences, it is crucial to make sure that it is handled securely. User trust and brand reputation can be seriously harmed by data breaches or misuse. Developers must abide by stringent legislation such as the CCPA, GDPR, and other local statutes, which call for strong encryption, safe data storage, and open privacy practices. App development becomes more complex and expensive when these measures are put into place. Additionally, the increasing risk of malware and assaults necessitates regular security updates, thus mobile app developers are constantly concerned

[TITLE]E-Commerce Market Shares Analysis, Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033 - AI, 5G, and Secure Payments Propel Growth Amidst Cybersecurity Challenges:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "E-Commerce Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The E-Commerce Market is expected to reach US$ 12.63 trillion by 2033 from US$ 6.56 trillion in 2024, with a CAGR of 7.54% from 2025 to 2033. The market is expanding due to the growing demand for AI-powered features, the substantial expansion of cross-border commerce opportunities, and advancements in safe digital payment systems.

Growth Drivers for the E-Commerce Market

The notable growth in opportunities for cross-border trade. High-speed internet connections' wider reach, the widespread use of smartphones, and the growing accessibility of digital payment methods are all making it much easier for people all over the world to shop from international e-commerce platforms, which is helping the market grow.

The globalization of supply chains, which makes it much simpler for any company to get goods and components from around the globe, is another factor driving the e-commerce market statistics. This gives customers access to a wider range of products, frequently at competitive prices. As more third-party logistics companies appear, the shipping and delivery procedure is shortened considerably, making it easier, faster, and less expensive to complete a cross-border order than it was previously.

Features Driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI-generated interpretations are utilized to improve client satisfaction during sales operations and offer a deeper comprehension of market trends. In addition, virtual fitting rooms are becoming more popular. These rooms use AI for a number of methods, including improving fit prediction accuracy and enhancing the overall shopping experience.

By enabling customers to see how apparel items will appear on them before making a purchase, virtual fitting rooms offer more participatory and captivating experiences. These rooms are offered by many e-commerce businesses since they lower return rates and the related expenses for merchants.

Zalando, a prominent European online fashion and leisure portal, for example, launched a virtual fitting room in 2023 where millions of clients may design a 3D avatar by entering their gender, height, and weight to see how different sizes from different brands might suit them.

The creation of safe online payment methods. The growth of mobile (m)-commerce modes, which enable customers to transact using a mobile application, digital wallet, and contactless technology, is supported by secure digital systems and high individual dependability. Furthermore, the market is still heavily influenced by developments in encryption technology, multi-factor authentication, and the implementation of strict security protocols.

A lot of people feel at ease disclosing their financial information online. High e-commerce platform sales fuel the payment method, which is backed by safe digital payment that facilitates transactions. Additionally, digital payment solutions make it easy for overseas customers to complete transactions with only a few clicks, which supports the expansion of the e-commerce market.

Challenges in the E-Commerce Market

Cybersecurity and Data Privacy. Online businesses have serious difficulties as the risk of identity theft, data breaches, and cyberattacks increases with the volume of e-commerce transactions. Retaining credibility and confidence requires protecting sensitive consumer data, including payment information and personal information.

Cybersecurity methods including encryption, secure payment gateways, and multi-factor authentication are critical to safeguard data and ensure secure transactions. A single breach may result in monetary damages, legal repercussions, and serious harm to one's image. Additionally, companies need to remain in compliance with legislation like the CCPA and GDPR as data protection standards get more stringent. In addition to being required by law, maintaining strong cybersecurity and data privacy procedures is essential for sustained success in the cutthroat e-commerce industry.

Return and Refund Management. Since handling returns and refunds may be expensive and time-consuming, it presents a big issue for e-commerce companies. Consumers demand a smooth and easy return process; therefore, companies must manage product returns, refunds, and item restocking effectively. High return rates can raise operating expenses for things like shipping, inspection, and restocking, particularly in industries like electronics and clothing.

Retaining client loyalty also depends on promptly processing returns while ensuring consumer satisfaction. A company's reputation might be harmed by bad return experiences. Businesses must employ technology to track returns, optimize reverse logistics, and establish clear return procedures in order to manage this. One of the biggest challenges is still managing returns effectively while cutting expenses and preserving a satisfying customer experience.

Online Grocery Adoption Redefines Last-Mile Consumer Expectations in cold Chain Logistics Market

The digital shift in consumer shopping habits is a monumental force. By mid-2025, an estimated 81 million U.S. households are expected to buy their groceries online, creating massive last-mile delivery needs. The number of individual Americans shopping for groceries online is projected to climb from 138.3 million in 2024 to 148.4 million in 2025. This sustained growth is a cornerstone of the modern cold chain logistics market. Consistent high demand is now the new normal for temperature-controlled delivery services.

Sales figures provide a stark illustration of this new reality. U.S. online grocery sales reached an unprecedented peak of US$ 12.5 billion in the single month of September 2025. Impressively, this figure represents a US$ 3 billion increase over September 2024 sales. The market's momentum is undeniable, with sales hitting US$ 10 billion in July 2025 and US$ 9.7 billion in March 2025. Moreover, March 2025 marked the eighth consecutive month where sales exceeded US$ 9.5 billion, while in November 2024, 77.8 million U.S. households participated in online grocery shopping.

Global Quick Commerce Creates New Hyper-Localized Logistics Challenges

The rise of quick commerce places immense pressure on hyper-localized cold chains but favoring the cold chain logistics market growth. Globally, an estimated 1.4 billion consumers are using online grocery services monthly in 2024, setting a broad stage for rapid delivery models. Within this group, a substantial 600 million people worldwide will use quick commerce services for essentials in 2024. The growth trajectory for this sub-sector is steep, with the number of global quick commerce users expected to reach 900 million by 2029.

In the United States, the quick commerce user base is already significant and growing. In 2024, 56.1 million people in the U.S. are using these rapid delivery services. The expansion of this model, exemplified by Amazon's launch of 15-minute deliveries in India in December 2024, intensifies the need for distributed micro-fulfillment centers with sophisticated refrigeration. The cold chain logistics market must adapt to service these on-demand expectations for perishable goods, a trend validated by a 25% rise in such deliveries in India during the 2024 Diwali season compared to 2023.

Critical Cold Storage Infrastructure Expands Amidst Tightening Vacancy Rates

The demand is fueling a wave of new construction in the cold storage sector. In the U.S., five speculative cold storage (SCS) projects were completed in 2024, adding 1.1 million square feet of crucial space. The pipeline remains robust across the cold chain logistics market, with another 2.2 million square feet of speculative cold storage space expected to be completed in the U.S. during 2025. As of early 2024, 15 specialized spec cold buildings were under construction or

[TITLE]Tata Sons' electronics bet crosses $1.3 billion:
[TEXT]
Tata Sons Ltd has ploughed over a billion dollars into its iPhone assembly business since inception, helping it cross watch-and-jewellery brand Titan Ltd in revenue in just four years.

The Tata Group holding company last month invested ₹1,499 crore in Tata Electronics Ltd, its phone assembly and semiconductor venture, bringing its total investment in the business to $1.3 billion. This also makes Tata Electronics the third Tata Sons subsidiary—the others are Air India Ltd and Tata Digital—to receive over $1 billion from its parent in the last four years. Tata Sons' investments in the three businesses now total $11.1 billion, a Mint review of the filings of the three subsidiaries showed.

Tata Sons’ latest annual report said it has invested ₹45,347 crore ($5.1 billion) in Air India, since acquiring the state-owned airline in January 2022. Tata Digital, its e-commerce business comprising BigBasket, Tata 1mg, Croma and Cliq, received nearly $4.7 billion ( ₹42,121 crore) since its inception in March 2019.

New investments in emerging businesses are a key focus for the Tata Group, which channels its investments through the group's holding company.

Tata Sons wants to pursue "manufacturing excellence at scale", chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran wrote to shareholders in the Tata Sons FY25 annual report. Major Tata Sons shareholders include Tata Trusts, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, and various Tata Group companies.

"At Tata Electronics, we are building a vertically integrated ecosystem for technology hardware and semiconductor manufacturing. It is hard, but that is why it matters so deeply to us," Chandrasekaran wrote. “In the capital-intensive world of technology hardware, I am told this is a good start."

Queries emailed to Tata Sons and Tata Electronics went unanswered.

Since beginning in September 2020, Tata Electronics has invested ₹6,961 crore in its iPhone assembly operations. It also spent ₹1,363.52 crore to acquire Wistron Corp’s plant in March last year, and ₹1,650 crore to buy a 60% stake in Pegatron’s India facility. Additionally, ₹50 crore was invested in the semiconductor subsidiary. These amounts total approximately $1.3 billion in investments by Tata Sons in Tata Electronics. The company is India’s single-largest assembler of Apple’s iPhones.

Tata Electronics last year entered chip manufacturing, announcing it will invest over ₹1,18,000 crore ($13 billion) to set up two semiconductor fabrication plants in Gujarat and Assam. The Gujarat plant, at an investment of $11 billion, is in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.

Tata Electronics reported revenue of ₹66,601 crore in FY25, behind Air India, which ended with ₹78,636 crore, and more than twice Tata Digital's ₹32,188 crore, according to Tata Sons’ latest annual report. The electronics business ended with a ₹70 crore loss, much less than the ₹10,859 crore loss from aviation and the ₹4,610 crore loss from e-commerce.

This is no small feat, as Tata Electronics’ ₹66,601 crore revenue surpassed Titan’s ₹60,942 crore, and close to Tata Power Ltd’s ₹66,992 crore. To be sure, Tata Electronics remains a loss-making business, unlike the profitable businesses of Titan and Tata Power. Despite Tata Electronics cutting losses by 92% to ₹69.7 crore ($7.8 million), down from ₹825 crore ($93 million) a year ago, the iPhone assembly margins remain wafer-thin for vendors like Foxconn.

To be sure, production-linked incentives (PLIs) for smartphone assembly expire in March next, and Tata Electronics is yet to spell out its plan to attain profitability. Tata Sons chairman Chandrasekaran also serves on the board of Tata Electronics.

Industry stakeholders, however, are not concerned.

"The smartphone PLI has seen Dixon become a large company in India, while Kaynes and Syrma are now on the path of growth," said Ashok Chandak, president, India Electronics and Semiconductor Association, an industry body. “These success stories have prompted Indian conglomerates to join the field too. Tata has been an early mover, while Larsen & Toubro has set up a dedicated subsidiary for fabless semiconductor engineering. The Murugappa group, too, has ventured into semiconductor testing and assembly—showing the importance of electronics in India's growth over the next decade."

“The primary purpose of the smartphone PLI was to cover for the cost disadvantage that early companies would have had when starting out in India, given that the PLI came when the industry was in its nascent stages. India now has a well-established last-stage assembly ecosystem, and both India and the likes of Apple have gained significantly from it. Now, with component incentives, we're seeing the next tier of value creation that will start to happen, and this will further strengthen the electronics ecosystem," added Ankush Wadhera, managing director and partner, and India leader - semiconductors at Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Tata Electronics employed 65,647 people. This exceeds the 31,749 in aviation and the 39,088 in Tata Digital.

India produced ₹11.3 trillion ($127 billion) worth of electronics goods in FY25, a 19% rise from ₹9.5 trillion ($107 billion) produced in FY24, making the electronics industry one of the fastest-growing sectors, finance ministry data shiwed. Mobile phone exports accounted for
