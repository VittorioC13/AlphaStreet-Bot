[TEXT]
FOCUS is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study evaluating Tonix’s investigational intranasal potentiated oxytocin products in patients with Arginine-Vasopressin Deficiency (AVP-D)

The trial is intended to generate preliminary data to inform future potential clinical studies of oxytocin replacement therapy in AVP-D

CHATHAM, N.J., Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: TNXP) (“Tonix” or the “Company”), a fully integrated biotechnology company with marketed products and a pipeline of development candidates, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the investigator-initiated FOCUS study (NCT04789148) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in adult patients with arginine-vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D), a rare endocrine disorder associated with oxytocin deficiency and adverse mental health outcomes, formerly known as central diabetes insipidus.

“Patients with AVP-D often experience mental health and quality-of-life challenges that are not adequately addressed by current interventions,” said Seth Lederman, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Tonix Pharmaceuticals. “Oxytocin plays an important role in regulating mood and socioemotional functioning, and evidence suggests that AVP-D is associated with oxytocin deficiency. We are pleased to support the FOCUS study at MGH, which will evaluate our investigational intranasal potentiated oxytocin products (TNX-1900/TNX-2900) in this population and may help lay the groundwork for future studies of oxytocin replacement therapy.”

“The FOCUS study uses a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design that enables within-patient comparisons of placebo and investigational intranasal potentiated oxytocin product at different doses,” said Elizabeth Lawson, M.D., M.M.Sc., principal investigator of the study and Director, Interdisciplinary Oxytocin Research Program in the Neuroendocrine Unit, Department of Medicine at MGH. “This approach will provide critical first data to inform future larger-scale clinical trials for patients with AVP-D. Ultimately, our goal is to generate insights that can lead to better treatments and improved quality of life for patients living with this condition.”

The FOCUS study (Feasibility of Oxytocin for Clinical Use and Socioemotional wellbeing) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study that will evaluate single-dose investigational intranasal potentiated oxytocin product at two different doses (6 IU, TNX-2900 and 24 IU, TNX-1900) on markers of anxiety, depression, and socioemotional functioning in patients with AVP-D, formerly known as central diabetes insipidus. An exploratory analysis will assess the effects of two weeks of the investigational products replacement on mental health outcomes.

[TITLE]Turn Therapeutics Provides Shareholder Update Highlighting Continued Execution Across Clinical and Strategic Milestones:
[TEXT]
WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif., Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Turn Therapeutics (Nasdaq: TTRX) (“Turn” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation dermatology, wound, and anti-infective therapies, provides a shareholder update outlining continued progress in the advancement of its clinical programs while highlighting the flexibility of its financing strategy following its dilution-sparing direct listing.

Capital Strategy and Alignment

Turn chose a direct listing structure to prioritize flexibility and long-term shareholder alignment. By bypassing traditional crossover rounds and IPO share issuance, early shareholders maintained their ownership positions.

Through its $85 million GEM Global Yield agreement, the Company entered the market with a flexible, on-demand financing vehicle in place. This structure allows Turn to access capital opportunistically, at times and amounts determined by the Company, and eliminated the need for a traditional offering at the time of listing. It also provides the potential to reduce reliance on future equity offerings.

Pipeline and Development Update

Turn continues to advance its phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of GX-03 as a potential treatment for moderate to severe eczema. As of now, approximately 25% of the targeted sample size has completed the trial with ongoing enrollment continuing.

This study of GX-03, the first topical IL-36/IL-31 inhibitor, is progressing as planned, with topline results anticipated in 2026. A blinded, aggregate safety summary provided by the contract research organization indicated no safety or tolerability concerns across the 25% of participants who have completed the trial, representing over 1,000 total confirmed applications of study product or placebo.

In parallel, the Company continues to advance development of its thermostable intranasal vaccine initiative, with in-vivo studies scheduled to commence in Q4 2025. This global health initiative reflects the Company’s broader mission to make advanced medicine accessible worldwide.

Shareholder Webinar – October 22, 2025, 2:00 PM ET

As previously announced, Turn will host a live shareholder webinar today at 2:00 PM ET to review its development roadmap, capital strategy, and near-term milestones. Participants may join via the following link: Join Live Webinar.

A copy of the recording and any materials used will be available after the presentation on the public relations section of the Company’s website, www.turntherapeutics.com.

[TEXT]
Dapirolizumab pegol (DZP) Phase 3 study presentations in SLE to show efficacy results across multiple clinical endpoints, including low disease activity/remission, flares, fatigue, joint pain and quality of life

Presentation of preclinical study of DZP showing minimal to no human placental transfer

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced upcoming presentations from studies evaluating dapirolizumab pegol (DZP), a novel Fc-free anti-CD40L drug candidate, in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to be presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2025 (October 24-29) in Chicago, Illinois. The presentations will show efficacy results of DZP across multiple endpoints including low disease activity/remission, flares, fatigue, joint pain and quality of life. Additional preclinical data will also be presented, demonstrating minimal to no placental transfer of DZP supporting further study in women before, during and after pregnancy.

“The data we are presenting at ACR Convergence strengthen our understanding of the range of effects dapirolizumab pegol has in systemic lupus erythematosus, suggesting it has the potential to broadly impact this chronic and debilitating disease,” said Diana Gallagher, MD, Head of AD, MS and Immunology Development Units at Biogen. “The novel flare analysis of the Phase 3 data presented at ACR, as well as data on quality-of-life metrics and disease activity, further support the potential of dapirolizumab pegol to be a meaningful new therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus. Biogen is committed to advancing its late-stage clinical pipeline which includes programs focusing on the diverse unmet needs of the lupus community.”

Dapirolizumab pegol is one of only three biologics to report positive Phase 3 data in a global SLE study. The additional data presented from the PHOENYCS GO trial at ACR suggest a broad impact across endpoints in this Phase 3 study. In the Phase 3 study, DZP met the primary endpoint of improvement of moderate-to-severe disease activity as assessed by achievement of BICLA after 48 weeks. As the first key secondary endpoint had a p-value = 0.1776, all subsequent secondary and tertiary endpoints are descriptive and nominal p-values are included. A second Phase 3 study, PHOENYCS FLY (NCT06617325), is ongoing.1,2 Dapirolizumab pegol is being developed under a collaboration between Biogen and UCB.

Details of the presentations are as follows:

[TITLE]Ipsen to acquire ImCheck Therapeutics, expanding its leadership in oncology, strengthening its pipeline:
[TEXT]
Acquisition focused on lead clinical-stage program ICT01 in acute myeloid leukemia, where data from the ongoing Phase I/II EVICTION trial showed high treatment response

ICT01 has the potential to be a new standard of care in combination in first line unfit acute myeloid leukemia, an aggressive blood cancer affecting older adults

Ipsen to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of ImCheck Therapeutics, for which ImCheck Therapeutics’ shareholders will be eligible to receive a closing purchase price of 350 million euros and downstream payments contingent upon achievement of regulatory and sales-based milestones

PARIS AND MARSEILLE, FRANCE, 22 October 2025 – Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) and ImCheck Therapeutics today announced they have entered into a definitive share purchase agreement in which Ipsen will acquire all issued and outstanding shares of ImCheck Therapeutics, a private French biotechnology company pioneering next-generation immuno-oncology therapies. The anticipated acquisition is focused on the lead Phase I/II program ICT01 in first line acute myeloid leukemia (AML)3 patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. ICT01 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody targeting BTN3A, a key immune-regulatory molecule broadly expressed across cancer, and received Orphan Drug Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency in July 2025.

Many AML patients are unable to tolerate intensive chemotherapy and must rely on lower-intensity options, which often deliver limited and short-lived benefit.2 This high-risk, unfit population continues to face a significant unmet medical need, highlighting the urgency for new therapies that can improve survival and quality of life.

“At completion, the acquisition of ImCheck Therapeutics presents an opportunity for us to expand our pipeline in oncology and reinforces our commitment to deliver transformative therapies to the people who need them most,” said David Loew, CEO, Ipsen. “We feel confident that with the ICT01 promising data combined with Ipsen’s global development and commercialization expertise, we are well positioned to start a Phase IIb/III trial in 2026.”

Interim data (n=45) orally presented at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology 20251 from the Phase I/II EVICTION trial showed treatment with ICT01 in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine (Ven-Aza) achieved very encouraging high responses. In this single-arm trial, treatment response nearly doubled relative to those seen in historical standard of care data across all molecular subtypes in newly diagnosed patients including sub-types typically less responsive to standard of care (Ven-Aza).2 ICT01 in combination with Ven-Aza was also shown to be well tolerated, underscoring ICT01’s potential as a novel immunotherapy to improve outcomes for patients with AML.

“We are thrilled to become part of Ipsen, a company whose ambition for transformative care matches our commitment to bringing innovative treatments to patients. This transaction recognizes groundbreaking science originating from French academia,” said Pierre d’Epenoux, CEO, ImCheck Therapeutics. “It also highlights the exceptional work the ImCheck team and our partners have achieved to advance the understanding of butyrophilns and gamma delta T cells. Joining Ipsen will help us accelerate ICT01 toward registrational studies and commercialization. I remain grateful to the patients and investors for their contributions to furthering ImCheck’s pioneering science.”

Transaction details

Under the terms of the agreement, through a wholly owned affiliate of Ipsen SAS, shareholders of ImCheck Therapeutics will receive a 350 million euros payment on a cash-free and debt-free basis at closing of the transaction, and deferred payments contingent upon the achievement of specified regulatory approvals and sales-based milestones, for a total potential consideration up to 1 billion euros.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of Q1 2026, subject to fulfilment of customary closing conditions including the expiration or termination of any required regulatory and governmental approvals under French and U.S. regulations.

Advisors

Allen & Overy Shearman (Paris) is acting as legal counsel to Ipsen. Centerview Partners is acting as exclusive financial advisor to ImCheck Therapeutics with Goodwin (London) and Dentons (Paris) acting as legal counsel.

[TITLE]Electra Therapeutics Announces $183 Million Series C Financing to Advance First-in-Class SIRP-Targeted Therapies for Immune Disorders and Cancer:
[TEXT]
Proceeds will fund a global pivotal trial of lead product candidate, ELA026, as a frontline treatment for secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH)

Financing will also support indication expansion of ELA026 in hematologic cancers and advance second pipeline program, ELA822, into the clinic for diseases in immunology and inflammation (I&I)

Financing co-led by Nextech and EQT Life Sciences, with participation from additional new investors including Sanofi, HBM Healthcare Investments, and Mubadala Capital, alongside existing investors

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Electra Therapeutics, a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering therapies against novel targets for diseases in immunology and cancer, today announced an oversubscribed $183 million Series C financing. The round was co-led by Nextech and EQT Life Sciences, with participation from new investors Sanofi, HBM Healthcare Investments, and Mubadala Capital, as well as existing investors OrbiMed, Redmile Group, New Leaf Venture Partners, Westlake BioPartners, Cormorant Asset Management, Blue Owl Capital, and RA Capital Management.

Proceeds from the financing will fund a global pivotal Phase 2/3 study of ELA026 in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), a hyperinflammatory disease with high mortality and a lack of treatment options. The pivotal study is enrolling patients at research sites across the U.S. and Europe and has initiated dosing. Beyond sHLH, Electra is also evaluating ELA026 in hematologic cancers, where initial clinical data have shown potential for promising therapeutic benefit. The financing will further support advancement of ELA822, Electra’s second SIRP-targeted program that selectively depletes activated T lymphocytes, into the clinic and through initial data readouts.

“We are pleased to have the support of a distinguished group of investors who share our vision to deliver life-changing treatments for patients with underserved diseases,” said Kathy Dong, PharmD, MBA, President and CEO of Electra Therapeutics. “Our team has a proven record of translating novel biology into first-in-class breakthrough therapies, as exemplified by ELA026. With strong momentum, we are driving the pivotal study of ELA026 in sHLH forward and accelerating our second SIRP-targeted program into the clinic.”

Electra has pioneered the development of novel therapies targeting SIRP, a family of cell surface receptors, to selectively deplete pathological immune cells. This approach was clinically validated in the Phase 1b study of ELA026 in sHLH, where frontline treatment with ELA026 in malignancy-associated HLH patients achieved 100% overall survival at 8 weeks, compared with approximately 50% reported for available therapies in historical benchmarks. These results provide a foundation to expand development of ELA026 into additional indications and to advance ELA822 for broad application across immunology and inflammation (I&I).

In conjunction with this financing, Thomas Geninatti, PhD from Nextech will join Electra’s board of directors and Christoph Broja from EQT Life Sciences will join as board observer.

“We are very impressed by the compelling clinical data the Electra team has generated for ELA026 in sHLH, a life-threatening disease with a growing patient population. These encouraging results provide validation for targeting SIRP as a novel mechanism and position Electra to expand its application across immunology and oncology,” said Thomas Geninatti, PhD. “We look forward to partnering with Electra to advance the company’s pipeline and help bring new therapeutic breakthroughs to patients.”

About Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH)

Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is a rare, life-threatening hyperinflammatory disease with a lack of treatment options. It can be triggered by cancer, infection, autoimmune disease, or immunotherapy. sHLH is associated with a severe inflammatory response that requires immediate intervention. Without effective treatment, patients may experience multiorgan failure and death. sHLH is associated with high mortality early in the disease course, with malignancy-associated HLH (mHLH) patients having a mortality rate of approximately 50% at two months with available therapies.

About Electra Therapeutics

Electra Therapeutics is a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering therapies against novel targets for diseases in immunology and cancer. The company’s lead product candidate, ELA026, is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets signal regulatory proteins (SIRP) on immune cells to selectively deplete pathological myeloid cells and T lymphocytes. ELA026 is currently in pivotal development for secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) and is also being evaluated in additional indications. Electra is further advancing a second SIRP-targeted program, ELA822, designed to selectively deplete activated T lymphocytes, with broad potential across immunology and inflammation (I&I).
