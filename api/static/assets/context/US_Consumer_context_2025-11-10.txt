[TITLE]Lendlease REIT to Acquire 70% of PLQ Mall to Expand its Suburban Retail Portfolio in Singapore:
[TEXT]
Key Highlights

Following the acquisition, Singapore will represent 89% of the portfolio – reinforcing geographic focus while enhancing income stability and portfolio resilience.

Prime location with excellent connectivity to support long-term income growth.

Agreed property value of S$885.0 million represents approximately 2.1% discount on its latest valuation.

Post acquisition, gearing will be 38.3% on a pro forma basis.

Distribution per unit to increase by 2.5% on a pro forma basis.

SINGAPORE, Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lendlease Global Commercial Trust Management Pte. Ltd. (the “Manager”), the manager of Lendlease Global Commercial REIT (“Lendlease REIT”), is pleased to announce that DBS Trustee Limited, in its capacity as trustee of Lendlease REIT (the “Trustee”), has entered into (a) a unit purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party (the “Seller”) to acquire 70% indirect interest in PLQ Mall (the “Property”) via the acquisition of 70% of the total issued units in PLQM Trust, which holds an approximately 100% interest in the Property; and (b) a share purchase agreement with the Seller to acquire a 70% interest in the trustee-manager of PLQM Trust.

Upon completion of the transaction, Lendlease REIT’s total asset value will increase to S$3.9 billion (post completion of the Jem Office Divestment by 12 November 2025) with Singapore representing 89% of the portfolio. This reflects the continued execution of Lendlease REIT’s Singapore-focused growth strategy to acquire higher-yielding assets with long-term income growth potential.

The enlarged portfolio will be well-positioned to deliver consistent growth, with the proportion of essential services expected to rise from approximately 57.7% to 59.9% of the retail gross rental income. Trade sector mix by gross rental income will be more balanced, reducing tenant concentration risks. In addition, the suburban retail component will expand to 62.7%, supported by consumer demand for essential services and the stable, recurring income generated by well-located suburban malls.

Mr. Guy Cawthra, Chief Executive Officer of the Manager, said, “This acquisition marks a strategic step forward in strengthening our resilient suburban retail portfolio in Singapore. It offers immediate DPU accretion for Lendlease REIT’s unitholders, underpinned by an attractive entry valuation. With gearing expected to be approximately 38%, we continue to deliver sustainable growth while maintaining financial prudence.”

Agreed Property Value and Net Property Income (“NPI”) Yield

The agreed property value was arrived on a willing-buyer and willing-seller basis after taking into account the appraised value by Knight Frank Pte Ltd as at 31 October 2025. The agreed property value of S$885.0 million is approximately 2.1% or S$19.0 million discount to the appraised value. The agreed property value is determined on the basis of a 100% interest in the Property. The NPI yield is 4.5%1 based on the agreed property value.

Method of Financing

The total cost of the acquisition is approximately S$246.8 million, comprising (a) S$234.3 million for the sale of units consideration and sale of shares consideration; (b) the acquisition fee payable to the Manager of approximately S$6.2 million; and (c) other acquisition-related fees and expenses of approximately S$6.3 million.

The Manager intends to finance the total cost of the acquisition from the proceeds of the private placement offering of no less than S$270.0 million2 launched on 5 November 2025.

The transaction is not subject to unitholders’ approval under Rule 1014(3) of the Listing Manual.

[TITLE]How This Pizza Chain Quietly Became The Go-To Spot In America:
[TEXT]
Domino's has built a reputation of being a technology company that happens to sell pizza. Its strategic emphasis on developing innovative and convenient delivery technology has greatly paid off for the chain. One of its pivotal inventions is the Pizza Tracker, which was the first of its kind. The tool was launched in 2008 and allowed customers to track exactly what stage of creation and/or delivery their meal is at in real time. See how to use Domino's Pizza Tracker to monitor orders.

In 2008, awareness of online ordering was much lower than it is now, but Domino's found that customers who ordered online (instead of in-store or over the phone) reported much higher satisfaction. The Pizza Tracker was the key to capitalizing on this insight, and due to its transparency and efficiency, the tool skyrocketed in popularity. Being able to track your order from the moment it was placed to delivery was a novel idea at the time. Today, more than 1.8 billion orders have been placed using the tracker. Not to mention, this tool inspired several other pizza restaurants to create their own tracking systems as well.

AI farm robots and food aid stalemate raise concerns over jobs and food security

AI Farm Robots Threaten Jobs: South Korea’s Doosan Robotics and Dae Dong deploy AI-powered agricultural robots for crop picking and weeding, accelerating automation that could displace millions of farmworkers globally, particularly undocumented laborers in California.

South Korea’s Doosan Robotics and Dae Dong deploy AI-powered agricultural robots for crop picking and weeding, accelerating automation that could displace millions of farmworkers globally, particularly undocumented laborers in California. Senate Democrats Block SNAP Funding: Political gridlock leaves 42 million Americans without food aid as Senate Democrats refuse to pass SNAP funding unless healthcare for illegal immigrants is included, worsening food insecurity and potential civil unrest.

Political gridlock leaves 42 million Americans without food aid as Senate Democrats refuse to pass SNAP funding unless healthcare for illegal immigrants is included, worsening food insecurity and potential civil unrest. Engineered Scarcity & Control: Critics warn of a deliberate globalist agenda—automation eliminates jobs while engineered food scarcity forces dependence on government-controlled systems, digital IDs, and social credit schemes for rationing.

Experts recommend upskilling with AI tools, growing local food resilience (home gardens, CSAs), and shifting savings into gold/silver to hedge against economic collapse and automation-driven unemployment. Coordinated Depopulation Strategy: The simultaneous push for AI labor replacement and denial of food aid suggests a manufactured crisis to weaken autonomy, mirroring tactics used in Gaza, with warnings of impending societal collapse.

South Korea’s AI-Driven Agricultural Robots Accelerate Automation While Senate Democrats Block SNAP Funding

In a stunning technological leap, South Korea’s Doosan Robotics and Dae Dong have unveiled AI-powered agricultural robots capable of replacing human farmworkers—accelerating fears of mass unemployment while Senate Democrats continue blocking Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding, leaving 42 million Americans without food aid.

The convergence of these two crises—automation displacing labor and political gridlock starving millions—has critics warning of a deliberate globalist agenda: eliminating human jobs while destabilizing societies through engineered scarcity.

AI Robots Set to Replace Farmworkers

Doosan Robotics, in partnership with agricultural giant Dae Dong, has developed AI-driven robots capable of picking crops, weeding, and performing complex farm tasks at near-human efficiency. These machines, equipped with edge AI (onboard processing rather than cloud dependency), are designed to operate in unstructured environments, meaning they can adapt to real-world farming conditions without constant human oversight.

While initial models may appear clumsy ("Robo clowns stumbling around farms," as one observer noted), experts predict rapid advancements—mirroring the explosive progress seen in AI text generation (ChatGPT) and video synthesis. Within two years, these robots could outperform human laborers in speed, endurance, and cost-effectiveness.

The implications are dire for migrant workers, particularly in California’s Central Valley, where undocumented laborers currently dominate crop harvesting. If AI automation accelerates as predicted, millions of agricultural jobs—both domestic and abroad—could vanish, exacerbating poverty in low-income nations reliant on remittances from overseas workers.

Political Showdown Over SNAP Funding

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have blocked SNAP funding 13 times, refusing to pass a budget unless it includes healthcare for illegal immigrants—a demand Republicans reject as fiscally irresponsible and politically motivated.

The USDA has issued an urgent warning:

"Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program. Bottom line, the well has run dry… Mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us are being denied critical nutrition assistance."

With 42 million Americans dependent on SNAP benefits, the standoff risks food-related violence, as desperation grows among low-income families. Reports of parking lot robberies and supermarket confrontations are already emerging—fulfilling warnings that societies are "nine meals away from anarchy."

Globalist Agenda: Depopulation and Control

Critics argue that both trends—AI replacing human labor and engineered food scarcity—align with the globalist depopulation playbook:

Automation Eliminates Jobs – AI and robotics displace workers, reducing economic independence and increasing reliance on government-controlled systems. Food as a Weapon – By destabilizing food access, governments can enforce compliance through rationing, digital IDs, and social credit systems. Immigration Manipulation – Democrats rely on illegal immigrants for census counts and electoral influence. AI automation threatens this strategy by removing the need for migrant labor.

Survival Strategies in the Age of Automation

For those facing displacement, experts recommend:

Upskilling with AI – Learn to leverage AI tools (coding, marketing, consulting) rather than competing against them.

– Learn to leverage AI tools (coding, marketing, consulting) rather than competing against them. Local Food Resilience – Grow your own food or join community-supported agriculture (CSA) networks.

– Grow your own food or join community-supported agriculture (CSA) networks. Financial Independence – Shift savings into gold, silver, and decentralized assets to hedge against currency collapse.

Conclusion: A Manufactured Crisis?

The simultaneous push for AI farm robots and denial of food aid suggests a coordinated effort to weaken labor autonomy while tightening control over survival essentials. As Mike Adams warns:

"Everything they did to Gaza, they plan to do to you."

The question remains: Will Americans wake up to the engineered collapse—or will they be left starving in the shadow of the machines?

[TITLE]Shoe Firms Get a China Tariff Break — But Trade Policy Still Unclear:
[TEXT]
firms got a holiday gift from the Trump administration in the form of a one-year hold on any additional China tariffs on imports to the U.S.

An executive order on the White House site disclosed further details on the modification of reciprocal tariff rates in the new trade arrangement between the U.S. and China. Much of the talk when the arrangement was first disclosed on Oct. 30 was centered on a one-year time period in connection with rare earth minerals. The presidential action in the new order clarified that the U.S. will suspend “heightened reciprocal tariffs” on imports from China through 12:01 a.m ET on Nov. 10, 2026.

The caveat in the executive order is that the U.S. will monitor conditions to ensure that China adheres to the trade terms, and if not, Trump “may modify this order as necessary.”

Before the new trade arrangement, the tariff threat on China imports was 100 percent starting on Nov. 1. The new trade deal has tariffs on China shoe imports in the range of 20 percent to 27 percent, depending on classification and not including existing duties. The new rate range is better than what it was as it is both lower than the temporary reciprocal rate of 30 percent and even lower than the original threat of a 55 percent duty rate.

For the industry, the new trade deal does present some form of a guarantee for most of 2026.

“We welcome the pause on further tariff escalation, and are optimistic it will bring some much-needed clarity for companies planning for 2026 and beyond,” said Steve Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA). “Still, true long-term stability demands durable trade agreements and renewed commitments with all of our key sourcing partners, especially while the fashion industry continues to bear disproportionately high MFN (Most Favored Nation) and Section 301 tariffs.”

“In spite of the fact that tariffs on footwear from China remain elevated — even with the reduction in the fentanyl tariff — the White House has provided some much-needed sourcing certainty with China for the foreseeable future. I’ve spoken to dozens of shoe companies since last week, and all have expressed relief that we might actually experience some policy stability out of Washington for at least the next year,” Matt Priest, president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA), said.

Priest noted that for footwear, the U.S. has now established equal tariff rates across “most of the countries we source from in Asia. All things considered, our members will be able to determine their best sourcing strategies based more on normal market realities and less on shifting or inconsistent tariff policy.”

Tariff uncertainties in 2025 presented one big operating headache for shoe companies. And the complexities of footwear production and working with upstream suppliers meant that for some firms it was just easier to stay put.

“The reduction in China tariffs to 20 percent is certainly better than 30 percent, but still too high. We pay the tariffs at the time our shoes are imported and the now 20 percent tariffs put considerable pressure on our cash flow,” said Rick Muskat, president and chief operating officer of Deer Stags. “In addition, we have not been able to establish sufficient price increases with our retail partners to offset the hit to our margins. So, while better…still terrible.”

Muskat said that currently, with the tariff regime in place, “we see no reason to move production from China, which isn’t easy to do.”

For some who moved out of China, moving back could be an option in some instances, said one footwear expert, citing extra costs and timing due to logistics and requirements to avoid transhipping penalties for production outside of China.

Steve Madden Ltd. is one example of a firm that moved a large portion of production out of China in anticipation of higher rates. But CEO Edward Rosenfeld told Wall Street analysts in August that the company returned some work for fall back to China after considering the ability to ensure on-time delivery, product quality and/or unreasonable pricing in an alternative country.

And in Wednesday’s conference call to investors after posting third quarter results, Rosenfeld expressed caution in connection to where the firm chooses to source, even though the reduction in the tariff rate on China is a welcome development. While the math might indicate a move back to China is a good idea, he was advocating for the need to remain flexible.

“I think that we’re going to be careful

[TITLE]Should you subscribe to Pine Labs’ IPO?:
[TEXT]
The IPO of prominent fintech player Pine Labs is live and open for subscription until Tuesday. It is a combination of a fresh issue of shares worth ₹2,080 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of ₹1,820 crore. The company is professionally run without promoter holding, and a clutch of investors, including those such as Peak XV Partners (Sequoia), Macritchie Investments (Temasek), PayPal and Mastercard, are set to offload a part of each of their stake in the OFS.

Pine Labs, founded in 1998, is a leading player in the digital payments space with a B2B business model. Its revenue model is dealt with in detail later. It operates in the lucrative, high growth fintech industry whose market size (by value of payments) is expected to double in the next four years from $1.4 trillion (₹117 lakh crore) as of FY25, as per a Redseer analysis in the RHP. Market size of only those sub-segments that are comparable to Pine Labs’ business model is considered here.

The company has showcased good growth in key revenue drivers such as number of merchants, transactions and gross transaction value (GTV), which has led to a 19 per cent CAGR in revenue between FY23 and FY25. It has been profitable at an adjusted EBITDA level (largely adjusted for ESOP cost) over FY23-25 and in Q1 FY26, but turned PAT positive only in Q1 FY26. However, this profitability can be attributed to a deferred tax credit.

At the upper band of the issue price, the issue is valued at an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple of 10.3x on a post-issue basis (based on FY25 revenue). The company does have levers that can drive its financial progress. However, considering the factors that investors need to mind and the downside risks if the company doesn’t execute well, such valuation does not present an attractive risk-reward proposition, in our view. Hence, we suggest investors avoid the IPO for now and wait for better entry opportunities while closely monitoring the company’s execution capabilities.

Over 95% of international data and voice call traffic travels through nearly a million miles of underwater communication cables. These cables carry government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming around the world. The first commercial telecommunication subsea cable was used for telegraphs and was laid across the English Channel between Dover, England and Calais, France in 1850. The technology then evolved to coaxial cables that carried telephone conversations, and most recently, fiber optics that ferry data and the internet as we know it. "

Is 2025 a possible “ChatGPT moment” for stablecoins ? It might be, though given the glacial pace at which the new payment technology is making inroads into everyday shopping, it might be easy to miss the change.Take EBANX. It’s a payments facilitator like Stripe Inc., though focused on shoppers in emerging markets in Latin America, Africa, and Asia who want to buy from global businesses like AliExpress, Uber, Airbnb, and Spotify. “Today, 100% of our customers are paying with fiat money,” João Del Valle, cofounder and chief executive officer of EBANX, told me on the sidelines of the Hong Kong FinTech Week. “The mainstream user is not using stablecoins.”Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Group Inc.’s USDC are the world’s two most popular stablecoins — privately issued, 1:1 digital clones of the official US currency. These tokens that change hands pseudonymously on the blockchain came into being a little over a decade ago as a bridge between risky cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether and conventional bank deposits. But now that most major markets have come up with regulations such as the Genius Act in the US, issuers’ next goal is to take these virtual representations of fiat money mainstream.To some extent, it’s already happening in Latin America, where dollar stablecoins are bringing stability to savers fleeing currency volatility and inflation. However, for their combined market value to swell from $315 billion to Citigroup Inc.’s baseline forecast of $1.6 trillion by 2030, it’s the shoppers who have to chip in. They must be able to save money or time by allowing these blockchain tokens to become a part of an already long menu of near-instantaneous, 24x7 digital payment options. EBANX works with two that are considered global success stories: Pix in Brazil, and Unified Payments Interface, or UPI, in India. What additional value can stablecoins offer in everyday purchases?Commerce on the internet is an obvious application. Both e-commerce and the blockchain are intrinsically global. Which is why payment services firms like EBANX are enabling merchants to accept tokens like USDT and USDC just as easily as dollars or euros. Del Valle, however, is not expecting an overnight miracle.McKinsey & Co. estimates that stablecoins account for less than 1% of the global daily money transfer volume, though the consulting firm also notes that at current rates of growth, they could surpass legacy payments in less than a decade.For that bold forecast to come true, smart contracts, or the software programs that automate the actions required in a blockchain transaction, will have to play a large role. They can help save costs by reducing manual intervention in anti–money-laundering and sanctions checks. The algorithms may also direct money to a highly specific use. Take the case of a Chinese tourist who wants to pay in yuan from her Alipay+ wallet, but the shop in Singapore only accepts funds arriving into GrabPay, a popular wallet in Southeast Asia. XSGD, a virtual representation of the Singapore dollar, is programmed to make this cross-border transaction go through instantaneously.The Monetary Authority of Singapore has already said that XSGD — and its cousin, XUSD — are substantively compliant with its upcoming stablecoin regulations. StraitsX, which issues the tokens, is now a major payment institution in the Asian financial center. When the local startup decided to experiment with stablecoins as a side project in 2019, most regulators didn’t know enough
