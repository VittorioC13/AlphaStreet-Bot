[TITLE]Feedzai Raises $75 Million; Partners with ECB to Safeguard Digital Euro:
[TEXT]
Fraud and financial crime prevention platform Feedzai has secured $75 million in funding at a valuation of $2 billion.

The company also announced that the European Central Bank (ECB) has selected it as the first-ranked provider for fraud and risk management for the digital euro, slated to be launched by 2029.

Founded in 2011 and headquartered in Portugal, Feedzai made its Finovate debut at FinovateEurope 2014.

In a big start to the month of October, fraud and financial crime prevention platform Feedzai has announced both a major funding round and a deal with the European Central Bank (ECB) to safeguard the digital euro.

First up, the funding. Feedzai has secured $75 million in a round that featured participation from new institutional investors Lince Capital, Iberis Capital, and Explorer Investments, as well as existing investors Oxy Capital and Buenavista Equity Partners. The funding, which takes Feedzai’s total capital raised to more than $352 million according to Crunchbase, gives the Portugal-based fintech a valuation of $2 billion.

In a statement, Lince Capital CEO Vasco Pereira Coutinho praised Feedzai for its use of AI and the company’s “end-to-end approach to risk operations.” Coutinho also underscored Feedzai’s ability to “execute across multiple product lines while scaling globally.”

Feedzai CEO and Co-Founder Nuno Sebastião spoke to the strong pace of innovation in the fraud prevention space, and pointed to the importance of future-proofing financial crime fighting technology. “This new investment round enables us to continue driving innovation to defend against whatever comes next, so that every form of payment, even those yet to be imagined, can be trusted and adopted safely,” Sebastião said.

Second, the ECB deal. The same day that Feedzai announced its major funding, the company also reported that the European Central Bank (ECB) has selected it as the first-ranked tenderer in its framework agreement to provide the central fraud detection and prevention solution for the to-be-launched digital euro. The framework agreement outlines the providers for five different digital euro components and related services: alias lookup, risk and fraud management, app and software development kit, offline solutions, and secure exchange of payment information. Feedzai is one of two providers in the risk and fraud management component; Capgemini Deutschland is the designated second provider. Service requests, according to the framework, will be initially directed to first-rank providers with second-rank providers contacted only as needed.

The framework agreement for the risk and fraud management component for the digital euro has been valued at €79.1 million ($92.8 million), with a maximum value of €237.3 million ($277.3 million). For its part, Feedzai is partnering with subcontractor PwC to deliver a state-of-the-art central fraud detection and prevention mechanism that complies with EU security, privacy, and data protection standards.

“Being selected as the first-ranked tenderer in the framework agreement to secure the digital euro is both an honor and a responsibility,” Feedzai’s Sebastião said. “With tens of billions of transactions expected across the eurozone, success depends on AI that can adapt as quickly as fraud evolves. Our role is to provide the intelligence that keeps even the most sophisticated fraud out, ensuring trust in every digital euro transaction from day one.”

Founded in 2011 and headquartered in Lisbon, Portugal, Feedzai made its Finovate debut at FinovateEurope 2014. Today, the company defends 900 million people in 190 countries from fraud with an end-to-end financial crime prevention platform that features AI-native solutions. Over the past year, Feedzai has launched a number of key products including its Feedzai Orchestration and Feedzai IQ, which empower financial institutions to make better, faster risk assessments. Feedzai has also introduced the TRUST Framework to embed fairness, explainability, and security into every component of GenAI model development.

In April, Feedzai acquired data management platform and fellow Finovate alum DemystData in a deal valued at $157 million.

[TITLE]Vestiaire Collective Names Bernard Osta Chief Executive Officer:
[TEXT]
Vestiaire Collective, a leading global platform for pre-owned luxury fashion, has promoted Bernard Osta to chief executive officer. He succeeds Maximilian Bittner, who has led the company for the past seven years.

Bittner remains a shareholder but no longer holds a position in the company.

Based in Paris, Osta has been part of Vestiaire Collective since May 2021. He had been chief strategy officer from May 2021 to August 2023, and chief financial officer from September 2023 to September 2025. Before joining Vestiaire, Osta spent time advising businesses strategically as an investment banker for 15 years at Lazard (2006 to 2011) and Goldman Sachs (2011 to 2021) in New York and Paris. He also serves as independent member of the supervisory board of media and entertainment group Vivendi.

A statement from Vestiaire’s board said: “We want to thank Maximilian Bittner for his dedication and the significant role he has played in the development of the company since he joined in late 2018. We wish him every success in his future professional projects. Looking forward, we are very happy to open a new chapter under the leadership of Bernard. We have worked very closely with him since he joined Vestiaire Collective. His intimate knowledge of the company, international experience and great leadership will be invaluable assets for Vestiaire Collective in its next phase of growth.”

Osta said: “I am very honored to take the role of chief executive officer of Vestiaire Collective and lead the highly talented team we have built over the years. Vestiaire Collective has secured a unique position as the ultimate trusted marketplace in the highly attractive pre-loved luxury fashion industry. Together, we will continue to transform fashion giving a second life to the most desirable pieces, at the service of a more sustainable model. This is a particularly exciting moment for the company. With the rise of AI, we have an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate on our product roadmap, deliver the most engaging customer experience and gain market share.”

Under this new leadership, Vestiaire will continue to deliver on its mission to transform the fashion industry toward a more sustainable future by focusing on several strategic priorities. According to the company, they include driving innovation at the crossroads of luxury, technology and sustainability; implementing the company’s extensive AI-enabled product roadmap to improve the buyers’ and sellers’ experience at an accelerated pace; increase Vestiaire’s reach and brand awareness through innovative and impactful marketing in its core regions across Europe, the U.S. and Asia-Pacific, and invest in the company’s leading authentication capabilities to further confirm its strategic position as the ultimate trusted marketplace in the pre-loved fashion industry.

Vestiaire, a certified B Corp., features a catalog of over 5 million items and is active in 70 countries.

Last July, the company named Samina Virk global chief marketing officer, adding to her current duties as U.S. chief executive officer. Earlier this year, Vestiaire wrapped up a three-year campaign to tackle textile waste, which has included a ban on fast-fashion brands. In November 2023 Vestiaire blacklisted 30 fashion brands including H&M, Mango, Uniqlo and Zara from being bought, sold or listed on its platform, and continued adding brands such ultra-fast-fashion players Temu and Shein. The company began an influencer education campaign in November 2024 to help change the narrative around popular social media “hauls,” call attention to marketing tactics and nudge consumer behavior.

Last week, the company said it became the first pre-owned fashion business to monetize its avoided emissions into measurable and additional carbon credits. The company’s new approach involves issuing credits that quantify the amount of emissions that were prevented from being used when consumers purchased pre-loved fashion instead of buying new.

During Bittner’s tenure as chairman and CEO, Vestiaire acquired and integrated U.S competitor Tradesy in 2022 and built strategic partnerships with brands such as Gucci, Chloé, Burberry and e-commerce platform Mytheresa. Prior to joining Vestiaire, Bittner was a senior advisor for Alibaba Group.

[TITLE]Reading the ENISA Threat Landscape 2025 report:
[TEXT]
Reading the ENISA Threat Landscape 2025 report

Pierluigi Paganini October 06, 2025 October 06, 2025

ENISA Threat Landscape 2025: Rising ransomware, AI phishing, and state-backed espionage mark a converging, persistent EU cyber threat landscape.

ENISA Threat Landscape 2025 report provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolving threat landscape in Europe. The report analyzes the events that occurred between July 2024 and June 2025, including nearly 4,900 verified incidents. This year’s edition combines technical depth with strategic insights.

The report emphasizes how the threat landscape is maturing, characterized by the rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities, the professionalization of cybercrime, and the increasing convergence between criminal, state-aligned, and hacktivist operations.

“In parallel, hacktivist tooling and criminal ecosystems increasingly intersect. FunkSec’s emergence in late 2024 brought FunkLocker ransomware, blending political messaging with financial extortion, underscoring how quickly ideology-driven branding can pivot to monetisation.” reads the report. “Hacktivists, seeking funding and visibility, embraced ransomware beyond DDoS and defacements. CyberVolk, operating in line with Russian interests, has used and promoted multiple strains—AzzaSec, HexaLocker, Parano, as well as LockBit and Chaos—since May 2024. KillSec, originally a pro-Russia hacktivist brand aligned with Anonymous, debuted its platform in June 2024.”

Ransomware continues to be one of the most dangerous threats, it represents the most disruptive and economically damaging activity across the EU. ENISA notes that ransomware groups have decentralized operations following major law enforcement actions, adopting aggressive double- and triple-extortion tactics and exploiting regulatory compliance fears to pressure victims.

The growth of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), public leaks of builder tools, and the rise of access brokers have dramatically lowered barriers to entry, fostering a diverse and resilient criminal marketplace.

State-sponsored and state-aligned actors have simultaneously escalated long-term cyber-espionage campaigns, particularly targeting telecommunications, logistics networks, and manufacturing sectors within the EU. These operations showcase advanced tradecraft, including supply-chain compromises, modular malware, and abuse of signed drivers to maintain persistence and evade detection.

A striking element of the report is the dominance of hacktivist operations, which account for almost 80% of all recorded incidents. These are primarily low-impact Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) campaigns motivated by ideology or geopolitics, often leveraging low-cost, easily available tools. While their direct impact remains limited, their scale demonstrates how cyber operations have become instruments of digital protest and influence.

From a sectoral perspective, public administration remains the most frequently targeted (38% of cases), followed by transport, where maritime and logistics infrastructure have faced significant disruption from both ransomware and espionage campaigns. Aviation and freight operations also experienced incidents affecting continuity, while digital infrastructure and online services continue to attract attention from both ransomware operators and espionage actors.

Phishing remains the primary intrusion vector (60%), evolving toward industrialized, subscription-based models such as Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS). These platforms enable even low-skilled adversaries to conduct sophisticated campaigns, leveraging AI-generated content, synthetic media, and automation. Meanwhile, vulnerability exploitation (21.3%) remains a cornerstone of initial access, with adversaries often weaponizing newly disclosed flaws within days. ENISA stresses the urgency of timely patching and robust cyber hygiene as key defense measures.

A growing concern highlighted in the report is the role of Artificial Intelligence. By early 2025, AI-assisted phishing and social engineering accounted for over 80% of observed global activity in this category. Attackers are exploiting jailbroken AI models, synthetic voice and video content, and model poisoning to automate reconnaissance, impersonation, and influence operations, making detection and attribution increasingly difficult.

“As a predictable trend, Large Language Models (LLMs) are leveraged to craft more convincing phishing

emails; with reportedly over 80% of all phishing emails identified between September 2024 and February

2025 using AI to some extent. AI is notably used in vishing and online fraud involving impersonation, with the use of deepfakes, as well as for malware development.” continues the report. “Threat groups were observed to be leveraging commercial LLMs to augment operations, as well as jailbroken or retrained (diverted) LLMs such as WormGPT, EscapeGPT and FraudGPT, to automate social engineering activities and accelerate the development of malicious tools.”

Overall, the ENISA Threat Landscape 2025 describes a convergent and persistent threat environment, one where traditional distinctions between cybercrime, espionage, and hacktivism are increasingly blurred. Rather than single high-impact attacks, Europe now faces continuous, diversified, and overlapping campaigns that collectively erode resilience and trust.

ENISA concludes by urging EU Member States and organizations to prioritize cross-sector collaboration, enhance situational awareness, and embed resilience through improved vulnerability management, threat intelligence sharing, and investment in cybersecurity capacity building. The report paints a clear picture: the European threat landscape is no longer defined by isolated incidents, but by a constant, adaptive pressure on digital infrastructure and society as a whole.

[TITLE]The State of AI Competition in Advanced Economies:
[TEXT]
October 06, 2025

The State of AI Competition in Advanced Economies

Alex Haag

Global competition in artificial intelligence (AI) has intensified in recent years. Some assessments emphasize US exceptionalism, while others argue that China is eroding US dominance. By contrast, the progress of other advanced foreign economies (AFEs) receives far less attention. Existing cross-country comparisons rely largely on composite indices that, while useful as benchmarks, are subject to weighting and aggregation biases that may obscure important dimensions of AI capacity. A clearer understanding of cross-country AI capabilities can help better contextualize global AI competition.

This note brings together international comparisons on key metrics to assess countries' relative preparedness and performance in AI. The analysis shows that the United States retains important advantages in infrastructure (with the exception of electricity-related infrastructure), compute capacity, and investment conditions. AFEs face greater challenges in scaling compute resources and attracting investment. China has achieved rapid gains in research output and adoption, though its position in enabling infrastructure is less clear.1 Taken together, these comparisons suggest a global landscape in which, despite increased competition in research and applied domains, US strengths in core AI enablers remain durable.

1. Cross-Country Comparisons Using AI Indices

We start with several widely cited indices of AI capacity and preparedness to provide an initial view of the global landscape (Table 1).2 The United States consistently ranks at or near the top, with the United Kingdom close behind and Italy lowest among G7 members. China's ranking varies from just below the United States on some indices (e.g., GII, Stanford) to significantly lower than most AFEs on others (e.g., IMF, Oxford).

These indices are a useful starting point but have limitations. Methodological approaches, such as indicator selection, weighting, and aggregation, can potentially obscure core metrics of AI performance and penalize diverse national AI strategies (Greco et al., 2018). Still, these indices highlight key areas for comparison: physical and digital infrastructure, investment and firm dynamics, and adoption across the economy. The rest of this note delves deeper into these dimensions, focusing on key metrics to provide a clearer picture of global AI capabilities.

Table 1: Cross-Country Comparison in Selected Technology and Artificial Intelligence Indices

WIPO GII IMF AI Preparedness Index Stanford Global AI Vibrancy Tool Oxford Insights GAIRI Country Score Rank Score Rank Score Rank Score Rank United States 62.4 3 0.77 3 70.06 1 87.03 1 Canada 52.9 14 0.71 18 15.71 14 78.18 6 France 55.4 12 0.7 22 22.54 6 79.36 4 Germany 58.1 9 0.75 9 18.49 8 76.9 8 Italy 45.3 26 0.62 36 14.11 22 71.22 25 Japan 54.1 13 0.73 12 18.47 9 75.75 12 United Kingdom 61 5 0.73 13 27.21 3 78.88 5 China 56.3 11 0.64 30 40.17 2 72.01 23 India 38.3 39 0.49 71 25.54 4 62.81 46

2. Physical and Digital Infrastructure

Physical and digital infrastructure form the foundation for AI adoption. Physical infrastructure includes data centers and high-performance computing hardware, supported by reliable energy, telecommunications, and manufacturing capabilities. Digital infrastructure adds cloud computing, data access, and other tools for widespread model deployment.

As shown in Figure 1, the United States made early, outsized investments in computing, software, and databases, with annual real investment in these areas growing over tenfold from 1995 to 2021, far outpacing AFE peers, whose growth was two- to fourfold. These early investments provided the computing power, networks, and hardware that positioned the United States to lead early in AI-related innovation and diffusion.

Figure 1. Investment in AI-Related Physical and Digital Infrastructure

Compute, the processing power and network resources used for AI training and inference, is the clearest measure of a country's ability to develop and deploy AI. Data centers, processors (CPUs and GPUs), and broader computing systems support the growing demands of modern AI workloads.

Data center construction in the United States surged over the past decade.3 The United States hosted an estimated 4,049 data centers as of 2024, far more than the EU (~2,250), the UK (484), and China (379).4 In 2024 alone, the United States added 5.8 gigawatts (GW) of data center capacity, compared with 1.6 GW in the EU and 0.2 GW in the United Kingdom.5 On a per capita basis, the US server base stands at 99.9 per 1,000 people, far surpassing other advanced foreign economies and China (Figure 2A).

Figure 2. Compute Capacity Indicators

High-end computing, particularly AI supercomputers, is particularly critical for large-scale model training and more recently inference-based tasks. The United States dominates cumulative AI supercomputer capacity, controlling an estimated 74 percent of global high-end AI compute, while China holds 14 percent and the EU 4.8 percent (Figure 2B).

3. Energy Infrastructure Risks

The rapid growth of AI workloads is driving a substantial increase in data center power demand, highlighting the importance of electricity generation and transmission capacity in supporting AI infrastructure. RAND estimates that AI could require 117 GW globally by 2028, while the IEA projects that global electricity consumption from data centers will more than double by 2030, with the United States and China accounting for 80 percent of the growth.6

China outstripped the United States in electricity generation capacity more than a decade ago (Figure 3), with roughly 3,200 GW of installed capacity compared with 1,293 GW in the United States and 1,125 GW in the EU. China added 429 GW of net electric generation capacity in 2024 alone, over 15 times the net capacity added by the United States (Chan et al., 2025).

It remains unclear whether US power generation and transmission capacity will keep pace with rapidly growing data center demand. Installed data centers currently account for

[TITLE]The EU’s Horizon research fund needs to stay a defence-free zone:
[TEXT]

In July, the European Commission announced a proposal to nearly double the European Union’s Horizon Europe research-funding budget to €175 billion (US$205 billion) for its next seven-year period, which begins in 2028. But any celebrations did not last long. The commission also confirmed its intention, first mooted earlier this year, to abolish a long-standing rule that restricts Horizon funding to projects with only civilian applications. If the change is implemented, it would be the first time that the EU’s principal research fund (previously known as the Framework Programmes) would allow ‘dual-use’ research — that is, work that could have both civil and military applications — since the programmes began in 1984.

How Europe aims to woo US scientists and protect academic freedom

The Brussels-based commission, one of the EU’s three law-making bodies, also plans to change the maximum length of term served by heads of the European Research Council (ERC), the EU’s widely admired fund for investigator-led research. Until now, the ERC president has served a four-year term, which could be renewed once; the change would cut each of those potential terms in half. Last week, the ERC’s current head, Maria Leptin, had her tenure renewed — but for only two years.

Such changes are characteristic of a growing trend of politicians interfering in the inner workings of research and research-governance processes. This has been evident in the United States of late; in the case of the EU, it is being done in the name of its member states’ national security. Changes are being announced without consultation or, it seems, consideration of the implications. Partly in response, the ERC’s governing body, its Scientific Council, took the unprecedented step of writing to the commission in June to suggest that the ERC be given more independence from the commission and be made into a stand-alone EU agency.

Announcing decisions without consulting those affected marks a departure from the way the EU’s research institutions have typically operated. Abandoning this approach is, to put it charitably, unwise. The commission’s proposals must now be comprehensively scrutinized by the EU’s other law-making institutions — the European Parliament, which is elected by the citizens of member states, and the Council of the European Union, which represents national governments. They, in turn, must be guided by the EU’s networks of scientific advisers.

Will Europe ramp up defence research? War prompts major rethink

Much of Europe is either on or close to a war footing, which is understandably having a big impact on research. Over the past few weeks, unidentified drone flights have led to the closure of some of the region’s main airports, causing chaos, alarm and uncertainty. Along with Russia’s invasion of — and continued war in — Ukraine, these incidents underscore why, after some 80 years of relative peace, the continent’s leaders are making massive investments in defence and security.

National security is often described as the first responsibility of any government. However, this does not mean that politicians should be permitted to interfere in the inner workings of research — an issue that is also evident at the national level. In the United Kingdom, for example, the government has instructed the Alan Turing Institute, the national centre for data science and artificial intelligence, to prioritize defence and security.

A science mega-programme is taking shape in the EU: what it means for researchers

Ekaterina Zaharieva, the European Commissioner for research and innovation, said in July that the division between civil and military applications is often artificial, and that “we cannot miss out on the potential of research and innovation to make Europeans safer”. But there’s a spectrum of fields with little, if any, connection to warfare that are also essential to safety, security and well-being, including environmental science, health and medical science, and social science. If the effect of the EU’s policy change is to squeeze budgets for such research, it is hard to know how gains in one area will be affected by losses elsewhere.

Science has a core role in defence and in warfare. But, as Kurt Deketelaere, secretary-general of the League of European Research Universities, has said, the lack of consultation in the EU’s research policymaking is eroding the already fragile trust between the continent’s leaders and the research community, and it sets an unwelcome precedent — that the research budget can be repurposed any time there is a new political priority. Such meddling is unlikely ever to serve the best interests of science or society as a whole.

[TITLE]Stock indexes mostly gain amid AI deal optimism; euro, yen weaken on fiscal worries:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK :Major stock indexes mostly rose on Monday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting record closing highs after news of AMD's artificial intelligence chip-supply deal with OpenAI, while the yen and euro weakened against the dollar after Japan's ruling party elected a new leader and France's new government quit.

Bitcoin hit a record high as investors increasingly sought alternative assets and uncertainty prevailed with the U.S. government shutdown. The world's largest cryptocurrency was last up 2.05 per cent at $125,295.33.

The euro was last down 0.26 per cent at $1.171 . New French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned on Monday, barely 14 hours after appointing his cabinet.

The yen weakened after Japan's ruling party picked conservative Sanae Takaichi, putting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. She is an advocate of late premier Shinzo Abe's "Abenomics" strategy to boost the economy with aggressive spending and easy monetary policy. The yen was down 1.93 per cent against the greenback.

AI-related dealmaking boosted sentiment in equities, with AMD shares jumping 23.7 per cent and other chip companies' stocks also rising. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 2.9 per cent.

Crypto-related firms such as Coinbase also rose.

But Wall Street indexes ended mixed, with the Dow slightly lower as the U.S. federal government shutdown dragged on for a sixth day. The shutdown has postponed the release of key economic indicators.

"The market is extending its momentum bias. It's shrugging off the (U.S.) government shutdown and, because of that, there's a belief that perhaps the Fed is going to be more generous than the market previously expected," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates again by 25 basis points at its October 28-29 meeting, following data that shows a weakening labor market.

Moreover, Cardillo said, "We're not far away from third-quarter earnings, and it looks as though it'll be another good earnings season." Earnings season for S&P 500 companies unofficially kicks off next week with reports from some big U.S. banks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 63.31 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 46,694.97, the S&P 500 rose 24.49 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 6,740.28 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 161.16 points, or 0.71 per cent, to 22,941.67.

MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 2.85 points, or 0.29 per cent, to 996.06.The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.04 per cent.

French political instability has ramped up since Emmanuel Macron's re-election in 2022, with no party or grouping holding a parliamentary majority.

In Japan, Takaichi beat the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi in the Liberal Democratic Party's leadership vote.

Short-dated Japanese government bond yields slid to a two-week low as traders pared bets on when the Bank of Japan will resume raising interest rates.

"There's a little bit more focus on the back end of the curve now, just given that Takaichi is generally seen as a follower of Abenomics. The market expects a little bit more fiscal stimulus there," said Sarah Ying, head of FX strategy, FICC Strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto.

Gold surged to an all-time high above $3,900 per ounce, helped in part by the economic and political uncertainty in the U.S., France and Japan. Spot gold was up 1.85 per cent at $3,957.78 an ounce.

Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields edged higher as the shutdown left investors without key economic data. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note was last up 4.7 basis points to 4.166 per cent

Oil prices also rose after OPEC+'s planned production increase for November was more modest than expected. U.S. crude gained 81 cents to settle at $61.69 a barrel, while Brent climbed 94 cents to settle at $65.47.
