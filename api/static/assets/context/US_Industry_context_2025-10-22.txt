[TITLE]Auto giant Stellantis invests $13B in U.S. manufacturing expansion – NaturalNews.com:
[TEXT]
Auto giant Stellantis invests $13B in U.S. manufacturing expansion

Stellantis (parent company of Jeep, Dodge and Fiat) announced a $13 billion U.S. manufacturing expansion, creating 5,000 jobs across Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana by 2029.

The move aims to offset $1.7 billion in tariffs on vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico, highlighting geopolitical trade war pressures.

Despite promises of new jobs, Stellantis is shifting production (including a midsize truck) from Illinois to Ohio, continuing a trend of layoffs and automation under the guise of EV progress.

While CEO Antonio Filosa claims the investment will "strengthen our manufacturing footprint," critics see it as profit-driven restructuring, following decades of outsourcing and automation that harm American workers.

The push for EVs ignores affordability issues, reliance on Chinese-controlled supply chains and safety risks (like immobility when batteries die). Meanwhile, automakers take taxpayer subsidies while slashing jobs – raising concerns

[TITLE]Jeep, Ram owner Stellantis unveils $13B investment in US manufacturing as Trump pushes reshoring agenda:
[TEXT]
Stellantis, one of the Big Three automakers in Detroit, said Wednesday it will invest $13 billion in domestic manufacturing efforts over the next four years — heeding President Trump’s call for major companies to bring operations to US shores.

The massive investment will expand domestic production by 50%, including five new vehicle launches, and add more than 5,000 jobs across factories in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, Stellantis stated.

“This investment in the US – the single largest in the company’s history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a Wednesday statement.

“Accelerating growth in the US has been a top priority since my first day,” added Filosa, who took the helm in June and has been eager to boost sales after his predecessor, Carlos Tavares, focused on profits over volumes.

Trump has been pushing US auto giants to ramp up their domestic manufacturing efforts. His tariffs – including a 25% levy on imported car parts and a 50% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum – have squeezed supply chains across the industry.

In June, Stellantis said the tariffs cost the company nearly $350 million in the first half of 2025 as it was forced to pause production at some plants and cut back on shipments of imported vehicles.

Shares in Stellantis – which owns brands like Jeep, Ram and Dodge – jumped 2.3% Wednesday. The stock is down about 20% so far this year.

[TITLE]Chief Financial Credit Union Partners with On the Wings of Angels to Launch Innovative "Pay It Forward" Micro Loan Program for Abuse Survivors:
[TEXT]
Rochester Hills, Michigan, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chief Financial Federal Credit Union has launched an innovative micro loan program in partnership with nonprofit organization On the Wings of Angels (OTWOA) that breaks traditional banking barriers to provide financial support for survivors of abuse and trauma. The mission-driven program creates a powerful "pay it forward" cycle where each survivor's successful loan repayment directly enables funding for the next person in need.

Unlike conventional lending that relies on credit scores and income verification, the program uses personalized evaluations conducted by OTWOA's dedicated committee to determine eligibility based solely on survivor need and potential for rebuilding their lives.

"This program is deeply personal for me because I know firsthand how financial barriers can keep survivors from rebuilding their lives — and how just a little help at the right moment can change everything," said Cheryl Boodram, Executive Vice President and CFO at Chief Financial. "Our mission-driven loan program with On the Wings of Angels is a true lifeline, giving survivors the financial freedom to take their next step toward safety and stability. Every repayment opens the door for the next survivor, creating a cycle of hope that's at the heart of who we are at Chief Financial — more than a credit union, we're a partner in people's lives."

The program addresses immediate financial needs that often prevent survivors from escaping dangerous situations or rebuilding their independence, including housing deposits, transportation, healthcare, legal services, and other recovery-related expenses. Loans are unsecured, require no collateral or co-signers, and feature flexible repayment terms designed around each survivor's circumstances.

"We've seen too many survivors trapped not by their abuser, but by the financial barriers that make leaving seem impossible," said JoJo Dries, founder On the Wings of Angels. "This partnership with Chief Financial removes those barriers and creates something beautiful – a community of survivors supporting each other through their repayments. When someone successfully pays back their loan, they're literally opening the door for another person to find their freedom."

The revolving loan structure ensures sustainability while maximizing impact. As survivors repay their loans, those funds immediately become available to help the next person in need, creating an ongoing cycle of support within the survivor community.

Chief Financial's values-based banking approach prioritizes community impact over traditional profit metrics, aligning business operations with core values of resilience, spirit, unity, and creativity. The credit union's mission to "inspire, empower, enrich communities" drives initiatives like this partnership that address real social challenges through innovative financial solutions.

Program highlights:

Eligibility determined by survivor need, not credit history

Flexible loan terms up to 60 months

No collateral or co-signers required

Revolving fund structure creates sustainable support

In-person loan closings with OTWOA representative present

Built-in support system through nonprofit partnership

The program launched July 1, 2025, and represents Chief Financial's commitment to using banking as a force for positive social change. By partnering with specialized nonprofits like OTWOA, the credit union can extend its community impact beyond traditional financial services.

[TITLE]Dwight Capital Supplies $53M Construction Loan for Texas Apartments:
[TEXT]
Texas developer Martin Inderman Development has secured $53 million of construction financing backed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to build a multifamily project in the Texas Panhandle, Commercial Observer has learned.

Dwight Capital closed the HUD 221(d)(4) loan for the developer’s planned 312-unit development in Amarillo, Texas, known as the Lariat. The deal was originated by Brandon Baksh and Tommy Ng.

“We’re excited to close another multifamily construction loan, continuing our commitment to supporting growth across Texas and beyond,” Baksh, partner at Dwight, said in a statement. “Our team remains active and eager to finance more multifamily developments throughout Texas and in other expanding markets.”

The Lariat will consist of one- and two-bedroom apartments in 13 three-story buildings with six garages on a 13.5 acre-site. Community amenities will include a clubhouse, a pool, electric vehicle charging stations, pickleball courts and a dog park.

Officials at Martin Inderman Development did not immediately return a request for comment.

[TITLE]European aerospace groups reach framework deal on satellite merger, sources say:
[TEXT]
ROME/PARIS :European aerospace groups Leonardo, Airbus and Thales have reached a framework deal on a proposed merger of their satellite businesses, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Leonardo is scheduled to hold an extraordinary board meeting on Tuesday to discuss details of the deal, which is subject to board and regulatory approvals, one of the sources said.

Leonardo, Thales and Airbus declined to comment.

PROPOSED VENTURE AIMS TO COMPETE WITH ELON MUSK

Europe's largest satellite makers have been in talks for more than a year to create a new satellite manufacturing company to compete on a larger scale with rivals led by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which owns the highly successful Starlink service.

Reuters reported last month that the three groups had redoubled efforts to combine their satellite businesses into a roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.66 billion) joint venture modelled on the pan-European MBDA missiles business.

Code-named "Project Bromo," talks had hit a roadblock over the summer when the parties could not agree on governance and valuation, insiders said.

One of the sources said the talks, which involve dividing politically sensitive technology and jobs between France and Italy, had not been helped by the government crisis in Paris.

Problems have also included disputes over the politically sensitive share of work, according to French daily La Tribune.

ANTI-TRUST REVIEW

The key remaining hurdle, analysts say, will be getting past a competition review by the European Commission.

Previous attempts to merge satellite activities in the past decade foundered on anti-trust concerns and national rivalries.

But the dramatic rise of Musk's Starlink network and a shift in the market towards cheaper satellites have increased pressure on Europe to combine assets or be pushed out of the market.

The deal could take up to two years to implement and the initial umbrella deal is the first step, sources familiar with the matter said. Last week, Thales denied a report that a sought-after provisional deal had been reached at that time.

Europe's top satellite makers have long competed to build complex spacecraft in geostationary orbit but have been hit by the arrival of cheap tiny satellites in low Earth orbit.

The deal will combine loss-making satellite activities of Airbus with those of Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio - two ventures currently controlled by France's Thales and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.

Paris-based consultancy Novaspace says more than 43,000 satellites will launch over the next decade, representing a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services.
