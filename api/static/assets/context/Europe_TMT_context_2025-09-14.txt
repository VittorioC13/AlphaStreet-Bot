By Amy-Jo Crowley, Mathieu Rosemain and Tim Hepher

LONDON/PARIS/ROME (Reuters) - Europe's aerospace groups Leonardo, Thales and Airbus have redoubled efforts to combine their satellite businesses into a 10 billion-euro ($11.7 billion), French-headquartered joint venture and are working towards hammering out an initial agreement in coming weeks, sources close to the matter said.

Under "Project Bromo," the three companies plan to set up a satellite manufacturing company to compete with rivals from China and the U.S., including Elon Musk's Starlink.

Talks have regained momentum after a rough period in the summer when the parties could not agree on governance and valuation, stalling an agreement, three sources said. The talks looked at risk of collapsing, according to another source.

A memorandum of understanding could now be signed by the end of September, though the timing could slip, the sources said.

Political signals so far have been encouraging, but details of ownership and governance must be signed by nations involved, three of the sources said. The venture is expected to include dedicated entities to protect sensitive national interests.

An agreement is not guaranteed, and talks could still fall apart, the sources warned.

The exact holdings of the new space venture are still being negotiated, the sources said, adding that ownership of the venture could be split roughly in three equal parts.

The new satellite venture value of

[TITLE]Klarna IPO and ASML's Mistral bet revive Europe's tech dreams:

LONDON — It's been a busy week for the European technology sector. On Tuesday, London-headquartered artificial intelligence startup ElevenLabs announced it would let employees sell shares in a secondary round that doubles its valuation to $6.6 billion. Then, Dutch chip firm ASML on Wednesday confirmed it was leading French AI firm Mistral's 1.7 billion-euro Series C funding round at a valuation of 11.7 billion euros ($13.7 billion) — up from 5.8 billion euros last year. Mistral is considered a competitor to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. To cap it off, Swedish fintech firm Klarna on Thursday debuted on the New York Stock Exchange after a long-awaited initial public offering. Klarna shares ended the day at $45.82, giving it a market value of over $17 billion. These developments have revived hopes that Europe is capable of developing a tech industry that can compete with the U.S. and Asia. For the past decade, investors have been talking up Europe's potential to build valuable tech firms, rebuffing the idea that Silicon Valley is the only place to create innovative new ventures.

However, dreams of a "golden era" of European tech never quite came to fruition. A key curveball came in the form of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which caused inflation to soar and global central banks to hike interest rates as a result. Higher rates are considered bad for capital-intensive tech firms, which often need to raise cash to grow. Ironically, that same year, Klarna — which at one point was valued as much as $45.6 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank — had its market value slashed 85% to $6.7 billion. Now, Europe's venture capital investors view the recent buzz around the region's tech firms as less of a renaissance and more of a "growing wave." "This started 25 years ago when we saw the first signs of a European tech ecosystem inspired by the original dotcom boom that was very much a Silicon Valley affair," Suranga Chandratillake, partner at Balderton Capital, told CNBC. Balderton has backed a number of notable European tech names including fintech firm Revolut and self-driving vehicle tech developer Wayve.

"There have been temporary setbacks: the 2008 financial crisis, the post-Covid tech slump, but the ecosystem has bounced back stronger each time," Chandratillake said. "Right now, the confluence of a huge new technological opportunity in the form of generative AI, as well as a community that has done it before and has access to the capital required, is, unsurprisingly, yielding a huge number of sector-defining companies," he added.

Europe vs. U.S.

Investors backing the continent's tech startups say there's plenty of money to be made — particularly amid the economic uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. For one, there's a clear discount on European tech right now. Venture firm Atomico's annual "State of European Tech" report last year pegged the value of the European tech ecosystem at $3 trillion and predicted it will reach $8 trillion by 2034. Compare that to the story in the U.S., where the tech sector's biggest megacap stocks combined are worth over $20 trillion. "Ten years ago, there wasn't a single European startup valued at over $50 billion; today, there are several," Jan Hammer, partner at Index Ventures, which has backed the likes of Revolut and Adyen , told CNBC. "Tens of thousands of people now have firsthand experience building and scaling global companies from companies such as Revolut, Alan, Mistral and Adyen," Hammer added. "Crucially, European startups are no longer simply expanding abroad — they are born global from day one."

Amy Nauikoas, founder and CEO of fintech investor Anthemis, suggested that investors may be viewing Europe as something of a safe haven market amid heightened geopolitical risks and macroeconomic uncertainty. "This is an investing opportunity for sure," Nauikoas told CNBC. "Macroeconomic dislocation always favors early-stage entrepreneurial disruption and innovation." "This time around, trends in family office, capital shifts ... and the general constipation of the U.S. institutional allocation market suggest that there should be a lot more money flowing from ... global investors to U.K. [and] European private markets."

Problems remain

Despite the bullish sentiment surrounding European tech, there remain systemic challenges that make it harder for the region's tech firms to achieve the scale of their U.S. and Asian counterparts. Startup investors have been pushing for more allocation from pension funds into venture capital funds in Europe for some time. And the European market is highly fragmented, with regulations varying from country to country.

[TITLE]Europe’s Automotive Industry Needs Urgent Action—Not Another Diagnosis:
[TEXT]
On 12 September, the President of the European Commission will convene key stakeholders to discuss the future of Europe’s automotive industry. As trade union leaders representing millions of workers across this vital sector and its supply chains, we urge the EU to move beyond analysis and deliver urgent, strategic action.

The automotive industry is facing a perfect storm. Production has dropped by 20% in just four years. The transition to clean mobility, while essential, is proving more disruptive than anticipated. On the shopfloor, anxiety and anger are becoming the norm. Without bold intervention, this toxic mix could threaten the future of one of Europe’s most strategic industries.

Europe’s car industry is also losing ground globally. While domestic demand can help, it cannot replace the 4.5 million vehicles exported in 2024. A fair and strategic trade agenda is needed—one that secures market access and rebuilds supply chains for key components like batteries and semiconductors.

Decarbonisation is non-negotiable. But the transition must be just. Climate legislation must be fit for purpose and adapted when necessary. The upcoming EU “Progress Report” on CO₂ emissions must lead to pragmatic solutions—addressing infrastructure gaps, affordability, supply chain resilience including investments in battery production —and delivering guarantees for workers.

Boosting demand must be the first priority. Legislative tools—such as corporate fleet regulations and public procurement—should be used to accelerate the uptake of clean vehicles. Bridging the affordability gap is essential. Many Europeans simply cannot afford a new car, and solutions like social leasing must be scaled across member states.

Investment is equally critical. Households, companies, and public authorities need support to invest in vehicles and infrastructure. Yet austerity budgets are undermining both public and private investment. The next EU budget must reflect Europe’s climate and industrial ambitions, aligning macroeconomic governance with strategic goals like climate neutrality and industrial resilience.

The future of 13 million workers and entire regions depends on bold, coordinated action. We need a stable, skilled workforce, strong social dialogue, and tools like SURE 2.0 and a Just Transition Directive to manage change fairly and democratically.

Europe must rise to the challenge. Workers are watching. The time for gesture politics is over. Workers and their unions expect quick, concrete, and courageous decisions. Their future—and Europe’s industrial strength—is on the line.

Bessent will meet Chinese officials in Spain for trade and TikTok talks

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will travel to Madrid this weekend for negotiations with his Chinese counterparts over tariffs and national security issues related to the ownership of social media platform TikTok.

Bessent is slated to meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Madrid to discuss national security and economic issues, a Treasury news release states.

This will be the fourth round of discussions between U.S. and Chinese counterparts after meetings in London, Geneva and Stockholm. The two governments have agreed to several 90-day pauses on a series of increasing reciprocal tariffs, staving off an all-out trade war.

During the last round of discussions in Stockholm, Bessent described his talks with the Chinese as “ very fulsome."

“We just need to de-risk with certain, strategic industries, whether it’s the rare earths, semiconductors, medicines, and we talked about what we could do together to get into balance within the relationship,” Bessent said at the time.

China remains one of the biggest challenges for the Trump administration after it has struck deals over elevated tariff rates with other key trading partners, such as Britain, Japan and the European Union.

The U.S. and China delegations are also expected to continue discussions about ownership of TikTok.

Congress approved a U.S. ban on the popular video-sharing platform unless its parent company, ByteDance, sold its controlling stake. President Donald Trump said last month that he will keep extending the sale deadline until there’s a buyer.

But Trump has so far extended the deadline three times during his second term — with the next deadline coming up Wednesday.

A Pew Research Center survey conducted in late February and early March found that about one-third of Americans said they supported a TikTok ban, down from 50% in March 2023. Roughly one-third said they would oppose a ban, and a similar percentage said they weren’t sure.

The Treasury Department also says Bessent will meet Spanish government counterparts to discuss the relationship between Spain and the United States.

After his Spain trip, Bessent is expected to travel to the U.K. to join Trump for his official state visit with Britain’s King Charles at Windsor Castle.

[TITLE]Telefónica Outlines Strategy to Consolidate European Telecoms, Divest Latin American Assets:
[TEXT]
Telefónica (NYSE:TEF) is one of the most undervalued telecom stocks to invest in. On September 8, Telefonica CEO Marc Murtra outlined his vision for a consolidated European telecoms market, stating that the company is looking to acquire telecom assets in Europe and Brazil while selling off its Spanish-speaking Latin American assets.

The strategy is part of a broader plan to increase scale and maintain the company’s investment-grade credit rating. Murtra argues that Europe’s telecom market is too fragmented, with 41 companies serving over 500K mobile customers each in 2024, compared to only 5 in the US, 4 in China and Japan, and 3 in South Korea. He believes that in exchange for consolidation, European telecom companies should invest in other related sectors, such as cybersecurity and data centers, as part of a social contract with regulators.

Telefónica Outlines Strategy to Consolidate European Telecoms, Divest Latin American Assets

To gain financial flexibility for M&A, Telefonica has agreed to sell its units in Argentina and Uruguay and is exploring potential sales in Chile, Mexico, and Ecuador. Analysts at Kepler believe these sales could provide up to 3.6 billion euros ($4.21 billion) in funding. Potential acquisition targets for Telefonica could include Vodafone Spain, a joint venture with 1&1 in Germany, assets in Brazil, or a 50% stake in Virgin Media O2.

Telefónica (NYSE:TEF) provides telecommunications services in Europe and Latin America. The company offers mobile & related services and products.

While we acknowledge the potential of TEF as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Zen, Neos carry out 400 Gbps upgrade between Manchester and London:
[TEXT]
Looking to address surging bandwidth demands through rapidly increasing AI adoption, datacentre growth and full-fibre roll-out across the UK, and linking two of the country’s leading business hubs, business connectivity provider Neos Networks has expanded its longstanding partnership with B Corp-certified telecoms provider Zen Internet with a major upgrade to 400Gbps connectivity between Manchester and London.

Neos Networks claims the UK’s largest business-dedicated network with more than 600 points of presence and 90 datacentres nationwide, providing high-capacity critical connectivity for businesses, from telecoms and energy to banking and emergency services.

Headquartered in Rochdale and employing 650 people, Zen offers a range of broadband, data, voice, hosting and infrastructure services to homes and businesses across the UK. It claims to be the largest B Corporation certified telecommunications and network connectivity provider in the UK.

With a network spanning over 2,800 exchanges, with more than 80% enabled for 10 Gb services, Zen also provides what it describes as “complex” network and cloud services for a range of large businesses and corporate customers through its strategic partnerships with Amazon Web Services and Cisco.

Delivered over Neos Networks’ nationwide fibre network, the upgrade to the advanced corridor is designed to support the UK’s growing bandwidth requirements as datacentre investment, AI adoption and full-fibre roll-out increase across the nation, and strengthening Zen’s strategy in the independent broadband provider (altnet) market expanding fibre access for businesses and consumers alike.

It is also intended to ensure Zen’s core network is ready for the future. Beyond the Manchester to London link, Zen uses Neos’s upgraded core and exchange-backhaul services, which are critical for delivering ultrafast, resilient connectivity.

“Our long-standing partnership with Zen Internet highlights the vital role of advanced fibre infrastructure when it comes to meeting the UK’s AI ambitions,” said David Bruce, CRO at Neos Networks commenting on the new deal. “Zen’s mission to become the country’s leading altnet aggregator is well-aligned with the breadth, quality and reliability of our backbone networks, and by working together, we’re ensuring an ecosystem that will ultimately benefit the UK as a whole.”

Zen Internet technical director John Lyons added: “In Neos we have a partner that not only delivers robust, high-capacity network solutions, but also real agility and collaboration, helping us deliver for our end users. Our collaboration is built on open communication, rapid provisioning and shared engineering standards like equipment duplication, diverse routing and true east-west redundancy. This approach means we can rely on Neos to deliver a network that consistently meets the high standards our customers expect.”

Just weeks ago, Zen Internet announced a strategic partnership with Sky Business Wholesale to allow its partners and direct business customers gain access to Sky’s Ethernet-enabled exchange footprint. The partnership was also designed to further strengthen Zen’s partner portal, The Fibre Hub, after its launch in May 2025 to further enhance nationwide connectivity by aggregating services from the UK’s leading alternative networks. This offers access to a full-fibre footprint of nearly 20 million premises via infrastructure providers Openreach, CityFibre, ITS and Freedom Fibre.

[TITLE]The Last Days Of Social Media:
[TEXT]
Credits James O’Sullivan lectures in the School of English and Digital Humanities at University College Cork, where his work explores the intersection of technology and culture.

At first glance, the feed looks familiar, a seamless carousel of “For You” updates gliding beneath your thumb. But déjà‑vu sets in as 10 posts from 10 different accounts carry the same stock portrait and the same breathless promise — “click here for free pics” or “here is the one productivity hack you need in 2025.” Swipe again and three near‑identical replies appear, each from a pout‑filtered avatar directing you to “free pics.” Between them sits an ad for a cash‑back crypto card.

Scroll further and recycled TikTok clips with “original audio” bleed into Reels on Facebook and Instagram; AI‑stitched football highlights showcase players’ limbs bending like marionettes. Refresh once more, and the woman who enjoys your snaps of sushi rolls has seemingly spawned five clones.

Whatever remains of genuine, human content is increasingly sidelined by algorithmic prioritization, receiving fewer interactions than the engineered content and AI slop optimized solely for clicks.

These are the last days of social media as we know it.

Drowning The Real

Social media was built on the romance of authenticity. Early platforms sold themselves as conduits for genuine connection: stuff you wanted to see, like your friend’s wedding and your cousin’s dog.

Even influencer culture, for all its artifice, promised that behind the ring‑light stood an actual person. But the attention economy, and more recently, the generative AI-fueled late attention economy, have broken whatever social contract underpinned that illusion. The feed no longer feels crowded with people but crowded with content. At this point, it has far less to do with people than with consumers and consumption.

In recent years, Facebook and other platforms that facilitate billions of daily interactions have slowly morphed into the internet’s largest repositories of AI‑generated spam. Research has found what users plainly see: tens of thousands of machine‑written posts now flood public groups — pushing scams, chasing clicks — with clickbait headlines, half‑coherent listicles and hazy lifestyle images stitched together in AI tools like Midjourney.

It’s all just vapid, empty shit produced for engagement’s sake. Facebook is “sloshing” in low-effort AI-generated posts, as Arwa Mahdawi notes in The Guardian; some even bolstered by algorithmic boosts, like “Shrimp Jesus.”

The difference between human and synthetic content is becoming increasingly indistinguishable, and platforms seem unable, or uninterested, in trying to police it. Earlier this year, CEO Steve Huffman pledged to “keep Reddit human,” a tacit admission that floodwaters were already lapping at the last high ground. TikTok, meanwhile, swarms with AI narrators presenting concocted news reports and “what‑if” histories. A few creators do append labels disclaiming that their videos depict “no real events,” but many creators don’t bother, and many consumers don’t seem to care.

The problem is not just the rise of fake material, but the collapse of context and the acceptance that truth no longer matters as long as our cravings for colors and noise are satisfied. Contemporary social media content is more often rootless, detached from cultural memory, interpersonal exchange or shared conversation. It arrives fully formed, optimized for attention rather than meaning, producing a kind of semantic sludge, posts that look like language yet say almost nothing.

We’re drowning in this nothingness.

The Bot-Girl Economy

If spam (AI or otherwise) is the white noise of the modern timeline, its dominant melody is a different form of automation: the hyper‑optimized, sex‑adjacent human avatar. She appears everywhere, replying to trending tweets with selfies, promising “funny memes in bio” and linking, inevitably, to OnlyFans or one of its proxies. Sometimes she is real. Sometimes she is not. Sometimes she is a he, sitting in a compound in Myanmar. Increasingly, it makes no difference.

This convergence of bots, scammers, brand-funnels and soft‑core marketing underpins what might be called the bot-girl economy, a parasocial marketplace fueled in a large part by economic precarity. At its core is a transactional logic: Attention is scarce, intimacy is monetizable and platforms generally won’t intervene so long as engagement stays high. As more women now turn to online sex work, lots of men are eager to pay them for their services. And as these workers try to cope with the precarity imposed by platform metrics and competition, some can spiral, forever downward, into a transactional attention-to-intimacy logic that eventually turns them into more bot than human. To hold attention, some creators increasingly opt to behave like algorithms themselves, automating replies, optimizing content for engagement, or mimicking affection at scale. The distinction between performance and intention must surely erode as real people perform as synthetic avatars and synthetic avatars mimic real women.

There is loneliness, desperation and predation everywhere.

“Genuine, human content is increasingly sidelined by algorithmic prioritization, receiving fewer interactions than the engineered content and AI slop optimized solely for clicks.”

The bot-girl is more than just a symptom; she is a proof of concept for how social media bends even aesthetics to the logic of engagement. Once, profile pictures (both real and synthetic) aspired to hyper-glamor, unreachable beauty filtered through fantasy. But that fantasy began to underperform as average men sensed the ruse, recognizing that supermodels typically don’t send them DMs. And so, the system adapted, surfacing profiles that felt more plausible, more emotionally available. Today’s avatars project a curated accessibility: They’re attractive but not flawless, styled to suggest they might genuinely be interested in you. It’s a calibrated effect, just human enough to convey plausibility, just artificial enough to scale. She has to look more human to stay afloat, but act more bot to keep up. Nearly everything is socially engineered for maximum interaction: the like, the comment, the click, the private message.

Once seen as the fringe economy of cam sites, OnlyFans has become the dominant digital marketplace for sex workers. In 2023, the then-seven-year-old platform generated $6.63 billion in gross payments from fans, with $658 million in profit before tax. Its success has bled across the social web; platforms like X (formerly Twitter) now serve as de facto marketing layers for OnlyFans creators, with thousands of accounts running fan-funnel operations, baiting users into paid subscriptions.

The tools of seduction are also changing. One 2024 study estimated that thousands of X accounts use AI to generate fake profile photos. Many content creators have also begun using AI for talking-head videos, synthetic voices or endlessly varied selfies. Content is likely A/B tested for click-through rates. Bios are written with conversion in mind. DMs are automated or outsourced to AI impersonators. For users, the effect is a strange hybrid of influencer, chatbot and parasitic marketing loop. One minute you’re arguing politics, the next, you’re being pitched a girlfriend experience by a bot.

Engagement In Freefall

While content proliferates, engagement is evaporating. Average interaction rates across major platforms are declining fast: Facebook and X posts now scrape an average 0.15% engagement, while Instagram has dropped 24% year-on-year. Even TikTok has begun to plateau. People aren’t connecting or conversing on social media like they used to; they’re just wading through slop, that is, low-effort, low-quality content produced at scale, often with AI, for engagement.

And much of it is slop: Less than half of American adults now rate the information they see on social media as “mostly reliable”— down from roughly two-thirds in the mid-2010s. Young adults register the steepest collapse, which is unsurprising; as digital natives, they better understand that the content they scroll upon wasn’t necessarily produced by humans. And yet, they continue to scroll.

The timeline is no longer a source of information or social presence, but more of a mood-regulation device, endlessly replenishing itself with just enough novelty to suppress the anxiety of stopping. Scrolling has become a form of ambient dissociation, half-conscious, half-compulsive, closer to scratching an itch than seeking anything in particular. People know the feed is fake, they just don’t care.

Platforms have little incentive to stem the tide. Synthetic accounts are cheap, tireless and lucrative because they never demand wages or unionize. Systems designed to surface peer-to-peer engagement are now systematically filtering out such activity, because what counts as engagement has changed. Engagement is now
