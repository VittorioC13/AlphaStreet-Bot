[TITLE]Chinese Firms Pour $80B Into Global Clean-Tech:
[TEXT]
Chinese foreign investment in clean energy has jumped to $80 billion in the year to November 2025, with Trump’s aggressive trade tariffs prompting many countries to deepen energy ties with China. That’s good for a 60% annualized increase compared with a total of $100 billion spent over the previous two years with Beijing leveraging its dominance in energy transition technologies. China already was the global leader in sectors such as solar and wind energy as well as electric vehicles and EV batteries before the Trump administration withdrew federal support for clean energy projects.

“The clean-tech economy represents a flourishing form of South-South cooperation, where national development goals meet China’s techno-industrial might,” Caroline Wang, analyst at Australian-based think tank Climate Energy Finance (CEF) said in a report. “While the US sees China’s rise as a threat, many developing countries are inspired by its success and aim to emulate it.”

According to CEF, Southeast Asia is China’s top destination for clean energy investments, led by Indonesia and Malaysia. Major projects here include a $6 billion battery plant in Indonesia being jointly developed by Indonesia Battery, Aneka Tambang and China’s EV battery giant, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL).

The Middle East and North Africa are also seeing a surge in Chinese renewable energy investments as governments try to lower reliance on oil. Countries are offering diverse incentives in a bid to attract Chinese clean-tech investments, including competitive tax rates and fast-tracked project approvals. These projects are mainly focused on facilitating joint-venture projects with local partners, building local manufacturing capacity and boosting employment.

Interestingly, China’s clean energy sector is also doing brisk business with less developed economies even as the U.S. retreats from the clean energy race. In fact, 51% of China’s EV sales growth in the current year has come from nations outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Exports to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) surged 75% during the first eight months of 2025, while EV exports to Africa nearly tripled, led by Morocco and Nigeria with the West African nation recording a six-fold surge in purchases. Meanwhile, exports to the Middle East jumped 72% while sales to Latin America grew 11%. But it's not just electric vehicles. China exported 46 GW of solar PV equipment in August, more than Australia’s total installed capacity.

“China’s electrotech is becoming the basis of the new energy system, with continued cost reductions driving faster growth than ever, especially in emerging economies,” Ember analysts wrote.

And, it’s all being driven by a virtuous cycle of falling renewable energy prices, an economic phenomenon where increased adoption and production lead to lower costs, which in turn encourages more adoption and production, creating a self-sustaining downward spiral of prices and upward surge in deployment. This cycle is driven by technological advancements, economies of scale in manufacturing, increased competition, and more efficient installation and operation of renewable systems.

China’s value of green energy exports has actually declined by 47% in dollar terms since its March 2023 peak, with the country’s solar manufacturers currently embroiled in a vicious price war. Since 2020, China has seen dramatic price reductions in both solar panels and EV batteries, with solar module prices falling significantly. An average EV battery pack price in China dropped by

[TEXT]
POCAHONTAS, Ark., Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tate, a global leader in innovative, sustainable, and customer-driven infrastructure solutions for mission-critical data center environments, has officially launched its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Pocahontas, Arkansas. The new site expands Tate’s North American production footprint and strengthens its ability to deliver advanced, high-performance data center solutions at scale.

As part of this expansion, the company announced the addition of a new product line and a $4 million investment to support continued growth in the data center sector. The expansion will create 52 new jobs, bringing Tate’s Pocahontas workforce to 200 employees and reinforcing Arkansas as a strategic manufacturing hub for the company.

"Today marks an important milestone not only for Tate, but for the future of data center infrastructure. Our expansion here in Pocahontas represents a long-term investment in American manufacturing, innovation, and the people who make both possible. With this new facility, we’re strengthening our ability to deliver the next generation of data center solutions while creating meaningful opportunities for the community,” said Daniel Kennedy, Global President of Cloud Solutions and Innovation for Tate. “The talent, partnership, and commitment we’ve experienced in Pocahontas have been exceptional, and we’re proud to grow alongside this region.”

Tate hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new 420,000-square-foot facility on Tuesday to celebrate the grand opening. Company executives joined state officials and local leaders to highlight this significant milestone.

“Arkansas is on its way to becoming a tech hub in America’s heartland, and companies like Tate and the solutions they manufacture are critical to our success,” said Governor Sanders. “This investment in Arkansas and the community of Pocahontas will strengthen our economy, grow our workforce, and send a powerful message that the Natural State is the perfect place to build and expand."

A global leader in next-generation products for data centers, Tate offers custom manufacturing capabilities and product lines for floor-to-ceiling solutions for the data center sector. In Pocahontas, the new manufacturing facility will focus on fabricating steel frames for data centers, further strengthening the local economy.

“With this new facility, Tate is planting its flag in Pocahontas and bringing a state-of-the-art manufacturing operation to northeastern Arkansas,” said Clint O’Neal, executive director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission. “Great Arkansas communities like Pocahontas are helping companies thrive thanks to talented employees and a strong value proposition. This is an exciting day for Tate, for the State of Arkansas, and for the City of Pocahontas.”

“Today is a milestone for Pocahontas, and we are proud to welcome Tate to our community,” said Pocahontas Mayor Keith Futrell. “This type of growth doesn’t happen by accident. It is a result of strong partnerships, a skilled workforce, and a commitment to economic development. We are grateful for Tate’s investment in Pocahontas and excited to support their success for years to come.”

"We are thrilled to celebrate the opening of Tate in Northeast Arkansas,” said Graycen Bigger, executive director of the Northeast Arkansas Regional Intermodal Authority. “Today’s ribbon cutting, coupled with Tate’s expansion announcement, is a tremendous win for Pocahontas and our entire region. These advanced manufacturing careers will strengthen local families, expand our skilled workforce, and position Northeast Arkansas for continued growth in today’s data-driven economy. We are proud to partner with Tate, the City of Pocahontas, Black River Technical College, Clay County Electric Cooperative, and AEDC to support this investment and 200 new jobs in our communities."

"The shared expertise, training, internships, and spaces that define the workforce partnership between Tate and BRTC are setting a new standard for all of our future partners,” said Dr. Martin Eggensperger, president of Black River Technical College. “Tate’s continued growth in Pocahontas demonstrates what is possible when industry and higher education work hand in hand.”

[TITLE]Abu Dhabi Investment Office executive optimistic about growth in Chinese investments:
[TEXT]
ABU DHABI, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior executive from the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) said here on Tuesday that investments from China are expected to grow as the emirate diversifies its economy and more Chinese companies plan to establish businesses here.

"In terms of geographies, we are looking to attract more investments from the U.S., Asia, and China. We see a lot of interest from companies to use Abu Dhabi as a hub," said Massimo Falcioni, ADIO's chief competitiveness officer, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua on the sidelines of the four-day Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW) that opened on Monday.

He noted that China is diversifying its traditional exports, which continue to grow and still have significant market potential.

"We're registering a lot of Chinese companies which want to come here. They want not only to assemble their products, but also start manufacturing here. We have seen this in the automotive and mechanics industries mostly," said Falcioni, who leads ADIO's efforts to grow and diversify Abu Dhabi's economy through private-sector investments.

Official statistics showed that Abu Dhabi's real GDP grew 3.8 percent in 2024 compared to 2023, reaching a record 1.2 trillion UAE dirhams (324 billion U.S. dollars). The growth was driven by the non-oil sector, which expanded 6.2 percent, making its highest-ever annual contribution of 54.7 percent to total GDP.

Talking about Abu Dhabi's investment outlook for 2026, Falcioni said he remained optimistic despite high geopolitical risks.

"A lot of investors and funds want to diversify and look at areas outside the U.S. or Europe. The Middle East is a great opportunity, in particular Abu Dhabi," he said.

ADFW is one of the region's leading business and investment events. This year, it brings together global leaders, market experts, policymakers, and investors from over 100 countries to promote dialogue and cooperation.

Banks in the Asia-Pacific region, including those in India, have built stronger capital positions compared to their counterparts in the United States and Western Europe, Moody's highlighted in its latest survey report.The survey pointed out that a comparison of the largest banks in Asia-Pacific systems with peers in the US and Western Europe shows they generally have built strong capital positions under prudent regulatory supervision.Further, it noted that large Asia-Pacific banks' risk-weighted asset (RWA) densities reflect their underlying asset risks, consistent with their credit losses for the past 10 years. It also added that the banks' RWA densities vary across the Asia-Pacific.Risk-weighted assets (RWAs) represent a bank's assets adjusted for risk levels, meaning loans or investments considered riskier are assigned higher weights. A bank with higher RWA density indicates that a larger part of its assets carries higher risk.Explaining the capital strength, Moody's highlighted, "Large private sector banks in India have high CET1 capital adequacy and leverage ratios because their internal capital generation has outpaced their RWA growth in the past couple of years, and they can raise equity easily from capital markets when needed."CET1, or Common Equity Tier 1 capital, refers to a bank's core capital, primarily common shares and retained earnings, which serves as the first line of financial protection against losses. A higher CET1 ratio indicates a stronger ability to absorb shocks without affecting depositors.The report mentioned that as of the end of 2024, the average reported CET1 capital adequacy ratios of the large banks in Hong Kong, India, Korea in the sample stood at 18.0 per cent, 14.7 per cent, and 14.5 per cent, respectively, all above 13.5 per cent for the four largest banks in the US and 13.8 per cent for the top six banks in Western Europe.According to the survey, these banks can also raise equity easily from the capital markets when required. However, it stated that their government-owned peers remain weaker than private banks in both metrics.The report attributed the higher RWA densities in India, Vietnam and among certain Chinese banks to the use of the standardized approach, a regulatory method that assigns fixed risk weights rather than relying on banks' internal risk assessment models.It added that regulators in India have announced plans allowing banks to transition to the more advanced IRB (Internal Ratings-Based) approach by 2028, a move expected to lower RWA densities if successfully implemented.For India, the sample included State Bank of India ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank , together accounting for approximately 50 per cent of system assets.Overall, the report assessed a total of 35 banks across eight key Asia-Pacific banking systems, representing 75 per cent of total assets of all rated banks in these markets.

[TITLE]EU plan would boost ESMA powers over crypto and capital markets:
[TEXT]
The European Commission has proposed expanding the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) over crypto and broader financial markets in a bid to narrow the competitive gap with the United States.

Published Thursday, the package would transfer “direct supervisory competences” for key pieces of market infrastructure, including crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), trading venues and central counterparties, to ESMA and strengthen its coordination role in the asset management sector.

The proposal still needs approval from the European Parliament and the Council, where it is under negotiation.

If adopted, ESMA’s role in overseeing EU capital markets would more closely resemble the centralized framework of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

EU proposal aims to streamline markets and strengthen ESMA’s authority. Source: finance.ec.europa.eu

In September, France became the third European country to call for the Paris-based ESMA to take over supervision of major crypto firms, joining Austrian and Italian securities regulators.

The move followed growing criticism of Malta’s crypto licensing regime. In July, ESMA released a peer review of the Malta Financial Services Authority’s authorization of a crypto service provider, saying that the regulator only “partially met expectations.”

Due to concerns over more lenient regulations in some jurisdictions, France has also threatened to block the “passporting” of European licenses obtained from member states, raising enforcement gaps

[TITLE]Q&A: AI and venture capital, a new partnership?:
[TEXT]

What will be the defining stories in the venture capital world from a top investor’s perspective in 2026? To help answer this question, Digital Journal spoke with Mike Collins, CEO of Alumni Ventures,

Alumni Ventures is one of the most active venture capital firms in the world. The firm has over $1.5 billion in assets, and the firm is ranked #20 on Time Magazine’s Top VC firms for 2025.

Digital Journal: What are the most investable opportunities within the AI value chain right now?

Mike Collins: The short answer: not where the headlines are.

Most people obsess over foundation models and leaderboard scores. That’s interesting, but it’s not where most of the returns will come from. Our team at Alumni Ventures sees these three parts of the AI value chain that are especially attractive right now.

Picks, shovels, and plumbing (AI infrastructure and tooling)

The world is underestimating how much raw compute, cooling, and infrastructure this AI wave will need. Companies like Rigetti (quantum computing) and Lambda (GPU cloud) are tackling the hard infrastructure problems every serious AI company will eventually run into. We also love enabling tech like Frore Systems with solid-state cooling — the boring-sounding stuff that quietly becomes essential.

Vertical AI apps with clear ROI, not science projects

[TITLE]TII says hit by conflicting government policy:
[TEXT]
Transport Infrastructure Ireland said they were hamstrung by year-on-year budget allocations, conflicting government policy, and delays from judicial review.

In a presentation to a high-powered infrastructure taskforce, Transport Infrastructure Ireland said constantly changing government policy was like working with "moving goalposts."

It said there was a lack of clear priorities and that annual funding instead of multi-annual budgets led to a "thin pipeline" of projects.

TII said policy on climate action and spatial planning was changing faster than the planning process leading to considerable risks.

It said some projects could be given planning permission but that government policy would change in the meantime and leave them "open to judicial review."

The presentation was given to the Accelerating Infrastructure Taskforce in June by TII's chief executive Peter Walsh.

It said population growth in Ireland had left services and the transport network under severe pressure and investment was needed.

Chronic congestion problems in cities like Cork, Galway, and Waterford were getting worse and becoming more costly to productivity.

It said government needed to set out much clearer national priorities and that state agencies had to work more closely together.

TII said multi-annual funding would give confidence to industry and that broader infrastructure plans were something that could be looked at.

It said the Adare Bypass had been a good recent example of government bodies working together to get a project moving quickly.

On the planning system, TII said there was "no economic risk" involved for people that took a judicial review.

The presentation said it could add delays of between one and four years and that planning for infrastructure was taking up to nine years, and sometimes even longer.

TII also highlighted government approval processes which required several lengthy technical reviews by multiple agencies.

It said this led to the reopening of "settled questions" causing delays while guidance on how to appraise projects kept changing.

The slideshow said the various review layers should be "collapsed" and the focus should be on mega-projects worth half a billion euro or more.

TII lamented resourcing issues and said "stop-start project delivery" was making it difficult to retain resources, expertise and capacity.

The presentation said local authorities were overstretched, with eroded skills and facing recruitment barriers.

Contractors sometimes favoured work in other countries leading to "leakage", as it was essential for them to have reasonable certainty or predictability on available work.

"Public confidence in schemes [is] impacted," it added.

The slideshow also pointed to a regulatory backlog in determinations on the environment, habitats and biodiversity, waste, and other areas.

TII said what would help them was a revised multi-annual National Development Plan that would show the construction and supply industries there was a steady flow of strategic projects.

It called for a renewed focus on light rail, continued support for Dublin’s Metrolink, and a review of processes around judicial review.

Asked about the presentation, a TII spokesman said: "[Our] expertise in the delivery and operations of transportation infrastructure across the National Roads Network, the Luas Network, MetroLink and Active Travel/Greenways offered a practitioner’s insight to assist the [taskforce]."

[TITLE]Transmission oversight gives project managers ‘eyes in the field’:
[TEXT]
(Credit: ATK Energy Group)

Contributed by Bill Perry

Last summer, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) released a report showing that 334 miles of new 345 kV transmission lines and 554 miles of new 500 kV lines were constructed in 2024. The expansion of transmission lines will require not only engineering, material, equipment, and construction crews but also oversight.

“Oversight prevents redlines and go-backs, and oversight inspectors make sure a project is built correctly,” says the vice president of construction for an engineering, procurement, and construction firm focused on transmission lines.

The vice president notes, “Field oversight is at the front line–the eyes in the field–and raises the issues to fix before they become a problem.”

Extra eyes in the field will be necessary along with other resources if the current speed of transmission construction is to keep pace with experts’ projections. For example, this summer, Grid Strategies LLC wrote that “the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2024 National Transmission Planning Study calls for at least a doubling of the current regional transmission capacity and quadrupling of interregional transmission capacity by 2050.”

“The big improvement that comes through transmission oversight is an objective, third-party view of the work at hand,” says Bill Chesney, director of Client Solutions for Victory Powerline Services, part of ATK Energy Group.

The oversight professional’s goal, says Chesney, is to come to the job, provide expert feedback, and offer a qualified perspective to identify shortfalls. Before joining Victory, Chesney managed planning and scheduling for a major utility’s substation group. Chesney adds, “Utilities benefit when they bring in a neutral party to stay on top of capital projects, construction, and safety.”

Overseeing Safety

Many utilities have their own oversight inspectors. But experts say these people may have multiple jobs to inspect in a day. With time spent driving between job sites, inspectors might have a little more than an hour per day, or perhaps every other day, to check work.

When a third party augments oversight, they can shoulder some of the burden carried by a utility’s own transmission inspectors. A continual presence on a job site is critical to coaching crews to perform better, safer ways of working.

“Guys are now taught to ground a line with insulated gear when they have a clearance; some of us used to grab grounds with our bare hands,” says a veteran transmission lineman working in the Southeastern U.S. “We used to cut poles with chainsaws and wear gloves and a hard hat, but now it’s all those things plus a face mask and ear protection. Oversight guys point this out for everyone’s betterment.”

Safety issues often involve clearances and maintaining minimum approach distance, or MAD, says Chesney. For example, a crew might maneuver their truck into position to untap some bushings. But if they don’t have the proper MAD for getting under the energized line, that’s when an oversight inspector can step in to redirect the crew, adds Chesney. Oversight is

Federal judge overturns Trump ban on wind energy projects

States challenging the president’s January executive order win a battle in court

President Trump suffered a significant legal defeat on Monday, when a federal judge declared his sweeping ban on new wind energy projects unlawful, delivering a victory to environmental advocates and more than a dozen states that challenged the directive.

US District Judge Patti Saris ruled that the executive order signed by Trump in January was arbitrary, capricious and violated federal law. The decision strikes down a policy that effectively halted all federal approvals for wind farms across the country, both onshore and offshore, while the administration conducted what it called a necessary review of approval processes.

The ruling arrives less than a year after Trump signed the controversial order within hours of beginning his second term in office. That directive immediately froze dozens of clean energy projects in various stages of development, including massive offshore installations planned along the Eastern seaboard that represented billions of dollars in potential investment.

Wind projects caught in political crossfire

The executive order created immediate chaos within the renewable energy sector. Project developers warned that the freeze would eliminate thousands of jobs and force companies to abandon investments already years in the making. Several large offshore wind farms planned from Massachusetts through Maryland found themselves in limbo, unable to proceed with construction despite having secured necessary permits under the previous administration.

Trump justified the ban by claiming the government’s approval process for wind projects contained serious legal deficiencies that required immediate attention. His administration has since indicated in court documents that it may move to revoke permits already granted to several offshore wind developments.

The legal challenge brought by states and clean energy organizations argued that the president lacked authority to unilaterally suspend an entire category of energy projects without following proper administrative procedures. Judge Saris ultimately agreed with that assessment, finding the order exceeded presidential powers.

A broader war on renewable energy

The wind ban represents just one front in Trump’s campaign against renewable power sources. Since returning to office, the president has systematically worked to reverse climate policies established during the Biden administration, which had prioritized transitioning American electrical grids toward cleaner energy sources.

Trump has instead focused on bolstering traditional fuel industries, including coal, natural gas and nuclear power. His administration argues these conventional sources provide more reliable around the clock electricity, particularly important as data centers drive unprecedented growth in power demand nationwide.

The policy whipsaw has created uncertainty throughout the energy sector. Companies that invested heavily in wind and solar projects based on Biden era incentives now face an administration openly hostile to their business model. The dramatic shift has complicated long term planning for utilities, developers and investors alike.

Competing visions of energy future

White House officials defended the executive order even after Monday’s ruling, characterizing Biden administration renewable energy policies as providing unfair advantages to wind projects while burdening other energy sectors with excessive regulation. A spokesperson suggested offshore wind developments received preferential treatment that distorted the energy marketplace.

Environmental organizations celebrated the court decision as vindication for clean energy advocates. Groups that challenged the ban described the ruling as a win for consumers, workers, businesses and environmental protection efforts. They urged the administration to abandon what they characterized as illegal interference with renewable energy expansion.

The decision also carries implications for union workers whose jobs depend on wind project construction. Thousands of positions in manufacturing, installation and maintenance hung in the balance while the ban remained in effect.

What happens next

The administration must now decide whether to appeal Judge Saris’s ruling or allow wind project approvals to resume. Even if officials choose not to contest the decision, the months long freeze has already disrupted project timelines and potentially scared off investors wary of future policy reversals.

The case highlights the vulnerability of energy policy to political winds. Projects requiring years of planning and billions in capital face tremendous uncertainty when presidential administrations hold dramatically different views on which power sources deserve government support.

For now, wind energy proponents can claim a meaningful legal victory, though the broader political battle over America’s energy future remains far from resolved.

[TITLE]Qatar Flags Post-2035 LNG Crunch as AI Demand Accelerates:
[TEXT]
Qatar's Energy Minister Al-Kaabi has told a forum in Doha that insufficient investment in energy infrastructure, coupled with surging demand driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom will lead to a global LNG and natural gas shortage after 2035. The energy minister has projected that global LNG demand will surge to 700 million tons per year over the next decade, from 400 million tons currently, noting that oil prices remain below the $70-80 per barrel range required to finance the necessary infrastructure investments.

"In every country we talk to, 10% to 20% of demand comes from artificial intelligence," Al-Kaabi said.

A recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) report says that a record 300 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year of LNG export capacity is set to be added by 2030, with the United States and Qatar accounting for the lion’s share. The U.S. LNG sector has sanctioned more than 80 bcm of annual LNG liquefaction capacity in the current year, an all-time high.

“The coming LNG wave is set to offer some respite for global gas markets, which have been tight and volatile for several years. As new supply comes to market, notably from the United States and Qatar, it should apply downward pressure on prices – offering welcome relief for gas importers worldwide,” said IEA Director of Energy Markets and Security Keisuke Sadamori.”

In sharp contrast, some energy experts are warning

[TITLE]Activist groups urge Congress to pause datacenter buildouts:
[TEXT]
More than 230 organizations across America have signed a letter calling for a moratorium on the construction of datacenters, claiming the current building boom represents a huge environmental and social threat.

The open letter [PDF], sent to members of the US Congress by campaign group Food & Water Watch, complains that the AI-driven wave of datacenter expansion is stoking demand for more energy, which in turn leads to further greenhouse gas emissions, straining water resources, and higher electricity prices for ordinary consumers across the country.

Organizations endorsing the letter collectively represent millions of citizens across all 50 US states, the group claims. It urges members of Congress to suspend the construction of new facilities until adequate regulations are enacted to protect communities and the environment from the damage it claims is already being inflicted.

Investment in datacenters has hit an all-time high, thanks mostly to the burgeoning requirements of training and serving AI. Analyst firm Omdia estimates global datacenter capex will top $657 billion by the end of 2025, almost double the figure of just two years ago, with the US dominating this spending.

In hotspots such as Virginia, hyperscale datacenter capacity is greater than the entire capacity of China or the whole of Europe, according to previous figures. This comes at a cost, as those facilities consumed nearly twice as much power in the second half of 2024 compared to the prior six months. Overall, datacenters' water consumption increased by almost two-thirds over the past five years.

Ordinary Americans will likely pay for all this extra power generating capacity and the grid infrastructure needed to carry it, with a report out last year warning that US consumers could face a 70 percent hike in their electricity bills by 2030.

In addition, it emerged last month that some states are keeping citizens in the dark about the subsidies they use to attract datacenter companies to their territory, which means many projects are being funded at the expense of taxpayers.

Even worse, all these new datacenters are causing greater greenhouse gas emissions, with hyperscale operators such as Microsoft and Google admitting their emissions have risen over the past several years, in spite of their commitments to reach net-zero by the end of the decade.

The demand for power has spurred a resurgence in coal-fired power generation, one of the dirtiest, most polluting ways of producing electricity. And datacenters generating their own energy on-site are also contributing to the problem, as demonstrated by the Colossus facility run by Elon Musk's xAI, which was accused of being one of the largest sources of smog-generating nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the Memphis area thanks to its fleet of gas turbines.

"At a time when millions of Americans are already struggling with soaring utility costs, the sudden explosion of the Big Data industry represents an existential threat for communities ill-equipped to handle the massive environmental and economic hardships these datacenters inflict," stated Food & Water Watch executive director Wenonah Hauter.

"The only prudent action is to halt the unfettered expansion of this dangerous industry in order to properly examine all manner of potential harm before it's too late," she added.

Good luck with that.

As far as the Trump administration is concerned, the US is in a race with China for AI supremacy, and it can only win by investing more in compute muscle to underpin AI development.

US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum went as far to claim that: "The real existential threat right now is not a degree of climate change. It's the fact that we could lose the [AI] arms race if we don't have enough power."

Trump himself pledged to remove obstacles to connecting datacenters to the electricity grid at the federal level during a White House dinner held for tech industry oligarchs in September. And AI investment is the only thing keeping the America out of a recession right now, as economists disclosed in October.

The datacenter industry is aware that it isn't entirely loved, as was revealed at an industry event in June. A Microsoft exec complained there are "communities that don't want us there.".

The consensus was not that the industry needs to change, more that the public should be better informed about what datacenters actually do and the applications and industries which depend upon them. The industry should get people to think of bit barns as vital utilities, like water and electricity. ®
