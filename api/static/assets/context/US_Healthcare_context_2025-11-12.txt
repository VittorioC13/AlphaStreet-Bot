[TITLE]India Coronavirus Vaccine Research Report 2025: $1.25 Bn Market Opportunities, Competition, Forecasts 2020-2030 - Expanding Healthcare in Tier 2 and 3 Cities, and Innovations in MRNA Technology:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "India Coronavirus Vaccine Market, By Region, By Competition, Opportunities & Forecast, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The India Coronavirus Vaccine Market was valued at USD 0.77 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 1.25 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 8.81%.

The Indian government actively promoted and facilitated vaccine distribution and administration. India is known for its robust vaccine manufacturing capacity, and the presence of major vaccine manufacturers like the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech played a vital role in supplying vaccines not only to India but also to other countries.

Ongoing research and development activities for COVID-19 vaccines, including the development of new vaccine candidates and improvements to existing ones, drove the market. Public awareness campaigns and the acceptance of vaccines among the Indian population were essential drivers for vaccine uptake.

Innovations in vaccine technology, including the development of different types of COVID-19 vaccines, played a role in the market's dynamics. Achieving herd immunity and reducing the spread of the virus were overarching goals, pushing vaccine distribution efforts. India's efforts in exporting vaccines to other countries, as part of its vaccine diplomacy, contributed to the market's growth. It enhanced the reputation of Indian vaccine manufacturers and generated revenue.

Key Market Drivers

Pharmaceutical Innovation

One of the most groundbreaking innovations was the development of mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These vaccines use a small piece of the virus's genetic material (messenger RNA) to instruct cells to produce a harmless spike protein found on the virus's surface. For instance, India's robust pharmaceutical industry offers strong investment potential, driven by its global leadership in affordable generics and vaccines, and growing demand in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Valued at approximately US$58 billion, the sector is poised for expansion as biotechnology advances and healthcare commercialization open new product opportunities across domestic and international markets.

The immune system then recognizes this protein and generates an immune response. mRNA vaccine technology had never been used in a widely approved vaccine before, making it a significant breakthrough. Some vaccines, like the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine, use a viral vector approach. They use a harmless adenovirus to deliver a piece of the coronavirus's genetic material into cells to trigger an immune response. This technique allowed for the development of vaccines with a single dose. Traditional protein subunit vaccines were developed for COVID-19, such as the Novavax vaccine. These vaccines contain harmless pieces of the virus, like the spike protein, which trigger an immune response. This approach is familiar and has been used in various vaccines.

Some vaccines, like Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, use inactivated virus particles or a live, weakened form of the virus. These are tried-and-true methods for vaccine development. Many pharmaceutical companies conducted adaptive clinical trials, which allowed for ongoing data analysis and adjustments in real-time. This approach expedited the development process. The pandemic prompted unprecedented levels of collaboration and data sharing among pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and governments. This collaboration helped accelerate vaccine development and the sharing of information regarding vaccine safety and efficacy.

Regulatory agencies around the world adapted their processes to issue emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines, allowing faster deployment while maintaining safety and efficacy standards. Developing vaccines quickly is one part of the challenge; manufacturing them at scale is another. Companies invested in expanding production capacity and optimizing vaccine manufacturing processes. Ongoing surveillance and research into emerging variants of the virus have driven innovation in vaccine development. Manufacturers have explored booster shots and adapted vaccines to address variant strains. This factor will help in the development of the India Coronavirus Vaccine Market.

[TITLE]ProKidney Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results and Provides Regulatory and Clinical Updates:
[TEXT]
Full results from the Phase 2 REGEN-007 study of rilparencel were recently presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2025

More than half of the patients required for the Phase 3 REGEN-006 (PROACT 1) accelerated approval analysis using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope have been enrolled; topline results anticipated in Q2 2027

Ended the third quarter with $272 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, supporting operations into mid-2027

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProKidney Corp. (Nasdaq: PROK) (“ProKidney” or the “Company"), a leading late clinical-stage cell therapy company focused on chronic kidney disease (CKD), today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025, and provided regulatory and clinical updates.

“The Phase 2 REGEN-007 full results recently presented at ASN Kidney Week further strengthen the body of evidence supporting our ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study and underscore the potential of rilparencel to become a novel treatment option for patients with advanced CKD and diabetes,” said Bruce Culleton, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of ProKidney. “In Group 1, which mirrored the dosing regimen being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study, treatment with rilparencel led to statistically significant and clinically meaningful stabilization of kidney function. Notably, 63% of Group 1 patients met the key PROACT 1 inclusion criteria, and similar efficacy was observed in this subgroup compared to the overall Group 1 results. We remain focused on the continued execution of PROACT 1 to bring a potential new treatment option to patients with advanced CKD and diabetes at high risk of kidney failure, an area of significant unmet need.”

Phase 2 REGEN-007 Full Results Recently Presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025

On November 6, 2025, ProKidney presented full results from the Phase 2 REGEN-007 study evaluating rilparencel in patients with advanced CKD and diabetes. The data, featured in a late-breaking clinical trials presentation, further demonstrate the potential of rilparencel to preserve kidney function in patients with advanced CKD and diabetes who are at high risk of kidney failure. Highlights include:

In Group 1 (n=24), bilateral kidney injection with rilparencel resulted in a 4.6 mL/min/1.73m 2 improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 78% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p<0.001)

improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 78% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p<0.001) Among Group 1 patients, 15 of 24 (63%) met key Phase 3 PROACT 1 inclusion criteria; in this subgroup, bilateral kidney injection resulted in a 5.5 mL/min/1.73m 2 improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 85% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p=0.005)

improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 85% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p=0.005) Post-hoc analysis of patient subgroups on standard-of-care (SOC) medications, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), suggest rilparencel had a treatment effect incremental to that observed with SOC

Rilparencel was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile

Phase 3 PROACT 1 Registrational Program Update: Alignment Achieved with FDA on Accelerated Path

In a July 2025 Type B meeting, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that eGFR slope in patients from the ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study can serve as the surrogate endpoint and primary basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission of rilparencel under the accelerated approval pathway. The FDA also confirmed that PROACT 1 may be used to support both accelerated and confirmatory approval of rilparencel. ProKidney continues to maintain its ongoing dialogue with the FDA under rilparencel’s regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation. More than half of the approximately 360 patients required for the accelerated approval analysis using eGFR slope had been enrolled as of August 2025. Topline data readout to support an application for accelerated approval is anticipated in Q2 2027. Rilparencel is the only cell therapy in a Phase 3 clinical study for the treatment of CKD and type 2 diabetes.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights

Liquidity: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2025, totaled $271.7 million, compared to $358.3 million on December 31, 2024. ProKidney expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held on September 30, 2025, will enable the Company to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2027.

R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $26.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $31.3 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of $4.4 million was driven primarily by decreases in costs for clinical operations of approximately $4.2 million driven by the wind down of activities related to REGEN-016 and our other clinical trials that have been completed or terminated. Additionally, the Company has seen decreases in spending on manufacturing process development and professional fees of approximately $1.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. These decreases have been partially offset by increases in equity and cash compensation costs of approximately $1.4 million as the Company continues to hire additional personnel to support our operations and increases in materials costs of $1.2 million to support the Phase 3 clinical program.

G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $17.7 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of $5.8 million has been primarily driven by the decrease in the amount of non-cash impairment charges of $5.0 million related to the Greensboro facility and decreases in cash and equity compensation of approximately $1.9 million. These increases have been partially offset by increases in professional fees of approximately $0.8 million.

Net Loss Before Noncontrolling Interest: Net loss before noncontrolling interest was $35.8 million and $41.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Shares outstanding: Class A and Class B common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2025 totaled 295,266,876.

[TITLE]India Coronavirus Vaccine Research Report 2025: $1.25 Bn Market Opportunities, Competition, Forecasts 2020-2030 - Expanding Healthcare in Tier 2 and 3 Cities, and Innovations in MRNA Technology:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "India Coronavirus Vaccine Market, By Region, By Competition, Opportunities & Forecast, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The India Coronavirus Vaccine Market was valued at USD 0.77 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 1.25 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 8.81%.

The Indian government actively promoted and facilitated vaccine distribution and administration. India is known for its robust vaccine manufacturing capacity, and the presence of major vaccine manufacturers like the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech played a vital role in supplying vaccines not only to India but also to other countries.

Ongoing research and development activities for COVID-19 vaccines, including the development of new vaccine candidates and improvements to existing ones, drove the market. Public awareness campaigns and the acceptance of vaccines among the Indian population were essential drivers for vaccine uptake.

Innovations in vaccine technology, including the development of different types of COVID-19 vaccines, played a role in the market's dynamics. Achieving herd immunity and reducing the spread of the virus were overarching goals, pushing vaccine distribution efforts. India's efforts in exporting vaccines to other countries, as part of its vaccine diplomacy, contributed to the market's growth. It enhanced the reputation of Indian vaccine manufacturers and generated revenue.

Key Market Drivers

Pharmaceutical Innovation

One of the most groundbreaking innovations was the development of mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These vaccines use a small piece of the virus's genetic material (messenger RNA) to instruct cells to produce a harmless spike protein found on the virus's surface. For instance, India's robust pharmaceutical industry offers strong investment potential, driven by its global leadership in affordable generics and vaccines, and growing demand in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Valued at approximately US$58 billion, the sector is poised for expansion as biotechnology advances and healthcare commercialization open new product opportunities across domestic and international markets.

The immune system then recognizes this protein and generates an immune response. mRNA vaccine technology had never been used in a widely approved vaccine before, making it a significant breakthrough. Some vaccines, like the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine, use a viral vector approach. They use a harmless adenovirus to deliver a piece of the coronavirus's genetic material into cells to trigger an immune response. This technique allowed for the development of vaccines with a single dose. Traditional protein subunit vaccines were developed for COVID-19, such as the Novavax vaccine. These vaccines contain harmless pieces of the virus, like the spike protein, which trigger an immune response. This approach is familiar and has been used in various vaccines.

Some vaccines, like Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, use inactivated virus particles or a live, weakened form of the virus. These are tried-and-true methods for vaccine development. Many pharmaceutical companies conducted adaptive clinical trials, which allowed for ongoing data analysis and adjustments in real-time. This approach expedited the development process. The pandemic prompted unprecedented levels of collaboration and data sharing among pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and governments. This collaboration helped accelerate vaccine development and the sharing of information regarding vaccine safety and efficacy.

Regulatory agencies around the world adapted their processes to issue emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines, allowing faster deployment while maintaining safety and efficacy standards. Developing vaccines quickly is one part of the challenge; manufacturing them at scale is another. Companies invested in expanding production capacity and optimizing vaccine manufacturing processes. Ongoing surveillance and research into emerging variants of the virus have driven innovation in vaccine development. Manufacturers have explored booster shots and adapted vaccines to address variant strains. This factor will help in the development of the India Coronavirus Vaccine Market.
