[TITLE]Broadcom (AVGO) Gets $420 Price Target as AI Tailwinds Support Multi-Year Growth:
[TEXT]
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the AI Stocks in Focus on Wall Street. On November 20, Raymond James assumed coverage on the stock with an “Outperform” rating and a price target of $420.00.

Raymond James believes there is upside for several semiconductor stocks, including Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and more.

“The AI secular theme has taken the wheel, and the strategy of trading the cycle in semis has moved to the back seat. Each of these companies is impressive in its own way. We are AI bulls yet acknowledge the rich valuations and risk, but these are high-quality compounders with long-term growth rates above their cost of capital. We are in the midst of an unprecedented structural shift in the technology landscape, and semiconductors are foundational elements.”

Particularly for Broadcom, the firm believes AI share gains, margin strength, and underappreciated software cash flows will support long-term upside.

“We resume coverage of Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) with an Outperform rating. The company is a share gainer in the AI complex, providing operators customized alternatives to general-purpose processors.”

Broadcom is seen gaining share in the AI world since hyperscalers may want customized alternatives to general purpose processors.

Even though non-AI semis and software are restricting overall growth, it expects improvement from the non-AI semis and believes that margin and cash generation from software is not fully appreciated.

“Broadcom’s strength in chiplet and systems solutions, coupled with strong networking IP (processing, PHY/Serdes, Optics, CPO) and steady march of advanced packaging/CPO, is a competitive moat to protect shareholder profitability and market share in a rapidly evolving world. Our $420 price target is based on 30x our FY27E EPS.”

Broadcom is a technology company uniquely positioned in the AI revolution owing to its custom chip offerings and networking assets.

While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]Raymond James Initiates Outperform on AMD, Citing Strong AI Pipeline and Market Share Gains:
[TEXT]
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the AI Stocks in Focus on Wall Street. On November 20, Raymond James assumed coverage on the stock with an “Outperform” rating and a price target of $337.00.

The firm believes AMD is a clear AI beneficiary supported by a potential $15B AI pipeline by 2026 and OpenAI deployments boosting GPU adoption and market share gains.

AMD is seen to be the best positioned to compete with Nvidia in the GPU market, with expectations for “continued momentum” in accelerators and AI rack systems.

“AMD is a leading vendor of CPUs, APUs, and GPUs in the consumer and data center markets and is actively developing new elements including platforms and software. Investor skepticism lingers, but shares have attracted a broader audience than in the past”

According to the analysts, fundamentals need to catch up, and they believe they will.

The recent wins from OpenAI and Humain for ~1GWcould be worth an estimated $15 billion by 2026, growing to over 2 gigawatts in 2027. AMD is also poised for sustained server and PC share gains, added the analysts.

Meanwhile, OpenAI deployments may act as an important endorsement, likely encouraging other model builders and hyperscalers to adopt AMD GPUs.

The firm models just 190K MI350 chips and 915K MI450 chips in FY27, with the company poised for continued server and PC share gains.

“The AI TAM is large enough to support multiple chip suppliers, and AMD will be among the participants. We establish a $337 price target.”

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) develops and sells semiconductors, processors, and GPUs for data centers, gaming, AI, and embedded applications.

While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Marvell (MRVL) Earns $121 Price Target on Rising AI Compute and Advanced Packaging Momentum:
[TEXT]
Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) is one of the AI Stocks in Focus on Wall Street. On November 20, Raymond James assumed coverage on the stock with a Strong Buy rating and a price target of $121.00. The firm is bullish on the stock as it sees Marvell well-positioned for AI-driven demand and advanced packaging trends.

While analysts acknowledge how Marvell faces skepticism being a secondary custom silicon supplier, it believes it has the right ingredients due to its application specific integrated circuit business and optics segment.

“Marvell’s shares have traded 25–30× next-twelve-month (NTM) P/E after re-rating lower earlier this year (the 3-year and 5-year average is ~30×), and applying today’s 26× multiple to our $4.67 FY28/CY27 EPS estimate yields a price target of $121.”

The firm’s model reflects content share declines to 10% at Amazon because of more IP/design moves to Alchip and Amazon’s Annapurna internal design team. Moreover, it models Trainium/Inferencia chips totaling 1.5 million in CY25, increasing to 2 million in CY26 and 2.8 million in CY27.

It also assumes a similar 10% content ratio for Microsoft’s Maia as it “ramps to meaningful production from ~75K in CY25 to 382K in CY26 and 620K chips in CY27.”

The expected growth in shipments will likely drive custom compute sales to $1.4B (-6% y/y) in CY26 and $2.2B (+50% y/y) in CY27; added the analysts. Meanwhile, optics is expected to climb $4.4B and $5.6B in CY26 and CY27, growing 40% and 26%.

“Marvell is well positioned to thrive when advanced packaging becomes the market model with chiplets and massive amounts of interconnect.”

Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) engages in the development and production of semiconductors, focusing heavily on data centers.

While we acknowledge the potential of MRVL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Alibaba’s AI Arm Surges 34% Though Big Spending Hits Profit:
[TEXT]
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. posted better-than-projected 34% revenue growth in its cloud business, offsetting a plunge in profit after the company unleashed spending on consumer subsidies and data centers to ride an AI boom.

The cloud division, which houses the flagship Qwen platform, propelled overall revenue 5% higher to 247.8 billion yuan ($35 billion) in the September quarter, just outstripping expectations. It posted a 16% rise in Chinese e-commerce revenue, suggesting it was holding its own in a three-way battle with JD.com Inc. and Meituan — one that compressed margins and halved its net income. The company’s US shares fell more than 2%.

[TITLE]Triple Zero Custodian might force telcos to share info:
[TEXT]
The federal government’s newly-operationalised Triple Zero Custodian might force telcos to enter new information sharing schemes to ensure emergency call services operate reliably and oblige them to be more transparent with information during disruptions.

It will also be searching for gaps in the current transparency arrangements that apply to carriers when making triple zero outages known to the public and authorities.

Additionally, it's also exploring “possible databases” to improve calling device compliance.

The measures, formulated in response to the September 18 Optus triple zero outage, are among six immediate work priorities that the custodian set out in its submission to the federal parliamentary inquiry into mass service disruption late yesterday.

The custodian wrote to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to put it on notice that the priorities would be its focus throughout the remainder of the year and beyond into early 2026, according to the department’s submission.

The department said it expected the new information sharing arrangements to take the form of mutual assistance arrangements.

It told the inquiry that it was “considering options to promote and, if necessary, compel carriers and the [emergency call providers] to enter into mutual assistance arrangements to share information critical to the carriage of calls to triple zero”.

To address issues around information transparency, the custodian said it would aim to close “gaps” in the notification framework that carriers currently work within when reporting triple zero service disruptions.

To that end, the custodian has put new regulations on the table for consideration.

Rounding out the list of six work priorities, the custodian told the inquiry it would work with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) on network reliability and explore mandatory standards for carrying out welfare checks in the aftermath of mass triple zero call disruptions.

It said that the reliability measures would include “regular network testing and in advance of any network upgrades”, in a less than subtle reference to the botched network firewall upgrade that was behind the Optus outage in September.

Australian telcos have already taken steps to try get out ahead of these issues in anticipation of a punishing new regulatory crackdowns in response to fatalities linked to the Optus emergency call service failures.

The carriers face the twinned wrath of an increasingly fearful public and a political class scrambling to come to grips with how to deal with the issues.

Nearly two months to the day after the Optus outage, that anger was reinvigorated when TPG Telecom reported that a customer of its Lebara-branded network tragically died after failing to reach first responders.

The deceased was using a model of Samsung handset among 71 known to have problems placing emergency calls.

Carriers have, for over a year, been asking customers to patch older devices with a software update or replace them. Otherwise, the carriers have told customers, they will block the devices altogether.

As reported by iTnews earlier this month, carriers have been trying to address this part of the problem, getting behind their industry lobby, the Australian Telecommunications Alliance (ATA), to establish a procedure for sharing information

[TITLE]UK government commits GBP 6.9 million to boost satellite communications sector:
[TEXT]
UK government commits GBP 6.9 million to boost satellite communications sector

by Sophie Jenkins

London, UK (SPX) Nov 25, 2025

The UK Space Agency has announced a GBP 6.9 million investment to accelerate the development of next-generation satellite technologies. The new funding, delivered through the European Space Agency's ARTES programme, supports five efforts led by UK organisations and aims to expand the nation's role in innovative space communications.

Projects selected for funding span a range of applications, from satellite refuelling and logistics to advanced 5G and optical communication systems. These initiatives are part of the UK's strategy to strengthen capabilities in satellite communications, positioning, navigation and timing, in-orbit servicing, space domain awareness, and the use of space data for Earth applications.

The European satellite industry is projected to generate GBP 40 billion in revenue by 2033. The UK could secure up to GBP 800 million from just 2% of this market.

Space Minister Liz Lloyd emphasized that "Space technology and especially satellites, are essential to our daily lives. From the sat nav in your car to your mobile phone, from weather forecasts to your online banking - space is where it all happens.

By backing our UK sector, we're not only cementing our position as a European space leader - we're creating high-skilled jobs, attracting investment, and ensuring space technologies can connect communities to the space-enabled services they need."

Among the funded projects, Orbit Fab will carry out the Advancing Satcom Technology with Refuelling and Logistics (ASTRAL) programme, receiving GBP 2.9 million in total and GBP 1.3 million for its initial phase from ESA. The project will demonstrate UK-developed technology for refuelling electric propulsion satellites, which extends mission lifetimes and improves satellite manoeuvrability.

Cornwall's Goonhilly Earth Station will lead the AGILE project to develop Antenna Ground Interface and LunaNet Equipment. With GBP 1.6 million in funding, the initiative will create units allowing global antennas to communicate directly with lunar spacecraft via the LunaNet specification, supporting the growing wave of lunar missions.

Vicinity Technologies is awarded GBP 1.19 million to design 5G Non-Terrestrial Network payloads and user terminals for its Satellite Access Networks project. The group will build the full software stack for both space and ground segments, intended to provide reliable internet access in underserved and urban areas.

A GBP 356,000 grant goes to Archangel Lightworks for the Space Optical Link Integration Study (SOLIS). In collaboration with Eutelsat, the team will assess the deployment of Free Space Optical Communications within the Eutelsat OneWeb LEO network, aiming for faster, higher-capacity data transmission.

Inmarsat Navigation Ventures Ltd (Viasat UK) will receive GBP 881,000 to develop the International Virtual Satellite Operators Network (Phase 2). This service is designed for governments to plan, procure, and manage secure satellite communications across multiple providers.

UK Space Agency Chief Executive Dr Paul Bate highlighted that "Today's investment shows how the UK's space ambitions translate into real-world impact. By advancing satellite communications technology, we're not only building a globally competitive sector but also ensuring that communities - even in the most remote corners of the UK - can access the services they need. This is space delivering for people and powering our future economy."

The new ARTES projects, in partnership with businesses, universities, and research centres, are expected to stimulate high-skilled employment and deliver tangible advances in weather prediction, communications, and security.

Laurent Jaffart, Director of ESA's Connectivity and Secure Communications, commented, "ESA is committed to supporting a vibrant and striving telecommunications ecosystem in Europe, while achieving a zero-debris environment in space. This milestone, with support from the UK Space Agency, will further strengthen the European autonomy and sovereignty that we are collectively striving for with our Member States."

Dr Colin Baldwin, Executive Director of the UKspace Trade Association, remarked, "UKspace's Satellite Telecommunications Committee, run jointly with techUK, has made a strong case that our industry has the expertise, technology and talent to capture a significant portion of the global satellite communications market over the coming decade.

We are delighted to see so many of our member companies benefiting from and taking advantage of the UK Space Agency's investment in the ARTES programme at the ESA Council of Ministers meeting in 2022 continuing to develop new innovations which will help to achieve this goal."

The funding comes ahead of the ESA Ministerial Council in Bremen, where the UK's investment in future European space activities and economic growth will be decided. Independent analysis indicates that every GBP 1 invested in ESA produces GBP 7.49 in direct economic benefits for the UK.

In addition to ESA programmes, the UK space sector now benefits from expanded national funding, with GBP 2.8 billion allocated to the UK Space Agency through 2029/30.
