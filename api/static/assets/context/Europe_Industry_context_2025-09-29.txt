[TITLE]Shutdown looms as September jobs data, third quarter finale await investors: What to watch this week:
[TEXT]
The major averages finished this past week little changed, as a light economic and earnings calendar saw investors take the week's events in stride, even President Trump's latest tariff surprise late Thursday.

This week, however, looming developments may prove more troublesome for financial markets.

Tuesday is set to be a pivotal day for investors. It will mark the final day of the third quarter, an eventful period that saw the Dow (^DJI), S&P 500 (^GSPC), and Nasdaq (^IXIC) all reach record highs.

Meanwhile, the US government is on a collision course with its latest shutdown, which is set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday, barring congressional action.

A government shutdown potentially imperils the release of upcoming economic data, including Friday's scheduled jobs report, and may muddy the picture ahead of the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting, which is now just four weeks away.

"The only realistic chance of avoiding a shutdown is for the Senate to pass the House-approved [continuing resolution]," Fundstrat's policy strategist Tom Block wrote in a note on Friday. Block noted that since this resolution would be subject to a Senate filibuster, the chamber would need 60 votes to get this bill through, which means flipping seven Democratic senators. A tall order in just a few days.

President Trump is planning to host a bipartisan gathering of the top four US congressional leaders at the White House on Monday afternoon in a final effort to avoid a government shutdown.

If released, Friday's aforementioned September jobs report is expected to be the highlight on the calendar, with Wall Street economists forecasting that the US economy created 43,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs during the month. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.3%.

Data on job openings, consumer confidence, and manufacturing activity are also set to feature on the economic calendar.

Earnings will be quite light, with Nike's (NKE) report on Tuesday set to be the week's biggest corporate update. The big banks will get the third quarter earnings season underway in earnest in mid-October.

Wall Street's Washington worries

Investors have generally been served well by not paying close attention to political goings-on. The coming week might be a hard time to resist the temptation.

In addition to the looming government shutdown and the anticipated monthly jobs data, the legal fight over who sits on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors continues to evolve.

[TITLE]Can Indian flag ships take India’s share of global maritime trade to 30%?:
[TEXT]
At the ‘Samudra ke Samriddhi’ programme in Ahmedabad on 20 September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the staggering financial loss India incurs due to reliance on foreign shipping. India pays foreign shipping companies $75 billion annually, nearly equivalent to its annual defence budget. This is mainly because foreign ships carry almost 95% of India’s export-import trade. “Be it chips or ships, they must be Made in India," Modi said.

Four significant steps to revitalize India’s shipbuilding and maritime ecosystem have been initiated as part of a package approved by the Union cabinet:

One, the Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme has been extended till 31 March 2036. This, coupled with infrastructure status for shipyards, will facilitate credit for setting up shipyards.

Two, a Maritime Development Fund (MDF) has been approved with a corpus of ₹25,000 crore to provide long-term financing for ship acquisition.

Three, the cabinet has approved the allocation of ₹4,001 crore for an innovative scheme, the Shipbreaking Credit Note, which was announced in the budget. This scheme incentivizes ship scrapping by issuing a credit note of 40% of the scrap value that can be reimbursed to buy new ‘Made in India’ ships.

Four, the Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SbDS), with a budgetary outlay of ₹19,989 crore, aims to expand domestic shipbuilding capacity to 4.5 million gross tonnage (GT) annually, support mega shipbuilding clusters and infrastructure expansion, establish an India Ship Technology Centre under the Indian Maritime University and provide risk coverage, including insurance support for shipbuilding projects.

In a related development, the finance ministry has included in the Harmonized Master List (HML) of infrastructure two categories of shipping vessels: (a) Indian-owned and Indian flag ships of 10,000GT capacity or more (b) commercial vessels of 1,500GT or more, which are built in India and under Indian ownership and bear the flag.

The RBI (Project Finance) Directions, 2025, that will come into effect from 1 October, clarify that sectors in HML can avail: (a) flexible lending terms, (b) enhanced limits for loans from banks and financial institutions (c) flexibility in refinancing and restructuring of existing loans and (d) flexibility on provisioning of non-performing assets.

For these benefits to materialize, the next steps should include reaching out to Indian infrastructure finance companies such as NaBFiD, PFC, REC and the Sagarmala Development Finance Corp to open access to their infrastructure funds for Indian shipping companies looking to augment Indian flag tonnage through the acquisition of ships and by building them in Indian yards.

These steps address the supply side. Of equal importance is demand and the government can facilitate this as well. For tugboats and specialized vessel segments, a series of measures, including standard tug designs for use by major ports and mandates for procurement of Indian-made tugs under the Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP), have created long-term visibility on the use of Indian built tugs.

In the context of cargo vessels, the assurance and availability of long-term charters will spur the purchase of ships under the Indian flag as well as ship-building in India.

The greening of ship manufacturing is another area in need of policy support. To be future ready, shipbuilding must adhere to international sustainability and environmental norms. The International Maritime Organization has proposed a net-zero framework for shipping to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050. The EU has already started mandating that ships entering its waters must comply with emission reduction norms.

Given the old age profile of Indian flag ships, the cost of compliance for any net-zero framework will be very high and could hurt our competitiveness. Financial support will be needed to ensure that they are able to comply and stay resilient in the face of a fast-changing regulatory scenario globally.

Similarly, building ships to meet high environmental standards calls for higher investments. A portion of the MDF could hence be dedicated to the financing of clean ship manufacturing as well as the transition of existing fleets.

The Harit Nauka-Green Transition Guidelines for Inland Vessels provided a structured plan for a shift of vessels used for inland passenger transport towards cleaner fuels, while the GTTP incentivized a transition to battery-operated tugs at all Indian ports. Similar programmes exist for investment in cargo vessels.

It will be exciting to see how various Indian policy initiatives unleash a wave of competition and growth in this sector so that not just large, but small and mid-size shipping companies can also thrive in India.

The benefits of the sector being granted infrastructure status include access to debt and equity financing at low cost, with terms matching the lives of vessels.

These are welcome steps. If implemented well, along with other complementary policy moves, it would help India achieve the objective of increasing its share in global maritime trade to at least 30% by 2047, as envisioned by the Prime Minister.

These are the author’s personal views.

[TITLE]I went to the Ryder Cup and calculated the eye-watering cost of spending a single day there:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

How much money is premier golf, questionable outfits, specialty cocktails, and almost unfathomable traffic worth? At this year's Ryder Cup, I made it my mission to find out.

I went to the biennial Europe vs. USA golf tournament on Friday with a media ticket, but everyone else had to buy their way in unless they snagged a corporate invite. Pre-sale tickets for the event went live almost a year ago, starting at $749.51 for entrance on Friday.

Tickets are just the beginning. The costs of the tournament, which is held at Bethpage Black Golf Course in Farmingdale, Long Island, are somewhat of a choose-your-own-adventure. I tallied how much a person coming from New York City might expect to spend in just one day.

The first question is transportation. Many, myself included, took the Long Island Rail Road from New York City. A one-way, off-peak ticket from Penn Station to Farmingdale costs $10.95. Free shuttles were waiting in the parking lot to drive us the two-ish miles to the course, but some opted for an Uber, which cost $25.72 at around 7:30 am.

When I arrived, it seemed that most chose to take the shuttle, though we might have all made a different choice if we'd known the ride would take an hour. Buses jammed the streets, some roads were blocked off, and it quickly became apparent that walking would have been the wiser choice.

For those who decided to brave the traffic and drive the whole way, a parking pass at Jones Beach on Friday was $55, according to the Ryder Cup website. From there, people took a free shuttle to Bethpage. I spotted some opportunistic Long Islanders offering up their driveways for $100.

Some locals offered parking for $100. Alice Tecotzky

The event ticket itself covered basic needs: food and non-alcoholic beverages. But alcohol seemed like a crucial part of the experience for a lot of people. I'd originally planned to calculate the cost of two drinks, but after seeing plenty of people walking around with cocktails and beers by 10 am, three drinks started to seem more appropriate.

A bartender told me that the "All-American Transfusion" and "Cherry Fairway Fizz" were the most popular choices, costing $19.50 and $17.50 before tax, respectively. Make it a double, and it's an extra $6. For a souvenir Ryder Cup glass, it's another $7.

Overall, an "All-American Transfusion" with an extra shot in a special cup cost $32.50. The cheapest beer was $15.

These plastic cups each cost $7. Alice Tecotzky

And then there was the seemingly endless, stadium-size hall of merch. Ralph Lauren Polo was the official outfitter of the US team this year, so the brand had a central spot in the huge merch tent.

One Ralph Lauren employee told me that the team polo shirts and customizable bear tees were the most popular choices, coming in at $128 and $82, respectively. I was a fan of a cashmere sweater, which cost $315. Next to the $415 cotton flag sweater, it didn't sound as bad.

The aforementioned $450 sweater. Alice Tecotzky

Many predictable, somewhat preppy athleisure brands were in the merch tent at comparable price points. A short-sleeved women's Nike polo cost $110, a Vineyard Vines tee was $60, and an Adidas sweater was $190.

Crowds of mostly men swarmed the walls of hats, many of which cost between $30 and $40. Between the $42 Bethpage Black-themed Stanley Cup, the $32 bear stuffed animal, and the $290 duffel bag, it wouldn't be hard to suddenly accumulate thousands of dollars' worth of goodies.

I was tempted by these $12 golf balls before remembering that I don't play golf. Alice Tecotzky

A cashier told me the highest bill he'd seen so far was $1,500, while another said he'd seen someone spend $4,200. Most people, they said, spend a few hundred bucks.

Sufficiently weighed down by golf-themed attire and alcohol, it was time for people to deal with getting home. At 5:12 pm, a bit before the golf matches ended, the short Uber ride from the course to the LIRR station was $68.72, according to my app. After the hourlong morning shuttle, I wasn't shocked that some opted for a car.

A Vineyard Vines would set you back $80. Alice Tecotzky

Of course, plenty of people attend the Ryder Cup for multiple days, meaning they have to think about where to stay, assuming they're not from the Long Island area. Looking online the week of the tournament, nearby hotels were often fully booked or had rooms going for more than $500 a night, way more than the typical rates in the area. Some locals were listing their homes on Airbnb for tens of thousands for just five nights, local news outlet Greater Long Island reported.

And then there were those who flew in for the event from across the country or the pond, adding international airfare to their total costs.

There were endless ways to spend, and spend on, the day. I exercised great self-control and only paid for my LIRR tickets. A typical New Yorker's day, however, might look something like this: entering with a standard Ryder Cup ticket, riding the LIRR both ways, taking the shuttle to the course and an Uber back to the train station, spending $350 on merchandise, and buying three drinks (a double cocktail in a souvenir cup, a single cocktail, and a beer).

That comes out to $1,255.13 — all for America to lose badly in its Friday matches.

Newsroom September 28 11:17

In his weekly post, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis described the past week as “eventful,” due to his presence in New York for the 80th United Nations General Assembly.

As he emphasized, in his meetings with leaders, investors, and opinion makers, “the common thread was the recognition of Greece as a force of stability in Southeastern Europe and the Mediterranean, as an attractive investment destination, and as a reliable partner.”

Mr. Mitsotakis defended Greece’s defense procurement program, highlighting that “we have already received 42 upgraded F-16s, 24 Rafales, while we expect the first FDI frigates in the coming months and the first F-35s in 2028.”

Referring to international developments, he stressed that “the way forward is dialogue, not the language of weapons,” calling on Turkey to withdraw its casus belli. Regarding Gaza, he stated: “There is no justification for the continuation of the war,” expressing support for a two-state solution. Concerning Ukraine, he declared that “we cannot accept under any circumstances the violent redrawing of borders by any revisionist power.”

He also made an important reference to protecting children’s mental health from social media, noting that Greece “is leading the way in setting a minimum age for digital adulthood.”

Regarding P. Routsis’s hunger strike, he stated that “the state must stand with sensitivity beside those who are in pain, even when they challenge it,” while also emphasizing respect for the decisions of the judiciary.

The Prime Minister presented detailed government actions:
