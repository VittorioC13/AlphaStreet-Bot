[TITLE]N.B. Power agrees to buy energy from J.D. Irving's Brighton Mountain wind project:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by AI-based technology. Mispronunciations can occur. We are working with our partners to continually review and improve the results.

J.D. Irving has secured an agreement to sell power from the large wind farm it's building in western New Brunswick to N.B. Power.

The Bright Mountain wind project, first announced by JDI in the spring of 2024, got regulatory approval from the province last winter.

In a news release, N.B. Power announced that an agreement had been signed to purchase 200 megawatts of energy from the project.

“We are pleased to see such a strong interest to add renewables to our grid and to proceed with this shovel ready project,” said N.B. Power Lori Clark in the release.

“With our province facing an energy shortfall as early as 2028, this agreement and strategic partnership will help us integrate additional renewable power into our systems at an expedited rate, which is so necessary to help us meet the growing energy needs of New Brunswickers both cost-effectively and efficiently.”

No details or terms of the agreement have been provided.

Construction activities have already begun at the site, which is JDI's first venture into the wind business.

The latest construction update posted on JDI’s website for the project, from October, said “exploratory activity with light construction activity” would be going on at the site.

An earlier update said timber harvesting and work at the pad sites for the turbines took place from June to September.

JDI got approval last November for the first phase of its $550 million Brighton Mountain wind farm project near Juniper in Carleton County. The website says this phase is expected to be completed in 2027.

Company documents available on the project website show the first phase will have up to 34 turbines on the northern half of the project property with a capacity of up to 200 megawatts.

The second phase, which would include up to 24 turbines with a capacity of up to about 150 megawatts, would need its own approval.

At a public meeting in Juniper in the summer of 2024, several local residents spoke out against the project, citing environmental concerns and what they called a lack of communication from the company.

NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — The developers of a Virginia offshore wind project are asking a federal judge to block a Trump administration order that halted construction of their project, along with four others, over national security concerns.

Dominion Energy Virginia said in its lawsuit filed late Tuesday that the government’s order is “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. The Richmond-based company is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a project it says is essential to meet dramatically growing energy needs driven by dozens of new data centers.

The Interior Department did not detail the security concerns in blocking the five projects on Monday. In a letter to project developers, Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management set a 90-day period — and possibly longer — “to determine whether the national security threats posed by this project can be adequately mitigated.”

The other projects are the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. Democratic governors in those states have vowed to fight the order, the latest action by the Trump administration to hobble offshore wind in its push against renewable energy sources.

Dominion’s project has been under construction since early 2024 and was scheduled to come online early next year, providing enough energy to power about 660,000 homes. The company said the delay was costing it more than $5 million a day in losses solely for the ships used in round-the-clock construction, and that customers or the company would eventually bear the cost.

Dominion called this week’s order “the latest in a series of irrational agency actions attacking offshore wind and then doubling down when those actions are found unlawful.”

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

U.S. District Judge Jamar Walker set a hearing for 2 p.m. Monday on Dominion’s request for a temporary restraining order.

[TITLE]Texas Launches $350 Million Nuclear Energy Initiative:
[TEXT]
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has congratulated the Texas Legislature for passing House Bill 14, saying it will help revolutionize Texas’ energy sector and cement the state’s role in leading a nuclear power renaissance in the United States.

“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” said Governor Abbott. “By creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million–the largest national commitment--we will jumpstart next-generation nuclear development and deployment. This initiative will also strengthen Texas’ nuclear manufacturing capacity, rebuild a domestic fuel cycle supply chain, and train the future nuclear workforce. I look forward to signing it into law.”

The U.S. nuclear power sector is seeing renewed momentum as electricity demand rises, particularly from data centers, alongside policy support for carbon-free generation and growing interest in long-duration, firm power. Large technology companies are increasingly positioning themselves around nuclear energy through long-term power contracts, development partnerships, and early-stage investments, marking a shift from decades of limited new nuclear deployment.

Microsoft has signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy tied to the company’s nuclear generation fleet, as Constellation evaluates the future of assets including the Three Mile Island site in Pennsylvania. Separately, Microsoft is backing nuclear fusion development through its partnership with Helion Energy. Alphabet has partnered with nuclear startup Kairos Power to support the development of small modular reactor technology, with the aim of sourcing power from future reactors expected to come online in the 2030s. Google has also invested in fusion developer TAE Technologies and early-stage fission company Elemental Power.

Meta Platforms has also signed a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy for electricity from an existing nuclear reactor in Illinois and has issued a request for proposals seeking 1–4 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity in the United States. Meanwhile, TerraPower, founded and backed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, is developing a sodium-cooled fast reactor, with a demonstration project underway in Wyoming. Oklo, backed by OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, is developing small-scale nuclear reactors aimed at supplying power to data centers, with the company targeting initial deployment later this decade, subject to regulatory approval.

[TITLE]Oil Slides on Ukraine Deal Prospects:
[TEXT]
Oil slumped in muted post-Christmas trading as investors assessed a fresh development in long-stalled Ukraine peace talks which could lead to a deal that allows more Russian oil into global markets grappling with oversupply.

West Texas Intermediate edged down 2.8% on Friday to settle near $57 a barrel, the biggest drop since mid-November, while Brent ended below $61. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he expects to meet with US President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday

[TITLE]Iraq and Kurdistan Extend Oil Export Deal to March 2026:
[TEXT]
Iraq and Kurdistan agreed this week to extend a deal for the export of crude oil from the northern semi-autonomous region until March 2026, Rudaw reported, citing the head of Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization.

“The three sides - the federal government, the Kurdistan Regional Government, and the oil companies - have agreed to renew the agreement for the export of Kurdistan Region oil,” SOMO’s Ali Nazar al-Shatri told the news outlet. The extension agreement comes a week before the expiry of the current deal, agreed in September.

Exports from Iraq’s northern region via the Iraq-Turkey pipeline to Ceyhan resumed on September 27, after two and a half years of halt over disagreements between the federal Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Regional Government over how export revenues should be distributed.

Eight foreign companies operating in Kurdistan signed agreements with the KRG and the Federal Government of Iraq to enable the restart of international crude exports from the region.

Under the agreement to restart oil exports, hailed as historic by Iraq’s federal government, KRG began delivering at the end of September about 190,000 bpd of crude to SOMO. Kurdistan is also entitled to keep 50,000 bpd to use for local consumption. Per the original agreement, KRG committed to delivering at least 230,000 barrels of crude daily to the Iraqi state oil marketing company.

Earlier this month, SOMO reminded foreign oil companies operating in Kurdistan that under that September deal they had a commitment to transfer their output from the region to SOMO. There is one company that refused to sign the deal, Norwegian DNO, which delivers its Kurdish crude directly to the Kurdistan government. The company, which is the largest foreign oil operator in Kurdistan, has concerns about the repayment of outstanding debt under the September deal.

[TITLE]What Would A Peace Deal In Ukraine Mean For The Global Oil Market?:
[TEXT]
The prospect of a peace deal in Ukraine has been gaining momentum in the global oil market over the past few days, stripping away part of the geopolitical risk premium that has kept prices elevated since Russia’s invasion on 24 February 2022. Following meetings last week in Berlin with Ukrainian and European officials, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner stated that consensus was reached on around 90% of the issues within a 20-point peace plan. Ukraine has indicated that it may drop its NATO membership bid in exchange for legally binding U.S. and European security assurances, similar to NATO’s Article 5. This states that an attack on one member is an attack on all, obligating other members to assist, potentially with armed force, to restore security. The U.S. has now said that it is offering ‘Article 5-like’ assurances, with President Donald Trump now reportedly willing to submit to the Senate for approval. Meanwhile, Russia has indicated it could accept Ukraine joining the European Union (E.U.) of 27 countries as part of a settlement, a major shift from its earlier stance. However, it continues to demand that Ukraine withdraw from parts of Donetsk still under Kyiv’s control, while Ukraine rejects ceding territory. Talks continue, with Trump saying in the last few days that “we’re closer now [to a peace deal] than we have been,” so what would it mean if such an agreement was reached tomorrow?

Even if a full peace agreement were reached tomorrow – freely agreed by both Ukraine and Russia -- it would likely take months for any significant rolling back of U.S. sanctions on Russia to occur, and years before all such prohibitions were removed. “Literally thousands of sanctions have been imposed on Russia since [24 February] 2022, involving codification through multiple executive orders, Treasury designations, and sometimes congressional legislation, so removing them doesn’t just mean a signature,” a senior Washington-based source who works closely with the U.S. Treasury Department exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “Removing each one will require a formal review process, inter?agency coordination, and sometimes Senate approval if treaty?level commitments are involved,” he noted. “Don’t forget that these sanctions often also feed into similar ones on third-country firms and individuals that are connected to Russia, so getting rid of those would require another level of legal process and negotiations with allies in Europe and Asia, which would be very time consuming,” he underlined. “And on top of that any major rollback could be challenged every step of the way by the lawmakers, which would take it out of the control of the executive,” he told OilPrice.com. Ultimately, sanctions are seen as the tangible sign of U.S. resolve, and any rapid removal – absent a clear milestone achieved by Russia – would risk being read by allies and adversaries alike as a reward for aggression. Given this, any substantive longer-term effects on the global oil market would likely be muted.

Related: Oil Prices Jump 2% on Fear of Supply Disruptions in Russia and Venezuela

Even more so, as it is highly likely that such an initiative would involve a graduated process, as with Iran, according to the Washington source. Indeed, once the U.S. had agreed to the ‘Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action’ (JCPOA, or colloquially ‘the nuclear deal’) on 14 July 2015, sanctions relief for Iran was phased in over years, contingent on verified compliance milestones, with Treasury and State monitoring implementation before easing restrictions, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. “It’s pretty clear that the Europeans would want to see this sort of a rollback, and Ukraine too, with [sanctions] relief charted against benchmarks, not a blanket lifting overnight,” said the Washington source. “In this case [Ukraine], we’d be looking for proof that Russia is not continuing with military support for its occupied territories, or a further build-up of Russian military in those regions, and this would require international monitoring,” he observed. Moreover, as seen in the E.U.’s recent ‘Sanctions Snapback’ on Iran, any relief programme for Russia would almost certainly contain a similar mechanism to re?impose measures if Moscow breached peace terms. Judging from the Snapback on Iran, and the likely terms for Russia of any peace deal, such a snapback for Moscow would involve a quick and broad-based reimposition of sanctions on it and third parties relating to military hardware, dual-use (civilian and military) technology, and finance as monitored through the lens of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF enforces 40 standards against money laundering and nine against terrorist financing, with sweeping powers to sanction individuals, firms, or states that fall short. Its grey? and black?list designations trigger escalating restrictions, making it an aggressive enforcement tool.

In any event, Europe – both the E.U. and other countries, including Great Britain – looks even less likely than the U.S. to start rolling back sanctions on Russia any time soon. After years of effectively bankrolling the Russian war machine through vast imports of the country’s oil and gas, the message finally appears to have sunk in: the rest of Europe is in President Vladimir Putin’s sights after Ukraine. He laid the groundwork for what was to come back in his second state?of?the?nation speech after his 2004 re?election, broadcast live on Russian television, when he said: “The demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century. As for the Russian people, it became a genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory.” Following that, his tentative first military incursion into a sovereign European country – Georgia in 2008 – showed him that he could get away with more, in the classic ‘salami slicing’ strategy of territorial advancement that he has used since. This was because of the ineffectual response from Europe to this aggression – itself a result of the fact that the continent, particularly Germany, was unwilling to jeopardise its cheap Russian gas and oil supplies, as also detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. When the same meek response met his 2014 invasion of Ukraine, and subsequent annexation of Crimea, it was game on for the full invasion of Ukraine in 2022. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte laid it out bare for Europe just over a week ago: “We are Russia’s next target. And we are already in harm’s way.” With this view now widespread among Europe’s top leaders, the meaningful rollback of sanctions on Moscow looks unlikely, with the corollary lack of long-term follow-through in the global oil market.

President Trump has further fuelled Europe’s determination to take its own path on Russia, having made it clear early in this presidency that NATO members who did not dramatically increase their defence spending could not rely on U.S. military support in the event of attack from Russia. The last time NATO met, members agreed to increase their defence spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, up from an average of 2% last year. Against this backdrop, it would be too obscene even for Germany to advocate the resumption of oil and gas imports in size from Russia. Indeed, around two weeks ago, the E.U. fully agreed to implement its ‘REPowerEU Roadmap’, which European Commission (E.C.) President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted as enabling the continent to: “Enter the era of Europe’s full energy independence from Russia [as] Today, we are stopping these imports permanently.” She underlined: “By depleting [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.” E.C. Commissioner, Dan Jørgensen, put it even more plainly: “We [the E.U.] will “never go back to our dangerous dependence on Russia, we will never go back to volatile supplies and market manipulation, and we will never go back to energy blackmail and economic exposure.” As such, the agreement contains bans on E.U. imports of pipelined natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and oil from Russia, as analysed fully by OilPrice.com. As one senior source in the EU’s security complex exclusively told OilPrice.com last week: “Regardless of what the Americans do, and regardless of any peace deal in Ukraine, we’re not rolling back anything on Russia.”

[TITLE]Africa Needs $100 Billion in Refining Investment as Oil Demand Soars:
[TEXT]
Africa’s crude oil demand is set to more than double to 4.5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2050, which will need more than $100 billion in investment in refining over the next decades, according to the African Refiners and Distributors Association (ARDA).

Thanks to population growth, urbanization, and industrialization, Africa’s crude oil consumption is expected to jump from 1.8 million bpd in 2024 to as much as 4.5 million bpd by 2050, ARDA Executive Secretary, Anibor Kragha, has said, as carried by African news outlets including Arise News.

The expected surge in demand positions Africa’s refining industry as one of the world’s biggest untapped investment frontiers, according to the association.

Despite the growth in consumption, Africa remains reliant on fuel imports, which expose many of the countries on the continent to price swings, supply disruptions, and reduction of their foreign exchange (forex) reserves, ARDA’s Kragha said.

“Downstream investment has stagnated even as upstream production grows, leaving Africa stuck in the costly paradox of exporting crude and importing refined products at a premium,” ARDA’s Kragha said.

To boost domestic fuel supply, Africa will need more than $100 billion in upgrades of mothballed or dilapidated refineries, expansion of existing refining capacity, and new greenfield projects to supply fuels, the African refiners’ association reckons.

A key hurdle to Africa-made fuels is the lack of harmonized fuel specifications, Kragha noted, adding that out of 54 countries in Africa, as many as 46 maintain various national fuel standards. All these mean there are 12 different gasoline and 11 diesel varieties being sold across Africa.

“Africa’s downstream sector is one of the world’s last large-scale, high-growth energy investment frontiers. The demand curve is defined by demographics. The supply deficit is structural. The capital requirement exceeds $100 billion. And the economic upside is transformative,” Kragha said.

As India steps up its clean energy ambitions while managing rising electricity demand from industry, mobility and digital infrastructure, the focus is shifting from capacity creation to grid readiness.In this interview with The Economic Times, N Venu, MD & CEO, India and South Asia, Hitachi Energy, outlines how COP30 priorities, high-voltage transmission, energy storage, and localisation will shape the next phase of India’s power sector transition.India approached COP30 with a clear focus on helping developing countries accelerate their progress towards climate goals, backed by predictable finance, accessible practical technology and a transition path that supports economic prosperity. This direction is closely linked to India’s own energy priorities, where renewable capacity is growing quickly, and electricity demand from industry, mobility and digital infrastructure continues to rise. The next stage of progress depends on strengthening the grid so that clean power can be transmitted reliably from renewable parks to major consumption centres.India’s grid expansion agenda aligns closely with the areas where Hitachi Energy brings long-standing technical expertise. High-voltage direct current (HVDC) links enable the transmission of large amounts of clean energy over long distances with reduced energy losses. Digital substations enhance power quality in densely populated urban areas. Advanced automation and protection systems support grid stability as renewable energy sources scale. These capabilities align with India’s COP30 commitments by enabling a cleaner, stronger and more efficient power system.India has made strong progress through the Green Energy Corridor and new transmission plans in renewable-rich states. Recently, we reached a historic milestone as the country’s total installed electricity capacity surpassed 500 GW, reaching 500.89 GW. The recent milestone of surpassing 500 GW of total installed capacity, with clean energy accounting for a majority share, underscores the need for the grid to expand more rapidly.Renewable capacity is increasing rapidly. To maintain stability, India needs more high-voltage lines (both HVAC and HVDC with STATCOM), smarter substations, and stronger regional coordination. The focus now should be on acquiring land for solar plants, right-of-way approvals, quick project execution, advanced system protection and control, and better integration of renewable clusters so that the energy transition moves from generation success to delivery excellence.Hitachi Energy has been closely associated with India’s HVDC journey since the late 1980s, when it helped deliver some of the country’s earliest long-distance transmission links. Over the years, the company has executed six HVDC projects that have strengthened India’s national grid, with a seventh project, the “Mumbai Infeed Project,” currently underway.More recently, Hitachi Energy has been awarded two landmark projects, the Bhadla-Fatehpur and Khavda-Nagpur HVDC links. Once completed, these projects will move over 12,000 MW of clean power from regions rich in renewables, such as Gujarat and Rajasthan, to major consumption centres across the country. Each of these projects reflects the company’s commitment to building the next generation of transmission systems that make renewable energy accessible and reliable on a national scale. With the strong potential of offshore wind power in India, sub-sea HVDC connection can help deliver power onshore more efficiently and reliably.Furthermore, Hitachi Energy’s global experience, covering projects that integrate more than 150 GW of HVDC capacity, offers valuable insight for India as it builds new renewable corridors.Storage has moved from discussion to deployment. The Solar Energy Corporation of India’s tender for 1.2 GW of renewable projects with 4.8 GWh of battery capacity marks a turning point. The next step is maintaining a steady pipeline so that manufacturers and financiers can plan long-term. Short-duration batteries balance daily fluctuations, while long-duration systems such as pumped hydro or flow batteries help stabilise supply over seasons. Integrating storage with transmission assets is essential. With advanced controls and real-time digital tools, stored power can be dispatched precisely and faster when it brings the greatest value, improving both reliability and economics for the grid. Green hydrogen fuel cell-based energy storage can complement battery energy storage with longer-duration storage.The digital economy is transforming how electricity is consumed. Clusters of hyperscale and AI data centres in Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad are expected to add nearly 5–6 GW of new load by 2030, contributing to India’s rising base power demand. These facilities consume two to three times more power than traditional data centres and require uninterrupted, high-quality electricity round the clock. As a result, utilities will need to expand transmission capacity, reinforce substations, and integrate automation to maintain grid stability. Hitachi Energy is enabling this shift through digital substations, transformers and real-time grid management systems, ensuring India’s AI-driven growth is powered efficiently and sustainably. Data centers are looking for green energy as part of a sustainable and carbon-neutral strategy. Utilities need to ensure green power purchase agreements are fulfilled with grid wheeling the power from renewable sources.Local manufacturing is not only an economic opportunity but also a foundation for expanding and strengthening the grid faster. When equipment such as transformers and switchgear is built closer to where it is deployed, delivery timelines shorten and service capability improves.
