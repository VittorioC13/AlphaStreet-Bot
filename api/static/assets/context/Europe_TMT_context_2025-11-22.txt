[TITLE]Smartkem and Jericho Energy Ventures Extend Letter Of Intent for Proposed All-Stock Merger to Form U.S.-Owned, AI-Focused Infrastructure Company:
[TEXT]
Proposed all-stock transaction aims to align JEV's scalable energy platform with Smartkem's semiconductor innovations to power next generation AI data centers

MANCHESTER, England, Nov. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Smartkem, Inc. (Nasdaq: SMTK), ("Smartkem"), a company developing a new class of organic semiconductor technology, today announced that it has agreed to a 60-day extension of its non-binding Letter of Intent ("LOI") for a proposed all-stock business combination (the "Proposed Transaction") with Jericho Energy Ventures Inc. (TSX-V: JEV, OTC: JROOF) ("Jericho" or "JEV"), an energy innovation company. The amendment to the LOI also extends the deadline by which Smartkem is required to invest in Jericho to prevent Jericho from having the right to terminate the LOI to December 31, 2025. The other terms of the LOI remain unchanged.

As previously disclosed, if completed, the Proposed Transaction would establish a Nasdaq-listed, U.S.-owned and controlled AI infrastructure company that integrates low-cost domestic energy with advanced semiconductor packaging and materials to support the rapidly growing demand for AI compute capacity.

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY

Ian Jenks, Chairman & CEO of Smartkem

"We are pleased to extend the LOI as both teams are committed to working towards a transaction that could unlock meaningful value across the rapidly converging energy and AI sectors. We believe the opportunity to integrate Smartkem's world-class semiconductor materials with JEV's scalable energy platform represents a compelling strategic path forward."

Brian Williamson, CEO of Jericho Energy Ventures

"Extending the LOI reflects the continued enthusiasm between JEV and Smartkem to progress with the proposed merger to create a U.S.-owned AI infrastructure company that brings together JEV's energy innovation and Smartkem's semiconductor capabilities. We look forward to discussions toward a definitive agreement."

Anthony Amato, Strategic Advisor to Smartkem

"This extension indicates the significant potential that both parties see in combining the complementary capabilities of JEV's energy platform with Smartkem's semiconductor technology to meet the power and performance needs of next-generation AI infrastructure."

The LOI is non-binding, and there can be no assurance that Smartkem and Jericho will ultimately enter into a definitive agreement for the Proposed Transaction, that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated, or as to the timing or ultimate terms of any Proposed Transaction that may occur. Both Smartkem and Jericho will need significant additional capital to complete the negotiation of the Proposed Transaction, obtain any required stockholder approvals and ultimately complete the Proposed Transaction. The closing of the Proposed Transaction would be subject to significant closing conditions, including the negotiation of the definitive agreement, the satisfactory completion of due diligence, required board and stockholder approvals, and approval of continued listing by Nasdaq.

[TITLE]Aramco Redefines Oil Power in $120 Billion U.S. Tech and LNG Alliance:
[TEXT]
The outcome of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, including his meeting with Trump and his entire entourage, has been successful, at least by media reporting. The impact of all is still to be seen, but from the start, MBS’s visit not just rebooted a strained political relationship. The primary outcome, based on all, is that it has reset the economic core of the US–Saudi partnership around Aramco. While the largest oil company in the world had already found its place in global power projections, Aramco has now become the principal vehicle for turning headline investment promises into hard assets, contracts, and code.

Though 2025 isn’t over yet, Aramco’s multibillion-dollar dealmaking spree with the United States has already reached staggering levels. In May 2025, the oil company had already unveiled 34 preliminary agreements with US companies worth up to $90 billion, encompassing a wide range of projects, including LNG, refinery upgrades, AI, advanced materials, and finance. The latter is now followed by another 17 MOUs, adding another $30 billion in potential projects, from LNG and manufacturing to services procurement. If you take both figures together, it shows clearly that the Saudi pledge to raise total investments is now anchored at around $1 trillion.

Analysts should understand that these levels of financial commitments are no longer just

[TEXT]
Dan Hanbury, global equity portfolio manager at Ninety One, which holds Nvidia as its second-largest holding in its global strategic equity fund, cautiously welcomed Nvidia's share price jump in Thursday's premarket trade. "As a holder, it's great to see an early positive reaction but of course as we know those reactions can reverse further into the day," Hanbury told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe." "Our reading of the numbers is they are very strong. Clearly, we can get caught up in the quarterly noise of a company like this but if we just put those [numbers] in context … only three years ago they were delivering $15 billion of data center revenue, we're now looking at consensus forecasts into next year of $280 billion," Hanbury said.

[TITLE]Public Money, Private Innovation: How Government Funding Built – and Sustains – America’s Technological Leadership:
[TEXT]
Yves here. We have regularly amplified the findings of Marianna Mazzucato’s seminal work, The Entrepreneurial State. She documented how the US funded basic research across many universities and fostered creative collaboration with business. That, contrary to ideology, made government, and not the private sector, the leader in innovation by regularly taking risks on fundamental investigation that companies were unable or unwilling to take.

The study below provides a new layer to this general picture. It shows that publicly funded patents that wind up being privately owned are disproportionately productive.

By Andrea Gazzani, Senior Economist Bank Of Italy, Joseba Martinez, Assistant Professor of Economics London Business School, Filippo Natoli, Senior Economist Bank Of Italy, and Paolo Surico, Professor of Economics London Business School. Originally published at VoxEU

The US has long been the world’s innovation powerhouse, based on a system that combines public funding with private initiative. Yet this model is under strain. Using newly digitised US patent data since 1950, this column shows that publicly funded but privately owned patents – just 2% of all US patents – account for around 20% of medium-term fluctuations in productivity and GDP growth. As funding cuts threaten the most productive funders of public R&D, the authors argue that America’s innovation edge rests on the visible hand of public support for basic research.

The US has long been the world’s innovation powerhouse. From semiconductors to the internet, from biotechnology to artificial intelligence, America’s scientific leadership has rested on an ecosystem that combines public funding with private initiative. Yet this model is under strain. Recent debates over proposed budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) come at a time when other economies — notably China and the EU — are increasing public investment in frontier technologies. These shifts have reignited a central question: how much of America’s innovation edge depends on public money?

In a new paper (Gazzani et al. 2025), we provide fresh empirical evidence on the macroeconomic impact of the post-war American innovation model — the one first envisioned by Vannevar Bush in Science, the Endless Frontier (1945). Using newly digitised US patent data that distinguish funding sources and ownership structures, we show that government-funded but privately owned patents — just 2% of all patents — account for roughly 20% of medium-term fluctuations in US productivity and GDP growth. These public–private innovations also crowd in private R&D and investment, underscoring the outsized returns to government support for basic research.

Our findings suggest that the US owes much of its technological dynamism not to the invisible hand of the market alone, but to what might be called the visible hand of government-enabled innovation.

The Global Race for Innovation Leadership

The US government’s role in shaping technological progress is often taken for granted. But in the current policy climate, where deficit concerns dominate, public research funding faces renewed scrutiny. The NIH and NSF — central pillars of American science since the 1950s — are under pressure even as China channels massive state resources into artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and green technologies. The EU, too, has expanded its Horizon Europe programme and national innovation funds to address its lagging productivity growth (see Aghion 2024, Bloom et al. 2019).

This is not the first time such a tension has surfaced. As argued by Mazzucato (2013), government agencies have long been the ‘entrepreneurial state’, de-risking the fundamental research that private firms later commercialise. Recent research has examined this theme from various angles — from the macroeconomic effects of public R&D (Fieldhouse and Mertens 2023) to the connection between fiscal policy in a high-debt environment and productivity growth (Fornaro and Wolf 2025). Our work complements this line of research by tracing, at the aggregate level, how different forms of public and private innovation have shaped US productivity dynamics over the past seven decades.

Mapping America’s Innovation Architecture

Following Bush’s blueprint, post-war US innovation has been built on three pillars:

Government funding for areas of public interest Universities and research institutes to conduct fundamental research Private firms to commercialise the resulting knowledge.

Using the Government Patent Register database (Gross and Sampat 2025), we classify all US patents granted since 1950 into three groups:

Public–private (funded by government, owned by a private entity)

(funded by government, owned by a private entity) Private–private (fully privately funded and owned)

(fully privately funded and owned) Public–public (funded and owned by the government)

We then link these time series to macroeconomic indicators such as total factor productivity (TFP), GDP, R&D expenditure, and investment. By controlling for the business cycle and showing that our innovation measures are not predicted by fiscal and monetary shocks, we isolate the medium-term co-movements between innovation activity and aggregate outcomes.

The results are striking. Figure 1 displays the macroeconomic effects of innovation, showing that public-private patents (first column) are characterised by the largest medium-term impact on both output (first row) and productivity (second row), doubling those of private sector innovations over the same horizons (second column). Government-funded but privately owned patents are also associated with sustained increases in private R&D spending, business investment, and real wages. Though public–private patents make up just 2% of the total, they account for

[TITLE]As Russia is accused of hybrid warfare against the West, vital undersea cables show their vulnerability:
[TEXT]
London — Over 95% percent of the world's internet traffic and voice and communication data flows through a vast network of fiber optic cables laid across the floors of oceans and seas. The cables are faster, more reliable and cheaper data carriers than alternatives such as satellites, and they have become indispensable to modern life.

They are the veins and arteries that link our deeply interconnected world, transmitting data for everything from sensitive government and military information and text messages between friends, to trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day, underpinning the global economy.

But our reliance on these undersea cables is a vulnerability, and one that rogue actors have allegedly already tried to exploit, including some adversaries of the United States.

Russia has been accused recently by America's NATO allies of increasing "hybrid warfare" against Europe, and analysts say it has shown a clear interest in targeting things like undersea infrastructure.

"That's quite explicitly a part of Russian thinking regarding modern warfare," said Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, in an interview with CBS News earlier this year.

He said that sabotaging "critical nodes on which society functions… [has been] illustrated in real time in the last few years."

Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has regularly conducted military strikes against Ukrainian energy and transport facilities. But beyond the battlefield, Russia has also been accused of targeting the infrastructure — including undersea cables — that's vital to other countries, including many of the United States' NATO allies.

"The sabotage events, they are a new phenomenon," Gabrielius Landsbergis, the former foreign minister of Lithuania, told CBS News. "They are directly associated with this later stage of Russia's militarization and aggressive action — not just against Ukraine, but also against the West."

Russia has denied allegations of interfering with undersea cables and called accusations it has carried out acts of sabotage in Europe "Russophobia."

What is happening in the Baltic Sea?

The Baltic Sea is a nearly enclosed body of water surrounded by eight NATO countries and Russia.

Relatively few undersea cables connect some of the Baltic NATO members, such as Lithuania, to the rest of Europe and the wider world.

"Baltic states are, you know, not entirely an island, but pretty much so," Landsbergis told CBS News. "That means that for us [Baltic states] to connect to the Western infrastructure, it's a rather difficult task. So most of our connections, a big part of our connections, go through the Baltic Sea."

The Baltic Sea is relatively shallow, meaning ships only need to drag their anchors along the bottom to cause potentially serious damage to cables. That increases the possibility of accidental damage, but also lends plausible deniability to malign actors who would like to carry out sabotage operations there.

And Russia's "shadow fleet" of vessels, with hazy registration and insurance documentation that allows it to continue transporting oil and other energy products around the world despite Western sanctions imposed over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has increased its plausible deniability.

When Finland and Sweden joined NATO, many in the West hoped the Baltic Sea would effectively become a "NATO lake." Over the last few years, there have been several incidents of alleged Russian sabotage of underwater cables in the sea.

"It is clearly a spike," Landsbergis told CBS News. "We have never seen almost any incidents during the last, I don't know, 20 years, and suddenly after [Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine] started, they're basically recurring every month."

Targeting the "anthropogenic shell of modern society"

RUSI's Kaushal said the apparent sabotage operations in the Baltic are an example of the hybrid warfare tactics being increasingly adopted by U.S. adversaries.

"Ever since the 90's and early 2000's, the Russians have talked

Verizon axes 13,000 workers in shocking power move

Telecommunications giant announces sweeping workforce reduction amid mounting cost pressures

Telecommunications giant announces sweeping workforce reduction amid mounting cost pressures

Telecommunications powerhouse Verizon Communications revealed plans Thursday to eliminate more than 13,000 positions from its workforce, marking one of the largest corporate downsizing efforts in recent memory as American businesses navigate increasingly turbulent economic waters.

Chief Executive Dan Schulman delivered the sobering news to staff members on Nov. 20 through an internal memorandum, citing cost structure limits as the driving force behind the sweeping personnel cuts. The reduction will carve away approximately 20 percent of the company’s non-union management ranks, drawing from a pool of roughly 70,000 employees across the telecommunications behemoth’s operations.

Unlike targeted restructurings that focus on specific divisions or underperforming segments, Verizon’s approach casts a wide net across its entire corporate structure. Company spokesman Kevin Israel emphasized that no particular department or business unit has been singled out for disproportionate cuts, suggesting the reductions reflect a comprehensive reassessment of the company’s operational footprint rather than isolated performance concerns.

The Timeline and Legal Framework

The execution of these layoffs will unfold according to varying state-specific Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act requirements, though federal law mandates employers provide affected workers with no less than 60 calendar days’ advance written notice before implementing mass workforce reductions. This regulatory framework aims to cushion the blow for displaced workers, offering them time to prepare financially and begin exploring alternative employment opportunities.

The staggered implementation means different employees will receive their final paychecks at different times depending on their geographic location, creating an extended period of uncertainty for thousands of Verizon professionals who now find themselves navigating an unexpectedly precarious career landscape.

A Financial Lifeline for the Displaced

Recognizing the profound disruption these cuts will inflict on affected employees and their families, Schulman announced the establishment of a $20 million Reskilling and Career Transition Fund designed to ease the transition for those losing their positions. This financial commitment represents an acknowledgment that simply severing employment relationships fails to address the human cost of corporate restructuring.

The fund will concentrate resources on skill development initiatives, digital training programs and job placement assistance, according to Schulman’s communication. These investments aim to enhance the marketability of displaced workers in an increasingly competitive and technology-driven employment landscape where yesterday’s credentials may no longer guarantee tomorrow’s opportunities.

Verizon Joins a Troubling Trend

The telecommunications company’s announcement positions it squarely within a broader pattern of corporate belt-tightening that has accelerated throughout recent months. Amazon confirmed the elimination of 14,000 corporate positions on Oct. 28, while retail giant Target reportedly prepared to jettison approximately 1,800 corporate employees on Oct. 23.

These high-profile reductions represent merely the most visible examples of a phenomenon rippling through corporate America with increasing intensity. According to analysis from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, employers eliminated more than 150,000 positions throughout October alone, representing the most substantial single-month wave of job cuts witnessed in over two decades.

Economic Headwinds and Corporate Calculations

The convergence of these layoff announcements reflects mounting pressure on corporate profit margins as businesses confront persistent inflation, elevated interest rates and evolving consumer spending patterns. Telecommunications providers like Verizon face additional sector-specific challenges, including massive capital expenditure requirements for 5G network buildouts and intensifying competition for market share in saturated wireless markets.

For affected employees, these macroeconomic explanations offer cold comfort as they confront the immediate reality of lost income, disrupted health insurance coverage and the psychological toll of unexpected unemployment. The scale of these reductions suggests that even professionals in traditionally stable industries and well-established corporations cannot assume their positions remain immune from organizational restructuring.

As November unfolds and holiday season approaches, more than 13,000 Verizon employees face the daunting prospect of job searches during what historically represents one of the slowest hiring periods of the calendar year, adding another layer of difficulty to an already challenging situation.

Adds Substantial Skilled Labor Capacity, Combining Two Leading Workforces

Transaction Expected to be Immediately Accretive to Dycom’s Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Diluted EPS and is also Projected to Improve Free Cash Flow for the Combined Company

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE: DY), a leading provider of specialty contracting services to the telecommunications and digital infrastructure industries throughout the United States, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Power Solutions, LLC (“Power Solutions”), one of the Mid-Atlantic’s largest electrical contractors serving data centers, for a total consideration which values Power Solutions at $1.95 billion. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close before the end of the fiscal year.

Power Solutions specializes in providing electrical infrastructure solutions for data centers and other critical facilities in the Greater Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia area, the world’s largest data center hub. With over 2,800 highly skilled employees, Power Solutions is a leading contractor of choice in the region, with strong customer relationships and a 25-year track record of high-quality execution. Power Solutions’ annual revenue is expected to be approximately $1.0 billion for calendar 2025. The company’s compounded annual revenue growth has been approximately 15% over the past four years, a trajectory that is expected to continue in calendar 2026. Power Solutions has consistently delivered Adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-to-high teens, and this level of profitability is expected to be sustained in calendar 2026. This outlook is supported by a total backlog that currently exceeds $1.0 billion.

“This is a milestone acquisition for Dycom that diversifies our business and significantly enhances our potential to generate long-term growth and value creation,” said Dan Peyovich, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dycom. “Power Solutions is a recognized leader and positions us to benefit from continued strong demand for digital infrastructure solutions among hyperscalers and other industry participants. Our customers will benefit from our expanded capabilities to support data center development by combining Dycom’s expertise in fiber and Power Solutions’ leadership in electrical, two of the most critical elements in digital infrastructure.”

“Dycom and Power Solutions share similar cultures with a focus on safety and quality, raising the bar for our customers, and a commitment to people as our greatest asset. Power Solutions’ skilled workforce, exceptional leadership team and deep relationships with top-tier customers are expected to support durable growth. I am excited to work with the team to realize the opportunities in front of us.”

Compelling Strategic Rationale

Expands Dycom’s Exposure to Rapidly Growing, Mission-Critical Data Center Demand

Deepens exposure to one of the fastest-growing infrastructure sectors, with over 90% of Power Solutions’ revenue coming from data center projects Data center infrastructure is poised for significant growth; while traditional non-gen-AI drivers, like cloud migration, are projected to sustain a 16% CAGR on their own, analysts estimate total U.S. demand for data center capacity could grow at 20% to 25% CAGR through 2030, with gen-AI accounting for the significant acceleration Strategically positioned in the Greater Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia area, which is the world’s largest and fastest-growing data-center region, currently representing 27% of total operational capacity in U.S. markets and forecasted to capture 30% of U.S. data center capacity currently under construction and planned Significantly enhances service offering in and around data centers and campuses

Establishes a Natural Extension Platform for Long-term Growth and Diversification

Adds Power Solutions’ leading electrical contracting capabilities, diversifying Dycom’s business and extending its platform for long-term growth Enables offering of turnkey capabilities at scale with a best-in-class operator

Unlocks Significant Opportunity to Scale Power Solutions’ Operations and Further Expand Existing Relationships with Hyperscalers and Other Technology Companies

Provides opportunity to offer powerful integrated services, enabling significant cross-selling opportunities across digital infrastructure players Provides the ability to extend capabilities into additional, targeted high-growth geographic regions and opportunities over time

Adds Substantial Skilled Labor Capacity, Combining Two Leading Workforces

Provides self-perform electrical contracting capabilities with a highly skilled workforce of over 2,800 employees Extends capacity to execute large and complex projects

Financial Highlights

The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Dycom’s Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, excluding non-cash amortization of intangible assets. It is also projected to improve free cash flow for the combined company.

Transaction Consideration and Financing

The purchase price is $1.95 billion, consisting of approximately $293 million payable in Dycom common stock and the remainder of the consideration payable in cash, subject to customary closing and post-closing adjustments. Dycom plans to fund the cash portion of the transaction with a mix of cash on hand, a committed $1.0 billion senior secured term loan A facility and proceeds from a committed $700 million senior secured 364-day bridge loan facility. Pro forma net leverage is expected to be below 3.0x at closing, and the free cash flow profile of the combined business is anticipated to provide a clear path to de-lever to approximately 2.0x net leverage in the next 12-18 months, maintaining Dycom’s financial flexibility for continued strategic growth.

[TITLE]Big Tech Poised to Win Immunity Shield From State AI Regulation:
[TEXT]
If you want to understand who the U.S. government serves, in all its corrupt and self-serving glory, you need only look at two ongoing fights in the National Defense Authorization Act, a bill setting military policy that’s critical to weapons manufacturers, and therefore is the only thing that passes like clockwork in Congress every year.

On the one side, a bipartisan Senate coalition led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Tim Sheehy (R-MT) managed to add the commonsense notion that the military should be allowed to repair the equipment it buys, building off a mandate instituted by the secretary of the Army. Needing someone to fly in every time a tank or aircraft carrier breaks wastes time and money, and serves as a second bite at the apple for lucrative military contractors. But because Congress is often just a pass-through for corporate America, the contractors’ lobbyists are blitzing Capitol Hill to secure their position as the military’s high-priced mechanics. It would “cripple innovation” to let troops fix their own stuff, apparently.

More from David Dayen

Meanwhile, our tech overlords are desperate to immunize themselves from oversight while they build their new toy on a mountain of dodgy accounting. Their effort to put a moratorium on all state-based artificial intelligence regulation for ten years first appeared in the Big Beautiful Bill; once the public got wind of it, the measure failed 99-1 in the Senate. The AI moratorium has re-emerged in the NDAA, which habitually becomes a catchall for lobbyist-driven bad ideas. Donald Trump himself has demanded AI immunity from state laws. But Senate Democrats are resisting once again, arguing that this emerging technology shouldn’t be placed in a regulatory free-fire zone in the absence of federal policy.

With that avenue blocked off, the Trump administration has now proposed an executive order, which leaked in draft form last night. The EO is designed to use multiple tools of federal coercion to make it impossible for states to regulate AI. But it’s actually much more expansive than that, potentially making it impossible for states to regulate much of anything business-related. While it’s primarily a wet kiss for Big Tech firms and the Wall Street interests financing data center expansion, the malleable definition of “AI” could block states from approaching anything with an algorithm or machine learning, extending Trump deregulation to the entire country and exposing consumers, workers and startups to untold abuses.

The moratorium push also has a political purpose. AI firms are mimicking their brothers in the crypto industry by building a war chest to buy Washington and neutralize any constraints on its conduct. They’ve already captured the White House, and this executive order is the payback. As Trump plummets in the polls and botches gerrymandering, the only thing he may have left in his favor next year is a tower of campaign cash. The executive order represents his chance to secure more.
