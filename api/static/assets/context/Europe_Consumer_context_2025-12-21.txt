[TITLE]Consumer Protection Authority: Despoina Tsangari officially appointed President:
[TEXT]
Newsroom December 19 04:18

Despoina Tsangari becomes the official president of the newly established Independent Consumer Protection Authority, following a proposal by the Minister of Development, Takis Theodorikakos.

According to the Ministry of Development’s announcement, her appointment was approved by majority vote during today’s session of the Standing Special Committee on Institutions and Transparency of the Greek Parliament. Minister Theodorikakos emphasized the importance of quickly and effectively establishing the new body, noting: “In accordance with the law we passed for the creation of the new independent authority, we immediately proceeded, as the transitional provisions required, with the process of selecting the first administrator.” He highlighted that “Ms. Tsangari comes from both society and the market and has full knowledge of how it functions,” calling her “the best possible choice to launch this institution during its initial and most challenging phase.”

Ms. Tsangari stated: “Knowing how the market operates and how companies function, I come as someone who wants to serve the public interest.” She added that “if this Authority is established and operates within the frameworks set by law, it will be highly effective.”

Biography of Despoina Tsangari

Born and raised in Patissia, Athens, Tsangari grew up in a household where her father ran a small furniture shop, giving her early exposure to the realities of the market, the value of hard work, customer respect, and the need for rules that ensure trust.

She completed her secondary education at Ionideios Model School in Piraeus and earned a degree in Computer Engineering and Informatics from the University of Patras. She later pursued postgraduate studies in Information Engineering at City University London, along with an MBA from EEDE in Athens.

Her professional career spans over 30 years and is self-made, beginning in 1995 at Procter & Gamble, where she held senior and executive roles both in Greece and across Europe, gaining strong foundations in multinational operations, data-driven decision-making, and complex organizational management.

Tsangari later served as President and CEO in major organizations in Greece and abroad, including Beiersdorf (Greece, Cyprus, Israel), Safilo in Italy, PepsiCo (Greece and Cyprus), and most recently NIKAS.

In all these positions, she operated in highly competitive and regulated sectors such as food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and consumer goods. She is fluent in English, proficient in French, and professionally competent in Italian, allowing her to manage international organizations, collaborate with European institutions, and participate in cross-border decision-making.

Throughout her career, she has overseen general management, financial supervision, budget and internal control management, and the implementation of organizational and strategic transformations. Her extensive market experience has given her deep insight into both healthy competition and practices that could harm consumers. She has also consistently worked with regulatory authorities and institutional bodies nationally and at the EU level, including serving on the boards of SEVT (Greek Food Industries Association) and SEV (Hellenic Federation of Enterprises).

Married with a 15-year-old son, Tsangari is distinguished by her integrity, sense of responsibility, sensitivity to people and consumers, empathy, commitment to public interest, and ability to manage institutions with operational discipline and measurable outcomes.

In her new role, she pledges to strengthen market supervision mechanisms, uphold professional integrity, maintain institutional independence, protect consumer rights, and enhance the authority’s functions. Her goal is to create a framework where businesses operate with fair competition, quality, and transparency, and where citizens feel genuinely protected through modern management practices, evidence-based decisions, and transparent control mechanisms.

4 common scams to watch out for this holiday season

Moor Studio/Getty Images

It's easy to lose our critical thinking skills around the holidays. In a frenzy of last-minute gift shopping and travel bookings, we can be more anxious, more distracted and more vulnerable.

Life Kit Watch out for these holiday scams Watch out for these holiday scams Listen · 20:04 20:04

"There's a lot of hustle and bustle during the holiday season, so there's a lot more opportunities for scammers to steal from us," says Amy Nofziger, senior director of Fraud Victim Support at the AARP Fraud Watch Network, a fraud prevention service.

In a recent AARP survey of nearly 2,000 U.S. adults, nearly 9 out of 10 reported being targeted by or falling for some type of scam during the holiday season in the past year. Common schemes included fake shipping notifications, stolen packages and fake charity and donation requests.

Sponsor Message

Being aware of the tactics that scammers use this time of year can safeguard you from falling victim to fraud, Nofziger says. She shares four types of scams her team has seen this season.

Fake retail ads on social media

Scammers open stores on social media platforms for a limited period of time. They sell fake branded clothing or jewelry and use stolen logos or similar domain names to appear authentic. The store might disappear shortly after you've placed your order.

How to protect yourself: "If you're using a vendor that you haven't normally used, take the name of the vendor, put it in a new search, type the words 'scam,' 'fraud' and 'complaint' after it, and use other shoppers' experiences with the company to guide your own," Nofziger says.

She recommends always using a credit card to pay for online goods. "You have greater consumer protections," she says, meaning, in the event you fall for a scam, you can have an easier time getting your money back.

Fake gift cards

If you're looking to buy a gift card for someone, know that it is possible for scammers to get the gift card number and PIN before you buy it.

"They actually remove stacks of gift cards off of the card carousels, log every gift card number and PIN into their system, then load those gift cards back onto the carousels," says Nofziger.

If you add money onto one of these cards, scammers are notified and able to instantly withdraw it. "You could not even have left the store yet and that money could be drained," she says.

How to protect yourself: Nofziger recommends buying gift cards that are close to the front of the store and might have had more eyes watching them. She also suggests purchasing electronic gift cards instead of physical cards that can be tampered with.

Fake delivery texts

It's more common to receive unexpected packages around the holidays, and scammers will use that to their advantage, says Nofziger.

Sponsor Message

"They'll send out fake notifications saying that they're from a shipping company and that there's a problem with your account," like a missing piece of your address, she says. "But most of the time, if there's a problem with a package, you will hear directly from the vendor."

How to protect yourself: If you receive an unexpected text message from a shipping company like UPS or FedEx asking for your personal information, Nofziger's advice is to reach out separately to the company's customer service line and confirm that a package is indeed coming your way. You can also verify your address directly through their website.

Usually, "this is nothing but a phishing scam," she says, or an attempt to dupe you into sharing personal information.

Travel deals too good to be true

Travel prices can get expensive around the holidays, leading some to search online for better deals. But Nofziger says to be wary of suspiciously cheap fares and travel websites you haven't used before.

Nofziger's team receives a lot of reports

[TITLE]Inside Colgate’s Enterprise-Wide AI Push:
[TEXT]
Colgate-Palmolive is pushing enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) beyond chatbots, moving into agentic systems, internal platforms and AI-driven product and materials innovation.

The shift reflects how one of the world’s largest consumer packaged goods companies is building internal platforms that let employees deploy AI assistants while applying generative models to research and development.

Rather than centralizing AI in a single innovation lab, Colgate has built an internal operating model to let employees identify problems, build assistants and deploy solutions at scale. At the same time, the company is using generative AI to accelerate biomaterials development and sensory design.

From Productivity Tools to an Internal AI Platform

Early AI adoption at Colgate focused on productivity, including copilots for writing, analytics and workflow automation. That phase quickly evolved into something more structural with the launch of the Colgate AI Hub, an internal platform that allows employees to build, test and deploy their own AI assistants tailored to specific business pain points.

Rather than pushing a single enterprise-wide chatbot, the AI Hub functions as a governed development environment. Teams can create AI assistants for specific use cases, such as analyzing sales performance, generating regulatory documentation or summarizing research insights, while operating within centralized security and data controls. The model shifts AI development closer to business users without sacrificing oversight.

This bottom-up approach is designed to solve a common scaling problem in enterprise AI adoption. MIT Sloan Management Review has described Colgate’s approach as a pivot from using generative AI primarily for efficiency toward using it as an engine for innovation, noting that the focus is increasingly on how AI reshapes product development and long-term growth rather than short-term cost savings.

Agentic AI in Operations and the Supply Chain

Beyond individual assistants, Colgate is also deploying agentic systems that can operate across workflows, particularly in supply chain and operations. These systems monitor demand signals, inventory levels and logistics constraints, surfacing recommendations and coordinating responses across planning and execution teams.

Forbes has reported that Colgate’s supply chain AI strategy emphasizes decision intelligence over full autonomy. AI agents simulate scenarios, flag risks and recommend actions, but humans remain accountable for final decisions. The focus is on resilience and speed rather than replacing operators outright.

The same philosophy carries into manufacturing and quality control, where AI systems analyze sensor data, identify anomalies and support preventive maintenance. As these agents become more integrated, Colgate is building an AI layer that spans operations, linking data, decisions and execution in near real time, essentially a dual-track approach.

AI-Driven Materials, Biomaterials and Sensory Innovation

The most strategic use of AI at Colgate is unfolding in R&D and product innovation. The company is applying generative models to oral care research, biomaterials development and sensory design, moving AI upstream into the innovation funnel.

According to the European Federation of Periodontology, Kli Pappas, the senior director of predictive analytics and head of AI for Colgate-Palmolive mentions that the company uses machine-learning models to analyze global search engine data to identify what consumers are actually asking

European Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide a $105 billion, interest-free loan to Ukraine over the next two years to support its war effort against Russia. However, the landmark pledge stopped short of allocating billions of dollars’ worth of frozen Russian assets to Kyiv, concluding (at least, for now) a major flash point that has divided the 27-nation bloc.

[TITLE]Tata Chemicals To Buy Novabay For Rs 260 Crore; Tap Non-Cyclical Products:
[TEXT]
Novabay, a wholly-owned subsidiary of France-based Novacarb, is primarily engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of premium grade sodium bicarbonate serving pharma, food, personal care in Europe, Americas, Oceania, ASIA, Middle East and ASEAN markets. The company was incorporated in November 2015.

The total turnover in calendar year 2024 was 29.49 million Singapore dollar.

The company holds key cGMP, API, and related certifications, supported by a fully automated facility. Its current capacity is approximately 60,000 tons with a potential to expand to 100,000 tons..

"Novabay’s focus on premium-grade sodium bicarbonate aligns seamlessly with TCL’s strategy to expand its presence in high-value, non-cyclical product segments. This acquisition strengthens TCL’s capabilities in specialty bicarb market and enhances our ability to serve premium customer requirements," said Tata Chemicals Managing Director and CEO Ramakrishnan Mukundan.

The premium-grade sodium bicarbonate market benefits from steady demand in healthcare, personal care, and food sectors. Rising haemodialysis needs, improved access to medical care, and growing consumption in emerging markets drive this demand, according to the company.

[TITLE]CARBIOS maintains its commitment to build the Longlaville plant and adjusts its timeline:
[TEXT]
CARBIOS reaffirms its ambition to pursue the Longlaville plant construction project and postpones the timeline by three-month.

The plant construction project is supported by: Pre-commercialization contracts covering close to 50% of the production capacity of the future industrial site in Longlaville. Significant progress in structuring the additional financing required to restart the project. Secured public funding of €42.5 million.

A small portion1 of the financing still needs to be secured before the project can move forward. CARBIOS aims to achieve this by the end of the first quarter of 2026.

With over €55 million in projected available cash at the end of 2025 2 , CARBIOS has visibility on its financing horizon beyond the next twelve months while maintaining its strategic capabilities and a rigorous control over expenses.

, CARBIOS has visibility on its financing horizon beyond the next twelve months while maintaining its strategic capabilities and a rigorous control over expenses. CARBIOS remains fully committed to the commercialization of licenses for its technology, and following the successful contract with Wankai, ambitions to sign other licenses in Europe, North America and South America.

Clermont-Ferrand (France), 18 December 2025 (6:30 p.m. CET). CARBIOS (Euronext Growth Paris: ALCRB) reaffirms its ambition to pursue the Longlaville plant construction project, by rescheduling the timeline with a three-month adjustment.

In 2025, CARBIOS signed pre-commercialization contracts covering close to 50% of the production capacity of the future industrial site in Longlaville and is working to secure commitments to reach 70% in the near term. These multiple commercial agreements concluded in the cosmetics, beverage, and tire textile filament industries, confirm the strong market traction for biorecycled PET produced using the technology designed and developed by CARBIOS.

The pre-commercialization progress has been instrumental in driving forward the structuring of the financing needed to resume construction project of this first PET biorecycling plant in France and to cover the main portion required to finance the plant project3. It is expected that the plant will be financially independent from CARBIOS (non-recourse financing on CARBIOS.)

The financing of this industrial project is based on private financing (debt and equity) and on confirmed public aid amounting to 42.5 million euros.

A small portion1 of the financing still needs to be secured before the project can move forward. CARBIOS aims to achieve this by the end of the first quarter of 2026. If this is the case, the plant should be commissioned during the first half of 2028.

CARBIOS remains fully committed to commercializing licenses for its technology, with an initial strategic partnership agreement signed on 2 December 2025 with Wankai New Materials to deploy its PET biorecycling technology in Asia4. In addition, the Company aims to commercialize new licenses in Europe, as well as in North and South America.

[TITLE]Unicorns Gallop Back on the Beauty M&A Scene in 2025:
[TEXT]
Beauty M&A activity picked up strongly in 2025, as did valuations that gained unicorn status again despite strong headwinds and market apprehension following an extremely quiet 2024.

U.S. tariffs, a weak dollar and geopolitical unrest were among the hurdles faced, but the pace of deals accelerated nonetheless. The run wound down 2025 with the biggest bang of them all: L’Oréal’s 4 billion euro deal for the Kering Beauty business, which was announced on Oct. 19 and is an industry game changer.

“The beginning of the year started with a lot of anticipation for activity, and then in some ways, it was pulled back a bit because of the tariffs and the macroeconomic headwinds,” said Marissa Lepor, managing director and head of beauty and personal care at The Sage Group.

“But the second half was pretty active from an M&A perspective, especially as there was a bit of a shakeout between the teams that could navigate the tariffs, still connect with customers and really had the margin to play around with,” she continued. “Ultimately, the macroeconomic shifts were kind of a test of brand and team, and the ones that were able to navigate it really shined even more.”

L’Oréal led the M&A charge, but many a strategic as well as other investors were acquisitive, homing in on all categories and driving up valuations to $1 billion.

The French beauty giant made a host of transactions across all segments. But the Kering deal was a game changer.

“This L’Oréal deal has completely changed the power play,” Nnenna Onuba, founder of 100 Allies and an M&A strategist, formerly of Rothschilds, told WWD Beauty Inc in early November. She voiced the sentiment of many.

“There is going to be downward pressure on all of the sector,” Onuba continued. “It’s going to flow to retailers, investors, founders — everyone’s going to feel the weight of this.”

The 4 billion euro strategic partnership between L’Oréal and Kering extends from prestige and niche fragrance, making L’Oréal the clear leader in the category, especially with the acquisition of The House of Creed, into luxury beauty and wellness.

Still, there was an acquisition involving the sector that dwarfed L’Oreal’s purchase of Kering Beauty. Kimberly-Clark Corp. revealed in November that it will acquire Kenvue Inc., owner of brands including Neutrogena, Aveeno, OGX and Tylenol, in a deal valued at $48.7 billion. That transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals and was devised to create a major global health and wellness leader.

As for L’Oréal’s other acquisitions, it revealed in early December that the group would double its stake in Galderma, the pure-play dermatology leader that’s among the largest in injectables, to 20 percent, highlighting the beauty giant’s increasing focus on the burgeoning aesthetics market. Financial terms of the deal transaction were not disclosed, but the 10 percent stake is valued at

While shopping malls across the US and Europe grapple with declining footfalls, oversupply and widespread store closures, India is emerging as a rare global bright spot for retail real estate.According to ANAROCK Research & Advisory, India’s retail sector is poised to attract over USD 3.5 billion in capital inflows over the next three years, driven by strong consumption growth, an acute shortage of quality mall space, and rising interest from global brands and institutional investors.The contrast with Western markets could not be sharper. Since 2020, the US has recorded a net closure of nearly 1,200 mall stores, even as new store openings rose sharply over the past two years.Vacancies have surged, forcing nearly 40% of empty malls to be rezoned or repurposed, highlighting what many analysts describe as an existential crisis for traditional malls in mature economies.India, meanwhile, is witnessing a retail resurgence.“Latest ANAROCK data shows that in the next three years, Indian malls are set to see over USD 3.5 billion of capital inflows,” says Anuj Kejriwal, CEO – Retail Leasing and Industrial & Logistics, ANAROCK Group. “Over 88 foreign brands have entered the Indian retail market between 2021 and the first nine months of 2025, and several more are actively scouting for space in the severely constrained Grade-A mall segment.”India’s appeal lies in a powerful combination of a young consumer base, rising disposable incomes and favourable FDI policies—factors that global brands increasingly struggle to find in saturated Western markets.One of the strongest drivers of investor confidence is India’s extreme undersupply of organised, Grade-A retail space. ANAROCK data shows that India’s per capita retail stock remains among the lowest globally. Tier-1 cities offer just 4–6 sq. ft. per person, while Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities have only 2–3 sq. ft. per capita. Grade-A mall space alone stands at a mere 0.6 sq. ft. per capita.By comparison, the US averages close to 23 sq. ft. per capita, while China exceeds 6 sq. ft.“This gap, combined with India’s per-capita income nearly doubling over the last decade, has created a demand–supply mismatch virtually unheard of in global retail,” Kejriwal notes. According to ANAROCK, most Grade-A malls in India are operating at 95–100% occupancy, often with long waitlists for prime zones. Leasing cycles are now outpacing construction cycles—a phenomenon rarely seen in global retail markets.India’s retail story is also being reshaped by changing consumer behaviour. The country is on track to become a USD 6 trillion consumption economy by 2030, powered by urbanisation, income growth and a demographic dividend.Unlike many Western malls, Indian shopping centres have evolved into lifestyle destinations. Entertainment and food & beverage now account for 30–35% of footfalls, helping malls remain resilient even as e-commerce grows. According to ANAROCK, leading malls record weekday footfalls of over 20,000, rising beyond 40,000 on weekends, underlining the sector’s robust demand dynamics.Although India has more than 600 operational malls, fewer than 100 meet institutional investment benchmarks, making quality assets fiercely competitive. This scarcity has sharpened global investor appetite.“With a portfolio of 19 malls housing over 1,000 brands and generating around ₹1,600 crore in annual NOI, the Nexus Select Trust REIT listing in 2023 established retail as a transparent, scalable and professionally managed asset class in India,” says Kejriwal. ANAROCK expects at least two more retail REITs to debut in the Indian market by 2030, further deepening institutional participation.Contrary to global fears, e-commerce has not weakened Indian malls. With online penetration still around 8%, far below the 20%-plus levels in the US and China, physical retail continues to play a central role. Brands are increasingly adopting a “phygital” approach, using offline stores for experience and trust-building while scaling digitally.Many direct-to-consumer brands report offline conversion rates that are two to three times higher than online, reinforcing the relevance of physical retail in India’s digital economy.From an investment perspective, Indian Grade-A malls typically deliver 14–18% internal rates of return, nearly double the yields available in many Western markets, according to ANAROCK. Stable rental escalations, revenue-sharing models linked to consumption growth, and consistently low vacancies provide investors with both yield visibility and long-term upside.“In the US and Europe, malls are battling oversupply, declining footfalls and online cannibalisation,” Kejriwal sums up. “India, in contrast, offers limited quality supply, rising incomes, heavy footfalls and rapid brand expansion.”ANAROCK data shows that retail leasing in India surged nearly 70% year-on-year in the first half of 2025, while new mall supply expanded by over 160%, reinforcing India’s position as one of the world’s most compelling retail real estate markets.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
