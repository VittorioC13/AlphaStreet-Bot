[TEXT]
Lyten announces it has completed the acquisition of Northvolt Dwa in Gdańsk, Poland, the largest Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) manufacturing facility in Europe.

Lyten is immediately restarting production and product development from Northvolt Dwa and targets sales before year end.

Lyten is on track to complete the acquisition of the remaining Northvolt assets in Sweden and German in the 4Q 2025.

SAN JOSE, Calif. & GDAŃSK, Poland — Lyten, the global leader in lithium-sulfur batteries and energy storage, announced this week that it has completed its acquisition of Northvolt Dwa in Gdańsk, Poland. Northvolt Dwa is a 25,000-square meter (270,000-square foot) battery energy storage system (BESS) manufacturing and R&D facility that was opened in 2023. The facility includes equipment to ramp up to 6 GWh of energy storage manufacturing capacity and the ability to expand to up to 12 GWh in the future.

The Northvolt Dwa acquisition accelerates Lyten’s entry in the rapidly growing BESS market. The Gdańsk location will serve as a major EU hub for Lyten’s BESS manufacturing and will export products to countries throughout the EU and across the world. Lyten intends to initiate the restart process immediately and to produce first commercial units off the line prior to year-end 2025.

“The Northvolt Dwa facility in Gdańsk is a world-class asset servicing the rapidly growing and strategically important BESS market. As demand for electricity continues its rise throughout the world to support AI and economic development, distributed energy storage will become increasingly critical,” said Dan Cook, Lyten CEO and Co-Founder. “We are seeing demand from across the world and are restarting production immediately to begin fulfilling orders before the end of the year.”

Lyten acquired Northvolt’s BESS product portfolio and intellectual property in the third quarter 2025. The first product to be produced at Northvolt Dwa is the Voltpack Mobile System (VMS). The 3rd generation family of modular BESS products is optimized for the rapidly growing commercial, industrial, and evolving data center markets.

Robert Chryc-Gawrychowski was recently announced as CEO of Lyten Poland and will lead operations at Northvolt Dwa. Robert was previously CEO of Northvolt Poland and led Northvolt’s efforts in Poland through the planning, construction, and startup of Northvolt Dwa.

Robert stated, “BESS is now a critical technology for energy security and economic development, and it is increasingly important that Europe is able to manufacture batteries locally. We are appreciative of the support of this acquisition by the Polish government at the city, provincial and national level and for their shared enthusiasm for Gdańsk as an important BESS hub for Europe.”

Andrzej Domański, Poland Minister of Finance and Economy, stated, “Lyten’s operations in Gdańsk are part of a broader process of developing advanced energy technologies in Poland and across Europe. International cooperation in this field supports knowledge transfer, innovation, and the growth of local industrial expertise. We support projects that contribute to building a sustainable and competitive economy.”

Aleksandra Dulkiewicz, President of Gdańsk, added, “For Gdańsk, Lyten’s activities represent an opportunity to collaborate on the creation of energy innovation centers. We see many opportunities for cooperation – from research and development partnerships with universities, through pilot projects, to other activities aligned with Gdańsk’s development strategy and national and regional economic specializations.

On August 7th, Lyten announced binding agreements to acquire all remaining Northvolt operations in Sweden, Poland, and Germany, with manufacturing assets totaling approximately $5 billion in book value. Close of the remaining Sweden and Germany acquisitions are expected to continue through the 4Q 2025.

[TITLE]Capital One and Discover Synergies Power Growth:
[TEXT]
Capital One’s third quarter earnings results showed improving card performance, growth in purchase volumes on those cards, and synergies from the Discover acquisition that closed earlier in the year.

Company materials noted double-digit growth year over year, given the impact of the Discover business. But even stripping out Discover, organic trends remained intact.

During his remarks to analysts, CFO Andrew Young said that in the domestic card segment, the company released $53 million of allowances, as the combined company noted “credit favorability in both losses and recoveries as well as a slight improvement in the forecasted unemployment rate.” The domestic card coverage ratio now stands at 7.28%, down from previous quarters.

And in his own comments on the call, CEO Richard Fairbank said that “the Discover acquisition was the dominant driver of third quarter domestic card results, including the impacts of a full quarter of combined operations, a combined quarter end balance sheet, and purchase accounting effects. Looking through the Discover impact, the combined domestic card business delivered another quarter of top line growth, strong margins and improving credit.” Excluding the impact of the Discover acquisition, Fairbank said, card-related purchase volumes were up 6.5%, and card loans were up 3.5%.

“While competitive intensity remains high, we continue to see good traction across our legacy card business, including strong growth with heavy spenders at the top of the market,” he said.

“The legacy Discover card loans continued to contract slightly and will likely continue to face a growth headwind due to Discover’s prior credit policy cutbacks and some trimming around the edges that we will implement going forward.”

Improving Credit Quality

The third quarter domestic card charge-off rate was 4.63%, down 62 basis points from the prior quarter and 98 basis points from a year ago.

“Our charge off rate has been improving on a seasonally adjusted basis throughout 2025,” said Fairbank.

[TITLE]Meta partners with Blue Owl Capital on $27 billion AI data center project:
[TEXT]
Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta Platforms Inc., during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025.

Meta said Tuesday that it formed a joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital in a deal worth $27 billion to fund and develop the social media company's massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana.

As part of the deal, the asset management firm will own 80% of the joint venture, while Meta will retain a 20% stake and oversee the construction and property management services of the data center, which is being built in Richland Parish, Louisiana. Blue Owl contributed about $7 billion in cash as part of the joint venture, while Meta received a one-time payout of $3 billion.

The partnership provides the "the speed and flexibility" Meta needs to build the data center and support its "long-term AI ambitions," the social media company said in a statement.

Meta in December announced that it chose Louisiana to host what would be its largest data center. Construction of that facility, which is being built on a site the size of roughly 1,700 football fields, is expected to finish by 2030.

Local utility Entergy told CNBC in June that the new data center could consume about twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day.

Meta has been spending heavily on artificial intelligence amid a broader race with other tech giants like Alphabet and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which are also developing gigantic data centers to power future AI models.

OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank in January formed the Stargate joint venture that will see the companies invest $500 billion to develop data centers over the coming years. The first Stargate data center site came online in September 180 miles west of Dallas in Abilene, Texas.

Last week, Google said that it would invest $15 billion on a data center project in southern India that will be the search giant's largest AI hub in the world outside of the U.S.

WATCH: A rotation out of the US is a bet against the AI trade.

[TITLE]Truist Bank Supplies $100M Refi for IOS Portfolio:
[TEXT]
A joint venture between Triten Real Estate Partners and TPG Angelo Gordon has sealed a $100 million loan to refinance a portfolio of industrial outdoor storage properties, Commercial Observer has learned.

Truist Bank provided the loan backing the sponsorship’s 19-asset IOS portfolio spread across Texas, Missouri, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and California.

Cooper Horowitz negotiated the financing with a team led by Justin Horowitz.

Triten principal Zach Dobin said the portfolio — which includes assets in the markets of San Antonio, Dallas, Miami, Kansas City and Baltimore — are well positioned in a supply-constrained sector that faces many zoning hurdles. Dobin noted that IOS has proven resilient in the last three years as transportation users have encountered market headwinds by attracting more construction and infrastructure tenants.

[TITLE]FinDev Canada commits USD 100 million to Africa Finance Corporation to expand sustainable infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa:
[TEXT]
MONTREAL, Oct. 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Canada's bilateral Development Finance Institution, FinDev Canada announces a USD 100 million loan to Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), a leading infrastructure solutions provider in Africa, to support sustainable infrastructure projects in Sub-Saharan Africa.

FinDev Canada's facility will enable AFC to support a pipeline of climate finance projects, such as a solar PV and wind power development in Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the facility will support the development of low-carbon, railway infrastructure for an inter-urban metro transportation project in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This will improve public transport, reduce emissions, and support economic growth due to the substantial flow of goods and people into the city.

Africa's rapid population growth, while representing a unique opportunity to harness a demographic dividend and expand a vibrant consumer and labor market, is generating critical infrastructure requirements to support sustainable economic development. This potential remains under-leveraged due to persistent gaps in access to energy, water, and digital infrastructure. In Sub-Sahara Africa, approximately 565 million people lack access to electricity, significantly impacting the region's ability to meet its Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, private sector investments are instrumental in addressing these barriers.

The loan proceeds will be entirely directed to helping AFC expand its long-term funding capacity, thereby enabling sustainable solutions that address climate change, infrastructure challenges, and strengthen energy access.

"This transaction represents an opportunity for FinDev Canada to support a leading solutions provider financing critical infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa and an important step towards expanding our market presence in the region. We are proud to invest in an institution which aligns with our impact development goals, particularly market development and climate and nature action," said Paulo Martelli, VP and Chief Investment Officer, FinDev Canada.

"We are delighted to partner with FinDev Canada on this milestone transaction. This partnership reflects our shared commitment to accelerating sustainable development across the continent through high-impact, climate-resilient infrastructure. The transaction not only diversifies AFC's funding base but also deepens North America's participation in Africa's growth story. We look forward to building on this relationship to catalyse even greater investment flows into Africa's infrastructure sector," said Banji Fehintola, Executive Board Member & Head, Financial Services, Africa Finance Corporation.

[TITLE]Analysis Warns of 'Disastrous Consequences' From $72 Billion Railway Megamerger:
[TEXT]
A merger between two of America's biggest railroad companies could have "disastrous consequences" for workers and consumers, according to a report out Monday.

In late July, labor unions raised alarm as Union Pacific Railroad announced a $72 billion deal to acquire Norfolk Southern Railway, which, if approved by the US Surface Transportation Board (STB), would make the new entity the largest railroad company in American history, controlling over 50,000 total miles of interstate rail.

The American Economic Liberties Project (AELP), an anti-monopoly think tank, provided more evidence for those concerns with its new analysis.

"A combined Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern will have disastrous consequences: less safe workers and communities, less competition, higher costs, and service disruptions," said one of the report's authors, AELP senior fellow Erik Peinert. "For good reason, there has never been an attempt at a consolidated transcontinental railroad system until now—a scale of railroad consolidation not even met by the railroad barons of the Gilded Age."

As the report explains, America's interstate rail system is dominated by four companies that operate as a pair of "regional duopolies." Norfolk Southern lines stretch across the Eastern US, along with those owned by CSX, while areas west of the Mississippi River are covered by Union Pacific and BNSF.

This already heavily consolidated system is the product of Congress' deregulation of railroads during the 1980s and 1990s, most notably through the replacement in 1995 of the more powerful Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) with the STB, which has more limited authority to regulate mergers.

"Even by the very lax merger standards of the late 1990s and early 2000s, these combinations were recognized as mistakes with devastating outcomes," the report says. "Shippers reported a deterioration in service, fewer options with higher prices, and the loss of jobs, while workers lost jobs and those who didn't face strenuous working conditions."

Though STB's rules tightened in 2001, requiring mergers to "enhance" competition instead of simply not harming it, the damage was already done. Over the next two decades, the report noted that the top four major railroads came to haul 7% fewer loads while hiking freight rates twice as fast as inflation. This was due in large part to the fact that 50% of customers were now "captive," that is, they had access to only one rail line, compared to just 27% two decades prior.

Another megamerger, the report warns, would cause a "likely permanent loss of competitive rail services for shippers" in large sections of the country, specifically the Midwest, where Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern have overlapping lines.

The deal has been opposed by a consortium of shipping associations, including the Freight Rail Customer Alliance, the American Chemistry Council, and the National Industrial Transport League (NITL), which warned that it would slow down service and lead to price hikes.

Labor unions—including the Teamsters, the Transport Workers Union of America, and the Railroad Workers United—have also opposed the merger, citing the companies' histories of cutting costs by laying off employees and flouting safety standards.

"Historically, rail consolidation results in job loss, diminishing labor power in negotiating better working conditions and pay, resulting in staffing shortages that lead to burnout and increased safety risks for workers and the public," the report says. "And in general, consolidation results in stagnant and reduced wages for workers, as there are fewer buyers for labor and greater leverage for the consolidated companies."

There is also a risk that if the STB approves the merger, it could embolden the other half of the duopoly, CSX and BNSF, to merge as well, creating a national duopoly where "choice and competition would be lost."

In part due to the STB's more stringent rules, no interstate railroads have attempted to merge in the 21st century. However, the Trump administration seemed to give Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern a green light when—just as proceedings for the merger were beginning in late August—President Donald Trump fired Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the STB who had been an outspoken critic of railroad consolidation, which broke a 2-2 tie on the board between Democrats and Republicans.

At the beginning of October, Primus sued the Trump administration, which had not explained his firing other than that he "did not align with the president's America First agenda." After meeting with the CEO of Union Pacific in September, Trump said that the merger "sounds good."

"Our country's supply chain demands that the board be independent and transparent. Congress mandated it 138 years ago," Primus said upon filing the lawsuit. "Failure to do so will negatively affect the network: railroads, shippers, and rail labor alike, disrupting the supply chain and ultimately injecting instability into our nation's economy. This is dangerous, and wrong, and cannot be allowed to happen."

Railroad Workers United said that Primus "was removed not for inefficiency or malfeasance, but for daring to stand for fair competition and consumer interests, a principle too radical for the 'America First' cabal."

Ashley Nowicki, the report's other author and a policy analyst at the AELP, said that the firing of Primus, "who questioned rail consolidation and the railroad's substantial lobbying efforts, raises serious concerns about political interference."

"The last 40 years of railroad consolidation clearly demonstrate how this merger could threaten public safety and harm shippers, workers, consumers, and the broader economy," she continued. "The Surface Transportation Board must show it can operate independently and protect the public interest over Wall Street."

[TITLE]European aerospace groups reach framework deal on satellite merger, sources say:
[TEXT]
ROME/PARIS :European aerospace groups Leonardo, Airbus and Thales have reached a framework deal on a proposed merger of their satellite businesses, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Leonardo is scheduled to hold an extraordinary board meeting on Tuesday to discuss details of the deal, which is subject to board and regulatory approvals, one of the sources said.

Leonardo, Thales and Airbus declined to comment.

PROPOSED VENTURE AIMS TO COMPETE WITH ELON MUSK

Europe's largest satellite makers have been in talks for more than a year to create a new satellite manufacturing company to compete on a larger scale with rivals led by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which owns the highly successful Starlink service.

Reuters reported last month that the three groups had redoubled efforts to combine their satellite businesses into a roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.66 billion) joint venture modelled on the pan-European MBDA missiles business.

Code-named "Project Bromo," talks had hit a roadblock over the summer when the parties could not agree on governance and valuation, insiders said.

One of the sources said the talks, which involve dividing politically sensitive technology and jobs between France and Italy, had not been helped by the government crisis in Paris.

Problems have also included disputes over the politically sensitive share of work, according to French daily La Tribune.

ANTI-TRUST REVIEW

The key remaining hurdle, analysts say, will be getting past a competition review by the European Commission.

Previous attempts to merge satellite activities in the past decade foundered on anti-trust concerns and national rivalries.

But the dramatic rise of Musk's Starlink network and a shift in the market towards cheaper satellites have increased pressure on Europe to combine assets or be pushed out of the market.

The deal could take up to two years to implement and the initial umbrella deal is the first step, sources familiar with the matter said. Last week, Thales denied a report that a sought-after provisional deal had been reached at that time.

Europe's top satellite makers have long competed to build complex spacecraft in geostationary orbit but have been hit by the arrival of cheap tiny satellites in low Earth orbit.

The deal will combine loss-making satellite activities of Airbus with those of Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio - two ventures currently controlled by France's Thales and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.

Paris-based consultancy Novaspace says more than 43,000 satellites will launch over the next decade, representing a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services.
