- **Leverage Analysis:** Celgene maintains a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 0.6x, providing financial flexibility for the transaction
- **Asset Operating Efficiency:** Celgene's working capital management shows strong cash conversion with inventory turnover of 12x and receivables turnover of 8x
- **Valuation Context:** The 18.5x EV/EBITDA multiple represents a premium to Celgene's historical trading range but is justified by the strategic value of the oncology portfolio and potential pipeline synergies

**Profitability Metrics:**

| Metric | 2017 | 2018 | 2019E | YoY Growth |
|--------|------|------|-------|------------|
| EBITDA | $6.2B | $7.1B | $7.8B | +10% |
