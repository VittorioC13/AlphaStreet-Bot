[TITLE]Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission blocks 3.2 GW coal power plan, citing clean energy push:
[TEXT]
The power regulator of Rajasthan, India’s largest solar power producer, has refused permission for a proposed 3,200-megawatt coal power project, saying it conflicts with clean energy goals and lacks justification under demand forecasts, a filing showed.

The Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission said in an order published on Thursday it had dismissed a petition by state-run Rajasthan Urja Vikas and IT Services Ltd seeking approval to procure coal power for 25 years through bidding.

The utility argued the new capacity was needed to meet rising round-the-clock demand.

However, the regulator said the proposal was inconsistent with the Central Electricity Authority’s latest Resource Adequacy Plan.

The Resource Adequacy Plan estimates Rajasthan will require only 1,905 MW of additional coal capacity by 2035-36, far less than the 3,200 MW sought.

The decision comes even as other Indian states are accelerating their coal power purchases, citing strong power demand and the need for round-the-clock, base-load power.

The Rajasthan power regulator also noted upcoming nuclear projects, large-scale solar additions and battery storage plans would ease supply gaps for the state.

Long-term coal contracts could lock in costly power and undermine renewable integration, the commission said in its order.

The commission warned that locking in coal for 25 years could burden consumers with high tariffs and worsen air quality, as the proposed plant would burn about 40,000 tonnes of coal daily, releasing hundreds of tonnes of particulate matter.

It also flagged renewable energy curtailment as a persistent issue and advised the state to maximize the use of its solar and wind resources before adding new coal capacity.

[TITLE]Heed electricity, gas safety during floods, Energy Commission cautions:
[TEXT]
PUTRAJAYA: The Energy Commission has reminded the public to remain vigilant and prioritise electricity and gas safety during the current flood season.

In a statement Monday (Nov 24), the commission said floods pose various risks, including fallen electricity poles, broken power lines, and damage to electrical and gas equipment. It also outlined several safety measures to be taken before, during and after a flood.

“If instructed to evacuate, place electrical appliances in a high and safe location to prevent them from being submerged. Switch off the main power supply at the electrical distribution board, as well as any installations connected separately from the main switch, such as solar PV systems, electric fences or electric vehicle chargers. Also, close the valves of gas cylinders or piped gas," it said.

The commission further advised the public to avoid areas with submerged electrical lines or installations, such as substations and switch rooms, and to refrain from touching poles or any structures that carry electricity.

It also reminded the public not to move fallen electricity poles or severed power lines, but instead to report them immediately to the electricity utility provider.

To ensure the safe use of electricity and gas after a flood, the main switch on the electrical distribution board and gas line valves must be turned off before any cleaning work begins.

"Before switching the main supply back on, ensure that all electrical equipment is in good condition and completely dry. Always remain cautious when carrying out post-flood cleaning activities near electrical lines, installation structures or piped gas systems.

"Avoid using any electrical or gas equipment if its safety is uncertain. If you are still in doubt, seek the assistance of an electrical or gas contractor registered with the Energy Commission," the statement said.

The public is also reminded to keep important emergency numbers, including the police, the fire and rescue department, the hospital and utility service providers, easily accessible at all times.

[TITLE]NDP calls for ownership and regulatory review of Nova Scotia Power:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

NDP Leader Claudia Chender is calling on the premier — who recently appointed himself energy minister — to launch an ownership and regulatory review of Nova Scotia Power.

Claudia Chender made the request in a letter to Premier Tim Houston on Monday.

“We have a utility that is not performing in any of the ways we measure performance,” she said in an interview.

“And now we have a premier who has appointed himself the energy minister and has promptly taken himself on the road. What we need is an energy minister who’s going to prioritize power affordability for Nova Scotians.”

Looking at options

Houston has recently made trips to Alberta, the United States and Europe, all to promote energy generation opportunities in the province, including onshore and offshore wind and natural gas, as a means of spurring economic development.

But Chender said those promotional efforts are happening at the same time as Nova Scotia Power customers are seeing their bills increase and the utility continues to deal with the fallout of a massive data breach this year that resulted in the theft of personal information of hundreds of thousands of people.

Her letter to Houston says Nova Scotians are paying on average $400 a year more for their electricity since the PCs formed government in 2021.

“What we need to do is understand how that could be better. I think that’s government’s job, is to figure out how we can deliver these services in the best way possible.”

Govts move away from utility ownership

Chender’s party has advocated for a low-income power rate and a one-time rebate of 10 per cent for all customers as ways to help soften the blow of increased costs.

Adam Fremeth, the E.J. Kernaghan Chair in Energy Policy at Western University’s Ivey Business School, said governments across the country have moved away from utility ownership.

“It tends to go in the other direction, that there’s efforts to bring private capital into the investment of these types of utilities to allow them to have more flexibility and have a bit more discipline,” he said in an interview.

“Private directors and those with know-how in these areas tend to bring a lot more discipline to management and how these organizations are run.”

Putting aside the massive cost that would go into making Nova Scotia Power a public utility again, Fremeth said there are other aspects that would make it a complicated transaction.

He said studies have shown that governments tend not to be as efficient when it comes to running electric utilities and they tend only to step in if the private market is unable to resolve or fix problems.

Aside from ownership of the utility, Chender said a review could also consider ownership of the electricity grid and programs that could help ease the burden for low-income customers.

Her letter to Houston also raised concerns

[TITLE]How artificial intelligence can help achieve a clean energy future:
[TEXT]
There is growing attention on the links between artificial intelligence and increased energy demands. But while the power-hungry data centers being built to support AI could potentially stress electricity grids, increase customer prices and service interruptions, and generally slow the transition to clean energy, the use of artificial intelligence can also help the energy transition.

For example, use of AI is reducing energy consumption and associated emissions in buildings, transportation, and industrial processes. In addition, AI is helping to optimize the design and siting of new wind and solar installations and energy storage facilities.

On electric power grids, using AI algorithms to control operations is helping to increase efficiency and reduce costs, integrate the growing share of renewables, and even predict when key equipment needs servicing to prevent failure and possible blackouts. AI can help grid planners schedule investments in generation, energy storage, and other infrastructure that will be needed in the future. AI is also helping researchers discover or design novel materials for nuclear reactors, batteries, and electrolyzers.

Researchers at MIT and elsewhere are actively investigating aspects of those and other opportunities for AI to support the clean energy transition. At its 2025 research conference, MITEI announced the Data Center Power Forum, a targeted research effort for MITEI member companies interested in addressing the challenges of data center power demand.

Controlling real-time operations

Customers generally rely on receiving a continuous supply of electricity, and grid operators get help from AI to make that happen — while optimizing the storage and distribution of energy from renewable sources at the same time.

But with more installation of solar and wind farms — both of which provide power in smaller amounts, and intermittently — and the growing threat of weather events and cyberattacks, ensuring reliability is getting more complicated. “That’s exactly where AI can come into the picture,” explains Anuradha Annaswamy, a senior research scientist in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering and director of MIT’s Active-Adaptive Control Laboratory. “Essentially, you need to introduce a whole information infrastructure to supplement and complement the physical infrastructure.”

The electricity grid is a complex system that requires meticulous control on time scales ranging from decades all the way down to microseconds. The challenge can be traced to the basic laws of power physics: electricity supply must equal electricity demand at every instant, or generation can be interrupted. In past decades, grid operators generally assumed that generation was fixed — they could count on how much electricity each large power plant would produce — while demand varied over time in a fairly predictable way. As a result, operators could commission specific power plants to run as needed to meet demand the next day. If some outages occurred, specially designated units would start up as needed to make up the shortfall.

Today and in the future, that matching of supply and demand must still happen, even as the number of small, intermittent sources of generation grows and weather disturbances and other threats to the grid increase. AI algorithms provide a means of achieving the complex management of information needed to forecast within just a few hours which plants should run while also ensuring that the frequency, voltage, and other characteristics of the incoming power are as required for the grid to operate properly.

Moreover, AI can make possible new ways of increasing supply or decreasing demand at times when supplies on the grid run short. As Annaswamy points out, the battery in your electric vehicle (EV), as well as the one charged up by solar panels or wind turbines, can — when needed — serve as a source of extra power to be fed into the grid. And given real-time price signals, EV owners can choose to shift charging from a time when demand is peaking and prices are high to a time when demand and therefore prices are both lower. In addition, new smart thermostats can be set to allow the indoor temperature to drop or rise — a range defined by the customer — when demand on the grid is peaking. And data centers themselves can be a source of demand flexibility: selected AI calculations could be delayed as needed to smooth out peaks in demand. Thus, AI can provide many opportunities to fine-tune both supply and demand as needed.

In addition, AI makes possible “predictive maintenance.” Any downtime is costly for the company and threatens shortages for the customers served. AI algorithms can collect key performance data during normal operation and, when readings veer off from that normal, the system can alert operators that something might be going wrong, giving them a chance to intervene. That capability prevents equipment failures, reduces the need for routine inspections, increases worker productivity, and extends the lifetime of key equipment.

Annaswamy stresses that “figuring out how to architect this new power grid with these AI components will require many different experts to come together.” She notes that electrical engineers, computer scientists, and energy economists “will have to rub shoulders with enlightened regulators and policymakers to make sure that this is not just an academic exercise, but will actually get implemented. All the different stakeholders have to learn from each other. And you need guarantees that nothing is going to fail. You can’t have blackouts.”

Using AI to help plan investments in infrastructure for the future

Grid companies constantly need to plan for expanding generation, transmission, storage, and more, and getting all the necessary infrastructure built and operating may take many years, in some cases more than a decade. So, they need to predict what infrastructure they’ll need to ensure reliability in the future. “It’s complicated because you have to forecast over a decade ahead of time what to build and where to build it,” says Deepjyoti Deka, a research scientist in MITEI.

One challenge with anticipating what will be needed is predicting how the future system will operate. “That’s becoming increasingly difficult,” says Deka, because more renewables are coming online and displacing traditional generators. In the past, operators could rely on “spinning reserves,” that is, generating capacity that’s not currently in use but could come online in a matter of minutes to meet any shortfall on the system. The presence of so many intermittent generators — wind and solar — means there’s now less stability and inertia built into the grid. Adding to the complication is that those intermittent generators can be built by various vendors, and grid planners may not have access to the physics-based equations that govern the operation of each piece of equipment at sufficiently fine time scales. “So, you probably don’t know exactly how it’s going to run,” says Deka.

And then there’s the weather. Determining the reliability of a proposed future energy system requires knowing what it’ll be up against in terms of weather. The future grid has to be reliable not only in everyday weather, but also during low-probability but high-risk events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, all of which are becoming more and more frequent, notes Deka. AI can help by predicting such events and even tracking changes in weather patterns due to climate change.

Deka points out another, less-obvious benefit of the speed of AI analysis. Any infrastructure development plan must be reviewed and approved, often by several regulatory and other bodies. Traditionally, an applicant would develop a plan, analyze its impacts, and submit the plan to one set of reviewers. After making any requested changes and repeating the analysis, the applicant would resubmit a revised version to the reviewers to see if the new version was acceptable. AI tools can speed up the required analysis so the process moves along more quickly. Planners can even reduce the number of times a proposal is rejected by using large language models to search regulatory publications and summarize what’s important for a proposed infrastructure installation.

Harnessing AI to discover and exploit advanced materials needed for the energy transition

“Use of AI for materials development is booming right now,” says Ju Li, MIT’s Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. He notes two main directions.

First, AI makes possible faster physics-based simulations at the atomic scale. The result is a better atomic-level understanding of how composition, processing, structure, and chemical reactivity relate to the performance of materials. That understanding provides design rules to help guide the development and discovery of novel materials for energy generation, storage, and conversion needed for a sustainable future energy system.

And second, AI can help guide experiments in real time as they take place in the lab. Li explains: “AI assists us in choosing the best experiment to do based on our previous experiments and — based on literature searches — makes hypotheses and suggests new experiments.”

He describes what happens in his own lab. Human scientists interact with a large language model, which then makes suggestions

[TITLE]Why Chinese Energy Projects Are Facing a Backlash in the Balkans:
[TEXT]
When a 25-year-old Chinese construction worker died at a vast solar power plant site in Bosnia-Herzegovina this summer, few expected the incident to snowball into one of the most significant legal blows against Chinese-backed projects in the country.

The accident at the Aurora Solar site near the southern Bosnian city of Stolac triggered an inspection that uncovered 71 illegal Chinese workers in October. Authorities quickly deported them, ruled construction of the $116 million project illegal, and opened investigations into the possible misuse of public land in November.

But local residents say the construction site has not yet closed.

For a region where Chinese infrastructure investments are often shielded by political alliances and government patronage, the move marked a rare setback for China's economic footprint in the Balkans and a successful instance of public resistance to Chinese projects.

Experts say officials in the region have often embraced Chinese capital as fast money for energy and infrastructure development at the expense of protecting the environment and upholding labor laws.

"Chinese companies behave in the Balkans the way they are allowed to do so," Vuk Vuksanovic, a senior researcher at the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, told RFE/RL.

Broken Promises, Environmental Concerns

Following months of legal wrangling and pressure from the local community, a government inspector effectively blocked any new construction at the solar power plant site in Stolac.

Residents like Arman Ajanic had raised concern that facilities for the project were built closer to populated areas than originally presented to the public and that construction could bring environmental and safety risks such as landslides.

"The location is a proven landslide-prone area and has a slope toward residential houses," Ajanic told RFE/RL. "Our neighbor Elmira Sefo was killed by a landslide caused by an earthquake. Having learned from these negative experiences, we simply did not want to sit idly by."

He added that locals began their legal campaign to stop the project in January, spending hours each day researching the relevant laws.

"This should not be the job of ordinary citizens but of institutions," Ajanic said.

The mayor's office, who led the effort to build the plant, did not respond to RFE/RL's request for comment.

Kemal Svrakic, the lawyer for China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO), the Chinese company building the solar project, told RFE/RL's Balkan Service last month that all the workers arrived legally and he had filed all the necessary paperwork for each of them.

'Free Rein To The Chinese’

The solar plant near Stolac is the latest high-profile project being built or managed by Chinese state-owned firms across the Balkans that has recently become embroiled in controversy and stalled due to local pushback.

There is the hydropower plant in the village of Ulog in southern Bosnia, where locals have for years pointed to environmental damage and mass fish die-offs. An investigation has now been opened into the cause of the fish deaths.

There is also the Bistrica hydropower plant in Bosnia whose building permit was revoked and which faced a local backlash.

The projects have faced public blowback for similar reasons, including circumventing local laws around labor, the environment, and land ownership.

Researchers like Vuksanovic said these issues derive from Balkan politicians' attempts to get an influx of Chinese investment into the country and benefit from a web of newfound capital.

[TITLE]Hyperscalers Crash the Grid as Big Tech Becomes a Power Trader:
[TEXT]
America’s hyperscalers are looking to ensure the electricity for their huge data centers by entering the supply side of the market—power trading.

Meta, Microsoft, and Apple, to name a few, have either requested or obtained authorizations from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale power.

Meta Platforms, for example, seeks to incentivize long-term commitments in power-generating capacity by expanding into power trading and having the flexibility to contract electricity from future power plants, according to Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy.

Currently, power plant developers are careful about committing investments in the long term, which is not enough to meet the demand from AI and data centers.

Power capacity developers “want to know that the consumers of power are willing to put skin in the game,” Meta’s Parekh told Bloomberg in an interview last week.

“Without Meta taking a more active voice in the need to expand the amount of power that’s on the system, it’s not happening as quickly as we would like,” the executive added.

U.S. power utilities are investing a record amount of money into transmission and grid connection. But current forecasts of AI-driven power demand vary so much that there is a massive margin of error, analysts and utility officials told Reuters Events in June.

The U.S. market faces “a moment of peak uncertainty,” according to Rebecca Carroll, senior director of market analytics at energy advisor Trio.

Electric utilities face a high degree of uncertainty over future revenues as the boom of AI data centers generates widely varying forecasts of peak demand in many areas across the country.

If utilities overestimate their future demand, they risk overbuilding new capacity that will not be met by consumption. A possible overbuild would come at the expense of the American ratepayers, who have already seen electricity prices rising at a faster pace than U.S. inflation over the past three years.

The era of stagnated power demand in the United States ended about two years ago when hyperscalers started the race to develop AI-driven solutions and build huge data centers across the U.S.

America’s five largest hyperscalers are set to hike spending on data centers by 50% to over $300 billion in 2025, according to estimates by Wood Mackenzie.

U.S utilities have already committed to add 116 gigawatts (GW) of large load to their networks, equivalent to around 15% of U.S. peak electricity demand in 2024, the energy consultancy reckons.

The venture into power trading from hyperscalers could give utilities more certainty that their future new capacity will find customers.

“We’re seeing a breakdown between the demand and supply sides of the market, with the biggest actors playing on both sides,” WoodMac’s Ben Hertz-Shargel told Bloomberg.

“To better orchestrate growth, you need some of the largest buyers of electricity to actively support the buildout of the supply side.”

If Meta and other tech giants commit to long-term purchase agreements, power capacity developers will be more willing to invest in long-lead plant construction.

Meta alone is investing $600 billion in the U.S. by 2028 to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion, the company said earlier this month.

The company says it’s making additional investments in energy supply and these have so far helped to add more than 15 GW of new energy projects to the grid across 27 states, representing more than $16 billion in capital investments.

It’s not only clean energy that will power the huge data centers of the hyperscalers—natural gas will play an important role, too.

For example, Meta’s new data center in Richland Parish in Louisiana, worth over $10 billion, will source electricity from three new gas-fired power plants after the Louisiana Public Service Commission this summer approved an agreement that paves the way for Entergy Louisiana to build these plants.

“Importantly, Meta is paying its share of the costs for the infrastructure needed to support its operations, ensuring that other customers are protected from those expenses,” Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO, said in August.

[TITLE]NDP calls for ownership and regulatory review of Nova Scotia Power:
[TEXT]

NDP Leader Claudia Chender is calling on the premier — who recently appointed himself energy minister — to launch an ownership and regulatory review of Nova Scotia Power.

Claudia Chender made the request in a letter to Premier Tim Houston on Monday.

“We have a utility that is not performing in any of the ways we measure performance,” she said in an interview.

“And now we have a premier who has appointed himself the energy minister and has promptly taken himself on the road. What we need is an energy minister who’s going to prioritize power affordability for Nova Scotians.”

Looking at options

Houston has recently made trips to Alberta, the United States and Europe, all to promote energy generation opportunities in the province, including onshore and offshore wind and natural gas, as a means of spurring economic development.

But Chender said those promotional efforts are happening at the same time as Nova Scotia Power customers are seeing their bills increase and the utility continues to deal with the fallout of a massive data breach this year that resulted in the theft of personal information of hundreds of thousands of people.

Her letter to Houston says Nova Scotians are paying on average $400 a year more for their electricity since the PCs formed government in 2021.

“What we need to do is understand how that could be better. I think that’s government’s job, is to figure out how we can deliver these services in the best way possible.”

Govts move away from utility ownership

Chender’s party has advocated for a low-income power rate and a one-time rebate of 10 per cent for all customers as ways to help soften the blow of increased costs.

Adam Fremeth, the E.J. Kernaghan Chair in Energy Policy at Western University’s Ivey Business School, said governments across the country have moved away from utility ownership.

“It tends to go in the other direction, that there’s efforts to bring private capital into the investment of these types of utilities to allow them to have more flexibility and have a bit more discipline,” he said in an interview.

“Private directors and those with know-how in these areas tend to bring a lot more discipline to management and how these organizations are run.”

Putting aside the massive cost that would go into making Nova Scotia Power a public utility again, Fremeth said there are other aspects that would make it a complicated transaction.

He said studies have shown that governments tend not to be as efficient when it comes to running electric utilities and they tend only to step in if the private market is unable to resolve or fix problems.

Aside from ownership of the utility, Chender said a review could also consider ownership of the electricity grid and programs that could help ease the burden for low-income customers.

Her letter to Houston also raised concerns

[TITLE]Eos Energy Successfully Closes $600 Million Convertible Senior Notes Offering and Registered Direct Offering of Common Stock, Enhancing Financial Liquidity and Fueling U.S. Manufacturing Expansion:
[TEXT]
EDISON, N.J., Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) (“Eos” or the “Company”), America’s leading innovator in the design, sourcing, and manufacturing of zinc-based long duration energy storage (LDES) systems, manufactured in the United States, announced the closing of its previously announced offering of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2031, including the full exercise of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase additional notes (the “Convertible Notes Offering”), for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $580.5 million. Following the exercise of the option, $600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2031 were issued and outstanding.

Concurrently, Eos announced the closing of its previously announced registered direct offering of 35,855,647 shares of common stock at a price of $12.78 per share to a limited number of purchasers (the “Common Stock Offering” and, together with the Convertible Notes Offering, the “Offerings”), for aggregate proceeds of approximately $458.2 million.

The financing represents a significant strengthening of Eos’ balance sheet, providing the financial flexibility needed to scale manufacturing, accelerate commercial pipeline and backlog conversion, and capture rapidly expanding demand for American-made long duration energy storage. The offerings were oversubscribed, demonstrating strong investor confidence in Eos’ market potential and progress against its strategic plan.

“This was an opportunistic move to strengthen Eos for the scale in front of us,” said Nathan Kroeker, Eos Chief Commercial Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. “Retiring a significant portion of the 2030 notes and securing a lower cost of capital while bringing in meaningful new cash gives us the flexibility to support manufacturing expansion and the growing demand for long-duration energy storage.”

The refinancing meaningfully enhances the Company’s capital structure by lowering its cost of capital, reducing interest expense, and adding substantial liquidity to support the next phase of operational growth and U.S.-based production. This strengthened position comes as Eos’ commercial pipeline has reached $22.6 billion as of September 30, 2025, representing approximately 91 GWh of identified long duration energy storage demand across data centers, utilities, and industrial customers, supporting the Company’s plans to scale manufacturing to meet evolving market needs.

“This financing positions Eos to compete from a position of strength,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “With a stronger balance sheet and a more efficient capital structure, we can scale with speed and certainty at a time when the world is entering an energy supercycle. Long-duration storage is becoming essential infrastructure, and this transaction gives Eos the ability to invest in U.S. manufacturing, meet accelerating demand, and lead the market as this cycle unfolds.”

Use of Proceeds

Proceeds from the Offerings were used to:

Repurchase $200 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 6.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030.

Add approximately $474 million of cash to the balance sheet as adjusted for the Offerings, net of initial purchaser discounts and commissions, prior to the deduction of expenses.

Department of Energy Warrants

Concurrently, the Company announced the issuance to the U.S. Department of Energy of a warrant to purchase up to 570,000 shares of common stock. As part of the Trump Administration’s review of the Office of Energy Dominance Financing loan portfolio, both parties collaborated to strengthen the transaction structure: Eos secured from the DOE the flexibility to pursue advantageous private market capital as its business scales rapidly, while the DOE gained the mechanism to share in potential equity upside that eventually can be converted into additional return for the U.S. government.

Public Warrants

In addition to the financing, and in the fourth quarter, holders of Eos public warrants exercised approximately 7 million warrants prior to the expiration, adding an additional $80.2 million of cash to the balance sheet. The combined effect of the warrants exercised and financing further enhances the Company’s liquidity and advances its path toward sustained manufacturing scale and commercial execution.
