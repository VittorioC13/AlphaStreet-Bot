[TITLE]Goldman Sachs leads investment in software delivery startup Harness at $5.5 billion valuation:
[TEXT]
Jyoti Bansal, co-founder and CEO of Harness, speaks at the company's Unscripted conference in London on Sept. 25, 2025.

Almost nine years ago, Jyoti Bansal sold AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion just as the software startup was set to go public.

Bansal's latest venture, Harness, is now worth substantially more than that, after raking in $200 million in fresh capital at a $5.5 billion valuation in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs .

Harness' technology helps companies manage and monitor code that's produced with the help of artificial intelligence, making sure it doesn't break, create security vulnerabilities or trigger cost overruns. It's a compliment to the so-called vibe coding trend that's taken off with the boom in generative AI.

In recent months, venture capitalists have poured money into startups such as Cursor, Lovable and most recently Kilo Code that sell subscriptions for tools for directing AI models to write and update software. Harness' software draws on models from Anthropic and OpenAI.

Earlier this year, Bansal bolstered Harness' cybersecurity chops by merging the startup with Traceable, another company he co-founded. The combined company, based in San Francisco, has a total of about 1,300 employees.

Harness is on track to exceed its goal of more than $250 million in annualized revenue, growing more than 50% year over year, Bansal said. That makes it larger than AppDynamics at the time it was acquired by Cisco.

Bansal is aiming for a different outcome this time.

"I'm a believer that at the right market timing, we want to operate as a public company, so we can build for the long term," Bansal said.

In addition to the funding round, Harness is also planning a $40 million tender offer to provide some liquidity to long-standing employees.

[TITLE]Exclusive-AI software startup Harness valued at $5.5 billion in latest financing round:
[TEXT]
Dec 11 : Harness, an AI software development startup, has raised $200 million in a Goldman Sachs-led fundraising round that values it at $5.5 billion, the company said on Thursday.

The financing marks a 49 per cent jump in the firm's valuation nearly four years after a Series-D round valued it at $3.7 billion.

Private market investors continue to plough into artificial intelligence as the nascent technology promises to universally automate structured and repetitive corporate and tech tasks.

Harness is also planning a $40 million tender offer with participation from existing investors IVP, Menlo Ventures and Unusual Ventures.

"We were not looking to actively raise capital right now," Harness Cofounder and CEO Jyoti Bansal told Reuters in an interview.

"But we had a lot of investor interest. So a lot of people were coming and reaching out to us, and that's what kind of created this financing," he said.

As boardrooms look to use AI to aid, and sometimes to replace, expensive software engineers, the velocity and volume of code being written has dramatically accelerated.

Harness has been benefiting from this shift, as it offers workflow AI tools that develop written code into practical use cases.

Its customers include National Australia Bank, Morningstar and United Airlines, whose deployment times accelerated by 75 per cent after using its tools, Harness said.

Major U.S. lenders JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have been vocal about AI-fueled productivity gains, are not only customers but also investors in Harness.

The blurring lines between client and owner labels across AI startups have led to comparisons with dotcom-era financing structures.

"We have very strong collaborative partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and AWS," Bansal said.

[TITLE]Private capital targets mission-critical software power and platforms in new space economy:
[TEXT]
Private capital targets mission-critical software power and platforms in new space economy

by Clarence Oxford

Los Angeles CA (SPX) Dec 09, 2025

Axle Point Capital and Balerion Space Ventures are directing new private capital into companies that build core infrastructure for the expanding U.S. space and defense economy, from mission software and guidance systems to deployable microreactors and high-temperature reactors. Axle Point's first transaction is a strategic equity investment in Odyssey Space Research LLC, a flight software and engineering firm that supports NASA and defense programs, while Balerion has taken stakes in Antares Industries, Samara Aerospace, and Valar Atomics, three companies focused on spacecraft platforms and nuclear energy systems for defense and industrial users.

Odyssey Space Research develops and sustains flight software and guidance, navigation and control (GN and C) systems for missions that range from small satellites to large human-rated spacecraft. Its work covers flight software development, simulation, mission analysis, avionics integration and test, spaceflight simulation and analysis, and human spaceflight operations, using software frameworks and tools that support configurable mission solutions. Odyssey's teams contribute to missions that include proximity operations such as rendezvous and docking, and support both uncrewed and crewed spacecraft operating in the vicinity of the International Space Station and in other complex orbital regimes.

A key growth driver for Odyssey is NASA's RPOC V contract, a five year award that extends the company's role in integrated GN and C assessments and trajectory and flight software integration. Under RPOC V, Odyssey supports commercial cargo and crew vehicles that approach and depart the ISS, as well as GN and C and trajectory work for Orion program missions. The contract continues a workload where Odyssey's analysis and software integration tasks must meet NASA human spaceflight certification and safety requirements, reinforcing its position as a supplier of mission-critical software and engineering to U.S. government customers.

Axle Point Capital, based in Newport Beach, completed the Odyssey transaction in partnership with the ONE Bow River National Defense Fund, which provided equity capital for the acquisition. The deal establishes Odyssey as a platform investment for Axle Point as it pursues additional aerospace, defense, and government services opportunities with institutional co investors. The firm's strategy centers on hard-to-access sectors such as space and defense, where programs often require long-term technical support, regulatory approval, and specialized engineering capabilities.

"Axle Point Capital was founded to identify and unlock value in hard-to-access sectors like space and defense," said Gerik Degner, CFA, Managing Partner. "We are thrilled to partner with ONE Bow River and the exceptional team at Odyssey and look forward to leveraging our sector expertise to help accelerate its growth and expand its impact on vital national space programs."

"Odyssey represents the very best of innovation in spaceflight software and guidance, navigation, and control systems for manned and unmanned spaceflight and robotics. The Odyssey team is stellar from top to bottom," added Kevin O'Neil, Chief Investment Officer of ONE Bow River. Steven Joanis, Senior Managing Director, added, "It is a privilege to partner with Axle Point, whose market understanding, strategic vision, and raw tenacity were pivotal in architecting this transaction and bode well for the valuation acceleration to come. This investment underscores our shared commitment to advancing technologies that are vital to our nation's capabilities in space."

Balerion Space Ventures is pursuing a parallel thesis across frontier technology, announcing investments in Antares Industries, Samara Aerospace, and Valar Atomics as part of a portfolio designed around systems that build, power, and operate critical space and industrial infrastructure. Antares is developing modular, transportable microreactors intended for rapid deployment in contested or remote environments to provide autonomous, resilient power for defense operations and critical infrastructure. These systems target growing demand for local, secure energy as defense spending increases and policymakers place more emphasis on energy security and grid resilience.

Samara Aerospace is building high precision spacecraft platforms that use advanced attitude control technologies to deliver agile on-orbit performance. Its satellite buses are aimed at missions that require fine pointing and maneuverability, including next-generation Earth observation and other constellations that depend on accurate pointing and rapid retasking. As government and commercial operators expand orbital infrastructure, platforms like those developed by Samara are positioned as enabling assets for imaging, data relay, and other services that rely on stable, responsive spacecraft.

Valar Atomics is focused on nuclear systems for heavy industrial power and hydrocarbon fuel production, and reports that it is the first U.S. nuclear startup to reach criticality at its Utah testing site. The company is advancing high-temperature reactors designed to provide industrial heat and support clean fuel production, and has achieved cold criticality under Project NOVA and been selected for U.S. Department of Energy efforts such as the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program and Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Program. Valar has begun construction of Ward 250, its first nuclear test reactor in Utah, after completing Ward Zero, a non nuclear prototype facility, and is working with partners including the Philippines Nuclear Research Institute as it develops TRISO-fueled, helium-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor technology for industrial users and AI infrastructure that require high reliability power.

"Launch costs are collapsing. Defense budgets are rising. Dual-use technologies are being adopted at a record pace," said Phil Scully, Co Founder and General Partner at Balerion Space Ventures. "The companies we're backing are building the foundational systems that will power the next trillion-dollar economy. Agile spacecraft, advanced nuclear systems, and deployable microreactors - these are the technologies that will determine who leads in space, defense, and domestic manufacturing over the next decade as we enter a new industrial era driven by mass access to space. Balerion is excited to back the companies developing the infrastructure that will power the space economy."

"These companies are building the enabling infrastructure that the broader space and defense ecosystem will rely upon for decades," said Daniel Wallman, Partner at Balerion. "As capital pours into the sector, our focus remains disciplined on backing mission-critical platforms with real technical depth and scalable economics. Antares, Samara, and Valar exemplify the kind of durable enterprise value being created at the frontier of this asset class."

Balerion states that the funding will support product development, facility build out, and progress toward commercial milestones at each of the three portfolio companies as they expand work with defense, civil, and commercial customers. The firm plans to discuss the investments and its view of the market at its annual general meeting in Bentonville, Arkansas.

[TITLE]The Nvidia Chip Deal Is a National Security Disaster Waiting to Happen:
[TEXT]
For Huang, the incentives are clear: China represents a $50 billion , nearly untapped market for Nvidia that is likely key to realizing investors’ lofty expectations for the company’s growth. But selling advanced semiconductors to the United States’ greatest adversary is national security malpractice akin to selling the Soviets nuclear technology after World War II. What’s more, the deal appears to be illegal under the U.S. Constitution’s Export Clause , which explicitly prohibits taxes or duties on exports to foreign countries from any state. This is why the administration is still struggling to develop a legal mechanism to facilitate the H20 deal Trump authorized earlier this year. Nvidia, the only company with the standing to sue, seems happy to accept giving the U.S. government a large cut of the anticipated Chinese profits.

In September, the leader of the world’s most valuable company lambasted China hawks for “ destroying ” the American dream. To be tough on China was a “badge of shame,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argued. “It’s not patriotic, not even a little bit.” His comments came after withering criticism over a proposed deal with the Trump administration to allow new semiconductor exports to China in exchange for a 15 percent kickback to the U.S. government. Then, on Monday, President Donald Trump announced that he would allow Nvidia to export cutting-edge chips to China—with capabilities at least a generation ahead of China’s most advanced technologies—in exchange for an even higher kickback of 25 percent.

This is why the administration is still struggling to develop a legal mechanism to facilitate the H20 deal Trump authorized earlier this year. Nvidia, the only company with the standing to sue, seems happy to accept giving the U.S. government a large cut of the anticipated Chinese profits.

Huang is free to pursue what he believes is best for his business. But both Huang and Trump display shocking naivete in thinking China will remain dependent on the United States for a technology that is rapidly determining the 21st-century balance of power. By selling China some of the most advanced U.S. hardware, Trump is voluntarily surrendering a widening strategic lead in artificial intelligence and effectively handing Washington’s primary adversary computational power that could facilitate a range of dire national security consequences.

Semiconductors provide the computational power driving revolutionary advances in AI, biotechnology, and quantum computing that are already reshaping our daily lives and national security. China views its dependence on advanced semiconductors as a “stranglehold” and set a goal to be 70 percent self-sufficient in chip production by the end of this year. Yet, despite investing some $48 billion into its National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund and providing generous state subsidies as part of its Made in China 2025 program, China is on track to hit just 30 percent self-sufficiency this year, mostly in “mature node” chips that are far less advanced than Nvidia’s cutting-edge H200 and Blackwell chips. Access to advanced U.S. chips is therefore critical for China to keep up in the AI race until the country can develop its own indigenous capabilities.

Leading technology policy experts estimate that China is at least 18 months away from developing its own equivalent to the Nvidia H200 chips that Trump now wants to sell. This gap is only growing, which is why China has spent millions of dollars trying to steal and smuggle these precious chips into China illegally. Indeed, the U.S. Justice Department made public this fact the very same day that Trump’s new proposal would effectively let Chinese agents carry the chips right out the front door of Nvidia’s California headquarters.

Trump’s technology policy team believes the path to “global AI dominance” is to reduce regulatory barriers such as export controls and send U.S. firms on an all-out sprint for global market share. This will, in theory, unlock economies of scale that will drive a few winners to stratospheric heights and leave the rest of the world dependent on the U.S. “AI technology stack” of hardware, software, infrastructure, and talent. This approach is straight out of the software-as-a-service venture capital playbook of growth at all costs and has proved very successful for investor-turned-AI czar David Sacks.

But managing the global balance of power is not the same as scaling a start-up, and the problem with publicly broadcasting this strategy to achieve global market dominance is that adversaries such as China will act accordingly to safeguard their national interests. When Huang and Trump first attempted the maneuver with Nvidia’s H20 chips, a less advanced unit that roughly matches China’s own leading Huawei chips, the Chinese government responded by instructing firms not to buy Nvidia products at all and instead direct their business to preferred domestic champions. This left Nvidia with no appreciable sales growth and made it clear that China refuses to accept foreign dependence where domestic alternatives exist.

China may welcome the new H200s initially—but if past is precedent, Huawei or another national champion will rapidly release a new product eerily similar to the H200, leading to a precipitous drop in Nvidia’s sales as China captures that $50 billion domestic market for itself. We have seen this play many times. Telecommunications company Cisco, for example, dominated China’s early internet infrastructure until Huawei successfully cloned its source code, allowing Beijing to systematically purge the U.S. giant in favor of its own sovereign enterprise. Yet apparently the temptation of the world’s second-largest economy—and perhaps the hubris that comes with building the world’s most valuable company—has led Huang to think perhaps this time will be different.

The national security consequences of advancing Chinese AI and biotechnology by nearly two years will be profound. Already, researchers suspect that by the end of Trump’s second term, AI could be capable of waging mass-scale cyberwarfare campaigns and helping lone-wolf terrorists to develop bioweapons. This transfer of compute power could ultimately supercharge China’s military research and development, allowing Chinese AI to automate scientific breakthroughs in fields such as stealth and hypersonics that could permanently erase America’s qualitative edge. No amount of profit is worth handing adversaries the ability to unleash such tools faster than the United States can build defenses against them.

Thankfully, Congress is aware of the severe constitutional and national security threats this policy poses; within 24 hours of Trump meeting Huang last week, it introduced the bipartisan SAFE Chips Act to freeze any further loosening of U.S. chip export controls. Congress must pass this bill as quickly as possible, ideally with veto-proof majorities that can force Trump to either sign the bill or abandon the deal. Meanwhile, chip companies excluded from the deal or even hawkish national security or taxpayer advocacy groups could file lawsuits to attempt to stop these sales, though it is unclear whether they will ultimately have standing for such challenges. Still, if even a single H200 reaches China before Trump and Haung are forced to abandon this misguided proposal, much of the knowledge transfer damage will already be done.

Nvidia is an incredibly successful U.S. business that employs tens of thousands of people, has unlocked meaningful scientific progress, and represents an outsized portion of Americans’ 401(k) growth this past year. But its decision to sell chips to China comes at the expense of the U.S. Constitution and national security.

[TITLE]NCC moves to resolve Abuja telecom disruption:
[TEXT]
Telecommunications services in parts of Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, were disrupted last week after a diesel supply shortage cut power to several mobile base stations, the country’s telecoms regulator said in an email.

The Nigerian Communications Commission stated the disruption stemmed from difficulties in delivering diesel to critical telecom infrastructure, degrading service quality for mobile subscribers in the affected areas.

The regulator said the crisis was triggered by actions of the National Oil and Gas Suppliers Association, which disrupted diesel supply to sites operated by IHS Nigeria Ltd., a tower company that provides power to base stations used by mobile operators including MTN Group Ltd. and Airtel Africa Plc. The emailed statement was signed by NCC Head of Public Affairs, Nnenna Ukoha.

“The NCC is actively engaging with relevant stakeholders to address the diesel supply issues and explore sustainable solutions,” the commission said.

“The Commission urges all parties to work together collaboratively to resolve these challenges swiftly by removing the diesel supply bottlenecks affecting critical telecommunications infrastructure, arising from NOGASA’s actions.”

The NCC urged all stakeholders to work together to resolve the crisis swiftly, assuring subscribers that it remains committed to fostering a conducive environment for the growth and sustainability of telecommunications services nationwide.

The regulator said it would continue to update the public on progress towards the full restoration of services in Abuja, while thanking subscribers for their understanding and patience during the period of disruption.

While diesel remains one of the major bottlenecks for telecoms companies, the sector has so far averted potential crises, particularly this year, that could have led to widespread service disruption.

In July, this publication reported that Nigeria’s telecoms industry grapples with mounting operational costs, spending over $350m annually on diesel-powered generators.

According to the State of Africa’s Infrastructure Report 2025 by the Africa Finance Corporation, telecoms operators in Nigeria consume more than 40 million litres of diesel every month.

This growing reliance on diesel generators adds significant financial pressure on telecoms operators, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

The report stated, “A growing number of tower sites going off-grid or relying on diesel generators is a cause for concern for several reasons. First, it increases CAPEX and OPEX costs for operators, making investments in rural and remote areas even more prohibitive.

“In fact, GSMA Intelligence estimates that the energy cost of a mobile base station in rural areas could be 37 per cent higher than in urban areas. In Nigeria, for instance, telecoms operators consume over 40 million litres of diesel per month, representing a yearly spending of over $350m.

“Mobile broadband costs are further exacerbated by the higher amount of energy required to power data traffic in Africa (0.24 kWh/GB compared to a global average of 0.17 kWh/GB), where lower traffic volumes and the use of older technologies like 3G are energy-inefficient.

“Second, tower sites that rely on generators and batteries report frequent theft of battery equipment and diesel.”

New Delhi: Commercial rollout of satellite internet services may take longer than expected, due to a standoff between the telecom regulator and the department of telecommunications (DoT) over spectrum pricing , industry executives said. The process could potentially take another 3-6 months amid upcoming personnel changes at the DoT and industry interference, they said."The current spectrum pricing proposals, including the disagreements between Trai Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ) and DoT regarding LEO (low earth orbit satellite) spectrum pricing must first be reviewed by a standing committee.The proposal then moves to the digital communications commission (DCC) for approval," Shivaji Chatterjee, CEO and managing director of Hughes Communications India, told ET.After the approval, the matter will go to the union cabinet or the telecom minister, depending on the scope of the issue, he said.Once it receives ministerial approval, the wireless planning and coordination wing (WPC) is tasked with creating specific rules, which will then be put out for public consultation for 30 days."This stage is critical as terrestrial telecom operators may attempt to impede the process during the feedback window," Chatterjee said. Elon Musk's Starlink had on Monday briefly displayed prices of its broadband service in India at ₹8,500 per month, with a ₹32,000 fee for the home equipment, on its website, but later retracted it, citing technical glitches. This prompted industry-wide expectation of an impending launch.So far, Starlink, Eutelsat OneWeb, and Jio Satellite have completed most of the licensing and space-regulatory steps, including obtaining the Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) licence, and approvals from space-regulatory body In-SPACe. Commercial launch, however, hinges on the spectrum allocation based on pricing rules, and compliance with security and capacity rules. Trai had initially proposed a flat rate of 4% of adjusted gross revenues to be charged for spectrum allocation to ensure a standardised approach, offering to impose an urban-usage disincentive to spur more rural coverage. The DoT, however, proposed to raise charges to 5% of AGR with a 1% discount if they meet specific rural rollout targets.The government's proposal to raise the spectrum charges from the initially recommended rates could be a gesture to pacify the telcos who have been demanding a level-playing field, an industry executive said. The executive, however, noted that the difference in revenues from changing the pricing to 5% from 4% would be financially insignificant for the government. "It was done primarily as a symbolic gesture to show the DoT was addressing telco concerns," the person added.Experts said telcos are not necessarily afraid of the immediate competition in broadband internet with the entry of satellite internet services. "The long-term fear is direct-to-mobile (D2M) technology," one of the executives cited above said. Telcos view low-earth orbit satellites as "potential mobile towers in the sky" that can serve handsets directly, bypassing terrestrial networks.

[TITLE]Connect Everyone Coalition enlists groups to modernize space development policy:
[TEXT]
Twenty organizations, working under the aegis of The Connect Everyone Coalition, have called on nine federal agencies to modernize and reduce bureaucracy in policy related to the commercial space industry.

While parts of the space development policy letter called for general changes and updates, the focus is on low-earth orbit (LEO) technology. The letter cited four current areas of redundancy and inefficiency: fragmented multi-agency approvals, redundant environmental reviews, redundant range safety determinations, and lack of transparency regarding scheduling and delays.

“New space-based innovations like low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites have the potential to finally give every American access to reliable, affordable, high-speed broadband and the 21st-century opportunities that it unlocks,” CEC executive director Richard Cullen said in a

[TITLE]SEC chair moves to boost IPO momentum: ‘Make it cool to be a public company’:
[TEXT]
Good morning. At the AICPA conference earlier this week in Washington, D.C., U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins told an audience of accountants, auditors, and financial preparers that it’s time to make going public more accessible.

Atkins noted that over the past 30 years, there has been a significant net decline in the total number of publicly traded companies, due in part to mergers and bankruptcies outpacing IPOs. His goal, he said, is to “make it cool to be a public company” again—something he believes has “taken a hit over time.”

Atkins outlined three obstacles he believes are holding issuers back. The first is what he described as expensive, overly long disclosures that impose an unnecessary burden on issuers. The second is the threat of securities litigation. Atkins reiterated his support for allowing companies—where state law permits—to adopt bylaws mandating arbitration and applying “loser pays” fee-shifting provisions, and said the SEC staff will no longer block an IPO solely because such measures are included. “If the state allows it, then that will be fine with us,” he said.

His third concern centers on what he characterized as “politicized shareholder activists” who can influence corporate governance battles. Atkins expects any related policy proposals to take most of next year to move through the regulatory process.

IPO momentum returns in 2025

After a significant downturn, the IPO market has been gaining momentum. In my conversation with Lynn Martin, president of the New York Stock Exchange, during the recent Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit, she said: “The IPO market is really, really strong. We’ve had a great year so far across all sectors.”

According to S&P Global research, the first half of 2025 was the strongest start for U.S. IPO issuance since 2021, with 102 IPOs versus 78 in the same period of 2024. Deal activity accelerated through the period, with 59 IPOs raising
